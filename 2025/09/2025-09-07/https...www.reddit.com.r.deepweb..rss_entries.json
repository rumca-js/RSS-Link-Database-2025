There&#39;s no physical evidence out there and if there is, it&#39;s being covered up by different parties. Only word of mouth even makes it considered an &quot;urban legend.&quot; The locals in the town ignore it as if it will go away/not let it impact their life. I live in a tourist town in the Florida Panhandle and the police, local colleges, public schools. They all play a part in making this person&#39;s life a living hell. Stolen research, making this person go crazy. Literally hunting them to the ends of the earth. They call him, &quot;The Lost Boy.&quot; There&#39;s so much to the story that I&#39;ve heard and the boy is trying to leave town before it becomes another cover up. It&#39;s a fight for the soul of this city. It feeds on the tourists and people who know too much are considered threats.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",
