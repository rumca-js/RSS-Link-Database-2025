To do that, I&#8217;ll be writing a dispatch covering every movie I&#8217;ve seen that day, which will run daily throughout most of the festival. That includes bigger movies you probably already know about, like Netflix&#8217;s <em>Wake Up Dead Man</em> and <em>Frankenstein</em>, along with hopefully some great new films you maybe weren&#8217;t aware of, like the creepy adaptation of the horror game <em>The Exit 8</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I won&#8217;t",

The luxury EVs, with their big battery packs and fine leather interiors, are all well and good, but if you really want to move the needle on EV adoption, we need more entry-level options. And so far, we\u2019re lacking. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Volkswagen hears this, and is responding with a new lineup of small and mid-sized electric vehicles aimed squarely at the low end of the market.

And now that I've seen it, I have to say that Johnson pulled it off: the new movie has a darker and more spiritual feel than its predecessors, and yet it's still distinctly <em>Knives Out</em>, which is to say twisting and hilarious. I gasped a few times, as did the rest of audience, at the many reveals. I'll have a ",
