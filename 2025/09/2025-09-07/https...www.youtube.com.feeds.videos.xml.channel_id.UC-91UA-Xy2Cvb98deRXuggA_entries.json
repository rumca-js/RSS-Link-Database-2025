After 99,000 employees filled out a survey hoping for improvements, they got a 2,000-word sermon about why they\u2019re wrong and why \u201cmarket-based culture\u201d means bye-bye perks, hello cubicles.\n\nIn this video, I break down how CEOs like John Stankey talk in endless loops of jargon \u2014 penetration, churn, synergy, autonomy, machine vision \u2014 without saying anything real. If you\u2019ve ever sat through a company all-hands and wondered, \u201cwhat the hell did that even mean?\u201d \u2014 this one\u2019s for you.",
