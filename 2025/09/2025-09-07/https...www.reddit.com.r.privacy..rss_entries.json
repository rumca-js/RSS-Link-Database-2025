Just wondering what the best option is out of what there is available. Just needs to make calls and texts at the least. I\u2019ve also heard something like 2g and 3g are being phased out permanently? So I guess another requirement would be that it wont be affect by that lmao.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard old blackberries were really good with encryption so idk if I can even get my hands on one of those that still work.
