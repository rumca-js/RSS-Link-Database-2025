As their lives intertwine, Mistry explores themes of human dignity, resilience and friendship against the backdrop of political oppression, caste discrimination and economic hardship.</p> <p>CONTEXT: In 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of Emergency in India, suspending civil liberties, censoring the press and enforcing forced sterilizations, amid rising political unrest. A Fine Balance reflects this dark chapter of Indian history, while also capturing the larger, systemic inequalities deeply embedded in society, particularly the caste system, bureaucratic corruption and poverty that strangled millions.</p> <p>The plot unfolds grad",

One thing that I have been wondering about is the idea of lines. There is, of course, the Ogee, or the line of beauty itself. But then there is also the idea of beauty as a form of class divide and of beautiful things outliving humans and families. And the lines of coke that seem to make the world a more beautiful place, And in the end, the idea that the protagonist himself is the one capable to see beauty in the world in spite of the circumstances, while many of the people who own those beautiful objects just take them for granted. </p> <p>I am afraid i haven&#39;t read enough of Henry James so there are probably important things that I am not even taking into consideration.</p> <p>Any ideas on the subject?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Flimsy-Calendar-7566\"> /u/Fl",

Thanks for the positive response to my other thread (&quot;my first year as a bibliophile&quot;).</p> <p>The discussion in that thread got me thinking about how a person can deepen their reading experiences, so I&#39;m going to talk about what I&#39;ve done and hoping others can add (hopefully a lot) to that.</p> <p>Of course, it&#39;s crazy to go over every book you read with a fine toothed comb. Sometimes, as Freud says, a book is just a book. But what if you <em>do</em> want to go deeper, if you really connect with a book or a writer?</p> <p>Let&#39;s talk about it!</p> <ol> <li>Write. Writing fiction had a transformative effect on how I read. You begin to understand more intimately how much skill and how much research is needed to put a good story on paper. It helped me to get a better feel for structure, symbols, and how writer intent comes across on the page.</li> </ol> <p>In my own case, I began to seek out resources for aspi",
