It\u2019s something I really enjoy building, but I still don\u2019t have any active users. I\u2019m not doing this for money \u2014 the drive for me is more about that internal sense of satisfaction from creating something.</p> <p>That said, it can get tough to stay motivated when no one is actually using it. I don\u2019t want to sell it or pivot into something I\u2019m not excited about, but I\u2019d love to hear how others deal with this phase.</p> <p>How do you keep going when the feedback loop is basically just you and your code editor?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/almaz_murzabekov\"> /u/almaz_murzabekov </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1naufuz/how_do_you_stay_motivated_building_an_app_when/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1naufuz/how_do_you_stay_motivated_building_an_app",
