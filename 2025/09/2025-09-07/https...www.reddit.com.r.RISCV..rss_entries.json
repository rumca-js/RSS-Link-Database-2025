The idea is to plug the board into my PC with the USB-C port, then connect a mouse to the USB-A port on the board. Basically, I want the board to sit in between and handle the mouse data.</p> <p>The mouse powers up fine and my computer sees the board as both an HID and a COM port, but I can\u2019t seem to actually read any data from the mouse. I\u2019ve been stuck on this for a while and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m missing something obvious or if the board just can\u2019t handle this.</p> <p>Has anyone done something similar with the RP2350-USB-A, or know if it\u2019s even possible? Any advice or pointers would be a huge help.</p> <p>Would you like me to make this sound a bit more like a <strong>troubleshooting/cry for help post</strong> (frustrated but casual), or more like a <strong>technical/engineering question</strong>?</p> </div><!-- SC_O",
