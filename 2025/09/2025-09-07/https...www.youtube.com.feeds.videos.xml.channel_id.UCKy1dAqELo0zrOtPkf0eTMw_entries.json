        "description": "Check out the first gameplay trailer for the dystopian cyberpunk psychological horror game Dreadcore: Locked Unit. It's a solo-developed project, and the creator describes it like this: \"You play as a concierge working for the Directorate, a dystopian government, trapped by a rogue AI inside a decaying simulation. What begins as a dull routine spirals into a descent of liminal corridors, haunting apparitions, and a collapsing artificial paradise.\"\n\nWishlist it on Steam if you're interested: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3459030/DREADCORE__Locked_Unit/ \n\nDeveloped by MonkeyFactory Media S\u00e0rl\nMusic by : Neuromorph - https://www.youtube.com/@NeuromorphMusic\nVocals by : VOIDLOT - https://soundcloud.com/voidlot\n\n#IGN #gaming",
