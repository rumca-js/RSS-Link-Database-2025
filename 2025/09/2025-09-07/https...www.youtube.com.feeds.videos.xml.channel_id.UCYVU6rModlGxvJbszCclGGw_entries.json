        "description": "I walk  you through Paris in between business meetings in the office, and meetings in the cafes. Brax Technologies Inc., which created the Brax3 phone has an office in Paris. No talking and no tech talk. Just a visual tour of Paris streets as seen through my eyes. But we are working on future products for all of you!\n\nIn another video, I will talk about the travel experience through Immigration and Customs of both the USA and France, which was all automated. No human involved and powered entirely by facial recognition. It was a weird experience and apparently something new now.\n\n----------------------------------\nBraX3 Privacy Phone is on https://braxtech.net\n-----------------------------------\nBrax Virtual Phone, De-Googled Phones, BytzVPN, BraxMail, BraxRouters are available on https://brax.me\n-----------------------------------\nMerch Store \nhttps://my-store-c37a50.creator-spring.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nI'm the Internet Privacy Guy.
