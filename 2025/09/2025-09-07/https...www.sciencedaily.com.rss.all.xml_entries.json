        "description": "Cambridge scientists discovered that thin, weak zones in Earth\u2019s plates helped spread Iceland\u2019s mantle plume across the North Atlantic, explaining why volcanic activity once spanned thousands of kilometers. These ancient scars not only shaped the landscape but still influence earthquakes and could point to untapped geothermal energy.",

By wrapping CRISPR\u2019s tools in spherical DNA-coated nanoparticles, researchers tripled gene-editing success rates, improved precision, and dramatically reduced toxicity compared to current methods.",

But in 2025, for the first time in at least four decades, this crucial upwelling did not occur. Scientists suspect weakened trade winds linked to climate disruption played a role, leaving cooler waters absent and fisheries under stress.",
