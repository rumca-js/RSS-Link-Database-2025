The researchers proved this by connecting language generation to binary classification - essentially showing that if you can&#39;t reliably tell valid outputs from invalid ones, the model will inevitably produce errors during generation.</p> <p><strong>Why Post-Training Doesn&#39;t Fix It:</strong> Here&#39;s the surprising part - most AI benchmarks actually reward hallucination. They use binary scoring (right/wrong) that penalizes uncertainty, so a model that says &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; scores worse than one that makes confident guesses, even when those guesses are wrong.</p>",

We will not sell foresight; we will manufacture serendipity. Here is the revised plan. It requires no direct contact, no unsolicited advice, and almost no capital.

Its been an informative learning journey and the one key insight that unlocked a lot of dev velocity was separating the <strong>outer-loop</strong> from the <strong>inner-loop</strong> of an agents. What are those and here&#39;s how you can model your agent architecture.</p> <p>The <strong>inner loop</strong> is the control cycle of a single agent that hat gets some work (human or otherwise) and tries to complete it with the assistance of an LLM. The inner loop of an agent is directed by the task it gets, the tools it exposes to the LLM, its system prompt and optionally some state to checkpoint work during the loop. In this inner loop, a developer is responsible for idempotency, compensating actions (if certain tools fails, what should happen to previous operations), and other business logic concerns that helps them build a great user experience. This is where workflow engines like <a href=\"https",
