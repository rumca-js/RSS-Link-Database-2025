The only book I\u2019ve read for leisure since I was 12 was Pet Sounds 33 1/3 by Jim Fusilli which was like 2 years ago and a very short, easy read. Guess I just don\u2019t really know where to start \u2014 mainly looking for something maybe positive and/or affirming to help maintain my current headspace, probably not looking for fiction atm, and maybe not something overly long.

One adult man prefers non-fiction historical books and the other adult man in the group rarely reads books (he\u2019s more interested in articles, but did like the book The Circle). First book we read was Damascus Station (second adult man I described\u2019s pick-he enjoyed it) and the second book was How to Read a Book by Monica Wood (adult woman\u2019s pick). Both men enjoyed How to Read a Book, particularly the first man described. </p> <p>I\u2019d like to choose a fiction, under 400 pages ideally (but must below 500). Maybe sci fi (a la Annihilation) Or a \u201cslice of life\u201d kind of book (honestly a la How to Read a Book). I also love historical fiction.

Something balanced like graphic novels or comics. I remember my cousin sister getting Geronimo Stilton. They were good.. set in a fantasy world, with good adventures and art. &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot; also feels like a good option, but I haven&#39;t personally read it.</p> <p>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever read a fiction book in his life before...
