I absolutely love the way that it&#39;s shot, a long with the score giving it a mythical or dreamlike feel at times. I was thinking recently about Tom Hardy and how his career trajectory has changed since the venom movies and I feel like he doesn&#39;t stand out as much as an actor anymore, and rewatching this movie reminded me just how great Tom Hardy can be. His role as Fitzgerald is genuinely his best in my opinion. The cinematography is stunning, the performances are bold, the violence feels real, and the desperation of Hugh Glass really is felt. Of course this movie won DiCaprio his Oscar and I feel that&#39;s well deserved despite some saying he tortured himself to get the Oscar. For the life of me I don&#39;t understand how so many people I know were underwhelmed with the movie upon its release. Have you revisited it recently? And if so, how ha",

I don&#39;t think that the movie is bad (it does has some cool scenes such as the Darth Maul fight scene) but I am saying this: we were all excited for the return of Star Wars after a 16 year hiatus, it was constantly hyped up, was the most anticipated movie of our lives and we were curious to know about the rise of Anakin Skywalker and how he became Darth Vader...</p> <p>Instead, we ended up getting Jar-Jar, a long podracing scene, CGI overload and corny dialogue that was written by a 7 year old. We waited 16 years for this film to come out and also, we get a sci-fi movie, disguised as a children&#39;s film for the first 2/3rds of the movie. It was a huge letdown at the time but despite this, I since have cooled down quite a bit on the prequels with the exception of Jar-Jar Binks as at least, it still has the Star Wars feel to it and a cool fight scene to Phantom Menace which is the Darth Maul fight scene",
