A passing motorist grabbed a fire extinguisher and rushed to the scene, pulling McLoryd to safety through the car's sunroof. McLoryd finally left the hospital after 41 days. Her daughter, Rashida, became her full-time caretaker. McLoryrd's hero, 23-year-old Nathan Felix, met her for the first time since the crash.",
