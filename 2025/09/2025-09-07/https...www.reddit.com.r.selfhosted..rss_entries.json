        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi there! I checked Immich for self-hosting a FOSS G00gle Photos alternative. However I have no access to a home server right now. I want something reliable to manage my photos both on my Android phone and on my Linux laptop. The ideal would be to share the camera folder with Syncthing, so that the pictures from my phone are also available in the computer. What programs do you recommend to organise these files, both on Android and Linux? I&#39;m also interested in fixing the dates easily from my phone, as the photos imported from WhatsApp always have the wrong dates. This should be reflected on the Linux gallery too.</p> <p>Any recommendations? Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pgilah\"> /u/pgilah </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nb6qx1/local_nonhosted_photo_gallery_app_for_android_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddi",

I plan to use Jellyfin and the *arr Stack for this, but I&#39;m caught up on how and where I want to set things up. Recently picked up a TerraMaster F4-212 NAS and have 2x 6Tb drives in it acting as a glorified hardrive atm. Had some trouble getting things setup on the TerraMaster trying to go through their community apps. Also you get what you pay for and it only has 1gb of ram I believe. I ended up getting Jellyfin working on my windows desktop instead. So I started thinking that it might just be easier to host on my desktop and point the storage to my NAS. I also have a Pi4B 4gb, Pi0, and an extra laptop or two I thought about using at one point. </p> <p>Was also going to setup PiHole for adblocking, would that be better on Pi0 or can that work on the NAS?</p> <p>TLDR: Wondering about pros and cons to using my daily desktop vs my NAS",

I have a pretty simple machine, an Intel i3 (4th gen) with an RTX 1650 4GB GPU not too power-hungry.</p> <p>Since my GPU was underused, I decided to install <a href=\"https://ollama.com\">Ollama</a>, a tool that allows running AI models locally. After testing Ollama, I quickly realized that 4GB wasn\u2019t enough to run the latest models.</p> <h1>Hardware Upgrade</h1> <p>With this new problem, I now had the perfect excuse to upgrade my other machine the one I use for gaming. After a lot of research, I managed to get a good deal on an RX 7900 XTX. Now I have 24GB to run the latest models. But I was surprised by its power consumption, easily pulling over 300 watts. This raised a red flag: keeping this machine on 24/7 would be far from energy-efficient.</p> <h1>Initial Idea</h",

I got everything setup without the VPN and was getting around 50-90 MiB/s total bandwidth (roughly the cap of my ISP bandwidth), 30-50 MiB/s on an individual torrent. After adding Gluetun w/Surfshark, this performance has tanked to around 1-2 MiB/s on the best torrents and &lt;1 MiB/s on most. I know that surfshark doesnt support port-forwarding but my normal network has hard NAT as well and I know it didn&#39;t work with it before either (to test this I disabled NAT traversal stuff as well and it still got very good speeds). I&#39;ve tried different servers which has helped bump it from \\~1 MiB/s to \\~2 MiB/s but this changes a lot. Is surfshark just not a good VPN provider for torrenting?

The integrated markdown editor is not so good for lists with checkboxes. You cant check/uncheck at all on view mode. Especially bad on Android. I tried to dance around it and i think i tested every Markdown editor there is on f-droid but didnt found the correct solution yet.
