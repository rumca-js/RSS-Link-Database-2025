Some have disappointed me with just a big world of nothing. I like worlds where there are interactions as I travel. Let&#39;s say Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption, for example. I am enjoying the gorgeous view, and someone tries to attack or rob me. What I like is how anything can happen as I travel. I may have some of the games yall might suggest, but perhaps I might find one that slipped under the radar. It doesn&#39;t have to be specifically about random events.
