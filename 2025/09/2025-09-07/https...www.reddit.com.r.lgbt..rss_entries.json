At first I thought about posting them on my Insta, but my sister is following me there and she doesn\u2019t know that I\u2019m gay. For now it doesn\u2019t feel safe, so I decided to share these pics here on Reddit.</p> <p>I never wore clothes like this before. It was a crop top and at first it felt a little uncomfy to go out of my usual frames. But I was not alone, my friend was with me, so it was ok.

Would that make me pansexual?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YourFavTimewaster\"> /u/YourFavTimewaster </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1nahk2j/lesbian_or_bi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1nahk2j/lesbian_or_bi/\">[comments]</a></span>",
