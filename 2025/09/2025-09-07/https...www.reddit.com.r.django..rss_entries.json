I decided to use Django for this task, bc I have a little bit more knowledge in python than every other backend language, like php or go.</p> <p>I&#39;m planning to do some Restful API features, although I still have to define exactly what I need to do as a whole.</p> <p>Besides Django, which other libraries might be useful? Maybe Fastapi?</p> <p>I&#39;m quite unfamiliar with the backend of an application and want to learn more about it. I mostly used BaaS.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chaneketm\"> /u/chaneketm </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1naztk0/starting_my_first_django_project/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1naztk0/starting_my_first_django_project/\">[comments]</a></span>",

How do I set it up with certain criterias (hourly rate limit per IP and set rate limit for human and non-human users). How do I set rate limiting properly, do you have a documentation to recommend? I deploy my app on google cloud inside a docker container.

Right now I have 0 users and could potentially get a small contract with a tiny community that&#39;s interested in putting their buildings in my system.</p> <p>Now I have a multi app project (12 django apps) all working together. I have a settings.py built with modular approach for development and production mode for modular switching. I&#39;ve tried to secure the diango app in every way possible SSO, 2FA, Django axes you name i think I got it. </p> <p>The problem is my knowledge my mathematical skills and real estate knowledge are fine, my coding knowledge is limited i would say. So I rely on Claude Opus and Chatgpt 5 etc. For brainstorming, plans, and execution. I try to verify what I can. </p>",
