I measured 100H/88V and I normally max out all headsets in terms of FOV. </p> <p>That puts the headset in a tough spot. If I am fine with such a small FOV, why go for the bulky Crystal Super? I could go for the Beyond 2 instead or the Meganex, and even get OLED. Or I could wait for the Dream Air and get better colors. So therefore, it is truly a headset that is hard to recommend, even though it is a good headset. </p> <p>Other than that, quite strong CA, felt more than the other versions. Also ",

I tried every in game setting but when I press left stick forward to move, the camera remains stationary and I see the character move. When I release the stick I&#39;m teleported to the character. I&#39;m assuming its not a glitch but how teleportation is supposed to work. But how do I turn it off??! Any help is much appreciated. Really looking forward to playing this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Capt-Quark\"> /u/Capt-Quark </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nasfy5/turn_off_teleportation_in_doom_3_bfg_vr_edition/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nasfy5/turn_off_teleportation_in_doom_3_bfg_vr_edition/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Was pretty happy with it but it wasn&#39;t perfect. Well Prism dropped it&#39;s new S1 Lite and I&#39;m happy I upgraded. It&#39;s smaller, cheaper and performs better then it&#39;s predecessor so I&#39;m not sure why they call it &quot;Lite&quot;. The old system used 2 USB connections which was a pain and now they connect direct to the ethernet port. It&#39;s great having my ports back and the ethernet offers more consistent, smoother data throughput so I&#39;ve had no microstutters. On monitoring I&#39;m getting very consistent 1000-1200mbps rates. Great little box. Amazon link <a href=\"https://a.co/d/9lDwvvB\">https://a.co/d/9lDwvvB</a> if you want to take a look.

I\u2019m talking budget-midrange consumer VR headsets.</p> <p>For one, I think most standalone headsets will have native displayport input over USB-C.</p> <p>I also think a lot of PC-VR only headset will have a much smaller form factor without sacrificing FOV. Think the Bigscreen Beyond 2 with an even wider field of view and higher res displays.</p> <p>Three, I think LCD headset displays will fall by the wayside on everything but the cheapest headsets. Micro-OLED is no doubt the future.</p> <p>Finally, maybe in the much nearer future, I think Meta\u2019s prototype Tiramisu and Boba 3 headsets will be combined into a new version of the Quest Pro.</p> <p>Idk, I wanna know what y\u2019all think</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VaderNotFound_2\"> /u/VaderNotFound_2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nah6ne/w",
