Slowly, piece by piece, the world of Ercaton started to come alive.</p> <p>The game is set in February 2078.

You can play as one of five characters and choose cards from various factions to build your deck and upgrade your ships.</p> <p>After two years of hard work, we released the game in April 2025 and since then we have made a lot of improvements and added new content with the latest <strong>1.2 update</strong> that we released a few days ago.</p> <p>The game is available on Steam and is steam deck verified and we are told by many that the soundtrack is awesome.

The more the mystery unfolds the more you wonder who\u2019s really in control.</p> <p>Thanks for checking out our project!
