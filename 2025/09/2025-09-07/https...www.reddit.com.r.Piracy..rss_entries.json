I am currently using Mobi and Calibre but when I use EPUB or AZW3 the format either doesn&#39;t show up or the cover doesn&#39;t show. if anyone can help me with telling me what im doing wrong, that would be great.</p> <p>I am unable to have book covers as my screensaver for this reason and I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing wrong. I used to be able to get AZW3 with book cover showing on my PW (2022) with no problems. </p> <p>I read about people getting X-Ray and other premium features working, but I can&#39;t even get any format outside of MOBI to work, and I have no idea how to convert KFX with all the features too. </p> <p>If anyone is better at pirating on the Kindle Colorsoft than me, I&#39;d appreciate some help/guidance on what I am doing wrong or what you do to make your media work. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/downinth",

So, along with my main question, is there anything else i need to know to be safe and secure when seeding to others? </p> <p>thank you so much y\u2019all, and to another 16 years of piracy and beyond o7</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",

I t<em>raveled abroad about once in my entire life</em>, so I&#39;m not used to the whole &quot;airport security&quot; stuff and what not. <strong>I am also from Brazil</strong>, and piracy here is EASY, you don&#39;t even need VPN to get stuff and people straight up sell hacked consoles and whatnot on the streets.</p> <p><strong>Well, here we go:</strong></p> <p>I heard Japan is VERY strict when it comes to Piracy, and after searching a lot there doesn&#39;t seem to be enough posts around to help me. How strict is it really?</p> <p>You see, I have an <strong>SSD with tons of</strong> pirated games and movies, a <strong>hacked 3DS</strong>, a <strong>hacked PS Vita</strong>, and some extra <strong>1 or 2 hard drives with movies</strong>. Is it safe bringing those to Japan? Will airport security somehow want to check them and get me in trouble? I hear yo",
