It is basically a script that automatically starts up upon launch and plays a full screen video from specific files using VLC.</p> <p>The issue I am having is when the pi starts and the program begins, the video plays at like 4 frames a second. If i shrink the window to a very small box, the frame rate becomes &quot;passable&quot;.</p> <p>This is weird because when I manually run the video in the file explorer, it plays perfectly in full screen and any other size video. I figure there is a default setting that is messing up this program.</p> <p>I do not know much about programming, and I am new to raspberry pi. I am hoping someone can point me in the right direction? Below is a link to the video I got this code from, as well as the script:</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ng9nKvCNBWY?si=gADw5qbXhSgg",

I&#39;m hoping anyone here can help me solve this problem.</p> <p>I try to show a dashboard webapp I built on a TV screen connected to a RPI4. The dashboard contains a GIS map (ArcGIS webmap). This map is constructed out of a background map/layer with multiple layers on top with information. The map uses blending for its visual effects. This map is shown correctly on every PC I open the app on, but on the RPI the layers on the map are missing.</p> <p>Here are 2 screenshots, one is showing the map as it is shown on every PC I load the dashboard. And the other one as shown on the RPI.</",

I need recommendations on a screen that is possibly a case. It Would be really nice if it had 3.5mm jack so I can connect it to my old computer speakers on my toolbox at work. If this case has room for me to put an M.2 hat on it or in it to be used as well, that would be awesome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tophellcat\"> /u/Tophellcat </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1najm8d/casescreen_recommendations/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1najm8d/casescreen_recommendations/\">[comments]</a></span>",
