Kuang, and while I liked the magic system and imperialism angle, the class stuff felt kinda tacked on, like it was there but not really explored deep. It got me thinking about how many fantasy books have these huge societies with kings and peasants, but they barely touch on the real tensions between them. Like in Mistborn, the skaa vs nobles is central, and it works great, but a lot of other books just have poor folks as background noise. I grew up in a working-class area, so when books skip over that, it bugs me. Am I missing something, or do you feel the same?

Not a huge amount of down time between action sequences. </p></li> <li><p>Interesting, weird, scary, funny characters. Something I love about Fury Road is the originality of the character designs.
