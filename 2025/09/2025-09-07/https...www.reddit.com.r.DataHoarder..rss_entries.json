Been using exFAT for mostly photos, docs, media, etc. Drives are primarily used with macOS but occasionally, also with Linux. I very rarely, if ever, have need for Windows compatibility.</p> <p>I\u2019ve learned that my two best options are HFS+ or continuing to use exFAT as both have native read/write capabilities in both macOS and Linux. Given that HFS+ is journaled, is this a better option for avoiding errors in the future or is there a reason to continue with exFAT? These are HDDs not SSDs so the speed penalty will not be noticed. I learned that if I ever do find a need for Windows compatibility, there are a few paid options that are reasonably priced to give full r/w access.</p> <p>Thoughts? Is the journaling a worthwhile upgrade? Which would you use? Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",

Tried another mac, an ipad or an android phone and same. Light 1 appears blue but light 2 appears red and stays red as soon as I connect the USB cable to the laptop. HDD is working as it works connected to the laptop via a SATA adapter. Is the unit defective or is there a drive missing? Manual says it should be plug and play so doubt that is the issue. Tried formatting the drive to APFS and exfat with the sata adapter and same issue.

I have a question unanswered for years.. suppose you have an hard drive full of data (files and directories) and an empty drive you want to copy all that data to. Ok, select all, copy, and paste in the other drive.. things move on but suddenly \u201cfile xxxx is already present, do you want to overwrite or keep both?\u201d How can this even be possible? Looks like two files with the same name are present in the source, but they can\u2019t be copied to the destination. This is driving me insane! Any suggestions?

Your code is safe on your own server - Repository gets DMCA&#39;d or deleted? You still have it - That",
