So instead of using an all automated script, which didn&#39;t work, I am trying with nodriver and a manual authentication in the browser.</p> <p>When executing the script, the target website opens and requests authentication. However, my credentials don&#39;t work. It&#39;s as if it doesn&#39;t recognize my credentials which are usually correct. On the other hand, when I launch the website from the search bar and connect, the same credentials work.</p> <p>Has anyone had the same issue? Is it due to an additional Clouflare protection? What can I try to solve this please?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/witmeur27\"> /u/witmeur27 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1nasroq/nodriver_authentication_fails/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a",
