Some argue that AI systems, like GPT-5, exhibit behaviours that mimic human intelligence. Other believe these systems are merely sophisticated simulations without geuine understanding. What are your thoughts? Is AI truly intelligent, or are we just witnessing advanced pattern recognition?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Signal-Pin-7887\"> /u/Signal-Pin-7887 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1nailnl/is_ai_truly_intelligent_or_just_a_complex/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1nailnl/is_ai_truly_intelligent_or_just_a_complex/\">[comments]</a></span>",

But after years working in construction and moving through very different corners of society, I\u2019ve seen something that AI still struggles with:</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 How to truly listen.</p> <p>Human beings reveal themselves in small details, the words they choose, the pauses they take, even the metaphors they lean on. These nuances carry meaning beyond raw text. Yet most AI training doesn\u2019t fully account for this kind of lived communication.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I believe lived experience is not \u201cless than\u201d technical expertise... it\u2019s a missing piece. If AI is trained only from data and not from the depth of human diversity, it risks misunderstanding the very people it\u2019s meant to serve.</p> <p>So I\u2019d like to open this question to the community: How can we bring more lived human perspectives into AI training and safety work, alongside the technical experts?</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear you",
