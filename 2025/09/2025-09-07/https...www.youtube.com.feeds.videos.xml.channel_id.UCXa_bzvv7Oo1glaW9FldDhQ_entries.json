        "description": "Hollow Knight: Silksong has been my obsession over the past few days, and despite all the frustration culminating in satisfying victories, all the hours not tracked in-game of trying and retrying to beat certain bosses, I can't wait to get back to it. My only worry is that I'll eventually finish everything and have to move on (or attempt a Steel Soul run for some permadeath shenanigans).\n\nYes, some things annoy me (which may be outright deal breakers for other players), and I wouldn't mind a few changes here and there. However, as it stands, Hollow Knight: Silksong is simply sublime. It's the culmination of passion, meticulous design, and stunning presentation that aims for something beyond a simple sequel, expanding on the atmosphere and exploration while delivering higher tempo movement and more creative combat expression.

        "description": "In the lead up to its release on September 12th, Borderlands 4 is generating a lot of buzz. The looter shooter series\u2019 enduring legacy as a strong influencer has kept its fanbase loyal despite a handful of recent missteps, but the principal reasons behind Borderlands 4\u2019s high anticipation are the reported evolutions coming to the series. \n\nGearbox Software have crafted a raft of gameplay, narrative, and world design innovations but, crucially, they\u2019ve been careful to maintain the series\u2019 long-standing DNA. In short: they\u2019ve embellished all that works in the series with aplomb whilst eradicating everything that doesn\u2019t. \n\nTheir diligence to honour the series\u2019 legacy ensures Borderlands 4 is shaping up to be one of the biggest games of the year.",
