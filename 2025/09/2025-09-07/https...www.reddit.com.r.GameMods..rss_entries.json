There\u2019s an achievement for clearing 9 rounds of \u2018Classic\u2019 PAC-MAN and it is unbelievably tedious. I actually earned it legitimately (barely) on PS5, but I\u2019m trying to 100% the game on Steam before the new one comes out. It seems this one achievement is what causes a lot of people to stumble. I know I should just get better at the game, but\u2026dude. Just try it. Try clearing 9 rounds of OG PAC-MAN. I know there are people that can do it, but it\u2019s annoying as hell for, I would venture to say, most folks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Axemans_Jazz93\"> /u/Axemans_Jazz93 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1navv94/can_someone_please_make_an_infinite_lives_mod_for/\">[link]<",
