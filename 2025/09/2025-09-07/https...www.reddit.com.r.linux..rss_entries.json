I tried to boot my Ubuntu installation day before yesterday, grub menu is gone. Windows silently overwrote the boot record. Followed the usual steps to restore grub, Windows &quot;repaired&quot; it on the next reboot. It did this multiple times without any interaction from me. I guess I am no longer allowed to control or configure my own system. I guess the option of switching between systems AS I DETERMINED WAS NECESSARY is no longer feasible. I currently have Ubuntu up after forcing a start from a bootable USB, but I am legitimately afraid to restart Windows at this point and just have the same thing happen again. Maybe just pull the drive at this point and quarantine it.....LOL.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",
