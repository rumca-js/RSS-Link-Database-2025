You&#39;re able to categorize by profile and it&#39;s all saved in a local database.</p> <p>Taking it a little further there&#39;s a built-in comments viewer, and ability to bookmark and filter. It also recognizes Youtube links and offers the option to launch in an external video player. You can also export your profile or bookmarked links to html, and backup and import your database. </p> <p>The project is just starting and I plan on adding more to it in the near future. I hope you get some use out of it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rl3z0x7in1of1.png?width=1271&amp;format=png&",
