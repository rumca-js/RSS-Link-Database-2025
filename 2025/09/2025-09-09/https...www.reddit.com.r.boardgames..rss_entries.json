After the first time I played, with the people who gifted it to me, I liked it a lottt and wanted to play it again. I&#39;d set up the entire game, deal cards, put the cards in the black card holder thingy, do everything and wait for my parents to come and play it with me, but they never did.

I would never use it for dining or anything else.</p> <p>Most dedicated game tables have a rim around the edge and are dropped down in the middle. I believe this is so things don&#39;t fall off while rolling dice and stuff, and so you can put a topper on and use it for dining and other stuff. </p> <p>Would I miss the rail if I didn&#39;t have one on my table? I was thinking I could get a normal dining table and cover it in neoprene or something. I play games like Eldritch Horror and Gloomhaven so I definitely need the space, but it seems like the rail might mess with my posture trying to bend over it all the time. I have a bad back as it is.</p> <p>Also, are there &quot;unrimmed&quot; game tables that people would recommend?

For example, my friends and I have been on a Root excursion for the past two months, playing every week or every other week. While we play we always look up &quot;Root ambient music&quot; on different platforms. Or something forest themed.</p> <p>This is a real necessity, but in times of high intensity, music is 100000% needed. This applies to more long, drawn-out and complicated games. Whenever we play Twilight Imperium, we usually play Duel of the Fates during the climax battles of the game. We also like the music from Gondor and Rohan. I personally like Holst&#39;s &quot;The Planets&quot;. It makes the game that much more fun.
