Or do you need to make something to avoid the software from connecting to internet?</p> <p>3- The Rhinoceros .exe is 690mb, so I can&#39;t upload it to Virustotal, there is another virustotal-like website where I can analyze this file?</p> <p>That&#39;s all, I did piracy back in 2000s but things had cha",
