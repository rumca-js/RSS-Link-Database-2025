I was talking with my website guy on a google meet call and we talked about needing to be able to make event ID&#39;s in the future to store in databases. I asked Chat GPT to make a new program to run a new event and it added that feature without me adding. Secondly I was chatting with one of my testers on Facebook messenger and she asked if it could normalize times to 3 decimals. I told her this could cause some issues. Well what do you know next time i ask chat GPT to make a change it adds code to do exactly that, and breaks the program. This seems like a massive security risk </p> <p>So is chatGPT bugging absolutely everything?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ccraddock\"> /u/ccraddock </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1nc7d5c/im_convinced_chatgpt_bugs_you",
