The stuff looks nice and I don&#39;t have to do it. So they wanted to work on some SEO stuff, I was like sure, I&#39;ve been using Moz, Google Search Console, etc. for awhile and our site is pretty clean and SEO friendly. I&#39;ve worked in SEO space in the past and keep repeatedly telling my boss &#39;make engaging content the user likes&#39; and you will do ok at at SEO (along with common sense SEO practices). So my boss sent me a slide deck of their progress and the first item was:</p> <p>Fixed over 12k 404 errors (to 301 redirects) to increase site performance</p> <p>I was like WTF, I watch for 404s and always create a redirect on an indexed pages when if it goes away. So I logged in and checked the redirects on the server.</p> <p>EVERY F&#39;n URL that a script kiddy has hit in the last few years that resulted in a 404 had a redirect. So:</p> <p>Like /d",

This is instead of picking a TLD that may be considered lower quality or cheap.</p> <p>The question was in response to a site owner saying he went with a .xyz TLD because his brand name on the .com was taken and didn&#39;t want to go with hyphens in his domain name. He also added that he saw Google went with <a href=\"http://abc.xyz\">abc.xyz</a> for its investors and Alphabet holding site, so thought it would be good. Over time, he noticed that &quot;instances where sites won&#39;t allow a .xyz URL to be posted because it&#39;s considered &quot;spam&quot; or folks consider it &quot;AI,&quot; he wrote.</p> <p>John wrote in part in his super-long response:</p> <blockquote> <",
