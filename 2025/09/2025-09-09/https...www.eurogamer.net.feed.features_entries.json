I hated it. It was so common that it might as well have been part of the school dress code, and yet, I resisted. I've always been pretty good at doing my own thing, not falling into the trap of peer pressure and what I've just this second coined as \"The trend fallacy\". Just because everyone is doing something, doesn't mean it's right for you.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/curtains-in-the-90s-pogs-and-the-trend-fallacy-yes-this-is-a-stealth-hollow-knight-silksong-article-sorry\">Read more</a></p>",
