Support my work: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nThere is a newly emerging industry called \u201cwhole-body\u201d biometrics. Surveillance technologies that go beyond anything remotely imagined by sci-fi scenarios and dystopian fantasies. It is currently the primary focus of research funded by the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activty (IARPA) \u2013 a US government body.\n\nIARPA aims to develop the ultimate surveillance tool \u2013 one that can combine all key biometric markers into one comprehensive surveillance AI. The research is lead by a team at the Michigan State University and the tool they are creating is called FarSight.\n\nFarSight combines three biometric markers \u2013 gait, body and face \u2013 into a traceable profile to be matched to known individuals or to identify new matches. Gait and face recognition are not new \u2013 they are long-know methods of identifying subjects based on their stride and face. What is new is FarSight\u2019s body recognitio",
