As for exactly how to install I am not exactly clear, but I suspect that you need to build your own SDcard in a similar method to the RPi3, RPi4, Odroid C4, or Odroid N2.</p> <p>The end goal by Samsung is historically not to support these devices, I would take it as a strong indication that Samsung will have RISC-V chips in their future products and supporting these devices now is to help developers work until then.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",

I wonder how, what and which GBZ80 instructions and registers &quot;could&quot; map directly to RISC-v. No - I don&#39;t plan on doing it. It&#39;s just a fun idea to look into and use what I know as an analogy to better understand something new :)</p> <p>Where I <em>do</em> see some use-case would be for PS3 - RPCS3 is one of the absolute tech marvels that just breaks my mind. It is amazing, pure and simple. Who knows, maybe PPC/CELL-&gt;RISC-V might be doable...some day, anyway.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IngwiePhoenix\"> /u/IngwiePhoenix </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV",
