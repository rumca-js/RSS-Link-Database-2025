The other option is getting a PSVR 2 with the PC adapter since I have a pretty beefy PC but no PS5. I got an OLED TV which is gorgeous, but I also want an upgrade from the fresnel lens from the Q2. I also enjoy being untethered, but I play in my office with my PC anyways so I don&#39;t think a cable would actually affect me all that much, I&#39;m just not sure what I&#39;m missing out with if I just go no console. I&#39;m also pretty tech savvy and don&#39;t mind installing third party software to get things like haptics and eye tracking more properly working, too.</p> <p>Should I also just wait the extra months for Black Friday or is the Batman game bundle just worth the $499? I have the funds right now and I&#39;ve been missing VR...<",

The top half of my headset image gets blocky/pixelated in steps, starting a bit above the center. The bottom half looks perfect.</p> <p>I experimented a bit:</p> <p>When I disable foveated encoding, the pixelation is gone and the image looks great \u2014 but then I get another problem: the image starts \u201cghosting\u201d/trailing behind, and latency is noticeably worse.</p> <p>When I enable foveated encoding, latency feels fine again, but the pixelation on the top half comes back.</p> <p>So I\u2019m stuck between these two problems. Has anyone else run into this? Is there a way to fix or tweak foveated encoding (offset, strength, etc.) so I don\u2019t get that blocky top half while still keeping the low latency benefits?</p> <p>Any advice would be much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive-Layer853\"> /u/Competitive-La",
