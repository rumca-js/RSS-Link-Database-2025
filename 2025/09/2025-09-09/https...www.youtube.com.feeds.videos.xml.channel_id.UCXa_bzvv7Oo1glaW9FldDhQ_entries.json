        "description": "Indiana Jones and the Great Circle gets an interesting if not innovative DLC chapter with The Order of the Giants diving deeper into the game. While it retains all of the base game's strengths, it could have done more to build on the combat system and perhaps featured more content to extend its relatively short runtime. \n\nHowever, what's on offer is an Indy experience that maintains the presentation of the original game. It's a fun chapter for those familiar with the gameplay.",

        "description": "Nintendo\u2019s newly launched Switch 2 delivers impressive performance for its price - thanks to its custom Nvidia Ampere-based chip with DLSS 3.0 and ray tracing. It\u2019s no wonder that it's already selling like hot cakes. But how much would it cost to replicate that power on a PC? \n\nWith this video, we try to do exactly that as we put together a build comprising fresh off-the-shelf parts and see how wide the price margin is between our proposed PC build and the Switch 2 (in docked mode).",

        "description": "The video game difficulty debate has arisen once more, this time with Hollow Knight: Silksong. Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel to the acclaimed Hollow Knight (over 15 million and counting) finally launched on September 4th for every single platform after seven years in development. It was hyped beyond measure in equal parts by a community that loves the first game, many who were happy to join in on the meme, and those in between. But this wasn't a case of \u201canything less than perfection is bad.\u201d\n\nMany saw Silksong in its sparingly low appearances, ogling the screenshots, dissecting the details. They were already in love, and more than anything else, they wanted to play the darn thing. As the hype continued to build, earning spots at Summer Game Fest and the Xbox Games Showcase (pity the ROG Xbox Ally, which is all but forgotten in this mania), the number of people waiting to get their hands on it was high.
