Wouldn&#39;t they qualify as one of the first long fantasy series with common main characters and a somewhat continuous overall plot? They certainly had plenty of magic and some worldbuilding, not just Oz itself, but the adjoining magical lands outside the Deadly Desert. I grew up reading them - the 16 or so that Frank Baum wrote, and the next batch written by Ruth P. Thompson (which admittedly weren&#39;t at the same level of storytelling) quality. I did not read any of the half dozen or so &quot;modern&quot; ones written in the latter part of the last century. </p> <p>Anyhow, that&#39;s where my love for fantasy truly began - well before I encountered Tolkien in jr high and high school.

The story follows an NCIS agent in the 90s who works for a special program that uses time travel to investigate crimes and potential threats. The interesting part of this time travel is that they can only visit possible futures as the future is not predetermined. However, there is a teminus point, an end of the world scenario, that an increasing number of futures are pointing towards that leads to a truly gruesome end to humanity that I will not spoil here. Worse that future seems to be getting closer to the present.</p> <p>The main story follows Shannon Moss as she investigates the murder of a family of an MIA agent lost during an expedition into deep space. She travels between 1997, her present time, and possible futures and quickly learns this murder is related to the terminus point. What follows is a complex plo",

I binged the last 5 hours at work today and I couldn\u2019t stop nor focus nor get anything done. Now if you\u2019ve asked me two weeks ago I would rate the series a 3/5 at best but now? A solid 5!</p> <p>The only problem: I\u2019m torn. Should I carry on with the next book, or reread the trilogy first? I listened to many parts of it while working, so I wasn\u2019t giving it my full attention. ",

I had original woven in the four main antagonists over the first few chapters to set the scene and build the story but I wondered if that was the problem? Did the story plod along too much at the start? So, I rewrote the first three chapters, dropped the reader right into the action and then worked the narrative with flashbacks and dialog to set the scene I had taken time over before. This done I submitted again. More rejections followed, so I self-published. The question remained though, did I do the right thing? If publishers and agents want three chapters or 10,000 words and you only get one chance to impress, can you really take the time to build up slowly? What I did made no difference.
