When I see a track is around 6 minutes, I instantly think of Tame Impala, their songs are often in that range but not always. But if I see something closer to 7 minutes, Pink Floyd comes to my mind right away, since they&#39;re known for long evolving and shifting tracks.</p> <p>It made me wonder if anyone else has this kind of association. Do you link certain lengths of songs to specific musicians or bands? e.g: maybe 3 minute tracks make you think of classic pop singles or 10 minute pieces bring up progressive or alternative rock epics.</p> <p>I wpuld love to hear if others also subconsciously connect time lengths with particular artists, and which ones come to mind for you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JSBach05\"> /u/JSBach05 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1ncghu0/do_you_ever_associate_specific_song_length",

There is so much excellent new stuff being created (and so easily available) that it\u2019s hard to keep up with it. Most of my school friends, of 50 years or more, tend to dismiss new music and stick with what they know from the 70s or 80s\u2026or to a genre they are familiar with. I recognise that it\u2019s not a competition and people like what they like\u2026but I wish they were more open to the new. Is there anyone in a similar position\u2026?
