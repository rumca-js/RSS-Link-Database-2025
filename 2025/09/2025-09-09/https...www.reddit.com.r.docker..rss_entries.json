I have, probably, specific question.</p> <p>As far I know, and see, docker includes base image inside built image:</p> <pre><code>REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE test latest 84ec88cef292 4 seconds ago 19.1MB alpine latest 4bcff63911fc 8 weeks ago 12.8MB </code></pre> <p>Where test image is built from next <code>Dockerfile</code>:</p> <pre><code>FROM alpine:latest WORKDIR /data COPY vim.basic . </code></pre> <p>I can understand why docker includes image into the built one. But is there any option to keep it on the remote (dockerhub or mirror) or in the local storage (where all <code>docker pull</code> images are stored)?</p> <p>I didn&#39;t find any info about this, so if you can provide any issues, discussions or docs - it will be good.</p> <p>I think that better solution is to keep base image as separated one (since docker uses layers it could extract each one inside container with base image)</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>alpi",

I&#39;m seasoned software engineer and always used docker on the &quot;easy&quot; mode, since most of my use cases are very typical web app deployments.
