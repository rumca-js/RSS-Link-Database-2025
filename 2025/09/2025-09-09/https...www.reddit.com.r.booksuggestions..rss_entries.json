I\u2019d love to hear about some spooky mysteries you have enjoyed. I prefer supernatural or monster based horror. Something like gravity falls or stranger things. Bonus points if the setting is a spooky forest. Outside of that, not picky at all.

I prefer books that are either in third person or solely from a woman\u2019s perspective, and characters are at least over the age of 25. I think late 90s, early 2000s chick lit is the sweet spot for me (Confessions of a Shopaholic, Bridget Jones\u2019s Diary, that kind of stuff). I read a book called Girls Poker Night that kinda summarized the vibe, but unfortunately I don\u2019t think many have read it so it\u2019s not exactly a helpful metric. \ud83d\ude05 I guess the best way to describe it is chick lit that\u2019s more centered on the woman\u2019s personal storyline but involved a romantic plot line.

What I loved about it was its smooth yet addictive plot laced with deep philosophical reflections. Earlier this year I also read East of Eden and enjoyed that as well. Though it is comparatively slower paced than the Count of Monte Cristo, it again closed on an immensely enjoyable philosophical statement. I loved how it closed with \u201ctimshel\u201d and Monte Cristo with \u201cwait and hope.\u201d I want suggestions on novels with similar elements: a gripping plot centred on a moral question, deep character studies, cliffhangers and an overarching philosophical theme that closes the story.

This is giving me Twilight feels but with way more bite (literally). It\u2019s all ballet shoes, vampire drama, and that moody 80s vibe that makes you feel like you\u2019re watching an old VHS horror movie.</p> <p>And honestly? It\u2019s the perfect fall read. Like, I swear you can practically hear the crunch of leaves under your feet while you\u2019re flipping the pages. It\u2019s got that spooky-romantic Halloween energy where you want to light a pumpkin candle and read until 2am.</p> <p>If Twilight was your guilty pleasure back in the day, Blood Rose is like its cooler, darker cousin that shows up in black lipstick with a bag full of secrets.

I don&#39;t like the perfect/ideal love stories like the ones from romcoms, they feel empty, unrealistic, and plastic. I don&#39;t need sad stories or bad endings either, just something more psychological or realistic. The only read that I had of this kind was White Nights from Fi\u00f3dor Dostoyevski.

Most of the books on my TBR are set in the summer and I want fall or winter vibes now that summer is basically over. The book doesn\u2019t have to be completely centered around taking place in fall/winter, just don\u2019t want anything set in the summer right now.

I\u2019ve been wanting to get back into learning about different dog breeds but I\u2019m not sure which book is the most recent and covers the most breeds and knowledge on said breeds! I\u2019ve tried to just google it but all I could find were region or country based dog books and a lot were published in the 19-hundreds but I\u2019d like a more recent one that covers a lot more than they had back then.

Tired of going to the bookstore or even the library and opening books and seeing a ton of smut.</p> <p>I\u2019m big into sci fi, action/adventure, military, dystopian, and even some fantasy as well\u2026but I am <em>not</em> a fan of very technical/hard sci-fi or slow paced reads. I don\u2019t mind dipping into YA, violence and language are fine, and so is romance (as a subplot, not the genre) so long as it\u2019s at the very least closed door.</p> <p>Latest books I\u2019ve loved are the Skyward series by Brandon Sanderson and the Devoured Worlds trilogy by Megan E O\u2019keefe. If you want more big picture ideas I really like Stargate, Star Trek, and Star Wars\u2026would be looking for books that keep up these themes/vibes but aren\u2019t necessarily part of those worlds.</p> <p>TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

The whole investigation process, I loved it, and I loved the mystery. I felt like the book was about to climax right before he got arrested and I wasn&#39;t sure where they&#39;d take it from there.
