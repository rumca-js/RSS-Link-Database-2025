Also availabel on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.\n\n\"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants can be whipped through in a single afternoon, but during that short run it takes you through a beautiful array of new locations to explore and presents several puzzles that are even better than those in The Great Circle itself. It probably would\u2019ve been better value as a more replayable, separate mode rather than stitched into the main story but, in an environment where some of my favourite single-player games are being bastardised into games-as-a-service hellscapes, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m against anything that extends my time with a lavishly crafted solo adventure like 2024\u2019s Indiana Jones, even if it\u2019s only by another four or five hours.\"",
