Today Amazon subsidiary Woot is selling a 49-inch MSI OLED gaming monitor <a href=\"https://computers.woot.com/offers/msi-49-dqhd-curved-monitor-mpg-491cqps-qd-oled-2\">for just $629.99</a>. Even for a refurbished model, that\u2019s an incredible deal \u2014 you\u2019d have a hard time finding a 49-inch LCD monitor at that price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MPG 491CQPS is as big as it gets for OLED monitors at the moment, unless you move up to a full-sized TV for a lot more dosh. With 5120\u00d71440 resolution it\u2019s basically two QHD monitors smooshed together in one gigantic curved panel. At 144Hz it\u2019s not the fastest monitor around, but just about any gaming desktop will sweat to push out that many frames at that resolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An",

Perhaps that\u2019s an unfair comparison, but it\u2019s one that plenty of fans are making anyway\u2026 and Lenovo\u2019s response to them isn\u2019t helping. <br><br>In a recent interview at IFA 2025, <a href=\"https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2045631.html\">PC Watch of Japan</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/the-legion-go-2-is-very-expensive-and-people-arent-happy\">Windows Central</a>) asked Lenovo executives about the high pricing.
