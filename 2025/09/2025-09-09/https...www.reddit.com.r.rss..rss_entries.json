Would this be a way to counter Chinese influence and ensure Nepal stays aligned with India\u2019s strategic interests?</p> <p>It\u2019s a sensitive thought, but considering how ideology, geopolitics, and external interference shape South Asia, the idea doesn\u2019t feel far-fetched.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WorthConstruction644\"> /u/WorthConstruction644 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",
