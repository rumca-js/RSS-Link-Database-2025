Otherwise windows will only use 2 cores.</p> <p>I use a windows vm for vr gaming because all the linux solutions are still too janky for me and Virtual Desktop is magic. It&#39;s worked pretty well but I&#39;ve had some mildly disappointing performance which I figured was just the cost of the VM overhead.</p> <p>Anyways, I just noticed in task manager that windows was reporting almost 60% cpu usage while idle, and when I looked closer it said I had 2 cpu sockets. I was confused for a bit, but then I tried changing the cpu topology in virt-manager and suddenly windows could see all 12 cores I had assigned it. </p> <p>It turns out that virt-manager defaults to exposing each core as a separate socket, and the consumer versions of windows are limited to only using 2 cpu sockets. Now Half-Life: Alyx runs flawlessly.</p>",

However, my biggest hold on to windows is nexus mods and vortex for the various fallout games, Skyrim, and oblivion. What is definitively, the simplest and most stable way to mod these games in Linux mint? I\u2019ve seen that mod organizer 2 can be used here and that\u2019s what I\u2019m leaning towards, but wanted to hear some input from the community! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Frogsnakcs\"> /u/Frogsnakcs </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ncaf5x/best_way_to_mod_fallout_and_skyrim/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ncaf5x/best_way_to_mod_fallout_and_skyrim/\">[comments]</a></span>",
