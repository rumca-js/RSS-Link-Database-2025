        "description": "Flathead catfish are rapidly reshaping the Susquehanna River\u2019s ecosystem. Once introduced, these voracious predators climbed to the top of the food chain, forcing native fish like channel catfish and bass to shift diets and habitats. Using stable isotope analysis, researchers uncovered how the invaders disrupt food webs, broaden dietary overlaps, and destabilize energy flow across the river system. The findings show how a single invasive species can spark cascading ecological consequences.",

A Rutgers-led study reveals that these apes balance protein intake and adjust their activity to match food availability, avoiding obesity and metabolic disease. Unlike humans, who often overeat processed foods without adjusting energy use, orangutans switch between fruits, leaves, and even stored body fat depending on the season. Their ability to maintain protein levels and conserve energy during scarcity offers insights not only into their survival but also into healthier dietary habits for people.",
