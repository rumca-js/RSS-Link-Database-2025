We built our own at Cloudkitchens, it is based on an in-house built sharder and CRDB. It also features a neat solution to head-of-the-line blocking by keeping track of consumption per key, which we call the Keyed Event Queue, or KEQ. Think it is like Kafka, with pretty much unlimited number of partitions. We have been running it in production for mission-critical workloads for almost five years, so it is reasonably battle-proven. </p> <p>It makes development of event-driven systems that require a true Active-Active multiregional topology relatively easy, and I can see how it can evolve to be even more reliable and cost efficient. </p> <p>We talked internally about open-sourcing it, but as it is coupled with our internal libraries, it will require some work to get done. Do you think anyone outside will benefit/use a system like that? The team would love your feedback. </p> </div><!-",

The technical idea is simple but important: you can seal a secret message with a random key, publish only the commitment, and later verify it by revealing the message and key. This avoids SHA-256 length-extension pitfalls by using HMAC with a domain-separation tag.</p> <p>The reason I shared it is that commitment schemes are often discussed in cryptography theory, but practical minimal code examples are harder to find.

The move from RxJS to signals is a huge shift, but it feels like a lot of developers (even seasoned seniors) are getting left behind. We constantly see the same struggles on our end:</p> <ul> <li>&quot;What&#39;s the right way to manage state now?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;How do I even start migrating old code?&quot;</li> <li>&quot;Should I use a signal or an observable here?&quot;</li> </ul> <p>Outdated tutorials and conflicting advice are making the modern workflow an absolute mess to figure out for everyone.</p> <p>So we made a <strong>workshop</strong> to cut the crap and get straight to what matters. This isn&#39;t some boring lecture; it&#39;s a legit, hands-on session where we tackle these problems head-on. The highlight?

Obviously this depends on the system itself so for the sake of argument let&#39;s assume Financial systems (because they are naturally event sourced i.e. all state changes need to be tracked.). We argued for a long time but his main argument is that it was just too hard for developers to get their head around event sourcing because they are conditioned to build CRUD systems, as an example.</p> <p>It was hard for me to argue back that it&#39;s easier to do event sourcing (.e.g. building new features usually means just another projection) but I am likely biased from my 7 years of event sourcing experience. So here I am looking for more opinions.</p> <p>Do you do Event Sourcing? Why/Why not? Do you find that it involves more effort/harder to do or harder to get started?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",

I&#39;m proud to say that the user interface is functional despite not being particularly ostentatious.Any comments, ideas, or even just your opinion on the concept would be greatly appreciated.
