And another that I host that offers several paid plans for people who do not have the skills to use the local version. I noticed that this type of site often has a lot of ads.

But imo this improves the UX of a mobile browser so much, especially for 1-hand operation. Switching tab is one of the most frequent actions you do, and this feature makes it 10 times easier.</p> <p>Chrome is definitely the browser that implements it the best (thankfully Google still gets this one right at least). Other than that, the only browser I&#39;m aware of that does it is Quetta. Unfortunately, Quetta&#39;s implementation is very bad. The animation looks so janky it is almost unusable.

If you haven\u2019t tried it yet, I really recommend giving it a shot\u2014it honestly changed the way I browsed.</p> <p>The thing is, I don\u2019t use a Mac anymore. Now I\u2019m on Windows and Ubuntu, and I need to find a new browser. Some of you who are more into the browser world might be wondering: <em>\u201cWhy not just use Arc on Windows?\u201d</em> Well, that\u2019s exactly why I\u2019m writing this post\u2014because in my experience, Arc on Windows just doesn\u2019t feel anywhere near as good as it does on Mac. Many features aren\u2019t fully implemented yet or work differently, and there\u2019s no Linux version at all.</p> <p>Personally, I really love Arc\u2019s <strong>side tab</strong>, the <strong>split tabs</strong>, and that little <strong>tidy-up button</strong>\u2014not to mention how beautiful the overall design looks.</p> <p>So, what do you all think?
