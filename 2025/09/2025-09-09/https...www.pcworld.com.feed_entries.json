You might just be better off snagging this Bosgame E2 mini PC, which is a great daily driver PC for home offices that balances performance with price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPY5Z2D2/\">Bosgame E2 is only $169.99 on Amazon</a> (was $239.99), a significant 29% discount that brings it down to almost impulse-buy levels of affordability.
