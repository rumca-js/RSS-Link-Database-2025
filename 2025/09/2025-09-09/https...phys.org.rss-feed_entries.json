A new study published in Antiquity provides the first direct evidence that brown bears were used in the gladiatorial arena, giving us a grim look at the brutal treatment they endured.",

Among these, the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a dominant intraseasonal climate signal, characterized by large clusters of clouds and rainfall that slowly move eastward across the warm tropical oceans. In doing so, the MJO shapes rainfall patterns, influences tropical cyclones, modulates monsoons, and even impacts weather far beyond the tropics. Understanding the factors that govern its speed and intensity is therefore essential for improving subseasonal to seasonal climate forecasts.",
