        "description": "Israel's military has ordered \"all residents\" of Gaza City to evacuate ahead of a new offensive, after Israel warned it would step up its military attacks in the strip if Hamas does not free the last hostages it holds.\n \nThe order follows comments from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, ordering Palestinians to \"get out of there\". Netanyahu issued a statement saying it was \u201conly the beginning of the main, intensive operation\u201d alluding to a ground incursion into Gaza City.\n\nPalestinians say \u201cthere\u2019s no place left\u201d and the UN says nowhere in Gaza can be considered as \u201csafe\u201d.\n\nThe Israeli government does not allow international news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza to report freely.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#Israel #Gaza #BBCNews",

        "description": "Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned after anti-corruption protests in the country left 19 people dead.\n \nProtesters have set fire to the home of an ex-PM and vandalised the homes of several leaders.\n \nThe nationwide protests erupted on Monday, ostensibly over a social media ban that the government has since reversed. While the current protests have taken aim at the social media ban they're also channeling a much wider, deeper dissatisfaction with the country's authorities and \u201cnepo kids\u201d.\n \nThe children of wealthy politicians and powerful figures \u2013 apparent beneficiaries of nepotism \u2013 are being widely condemned, with protesters accusing them of flaunting their luxury possessions, expensive vacations and overall lavish lifestyles on social media.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#Nepal #SocialMedia #BBCNews",
