This year, we&#39;re getting the Watch Series 11, Watch SE 3 and Watch Ultra 3, and each of them have some interesting features. At a hands-on session here at Apple Park, I spent some time with the devices, and believe the most intriguing is the Series 11.</p>\n<p>At first glance, the Series 11 is no different from the Series 10 I wore to the event. They&#39;re the same thinness and have pretty much the same dimensions, and the main change is that the new smartwatch has an IonX glass covering that&#39;s a bit more scratch resistant. There&#39;s also a new space grey case option that looked nice, though I was a bigger fan of the rose gold band and case pairing. I especially like the loop band that was on the unit I checked out.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>I put the Serie",
