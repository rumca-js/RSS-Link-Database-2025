Even just a black screen if you want peace.</p> <p>The idea hit me after watching the younger kids in my family get absolutely spammed (and kinda brainwashed) by adverts. Figured there\u2019s gotta be a way to stop it.

This move, influenced by far-right activist Laura Loomer, targets India&#39;s $250 billion IT sector, potentially affecting millions of jobs and straining U.S.-India trade relations amid broader tensions over tariffs and alliances.
