Use code UNDECIDED at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: http://incogni.com/undecided What if I told you there's a way to get up to 30% more power from the same solar panel footprint? No breakthrough chemistry. No quantum physics. Just one simple change that\u2019s finally starting to catch on. They're finally putting solar cells on both sides of the panel. And now one company has achieved something remarkable: the back of their panels is 91.7% as efficient as the front. But here's why this is actually huge news: they've done it with cheaper technology that was supposed to be inferior. So what's actually going on here? And why does the back of a solar panel matter so much?\n\nWatch How CATL Made Batteries 90% Cheaper (And What Happens Next) https://youtu.be/Wf84NJSiAeU?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/how-this-bifacial-solar-",
