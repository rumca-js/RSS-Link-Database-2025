This vulnerability (patched in late July 2025 and exploited in the wild) allows arbitrary file writes on the victim\u2019s filesystem simply by opening or extracting a malicious RAR archive.</p> <p>The series covers manual hex editor analysis of a malicious sample captured in the wild, building a working Python exploit from scratch, crafting custom file and service headers and using alternate data streams with path traversal to finalize the PoC.</p> <p>All videos are narrated in Italian, but include <strong>English subtitles</strong>. The plan going forward is to produce videos <strong>entirely in English</strong>, but before that I\u2019d like to understand if this walkthrough format is something people enjoy, or if a more concise and streamlined style would be preferable.</p> <p>Feedback from the community is super welcome.</p> <p>Here are the links:</p> <ul> <li",

I\u2019ve seen the Cyber Security EXPO in London coming up and was wondering if anyone here has been before.</p> <p>Is it worthwhile for someone new to the industry who\u2019s still trying to get their foot in the door, or is it more geared toward experienced professionals who are already established? I know it&#39;s not going to be anything close to the RSA Conference or Def Con in the US. I think this is the best the UK has in comparison, unless I&#39;m mistaken. </p> <p>If you\u2019ve attended, would you recommend it for someone at the start of the journey and looking for work, or is it better to wait until I\u2019ve got more experience?</p> <p>I\u2019m keen to immerse myself in the industry, but I\u2019ve also noticed that some events can feel more like they\u2019re exploiting newcomers rather than genuinely fostering networking and community-building.
