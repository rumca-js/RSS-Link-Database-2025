        "description": "As the current political administration continues to lie, obfuscating wherever possible about the severity, contradictions and hypocrisy of the Epstein file release scenario... a once disputed letter has now been subpeonad, which radically changes the current narrative.\n\nOn top of a statement by the Speaker of the House (Mike Johnson) that Trump was somehow an FBI \"informant\"... the shifting sands of the Epstein  coverup have gone through so many evolutionary stages... it is now practically unrecognizable. \n\nFrom initial calls for transparency, to outright political theater and narrative dodging... what we see is an administration in full coverup mode, failing at every turn to either diffuse the situation, or distance themselves. Nothing they say at this point can be trusted. \n\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/suppo",
