This AI-driven boom has been so significant that IT investments accounted for all of America\u2019s GDP growth in the first half of the year, and a third of Western venture capital funding has poured into AI firms.

Now here&#39;s my idea, use ai to grab ANY VIDEO OR CONTENT and randomize and or edit over it enough just to wear you can post for free without violating laws such as how people are doing it do today, or do it yourself. Find a video and record yourself giving reactions to it overtop the video. NOW give permission of your videos and content you created to be used freely and make the content open to public for anyone can monitoztize off it. Then you command AI or simply take whatever you just essentially duplicated and repost it, but this time since the content, you essential made, has no copyright law protecting it you can monitize and post freely with ads where ever you want. Am I wrong or is it just so obvious and ridiculous that no one has tried it yet?</p> </div>",
