There seems something telling about the timing. It happened on the heels of 1990\u2019s Sound+Vision tour, when Bowie grandly announced he was performing his hits live for the final time \u2013 a resolution that lasted all of two years. It also followed the bumpy saga of Tin Machine, the short-lived hard rock band that Bowie insisted he was simply a member of, rather than the star attraction, and whose work has thus far escaped the extensive campaign of posthumous archival Bowie releases. These include more than 25 albums and box sets in the nine years since his death, with another \u2013 the 18-piece collection <a href=\"https://www.davidbowie.com/blog/2025/7/8/david-bowie-6-i-cant-give-everything-away-2002-2016-press-release",

There are other side projects as well, musical and music-adjacent \u2013 the occasional bit of barbering with an old friend from Leicester with whom he co-owns a salon, and DJing on BBC Radio Leicester.</p><p>Clearly the man has a strong work ethic despite a hard partying image and songs about getting high. A few of his colleagues and employees dare to suggest that he can be a bit of hard taskmaster with a combustible temper.
