I reused an old laptop of mine as a server and I store all my data on there.</p> <p>As I don&#39;t have any room for adding an extra SATA disk in the laptop, I have no other option than to use USB.

However, in one of the images you can see that the drive does not sit perfectly in the bay and has a bit of wiggle room. My concern is that this can cause vibrations that would slowly corrupt the drive over a long period of use.
