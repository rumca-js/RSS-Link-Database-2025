        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media have finally taken notice of the brutal killing of a white woman by a black man in Charlotte. But to them, the real outrage is that conservatives are upset about it. Also, there's a growing movement to abolish property taxes. And yet a shocking number of tax paying Americans seem to be opposed to the idea. And Rand Paul cites the book \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" in an effort to explain why we shouldn\u2019t blow up drug cartel boats. There are a bunch of reasons why that argument isn\u2019t compelling, starting with the fact that the book, despite being force-fed to every American child for decades, isn't very good.\n\nEp.1654\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://x.com/cimmerian_v/status/1964707149373915605\nhttps://x.com/MiddleearthMixr/status/1964681979561164854\nhttps://x.com/PannonianMantis/status/1965055546593337486\nhttps://imgur.com/a/S2VPAd3\nhttps://imgur.com/a/XKD6gaX\nhttps://imgur.com/a/j78ulzY\nhttps://imgur.com/a/YBXk7Qq\nhttps://x.com/MediasLies/status/196524174600820761",
