I got the Fire &amp; Blood since I saw it was just like 12 dollars. It being a game of thrones prequel piqued my interest. However, shortly after reading a few chapters, itt seemed more like a collection of historical accounts more than an actual story. Didn&#39;t help that I&#39;ve never read or watched game of thrones. Definitely, a blunder on my part. </p> <p>Now I am looking for new suggestions. When I was in high school I really loved the percy jackson series as well as the heroes of olympus stories.

I&#39;ve been in an audiobook mood but most of my books on audible are less than 60 hours, which kind of bums me out, cause I love long audiobooks. I already read the Stormlight Archive and The Count of Monte Cristo and loved them both, now I&#39;m looking for something around that length. Ideally fiction but nonfiction is fine too as long as it&#39;s an extremely well researched book and not misinformed slop. I have no triggers and I&#39;m open to all genres.
