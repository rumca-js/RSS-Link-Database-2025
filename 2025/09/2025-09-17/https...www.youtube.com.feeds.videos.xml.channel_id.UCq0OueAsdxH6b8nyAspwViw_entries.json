        "description": "How do you take a show beloved in living rooms worldwide and turn it into a movie event? In this episode of Seen on the Screen, Jacqueline Coley sits down with Laila Lockhart Kraner, the star of Gabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie, to talk about the leap from small screen to DreamWorks\u2019 first live-action/animation hybrid feature.\n\nLaila shares the story of growing up alongside Gabby, from her cat-filled audition at age ten to leading a film that brings the dollhouse to theaters for the first time. She opens up about acting opposite comedy icon Kristen Wiig and music legend Gloria Estefan, and why the movie\u2019s interactive, sing-and-dance moments demand to be experienced in a packed theater. We also hear about Laila\u2019s cinephile side\u2014from comfort rewatches like The Croods and Napoleon Dynamite to classics like Roman Holiday\u2014and how those films have shaped her own love of storytelling.\n\nFollow and listen to Seen on the Screen with Jacqueline Coley wherever you listen to podcasts \ud83c\udfa7\n\u00b7 Apple Podcast",
