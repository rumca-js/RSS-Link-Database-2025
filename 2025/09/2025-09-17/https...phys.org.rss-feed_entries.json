        "description": "Tiny tweaks in DNA folding can have big effects. A study from Ume\u00e5 University shows that even the most subtle changes in DNA's shape have an important influence on gene activity and energy production. This discovery challenges the view of DNA as passive storage of information and points to its active role in cell behavior, offering new possibilities for understanding diseases like cancer and diabetes.",
