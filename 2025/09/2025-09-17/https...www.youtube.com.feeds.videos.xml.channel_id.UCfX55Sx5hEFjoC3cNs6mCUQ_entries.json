A lightweight alternative may be found in protection keys (pkeys), a hardware mechanism that provides a per-thread and easily switchable view of memory. While pkeys are currently available to userspace on supported architectures, their potential for enhancing kernel security remains unused.\n\nThis talk demonstrates how pkeys can be leveraged within the kernel to protect critical data structures, such as page tables and credentials.
