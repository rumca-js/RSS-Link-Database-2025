I get that it is for tracking and it is unique to each user. But I want to know if they use my name, location, cookies, or something like that to create these strings (and associate it with each user)?</p> <p>Usually there is a string of length 16 32 or 64. There doesn&#39;t seem to be a lot of info about the different types of tracking URLs out there, or at least I have not been looking in the right direction, on what they are (or even how to create one myself) exactly. There are a lot of variations from using m=, u=, C=, qs=, etc</p> <p>Example: &lt;WebsiteDOTcom/.../&lt;something&gt;.html?<strong>m=&lt;16 length string&gt;&amp;u=&lt;16 length string&gt;</strong></p> <p><strong>-</strong",
