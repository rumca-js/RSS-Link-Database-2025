I get 65% frame drop in 360p in Youtube, whereas chromium has 0% frame dropped in 720p (!). After researching the issue (including on Reddit), I tried many things, such has turning off hardware optimisation, and installing H264ify. Apart from useless AI summary telling to check CPU usage, thermal throttling, or upgrade to the latest version (none of these are relevant for me), I am surprised I only find complains about Firefox for RPI3 and RPI4.

It looks like it <em>should</em> but the square bit of metal stops it from sitting snugly into the stock Pi Zero case. I&#39;ve been hunting around the Internet to find a solution - either a completely new case for the Zero + Module 3 or just a lid that fits the stock case that can accommodate all of the Camera module 3.
