        "description": "We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Thirty-Eight! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\nIn the DNA of Tabletop Gamers there are two divergent genetic lines that often butt heads; those that believe Orcs are the coolest and those that believe Dwarfs are the coolest. These gamers can often be found scrapping, drinking and throwing things at each other. This game was clearly written by the latter, for the latter. Let's dive in!\n\nCheck out the Rulebook HERE: https://www.wargamevault.com/product/476035/Torch--Shield?affiliate_id=210041",
