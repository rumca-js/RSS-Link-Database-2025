        "description": "What makes some people supercommunicators? How can you become one too? This is the central lesson in Charles Duhigg\u2019s bestseller Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret of Communication. Charles and Chris dissect what makes messy conversations so great, how to ask deep questions, and whether women and men communicate differently. They also discuss the different rules for different technologies \u2014 from telephones to Facebook to Signal \u2014 and how cautious politeness may be the best method to communicate effectively online.\n\nFollow\nHost: Chris Duffy (Instagram: @chrisiduffy | chrisduffycomedy.com)\nGuest: Charles Duhigg (Instagram: @charlesduhigg | LinkedIn: @charlesduhigg | Website: https://charlesduhigg.com/) \n\nLinks\nSupercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection\nThe Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business\n\nSubscribe to TED \nInstagram: @ted\nYouTube: @TED\nTikTok: @tedtoks\nLinkedIn: @ted-conferences\nWebsite: ted.com\nPodcasts: ted.com/podcasts\n\nJoi",
