        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I really don&#39;t like trying to figure out timescales in books; because its difficult to figure out where humanity and the world was like in the past. Or that creatures could live thousands of years and still be considered children even if they age very slowly. Or that there could be hundreds of generations of those same people. But I don&#39;t know why I like the time scale in HWFWM. It gives an unbelievable timeline of the multiverse but there are two lines I like that show the length of it. I&#39;ll paraphrase them &quot;we great astral beings count the seconds in the dying of universes&quot; and &quot;in the length of the multiverse the time we&#39;ve been freed is only two weeks.&quot; I was curious so I looked up the number of seconds in two weeks, it&#39;s about 2.21 million. I dont know why but I like how time in this universe is described.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TavonLee\"> /u/T",
