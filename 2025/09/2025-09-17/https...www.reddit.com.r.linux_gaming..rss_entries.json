But I also hate Linux, mainly because it is not as stable for gaming as windows is.</p> <p>Due to this, I dual boot with separate drives. Sometimes, after a long day, I just want to game and not deal with various Linux issues I face, so I switched to Windows which I have de-bloated, de-microsfted as much as possible and it is a very smooth experience for gaming. </p> <p>The question though from the title. My windows drive is not large enough to have all the games I regularly play installed. It really only has enough space for windows exclusive games (someone tell me to stop playing League....)I would really like it to have all the games I regularly play on Linux but don&#39;t have the space. Is it possible to have a 3rd drive as a Steam Library that both Linux and Windows can access?</p> <p>If it matters, I currently run CachyOS but I am not married to that distro and can switch if need be. </p> </div><!",

YouTube videos slow down to 2-3 fps, window arrangement is slow, keyboard input has a lot of lag... like, everything has lag and low fps. Then, I change the tab to Library or Store and lag is gone.

The problem I have is gaming performance. For example Control or Witcher3: in windows I had a very steady framerate (I usually locked it to 60fps) and high to medium settings otherwise. However now I&#39;m lucky if I ever get around to 40fps and all the details are blurry and there&#39;s a lot of tear. It almost looks like the settings were much lower. </p> <p>I was hoping to completely switch to linux when win10 EOL comes around and perhaps get a new rig. However, this situation doesn&#39;t encourage me to buy ~1500\u20ac rig and then get this kind of performance.

The game runs consistently slow and it&#39;s making it borderline unplayable, even when I set all the graphics settings to the lowest possible options.

Although the playtest will only be available as a sandbox without specific gameplay, a tremendous amount of effort was put into this build because the game doesn&#39;t use any major commercial engines.</p> <p>Personally, I&#39;m very interested in seeing how products evolve from a mess into something compelling. Perhaps you would find this interesting as well? The thing is, the old builds were made exclusively for Linux for internal use. They weren&#39;t daily builds but rather specific releases with huge changelogs. There are only four of them, so it wouldn&#39;t be a problem to go through each one.</p> <p>So, if you&#39;re interested, I&#39;d be happy to publish them and hear your thoughts.

I got everything to work, but I have one minor issue. Every time I close a game, remote play closes because I get a &quot;allow remote interaction?&quot; window pops up. And sometimes it will pop up multiple times before I can actually get a game loaded. Is there any way to disable this? Or at least disable it for steam? Or even just to ask it once when I first open steam/start remote play? </p> <p>From what I have found, this is just how it is, but I haven&#39;t had people asking this exact question. It was more how steam handles certain controllers when remote access isnt actually being used. This is when I <em>am</em> using remote access, but it interrupts mid session to ask again if I want to allow remote interactions. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mklinger23\"> /u/mklinger23 </a> <br/> <spa",
