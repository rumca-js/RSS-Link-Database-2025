Each legend is unique in their abilities (Ultimate and Tactical) and, of course, their Feat cards. Each legend has a deck of cards, which once played, they&#39;re gone from the game. That really adds to the weight of them, and timing is everything. Next time, we&#39;re doing a 3v3 game, which is going to be &quot;legendary&quot;.</p> <p>Have you managed to play this yet and who is your favourite legend? It&#39;s really surprised me (JP) how much I enjoy it as it&#39;s not my style of game at all but the way they&#39;ve managed to work this is a lot of fun.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Whose-turn-is-it-Pod\"> /u/Whose-turn-is-it-Pod </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1nj5snk/apex_legends_the_board_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span",

They said that it was used in all their designs but said designs were finished by real artists but the art looks like the most generic AI prompts I\u2019ve ever seen. I think AI is fine if you\u2019re using it to conceptualize ideas but it shouldn\u2019t be used for the final product.</p> <p>Moreover, this company seems to run every single bad practice a crowdfunding campaign could have. Freebies for FIRST DAY BACKERS only? Stripping a large amount of the content to be resold as expansions? </p> <p>Seems like a bunch of people are calling them out in the comment section but it is still raising a decent amounts of funds.

I hate failing forward. I hate feeling like I missed something because of failing. Whether it be a reward, an ally, or anything of the sort. In this game, it just costs you a bit of your resources when you do an action. You always have enough dice to roll. You never feel out that you missed out on something because you didn\u2019t manage dice pool well enough. </p> <p>There are tons of ways to mitigate bad rolls and you even get back some resources every once in a while, which is a nice little surprise when it does happen. </p> <p>Even though you\u2019re only allowed one action at each location (unless it says you can continue picking actions), it never feels like you made the wrong choice.
