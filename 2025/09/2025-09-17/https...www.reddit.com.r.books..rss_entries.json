The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov</strong></p> <p>I first read this book in my early twenties after it was recommended to me by a coworker from Moldova. There are so many layers, and much lost in translation as a result of the language (Russian) and the times (Stalin Era Soviet Union). As I get older, and learn more, each reading provides new understanding and a deeper appreciation of the work. </p> <p><strong>2. Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut</strong></p> <p>Its hard to choose one KV title since I have reread nearly all of them, but this story is my favorite. Vonnegut has always been a bit of a mystery to me, too, in that the more depressing his storylines get, oddly I seem to get happier.</p> <p><strong>3. The Stranger by Albert Camus</strong></p> <p>It&#39;s a quick read by a favorite author.</p> <p><strong>4. Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson</strong></p> <p>I love the smell of the lang",
