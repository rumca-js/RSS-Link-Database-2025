People more familiar or even just generally smarter will use the tool in a smarter way, increasing knowledge, skill, etc, creating increasingly large gaps in terms of the elite users and average users. This has been thought about and is called \u201cThe Great Divergence\u201d, and shows how AI is actually a skill multiplier more than a tool that levels the playing field. </p> <p>Now take this and apply it to corporate American and the world economy.
