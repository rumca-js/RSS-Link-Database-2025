I&#39;ve been using Nord Meshnet for 3 years to access mkv videos from my home computer remotely via Windows network fileshare. I play them through a file management app on my phone that points the network stream to a video player (I do not want to use plex or anything similar because they try to hardcode the subtitle files). With Nord phasing out Meshnet, I would like to set up, if possible, a completely self hosted replacement for the Nord Meshnet only using my home computer, I would love to avoid using a VPS, and still be able to access from outside my home network. I have tried Tailscale and Zerotier but the file transfer rate is not fast enough for some odd reason (although it worked perfectly with nord.)</p> <p>Please no rude comments I am completely beginner and have no idea what I&#39;m doing.

I basically have everything I think I *need* setup, but I still want to tinker. So I was testing out some wiki options (wikijs, docmost, and then bookstack). And that is all fine, but then I added bookstack and it broke my Owncloud db. I *thought* I was keeping things separate. I ended up compose down the bookstack and Owncloud then compose up and it came back, but I am not understanding why the bookstack container was stepping on Owncloud. I have tried to look into it, but everything I was reading is that with separate containers it shouldn&#39;t be a problem. In any case, my compose.yml files are below. Can someone explain why bookstack was messing with my Owncloud db?</p> <p>The both have a mariadb service, but aren&#39;t they separated by container? Or should I have named them &quot;mariadb_owncloud&quot; and the &quot;mariadb_bookstack&quot;?</p> <p>In any case, I don&#39;t w",
