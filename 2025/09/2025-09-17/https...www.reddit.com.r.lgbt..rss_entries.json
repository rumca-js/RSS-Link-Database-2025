So my friend and I went to a gay club, dressed in a way that very much printed as... friends of Dorothy. Afterwards we were walking through campus to go get cookies. For further context, we were crossfaded (drunk and high) and having a very nice time haha. So everything happening was already very funny.</p> <p>While we were walking, this big ol&#39; white truck drives by us.

It literally just says don&#39;t do the sexual act with someone the same sex as you because it wasn&#39;t understood as a sexuality by practically everyone back then and often associated with people who practiced prostitution and rape. To Biblical people, the term and meaning of &#39;gay&#39; would have been almost completely alien.</p> <p>Regarding trans people, it is certainly not a sin to be trans. All it says is that God created them &quot;male and female&quot;, and when He says this, He is talking about mankind in the general biological cis sense, not that people should never change their sex. And God condemning men to wear &quot;women&#39;s clothing&quot; was designed to protect them from rape, not because He wants them to follow a strict belief of not dressing however you please.</p> <p>Screw what the media tells you, there ",

I was honestly worried she might be having a heat stroke, so I was paying attention in case she needed help.</p> <p>Then it turned uncomfortable fast. While pointing toward me, she accidentally flashed me. I wasn\u2019t even looking at her at that point because the number one rule on these busses is to avoid staring; even if the person looks like they need help.

I am just wanting other opinions and want to know how others would feel in this situation. </p> <p>Background: My wife and I have already been married for multiple years and are now finally having our wedding ceremony. It&#39;s more like a giant party with friends and family. We are getting to the final couple of weeks and doing our final counts of attendees. One of my wife&#39;s best friend since middle school just changed her mind about not being able to come to the wedding. We are having a friend&#39;s party the night before and she said she can come to that but not the wedding. The reason for the sudden change is because she &quot;doesn&#39;t know if she can support gay marriage&quot;. She is very culturally catholic and a very devout catholic. </p> <p>My issues are that she has been one of my wife&#39;s best friends since middle school.
