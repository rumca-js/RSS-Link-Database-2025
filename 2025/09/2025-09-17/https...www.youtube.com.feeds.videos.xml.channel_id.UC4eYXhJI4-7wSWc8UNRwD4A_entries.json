        "description": "This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.\n\nLars Gotrich | September 17, 2025\nLuiza Brina has emerged as a tender and idiosyncratic voice of Brazil, with transcendental music as quiet as it is cosmic. At the Tiny Desk, she presents a searching set of ora\u00e7\u00f5es that serve as meditations, no matter your spiritual journey.\n\nA little over a decade ago, Brina suffered panic attacks and, as a way to re-center herself, began to write a series of prayers despite not having any religious background. Prayers for comings and goings, hopes and dreams, a world falling apart. This practice formed the basis of Prece, one of NPR Music's best albums of 2024, where psychedelic symphonies commune with the sacred. That she comes from the southeastern state of Minas Gerais \u2014 home to Milton Nascimento and L\u00f4 Borges \u2014 speaks to the lineage of soul seekers that she inherits. Inspired by M\u00fasica popular brasileira and artists from the late '60",
