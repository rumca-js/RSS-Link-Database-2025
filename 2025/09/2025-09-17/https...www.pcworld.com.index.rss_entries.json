But today, Acer is offering a refurbished model\u2014by way of eBay\u2014with an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/276288732267\">for just $393.99</a>. That\u2019s over $300 off its retail price!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acer Aspire Vero is pretty typical for a budget-to-mid-range design, omitting such niceties as a touchscreen or a face-scanning webcam. But with a 13th-gen 10-core Intel processor, 16GB of DDR5 RAM (the minimum I would recommend for Windows 11), and 512GB of storage, it\u2019s got more than enough juice to power through standard student and office tasks. You can upgrade that RAM and storage fairly easily, by the way, which is great to see. With integrated Iris Xe graphics, ",

Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help safeguard your data and keep intrusive trackers at bay. Plus, they allow you to get around region blocks on streaming services and avoid ISP throttling. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense might not be an option. That\u2019s where a free VPN can come in handy, providing you with much needed security for no cost at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I advise that you opt for a premium VPN, such as those in our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best VPNs</a>, I understand that sometimes ",
