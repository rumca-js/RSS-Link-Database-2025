However, I&#39;ve recently been trying to spin up a dev container and run into a bit of a brick wall. </p> <p>As this is Vscodium the dev-containers plugin is out as that&#39;s propriety to microsoft and therefore only available to VsCode users. No bother, containers tools is open source and podman and pod-manager are open source. However, due to the isolation of the flatpak all the tutorials I can find then use vscode&#39;s remote development plugin, which is again a proprietry Vscode exclusive, to connect to the container. </p> <p>Is there an open source alternative I can sub in for the &quot;remote development&quot; plugin or some other way I make dev containers work on the vscodium flatpak.</p> <p>Thanks,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pioneer_11\"> /u/Pioneer_11 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www",

MariaDB introduced the Business Source Licence (BSL) in 2016; MongoDB, Confluent and Redis Labs followed; and HashiCorp switched Terraform to a non-compete licence. The justification is almost always the same: as these companies grow, the financial upside of being fully open diminishes, so they try to cut off \u201cfreeloaders\u201d and capture more value. But the backlash is real: users and competitors fork projects and publish manifestos warning that licence switches create legal risk.</p> <p>Red Hat\u2019s decision to remove public access to RHEL source code has hit a similar nerve. SUSE\u2019s Dr. Thomas Di Giacomo notes that RHEL exists only because of upstream projects like the Linux kernel, and Red Hat\u2019s move has caused \u201csignificant concern within the open source community.\u201d He argues that the freedom to access, modify and ",
