I'm not mad at it - I adore it. But who would have predicted such a simple-looking and simple-playing thing would inspire such a following? A game in which all you do is move an auto-attacking character around while avoiding the swarms of enemies chasing after you. A game about choosing the right upgrades. It became an obsession! So the copycats and variations followed. But their job was harder: they couldn't simply recreate it. This brings us to Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, released in 1.0 today, a variation on the theme. And I'm pleased to say it's marvellous.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/your-new-vampire-survivors-obsession-is-deep-rock-galactic-survivor-and-its-a-feast-of-a-game\">Read more</a></p>",

But slowly, it slips on a new face, and by the time things wrapped up several hours later in a smog of suffocating hopelessness and a smear of blood and bone, I was genuinely a little shellshocked by it all.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/quirky-horror-with-a-timely-story-hidden-beneath-indie-gem-no-im-not-a-human-might-be-one-of-my-favourite-games-this-year\">Read more</a></p>",
