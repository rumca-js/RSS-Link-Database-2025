Linus and Luke break down why this kind of patent could be problematic for the industry, how it differs from trademarks, and whether there\u2019s any universe where this could benefit consumers.\n\nWatch the full WAN Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcIbqUHzx7M\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners",
