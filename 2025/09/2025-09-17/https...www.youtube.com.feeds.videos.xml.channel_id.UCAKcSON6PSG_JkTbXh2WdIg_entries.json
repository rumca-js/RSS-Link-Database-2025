        "description": "Toronto band The Beaches are becoming well known to The Current\u2019s audience by virtue of their irresistibly catchy new single, \u201cBlame Brett,\u201d from their latest album \"Blame My Ex.\"\n\nThe lead single, \u201cBlame Brett,\u201d was actually inspired by The Beaches' Jordan Miller\u2019s breakup, but ended softly enough that she asked her former boyfriend, Brett Emmons of Canadian rock band The Glorious Sons, if she could use his name in the lyrics because the alliteration just worked so well. \u201cHe gave me his consent and his blessing,\u201d Jordan Miller told the CBC in a September 2023 interview.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the song isn\u2019t really about Brett; rather, it\u2019s about her own feelings of still processing after a breakup. \u201cIt was a really sad and devastating time for me,\" Jordan Miller said in the same interview with CBC host Tom Power. \u201cThere still is a little bit of humour in [Blame Brett] with the chorus, but it is really about me just not being over him.\u201d\n\nChatting at The Current ahead of their recent session in",
