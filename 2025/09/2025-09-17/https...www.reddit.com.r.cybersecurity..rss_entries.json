We already have the blocking options in place with three settings available: block everything, block execution, upload and copying of files, or block only file uploads. My preference is to fully block USB usage.</p> <p>With full blocking, a smart exception process is needed. We already built automation using AD groups connected to the ticketing system, which can automatically add or remove users from these groups.</p> <p>Now I am considering the design of the exception process itself and would like to hear about best practices. Options include device-based exceptions, media-specific exceptions (the USB stick itself), or user-based exceptions, possibly in combination. Most likely we will use temporary exceptions such as eight hours, as well as longer ones ",

It\u2019s called <strong>BiDi Swap</strong>, and it abuses how browsers handle bidirectional text (mixing LTR and RTL scripts) to make URLs look legit when they\u2019re not. This kind of trick is perfect for phishing, and it\u2019s surprisingly easy to pull off. We built on older Unicode attacks like:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Punycode homographs</strong> (e.g., <code>&quot;apple.com&quot;</code> with Cyrillic characters)</li> <li><strong>RTL override</strong> (e.g., <code>blaexe.pdf</code> instead of <code>blafdp.exe</code>)</li> </ul> <p>Most browsers still don\u2019t fully catch this. Chrome flags some lookalikes, Firefox highlights domains, and Edge can be inconsistent. We tested a bunch of payloads and found that mixing RTL parameters with LTR domains can confuse the rendering logic.
