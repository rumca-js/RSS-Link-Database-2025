PC/Console: https://playwt.link/bellularwarcraft | Mobile: https://wtm.game/bellularwarcraft Sponsored by War Thunder.\n\nEA prioritized low-end PC performance from day one of Battlefield 6's development, ditching ray-tracing entirely and testing on below-spec hardware - a complete reversal from BF5's graphics-first approach.
