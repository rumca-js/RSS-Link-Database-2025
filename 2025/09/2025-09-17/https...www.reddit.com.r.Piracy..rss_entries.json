So I, like I&#39;m sure many of you frequent pstream. But as of today, I noticed a strange glitch where if I am in fullscreen and the playback bar at the bottom disappears, the subtitles do too. I tested it out and it doesn&#39;t seem to happen when something is playing through Rage, but it is happening through Streambox which I find the majority of things to run through. Is anyone else having this issue? Is there a fix I&#39;m not thinking of?</p> <p>EDIT:<br/> I&#39;ve tried clearing my cache and my cookies, and using external subtitles.

I&#39;m fully on that side now, because the legal options have become completely anti-consumer.</p> <p>We&#39;re living in an age where you don&#39;t own what you buy. Look at the gaming world. We spend $70 on a new game, but we only have a license to play it. We hear about companies like Nintendo potentially banning consoles, which could instantly delete your access to a library of games you paid thousands for. If a company can remotely take away your ability to play a game you &quot;bought,&quot; did you ever truly own it?</p> <p>Then there&#39;s streaming, which is a complete mess.<a href=\"Https://youtu.be/H6Oac6mtytg\">This video explains the situation perfectly</a> and it really hit the nail on the head. Services like Netflix and Hulu are constantly deleting shows and movies from their libraries. My family could be halfway through a series, ",

Not even an offline software like Ultimate Vocal Remover. Every option I have come across that is supposedly &quot;free&quot; is either not free at all and/or requires going through some loops and hoops to even get the basics working, as if they&#39;re expecting you to be on the same tech genius level as the people that first developed those AI tools.</p> <p>And I fear that if companies start integrating their products such as computer programs, games and anime streaming services less offline and more online, use API and paywall them, on top of their advanced technology to completely block people from seeing anything beyond those paywalls, then piracy might get stamped out from the Internet, just like how all opposition would end up once a fascist state fully materializes. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comme",
