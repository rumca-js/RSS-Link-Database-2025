I suffer with real bad anxitey which stops me leaving the house most the time and socialising with people! Even tho I love to socialise the world outside I\u2019m just not a fan of. </p> <p>I\u2019ve read up so much about VR chat rooms and so excited to hopfully make some new friends \ud83e\udd79 my only issue is tho is I\u2019ve read a lot about public rooms being filled with younger kids in them. I\u2019m 31.. so I\u2019d like to make some friends in there older 20\u2019s / 30\u2019s but apparently most people have private rooms so I might struggle? </p> <p>Dose anyone have any private rooms they could suggest for me? Or any kind of rooms to join to meet people around my age?</p> <p>I\u2019m so completely new to this so haven\u2019t even got a clue on how to use the device let alone try and find rooms to connect with people \ud83e\udd23</p> <p>I\u2019m just excited to play games socialise with new people and hopefully have an enjoyable experience !</p> <p>Thank ",
