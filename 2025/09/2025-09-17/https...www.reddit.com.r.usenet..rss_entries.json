For English-only content it works fine, but I mainly need multilingual releases (ITA/ENG).</p> <p>I set up everything correctly in NZBGet and also configured Sonarr/Radarr with preferred languages. However, whenever I try to grab ITA/ENG content, I either get no results or sometimes only FR/ENG.</p> <p>Because of this I ended up going back to torrents (where I have no issues finding the exact ITA/ENG content I need).</p> <p>On top of that, I also noticed that Usenet wasn\u2019t as fast as I expected \u2014 sometimes downloads were even slower than torrents, even though Eweka should have great retention and speed.</p> <p>So I\u2019m wondering:</p> <ul> <li>Am I doing something wrong with my <strong>indexer setup</strong>?</li> <li>Do I need a different indexer that specializes more in multilingual (Italian/English) content?</li> <li>Or is Usenet jus",
