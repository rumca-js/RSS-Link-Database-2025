In my opinion macOS absolutely stands out of the crowd, with best looking, most consistent design. The next is Windows 11, which subjectivly handles UI scaling and rendering better than Linux. The last is Linux, actually Linux Desktop Environments such as Gnome or KDE. Among a number of DE&#39;s only KDE manages scaling properly. But other problems are common, ugly rendering, ugly fonts, ugly color schemes, inconsistency among apps. I dont even know how to name it. Do developers acutally care about aesthetics? Funny thing is that free DE&#39;s could even be more functional than commercial solutions, but they&#39;re just ugly.</p> <p>To be clear: I dont mean ricing, polishing and changing fonts or color schemes.

Slackware, at the time, prided itself on being minimalist and &quot;DIY,\u201d while Linus\u2019 perspective was that Linux should be accessible to the masses. This divide between the &quot;easy to use\u201d crowd and the &quot;power users\u201d is still very much alive today.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing though, Linus Torvalds himself has a more nuanced perspective on accessibility.
