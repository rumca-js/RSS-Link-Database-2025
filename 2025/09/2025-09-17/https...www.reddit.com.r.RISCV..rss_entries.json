I\u2019ve been trying to get privilege-mode filtering of hardware counters working on my Banana Pi-F3.</p> <p>According to the RISC-V Privileged Spec, there are two relevant extensions:</p> <ul> <li><code>Ssmcntrpmf</code>: Cycle/Instret privilege mode filtering (Ch. 7, p. 90)</li> <li><code>Sscofpmf</code>: Count overflow + mode-based filtering (Ch. 20, p. 156)</li> </ul> <p>On my board, <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code> reports that only <code>Sscofpmf</code> is available. That means I can filter hpmcounters by mode, but not cycles/instret, and when doing any attempt it effectively confirms that.</p> <p>My question is: Does the hardware actually implement <code>Ssmcntrpmf</code>, and the software stack just isn\u2019t letting me use it yet? Or is<code>Ssmcntrpmf</code>not supported at all?</p> <p>This would help me know whether to dig deeper into OpenSBI or kernel changes, or to simply accept there is nothing to do about it.</p> <p>Thank you very much!</p> </div",
