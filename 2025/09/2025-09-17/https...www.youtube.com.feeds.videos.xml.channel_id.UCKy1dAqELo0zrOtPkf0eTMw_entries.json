        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nAnother rumor about the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake has been making the rounds on the Internet. According to the latest, Ubisoft will cut all the present-day Abstergo portions of the game, and instead will add in new content featuring Edward Kenway and Marie Read. Fans are upset that Ubisoft might cut any of the original content, but this follows recent trends in the franchise, which focuses heavily on the historical eras of the games. The recent Assassin's Creed Shadows, for example, doesn't feature any present-day gameplay sections at all. In other news, developers for Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 are backtracking some of their DLC plans. Two of the playable vampire factions will originally going to be behind a paywall, but after fan backlash, they will be playable from the start. And finally, RGG Studio may have accidentally leaked that they're working on Yakuza Kiwami 3.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

But when he learns that NoizeQuest, a battle-of-the-bands competition, is coming to his town, he sees a shot at redemption - and maybe even a second chance with Medina.
