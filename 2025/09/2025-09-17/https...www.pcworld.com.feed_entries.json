Then in 2022, Facebook settled a separate class-action lawsuit that sought damages for users affected, agreeing to pay <strong>$725 million to said users</strong> for its improper data sharing with third parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in 2025, that settlement appears to be bearing fruit with users starting to receive payment. Currently, there are only reports from sites such as <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/facebook-settlement-payments-begin-3597892/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Android Authority</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/ArtemR/status/19",
