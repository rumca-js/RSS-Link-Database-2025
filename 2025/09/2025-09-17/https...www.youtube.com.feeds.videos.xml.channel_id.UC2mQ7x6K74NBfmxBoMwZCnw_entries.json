        "description": "Josh and Luka finally crack open the new third edition of the Horus Heresy and immediately do what any sensible hobbyists would do: slam 1500 points of White Scars into 1500 points of Death Guard and see what happens. Luka brings the slow and steady wall of resilience that Mortarion would be proud of, while Josh revs up the go-fast cavalry and tries to prove that speed is indeed a weapon.\n\nBetween Centurions, dreadnoughts, bikers, and plenty of questionable tactical decisions, the lads bumble through their first outing with the updated rules. Expect a mix of genuine learning, rules clarifications mid-battle, and the kind of table banter that usually ends with someone muttering about eternal warrior while another laments dangerous terrain checks. White Scars race headlong into the grinding gears of the Death Guard, and it makes for one heck of a first clash.\n\nMembers to watch the Post Game Show, go here\nYoutube Members - https://youtu.be/NbfTqzOb7hs\nVault Members - \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bhttps://www.m",
