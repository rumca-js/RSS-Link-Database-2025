Used to be about building for the people, now it\u2019s just solo grinds and exit bags. No new tools, no faucets, no support. And if we don\u2019t start planting seeds now, we\u2019re risking digital extinction. CW labels us criminals, but we\u2019re just ahead of the curve \u2014 coders, builders, privacy freaks. Not hiding. Protecting. The real threat is centralization, surveillance, and silence. Forget clout. This is about legacy. What comes next stays off-grid \u2014 no indexing, no noise. Just PGP invites, auth-only access, and trust earned, not given. Not a platform. A protocol. Not a trend. A movement. If you know, you know. If you don\u2019t, you weren\u2019t meant to.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/V01DL0RD_1\"> /u/V01DL0RD_1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1njlxxc/why/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",
