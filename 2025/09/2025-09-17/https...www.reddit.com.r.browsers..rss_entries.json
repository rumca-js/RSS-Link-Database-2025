I really like it (I still prefer Librewolf on my Mac though), but I&#39;m not sure which one is better, per se. I looked at <a href=\"https://privacytests.org\">https://privacytests.org</a> and I found Librewolf doesn&#39;t block referral stuffs; However, it seems to mostly be on par with Brave. I know you guys here are well versed in these stuffs, so if anyone knows or has an opinion on this, thanks!</p> <p>Edit: Rechecked privacytests and saw that Librewolf now blovks referral things.
