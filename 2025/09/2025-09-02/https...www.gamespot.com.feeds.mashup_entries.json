While older games often struggle to be preserved properly due to a myriad of issues--licensing disputes, asset loss, tech limitations and simply being forgotten chief among them--studios like Nightdive have made a concentrated effort to prove that no game is beyond preservation. In the past few years, Nightdive has restored and released new versions of System Shock 2, Star Wars: Dark Forces, and Turok, bringing the beloved classics to modern audiences.

In addition to the price point, the developer also noted that the sequel will go live at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on September 4, so there's no reason to stay up late September 3.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The launch price and release times were detailed over the weekend by Team Cherry <a href=\"https://x.com/teamcherrygames/status/1962330350681735642?s=46&amp;t=KA0eXy1Spm71dnMQdFC23A\">on X</a>. Silksong costing $20 could come as a surprise for some, since it's only $5 more than what Hollow Knight retailed for since arriving in 2017. The <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-is-still-breaking-records-as-silksong-nears/1100-6534386/\">hype for the sequel has led to Hollow Knight breaking Steam concurrent-players records</a>--the metroidvania game saw over 71,000 people on September 1. The price has also been a mystery after it wasn't provided <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knig",

Her biggest takeaways were that the voice acting was phenomenal, the vast array of optimization and accessibility options, the improved visuals that are not polished to an uncanny degree, and it has just enough changes to keep veteran players on their toes while retaining what made the original game a master piece.",

The studios have decided to postpone the upcoming MK sequel until summer 2026.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/mortal-kombat-ii-summer-2026-release-date-1236357393/\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mortal Kombat 2 will now debut in theaters on May 15, 2026. Typically, the beginning of May isn't an ideal space for anything that isn't a big-budget blockbuster. But because Avengers: Doomsday was pushed to December 2026, there's no Marvel movie in the immediate vicinity of Mortal Kombat 2. That may give the sequel a better chance to break out from the pack than next month's crowded October slate would have.</p><p>The Boys' Karl Urban is the most prominent addition to the cast of Mortal Kombat 2 as the fan-favorit",
