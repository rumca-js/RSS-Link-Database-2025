The instrumentals had such a beautiful, flowery, even uplifting sound to them. Yet when you listen to the few lyrics that the song samples, you can tell it is very much a sad song.</p> <p>I&#39;ve listened to a few songs like this now and it&#39;s always a great listening experience hearing beautiful, melodic instrumentals coupled with lyrics that detail sadness, lamentation, regret, etc.</p> <p>Some other songs that I&#39;ve listened to that I would put in this category are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tffzUtPlD4E&amp;list=RDtffzUtPlD4E&amp;start_radio=1\">Mercy Mercy Me by Marvin Gaye</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OCja0WBWYA&amp;list=RD4OCja0WBWYA&amp;start_radio=1\">Caroline, No by The Beach Boys</a>.</p> <p>What are some songs that you guys would put into this category?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",

It accompanies us when we are sad, makes us cheerful when we are happy, increases our motivation, and calms us down.</li> <li>Independent of words and languages, it appeals directly to emotions. It can bring people together, overcoming cultural, racial, and language barriers.</li> <li>It plays a critical role in the construction of individual and social identity.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My favorite song of all time is 1979 by Smashing Pumpkins, but as a whole I don&#39;t really care for them that much at all! I like a few other songs off Melancholy and Gish but I think Billy Corgan has kind of a terrible voice and not much else from their catalog really stands out, especially as much as 1979. That song was pretty popular at the time when it was released but I was starting to get into more punk and was actively caring less about what was on the radio at the time, but in my early 30s kind of rediscovered it and realized how much I loved it. I hear it and it just brings me back to being 15 again even though I didn&#39;t really care for it much at the time! Anyone else have any similar opinions on a song by a particular band?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kinnakattak\"> /u/kinnakattak </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1n65v25/favorite_song_by_a_band_y",
