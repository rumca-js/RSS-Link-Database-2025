I see a lot of them sub 400. Surge protectors can let your device hard shut down which may corrupt data but can have actual surge protection (2k joules and higher)</p> <p>What do you use?

It&#39;s annoying having it just take up space on my desk; the fewer dongles and things I need plugged in and the more I can have built into the computer the better.

Being able to burn up to blu-rays at least (idk if you can burn 4ks) would be nice too, but not a necessity.
