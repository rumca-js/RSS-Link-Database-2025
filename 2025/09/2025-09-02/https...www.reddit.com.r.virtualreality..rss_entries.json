I&#39;m using I think 68% of steam VR&#39;s resolution scale which is around, 2800x2600 or somewhere around there. I know I got a decent rig for VR, Any VR game I&#39;ve thrown at it, it runs smoothly. I&#39;m using fpsVR to check the graphs. the Frame time graph is like going up and down (I would show screenshots but the screen shots I took doesn&#39;t show the fpsvr graph) it&#39;s like a perfectly consistent stuttering graph, and whatever I do I can&#39;t get it to stop. I also tried going into windows advanced settings and changing the process to background process or background programs, the stutters are less but the game just crashes after 5-10 minutes. Does anyone know any tips to help???</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chunkymonke589\"> /u/chu",
