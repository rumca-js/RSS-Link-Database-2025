I can\u2019t say if it was a success or a failure if I don\u2019t know what it set out to achieve. I can say it\u2019s not what I expected, but that could have been on purpose or it could have been just a failure to meet expectations. I don\u2019t know. It was an interesting read, it had beautiful passages, but it was also frustrating as all hell, because I found the narrator painfully unrelatable - but that\u2019s a me problem. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say it failed to rise to the hype of a \u2018dark academia\u2019 staple, because maybe that was never the intent of the author. And after much thought, I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say it failed at representing the study of \u2018the classics\u2019, because maybe that was also not the intent of the author. But as it is, I can\u2019t say what really WAS the author\u2019s intent in this.</p",

He seems like someone you would (aside from his violence) want to befriend. There&#39;s an undeniable allure to him. But given that this book takes place during America&#39;s expansion and given his personal traits, I interpret him to be the personification of America and the Western World; intelligent and alluring, power hungry, morally inept, deceitfully dangerous, seemingly everywhere, nearly impossible to kill....and his slaughtering of babies would imply a killing of the next generation at all costs of success to those in power. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BaconBreath\"> /u/BaconBreath </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1n6vh5v/im_convinced_judge_holde",

When I read him, I feel a little bit inferior, like as if reading a book by someone by a current college professor or someone who would go on to become such a person. It&#39;s hard to describe why I feel that way. Yes, part of it is that he is very smart and his books really show that, especially his later works, though even Dubliners, it&#39;s hard to imagine it&#39;s written by someone who was just a little older than 20. Perhaps he also had a big ego back then. He was always ambitious, that you can tell.</p> <p>Just to compare, I feel different about Tolkien, who was also very intelligent and learned and an actual college professor, but I can see forming a friendship with him. Just sounds kind and down to earth.</p> <p>Anyhow, if i had to pick one person though, to be friends with, it&#",

I&#39;m glad for the read-a-long because it made me accountable even with nutty schedules. And I&#39;m glad I read it. </p> <p>The book is in two parts - part one is facilitating a good death, part two is the good death planner. Now, I think everyone should read this book - whether they&#39;re a caregiver or not. Why? Because death is part of the process and no one gets out of here alive.</p> <p>The first part is something that everyone that&#39;s a caregiver should read. Whether it&#39;s been 10 years or you&#39;re just finding out about what you&#39;re getting into. Why? Bluntly, most caregiving roles end in the death of the person you&#39;re caring for.
