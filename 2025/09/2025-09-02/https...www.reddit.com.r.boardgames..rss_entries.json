As there were 3 of us at the table he was kind enough to explain the rules and basically narrate (ATC) the game for the two of us that had never played it yet. </p> <p>After the first game we decided to reset and try again. And then again.<br/> We ended up rotating around so whoever was ATC got to land the plane on the next game, and so on.<br/> We explored the intern mechanic as well as the fuel mechanic. Very fun and incredibly addictive. We must have played for 2 solid hours, before closing the night with Cabo. </p> <p>When I got home, I offered to show my fianc\u00e9e and again, it was a success and we reset and played it again. </p> <p>Seriously, it&#39;s addictive </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

When we played though it just seemed like it had so many different mechanics that was hard to play together with. I felt a bit overwhelmed on strategy. I just went aggressive and tried to battle a lot and upgrade my ship. In the end I did pretty well I think. First place got 66, I got 59, and third got 55 so I came in second but we were so late the guy who got his fourth achievement we just ended and per the rules I think everyone ends was allowed 1 more turn? I think I could&#39;ve found at least 7 more points. My best turn was third place guy got beat up but dumped 7 coins on his island before the battle. I came right after, destroyed his garrison and put influence down to control the island, loaded his gold and returned to my port. That move kept me in the game. </p> <p>Anyways, what are your thoughts? I want a pirate game but I&#39;m not set on Dead Reckoning yet. Maybe ",

Why is Ripley THE CANONICALLY SOLE SURVIVOR OF THE NOSTROMO the absolute worst solo character? Everyone else has fitting enough abilities that could make for fun solo runs, Dallas gets an extra action, Parker can use an action to get scrap, Lambert can revel the next encounter card and choose to put it on the bottom of the deck, Brett can craft without using an action and for one less scrap. But Ripley\u2019s ability is worthless in solo play, she can use an action to move another player, that\u2019s it. I Feel like they should have switched Dallas and Ripley\u2019s abilities. She is by no means a bad character but when soloing she is disappointing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GrouseRoused\"> /u/GrouseRoused </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",

We have played a few games and they LOVE it, as i suspected. Simple, fast and fun. The game itself is a banger to play casually with kids. However... The quality of the card stock used in this printing at least, is HORRIBLE. The cards are at the most the thickness of a magazine cover and made of some cheap stock that is like a wafer packaging box that bends and creases all the time. And the surface makes them stick together as well. Being that they are leaf thin, flimsy yet also super prone to creasing due to the weird &quot;glossy&quot; paper used, they are just about the worst cards imageinable for a game where you constantly flip cards with force onto the table as well as compete to &quot;slap&quot; the deck the fastest. Three games in we bent half the cards",

Did anyone ever actually get to play the Off the Rails expansion for Vagrantsong? \ud83d\ude43 Very little written or video material to find.</p> <p>My question is this: I am considering buying the Encore expansion and might add OtR with the order. I just wonder if I will actually ever get to playing it. The campaign is already long, especially with Encore added, and I don&#39;t really need it to be more difficult. I am not interested in replaying the campaign after finishing it. Is there any other content in the small expansion that makes it worth buying for me?

After playing it though, we were feeling like playing the big version and i got a dubious idea. I&#39;d like to try implementing the alliance rules from Tiny Epic into the big version. I honestly doubt it would work as good as I think it would be and it would only break game balance. Still, I would like to give it a go although I&#39;m no expert in the big version. So, any recommendations on how to implement this rule IF it was to be implemented? I have to clarify, my group isn&#39;t really competitive and we truly only play to pass the time together, so no one would mind a little game breaking fun!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/False-Level7367\"> /u/False-Level7367 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1n65sip/tiny_epic_game_of_thrones_and_big_game_of_thrones/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <",
