I&#39;m confused about which Bonnet or Hat I need to facilitate this, and which Pi to purchase. Can this be accomplished via wifi or I need a physical (HUB75 or other) connection. The adafruit website currently says, &quot;<strong>Currently the Matrix driving software library does not support the Pi 5 (</strong><a href=\"https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix/issues/1603\"><strong>and no ETA when it might be done</strong></a><strong>)</strong> so best to use a Pi 4 until Pi 5 support is complete.
