It&#39;s slow and takes longer to do basic tasks, as if the internet connection is sluggish. I&#39;ve previously experienced hacking on my Instagram account (I have several IP addresses I need to investigate, though I don&#39;t have a lawyer). I also noticed that my iPhone analytics frequently show a user ID named &quot;Alex.&quot; Is this normal? One of the reports was even titled &quot;Dolly Parton.&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MEmeow80087355\"> /u/MEmeow80087355 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1n67qrv/analytics_report_alex/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1n67qrv/analytics_report_alex/\">[comments]</a></span>",
