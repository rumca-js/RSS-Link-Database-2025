Whilst the dev has revealed <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-not-the-end-of-the-franchise-director-confirms\">there's more set in the world of Maelle and pals to come</a>, I can only imagine I speak for a fair few of us when I say: I want more French-made role-playing game goodness. To that end, I booked in some time at <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-opening-night-live-gamescom-2025\">Gamescom 2025</a> to play something that may not be on your radar - a follow-up to 2021's underrated Edge of Eternity curio, Edge of Eternity.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/want-a-french-made-rpg-that-takes-inspiration-from-japanese-rpgs-and-was-actually-",

It's one of <em>those</em> games where it's difficult to ascertain and harder to elucidate, but it just has&hellip; <em>something</em>. An X-Factor. A <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. I have vaguely fond memories of the game in general, but sitting down to play just 45 minutes of upcoming remaster The Ivalice Chronicles, it doesn't take long for that secret sauce to sink its claws into me. I should play this whole thing, I think. I hadn't really planned to play it in full again. But 45 minutes later, there I was - mentally rejigging my October weekend plans.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-difficulty-tweaks-new-features-preserving-a-seminal-magic\">Read more</a></p>",
