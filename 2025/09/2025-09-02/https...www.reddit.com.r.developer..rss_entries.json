Wondering if it&#39;s just me or if this is a universal developer experience.</p> <p>You need specific training data for your model. Not the usual stuff you find on Kaggle or other public datasets, but something more niche or specialized, for e.g. financial data from a particular sector, medical datasets, etc. I try to find quality datasets, but most of the time, they are hard to find or license, and not the quality or requirements I am looking for.</p> <p>So, how do you typically handle this? Do you use datasets free/open source? Do you use synthetic data? Do you use whatever might be similar, but may compromise training/fine-tuning?</p> <p>Im curious if there is a better way to approach this, or if struggling with data acquisition is just part of the AI development process we all have to accept. Do bigger companies have the same problem",

Do you struggle with poor documentation, fragmented information, or just a lack of visibility into available APIs?</p> <p>API Debugging: How difficult is it to troubleshoot issues when an API isn&#39;t behaving as expected? Are you spending a lot of time sifting through logs, or is it hard to reproduce and isolate problems?</p> <p>I\u2019d love to get a sense of whether these are widespread issues and which one is the bigger challenge for you. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/1n6cij0\">View Poll</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Shot-Bar5086\"> /u/Shot-Bar5086 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
