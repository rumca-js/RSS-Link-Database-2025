        "description": "Kirby and the Forgotten Land: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World is a top tier game, stuffed full of content and with oodles of charm and flair. This upgrade makes that clear, and allows the game to shine in the way it was always meant to. \n\nNintendo will at some point need to reassess how it prices things, sure, and Kirby itself unfortunately has to deal with the fallout of that. But the actual game and upgrade we get here is an excellent update for an excellent game.",

        "description": "Metal Eden won't see Reikon become the new king of first-person shooters anytime soon, especially with all the rough edges. Its efforts are almost contrary to their first title \u2013 sleek instead of raw, if a little too rudimentary, with a commitment to a specific narrative style, though more overbearing. \n\nThe mystery of ASKA and how she fits into this ruined future may not stand out much initially \u2013 and her relatively stoic personality doesn't help either. It probably won't make the same impact as Ruiner, but the gameplay makes up for it in spades.",

        "description": "The Metal Gear franchise is arguably among Hideo Kojima's most iconic work to date, Death Stranding aside. It has been an inspiration for other developers to try their hand at the stealth-action genre with varying results while its sometimes convoluted narrative continues to be among modern gaming's most elaborate spy stories.\n\nBig Boss and Solid Snake are legends in their own right in their respective games, with each title bringing something new, and special, to the table. We take on the daunting task of attempting to rank each mainline entry in the franchise. A pity we couldn't just rank all of them as the best and be done with it!",

        "description": "It\u2019s not every day we get a game previously locked to the VR format come out on displays everybody generally uses. Superhot and Moss are two examples that come to mind, and Alien Rogue Inclusion joins that small list. This is essentially the same game with some enhancements and formatting to fit traditional displays.\n\nBut before shelling out your hard-earned $29.99, it\u2019s worth knowing what you\u2019re getting into here. Like Alien: Isolation? Well, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll enjoy Rogue Incursion; it\u2019s not quite as strategic or atmopsheric, but it has that same spirit. \n\nWith a 7 hour runtime and tons of lore and Alien goodness at your fingertips, Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition will make fans satisfied. Alien Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition releases on September 30th on PC and PS5.",
