        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, for decades Big Pharma has been pushing drugs onto the public without having any idea what the side effects and downstream consequences will be. Trump is now calling for accountability over COVID drugs. But a new study shows again that we need to be having a similar conversation about birth control pills. Also, the longer Jasmine Crockett is in office, the more she loses her ability to speak proper English. It's a very strange phenomenon. And Donald Trump calls out a contractor who did shoddy work at the White House. Is this petty, or totally justified? Or both? And a new article asks the question: why did Vegans lose? I think I know the answer.\n\nEp.1650\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/A7409444.jpg?w=1200\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/F1Kbv25WwAUcNn9?format=jpg&name=medium\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/GzwuYgYXYAAXUyf?format=jpg&name=large\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlhgk9VwhKI\nhttps://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1962666677",
