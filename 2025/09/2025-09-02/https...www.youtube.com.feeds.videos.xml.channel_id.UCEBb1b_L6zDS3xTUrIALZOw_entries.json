We also define the notion of a metric space. A metric space is a space with a well-defined way of measuring distances between pairs of points. Many of the notions that we have introduced for the real numbers have counterparts for metric spaces and we discuss some of those including convergence and Cauchy sequence. We will also give a number of examples of metric spaces.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\nSupport OCW at http://ow.ly/a1If50zVRlQ\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other social med",

This means that the graph of such a function bound a well defined area. To do so, we define what it means for a function to be uniformly continuous. This is a strong version of continuity but we will see that all continuous functions on a closed and bounded interval have this stronger property. Once we have shown that all continuous functions on a compact interval are uniformly continuous, it will follow relatively easily that they are integrable.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\nSupport OCW at http://ow.ly/a1If50zVRlQ\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other soc",

This is the Picard-Lindelof theorem and is a wonderful application of much of the material in the class. It will use the theory of metric spaces as well as the contracting mapping theorem. The solution to an ODE will be constructed as a fix point of a contracting map.

After that, we turn to the important notions of limsup and liminf. These new notions are needed to state the general form of the convergence tests. Once we have limsup, we can define the radius of convergence for a power series.

We show that if a function is differentiable at a point, then it is also continuous. We then establish the basic algebraic laws for differentiation. Those includes Leibniz's rule, the quotient rule, and the chain rule. Once we have that, we prove Rolle's lemma and use it to show the mean value theorem.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\nSupport OCW at http://ow.ly/a1If50zVRlQ\n\nWe encourage constructive comments and discussion on OCW\u2019s YouTube and other social media channels.
