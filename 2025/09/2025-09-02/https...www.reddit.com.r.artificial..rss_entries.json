But whenever I wander the realms of social media groups or youtube, I can&#39;t help but noticed that some hatred on AI is becoming non constructive and, somehow irrational. Just to give you an idea, not everyone is using AI for business. Others simply wants to have fun and tinker. But even people who are just goofing around are becoming a victim of an online mob who sees AI as an infernal object. In one case, a friend used AI to convert the face of an anime into a real person, just for fun. And instantly, he was bashed. It was just for fun but people took it too seriously and he ended up being insulted. Even on Youtube. Trolls are everywhere, and they are bashing people who uses AI, even though they are just there to have fun. And even serious channels, who combined the use of AI and human editing skills are falling victims to online trolls. </p> </div",

My team and I are currently developing a highly promising artificial intelligence assistant named Hera.<br/> Let me briefly introduce Hera to you. Hera is initially designed to be the most helpful assistant in your daily life. It consists of a case and a clip. The clip has a simple and ergonomic design, which makes it extremely comfortable to wear. You won&#39;t feel any discomfort even if you use it for a long time during the workday. The case is a rechargeable recording compartment equipped with a total of six microphones. Among them, five are omnidirectional microphones, and their sound pickup distance reaches an industry-leading eight meters.<br/> In terms of functions, Hera has a powerful memory ability and can distinguish and handle different types of memories. For example, it can use short-term memory to quickly respond to various temporary task requirements at present. It can also rely on long-term memory to deeply understand y",
