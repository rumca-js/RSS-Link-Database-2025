        "description": "The story of the murder spree, manhunt and capture from the perspective of a Lincolnite in 1958, immersed in fear and horror. Information unfolds across the news, which depicts Charles and Caril as teenage lovers on the run, and public opinion is shaped against Caril. She is made to seem not just as guilty as Charles, but perhaps the mastermind of the whole event. The archival crime spree story is intercut with present day interviews with those close to the case. There is much more to this story than people think.
