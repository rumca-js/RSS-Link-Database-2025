Shot for the streaming service HBO Max, it is the director\u2019s second historical miniseries after 2022\u2019s Exterior Night, about the kidnapping of Aldo Moro, and features the same lead player in Fabrizio Gifuni, an actor who has surely cornered the market in playing glossy public figures whose lives are about to take a hellish turn.

The plants we brought with us aren\u2019t thriving. What houseplants can cope with low light levels?</p><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br>\n Many popular houseplants, especially those that need bright, indirect light, will struggle in dimly lit spaces. Symptoms like yellowing leaves, leggy growth and overall decline are common when plants aren\u2019t getting enough light to photosynthesise properly. But all is not lost. Several houseplants are far more tolerant of low light and can thrive in shadier spots.
