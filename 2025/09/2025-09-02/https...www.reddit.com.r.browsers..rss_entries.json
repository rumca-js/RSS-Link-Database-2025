I wanted to love Firefox but the bookmark system is terrible. The organize bookmark page is ok-ish but still way worse than Chrome. The worst part of it is when bookmarking, the ultra tiny window that opens with no way of expanding is super bad when have more than 6-7 folders (while chrome allows to go &quot;chose another folder&quot; to expand and actually see where you bookmark. Completely unuseable for me.<br/> So unless there&#39;s a way to circumvent that (but I doubt it), what could be options ?<br/> Besides these bookmarks, I also use tabs groups sometimes, which Firefox also does not support unless I missed something.<br/> So I saw Vivaldi that seems to be close to what I would need, even if it&#39;s not completely open source.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",

Feels like someone finally designed a browser for 2025. Smooth, minimal, functional, pure chef\u2019s kiss \u2026until you open Activity Monitor. Then you realize Zen is less \u201cbrowser\u201d and more \u201cAAA game disguised as a browser.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>Memory: GONE!</li> <li>Battery: haha nope (5x worse drain than Safari and still worse than Chrome \ud83d\ude43)</li> </ul> <p>Honestly, it feels like Zen is the only browser where you need MagSafe more than WiFi. <em>sigh</em></p> <p>I want to love it. I <em>do</em> love it. But when my browser eats the resources I need for actual work (research, coding, etc.) and basically turns my MacBook into a desktop because it has to stay plugged in 24/7\u2026 it\u2019s really hard to justify.</p> <p>For now, I\u2019m reluctantly moving to Vivaldi, which doesn\u2019t have Zen\u2019s elegance but at least respects my battery life.</p> <p>Wha",
