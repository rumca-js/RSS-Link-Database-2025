I&#39;m just looking for a really well written fantasy book where romance isn&#39;t the main focus (there doesn&#39;t need to be a romance element at all). I&#39;m looking for something with great world building, complex characters, and classic fantasy themes. Some authors I enjoy reading are Naomi Novik, Orson Scott Card, David Eddings, JRR Tolkien.

The politics are the name of the game here, and the characters and themes are built around it. </p> <p>Let&#39;s start off with the premise: Steffan Dekkard is a young man acting as a bodyguard for a Councillor, basically a member of parliament of his country, Guldor.

I admittedly don&#39;t have the best taste as far as classic literature and typically lean toward easy reading books. My favorites include wheel of time, red rising, the lightbringer series and fourth wing.

I&#39;ve also recently tried &quot;the curse of chalion&quot;, &quot;the blade itself&quot; and &quot;mother of learning arc 1&quot; but none of them really grabbed me. When I find a book I like I&#39;ll go out of my way to listen to it and often have it on most of the day while doing other tasks. If a book doesn&#39;t hit me quite right then I&#39;ll find myself choosing podcasts or music and sort of just casually falling out of the ha",

Only the fey woman who appears couple of times in the novel is different. </p> <p>In the background of the novel there is a war. The protagonist, Liadan, cannot seem to understand that. She doesn&#39;t understand why her family has to make political alliances for protection. Why marriage is important. Her uncles died in the war. Other people in her land are being killed. But that does not matter. Only romance and babies are important. She even &quot;fell in love&quot; with a man child who hates all women, especially her mother. Without spoilers she almost destroys her family for romance and happiness. All of this without any real self awareness. Just blames the male characters for anything that",

But most worlds have a history, right? Often it&#39;s laid out how humans et al first met, but that&#39;s 10000 years ago and now everyone knows everything about the others. I&#39;d like stories set in that volatile period where they haven&#39;t even figured out each other&#39;s intentions, or their language. </p> <p>So why is the first contact explored so little? Or do I just need to read more? (yes)</p> <p>Both looking for recommendations and more in-depth discussions of the trope and worlds.</p> <p>I&#39;ve found these old threads, but they&#39;re about to start middle school soon, so I was wondering if there are any other examples. * <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5ksl5b/are_there_fantasy_booksseries_simila",

The closest I can think is I guess Harry Potter but make it queer(never actually read the books growing up, i just know it&#39;s a mahic school) or loke Tempest and Slaughter by Tamora Pierce(i did read this. Very much liked the way she handled school life). Would like an interesting overarching narrative, not picky on tone, just hope that there&#39;s at least a semi-seriousness to it. Bonus if there are at least a few instances of learning the magic through these classes and seeing teachers/professors be mentors and guides. Can be full fantasy or urban fantasy, I&#39;m not picky in that sense.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/walking_fuckup\"> /u/walking_fuckup </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1n6620o/magical_schools_mm/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a",
