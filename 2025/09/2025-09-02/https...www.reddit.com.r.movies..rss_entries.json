The part that hooked me was when Cruise\u2019s character keeps dying during training with Rita. It\u2019s darkly funny watching him try to get it right and failing in ridiculous ways, yet slowly improving. </p> <p>That experience made me realize how many films I might dismiss too quickly based on trailers or hype.

I also loved it and enjoyed it for what it was trying to do. But rewatching it recently really makes it feel like a movie out of time. It was doing the whole meta, self-aware thing long before it caught on. Movies like Cabin in the Woods, Tropic Thunder and Deadpool later got praised for that same kind of storytelling, but Last Action Hero was already playing with those ideas in the early 90s.</p> <p>It\u2019s fun to revisit it now and see how much it holds up, especially knowing how common that style has become.</p> <p>Curious what other movies people think were misunderstood at release but actually aged really well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LurkerBigBangFan\"> /u/LurkerBigBangFan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n6iybx/which_movie",

I\u2019ve always appreciated Peter Berg\u2019s attention to detail with the rifles and gear and the beautiful scenery of the mountains. Once I learned that the film was shot on location in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of New Mexico, I had to go see the site in person.</p> <p><strong>Finding the Site:</strong> The behind the scenes footage from the Blu-Ray special features established the crew filmed at Ski Santa Fe, but I used Google Earth to narrow down the precise filming locations. Using this large boulder for reference I was able to determine one scene was filmed at 35\u00b047&#39;35&quot;N 105\u00b046&#39;47&quot;W, elevation 11,658ft (3,553m). Here is the same boulder from the other direction. For comparison, here is the same location in person. Once there, I found several crimp-nosed 5.56 blank ",

It\u2019s one of the few films that makes me both ache and smile at the same time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ang-ela\"> /u/ang-ela </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n65gbl/what_movie_completely_changed_your_opinion_after/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n65gbl/what_movie_completely_changed_your_opinion_after/\">[comments]</a></span>",
