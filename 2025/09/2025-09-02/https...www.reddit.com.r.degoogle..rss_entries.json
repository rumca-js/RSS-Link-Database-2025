I know the general idea is about privacy, but I wanted to ask a direct, honest question to this community: What is the actual danger of Google having my data?</p> <p>I&#39;m talking about things like my search history, my name, my interests, and my location. I understand they use it for things like targeted ads, but is that really the extent of it? Is there a more serious danger that I&#39;m not seeing? Like, how does this put me in a genuinely dangerous or vulnerable situation? I&#39;m not trying to be contrary, I just want to understand the &quot;why.&quot; I&#39;m looking for the tangible reasons why I should care, beyond just the concept of &quot;big tech having my data.&quot;</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any insights or explanations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SouthR",

I read lot of people say that vpn isn&#39;t needed since everything uses https now and i agree. even well known tech youtubers said the same thing and they explained it very well. But here is one situation where I think that a vpn is necessary but i could be wrong. If I connect on a malicious wifi or like a fake wifi. Can&#39;t the owner just man in middle attack me. For example i go on google and type youtube and then I click on the first link. now I made sure that the link is the correct youtube link with the https. Can&#39;t the malicious wifi owner just see that and redirect me onto a fake youtube where cred can be stolen. I know lot of website and browsers have certificate that can detect this but what if you do this on not very known websites and these website do have https. If you are going to give use a yes or no please explai",
