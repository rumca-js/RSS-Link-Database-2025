I can&#39;t help but see most games as just repetitive tasks. Such as go here, shoot these bad guys, upgrade your gear, repeat (and slap a mid-tier story on top of it). After 30yrs or so of gaming I feel like I&#39;ve done it all before. I tend to get like 5-10 hours into a game before I get bored and then just wonder why I&#39;m wasting my time with it.</p> <p>The only recent (to me) game that seems to scratch an itch for me is Slay the Spire. But I&#39;m not always in the mood for a deckbuilder.</p> <p>I really cannot remember the last time I was genuinely excited to play a game. I&#39;ll spend hours looking through the Steam store just going &quot;hmm, nah&quot; at everything I see. And the few I have bought I&#39;ve often ended up refunding or not finishing.</p> <p>I have other hobbies, but come 9pm, sometimes I just wanna sit and play a game for a couple ho",

The last few years I&#39;ve been missing that feeling but when I fire up retro classics or new age games I don&#39;t feel the want to know how the story ends or if I can find all of the so and so.. But I know there are beautiful games out there I&#39;ve never even seen or touched. So I&#39;m asking reddit.. What are games you think are truly beautiful?
