TrendRadar connects to Twitter and pulls in public tweets from accounts you select (competitors, influencers, news outlets etc.). It then cross-references those tweets with recent news articles to surface the topics that are getting attention right now.</p> <p>For example, when I tested it with WatcherGuru\u2019s account, it recognised their focus on crypto and stocks and immediately listed related breaking articles. This makes it easy to plan posts and stay relevant without spending hours researching.</p> <p>I\u2019m sharing the project here because I\u2019m in the free beta ",
