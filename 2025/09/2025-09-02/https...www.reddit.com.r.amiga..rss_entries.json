        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I recently had an urge to play some old Cinemaware games on the go. Most of them are 2 disc games, which are annoying to swap on the steam deck so I decided to download some WHDload versions. I&#39;ve never used WHD files before but I thought I could just load up Emulation Station, click on them and start playing. However when I do that, it just takes me to a workbench screen with what looks like an installation file that does nothing when I click on it. Does anyone know how to get those games to run? Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChiliSub\"> /u/ChiliSub </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1n68m3w/can_anyone_help_me_get_whd_games_running_on_steam/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1n68m3w/can_anyone_help_me_get_whd_games_running_on_steam/\">[comments]</a></span>",
