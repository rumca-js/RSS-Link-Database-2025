        "description": "The BCCI has barred cryptocurrency and real money gaming firms from bidding for the Indian cricket team\u2019s lead sponsorship rights. The decision reflects increasing regulatory scrutiny of crypto promotions in India, with SEBI previously targeting misleading celebrity endorsements. The move marks a significant setback for crypto adoption, cutting off one of India\u2019s most visible marketing avenues. Industry watchers say the decision could further limit mainstream acceptance of digital assets in the country.",

Some users are said to be receiving warning emails stating their Premium access will be revoked within 14 days if location checks fail, though they will remain in the family group with ads unless verified. YouTube already runs 30-day location check-ins, but rarely enforces them. The move appears to be pushing users toward individual or two-member plans, similar to Netflix\u2019s strategy.",
