Important historically, geographically and politically. One of the city\u2019s most famous sons, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, as a boy, was so embedded that his first language was Low Alemannic German, not French. To use a word Wenger brought to the English football vernacular \u2013 footballistically \u2013 Strasbourg was never too much of a hub. The club reformed after liquidation as recently as 2011, having won just one French title back in 1979 when Wenger was a fringe player already embedded in coaching.
