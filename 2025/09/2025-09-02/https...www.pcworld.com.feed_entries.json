Replacing your dumb bulbs with smart ones is perhaps the easiest way to start. Many smart bulbs can be screwed into existing light sockets, and they can be controlled remotely, put on schedules, change colors, and more.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re feeling more ambitious, you can venture into smart string lights, light strips, wall and ceiling fixtures, smart lamps, and even smart lighting for the yard or other outdoor areas.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our guide to the best smart lighting can help you navigate the thicket of options, from the various smart light manufacturers (like Philips Hue, LIFX, Nanoleaf, and Wyze) to the connectivity standards (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Matter). We\u2019ll also let you know which voice assistants (like Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, and Google Assistant) work with which lights.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-hea",

That\u2019s a darn good steal of a bargain!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Acemagic mini PC is a tiny beast with a jaw-dropping configuration for the price.
