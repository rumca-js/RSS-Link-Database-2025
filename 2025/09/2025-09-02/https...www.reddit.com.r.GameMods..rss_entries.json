        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone! I&#39;m trying to play the Cosmos Collapse Mod for Super Mario Galaxy 2 on my Homebrewed Wii. I know that I can just activate/deactivate the mod with riivolution, but I&#39;d like to have both the original game and the mod at the same time as two different files...so I was trying to change the ID of one of the copies of Super Mario Galaxy 2 that I&#39;m gonna put on my HDD with the Wii games, so that USB Loader GX recognizes 2 times the same game, but as two different games. Then, activating the mod with riivolution just on 1 of the 2 copies of the game. But I&#39;m having a super hard time managing to change the ID of my Mario Galaxy 2 ISO file. I tried with WIT: Wimms ISO tools, but both &quot;set-id&quot; and &quot;-g&quot; (to make a copy changing ID) are not working...so I have no clue if there is another method. If you know a way, please help me. Tysm</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
