Today, I want to talk about why Standard Voice shouldn\u2019t be removed.</p> <p>First, regarding functionality: Standard Voice Mode (SVM) enables dialogue with the model based on STT (Speech-to-Text) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) technologies. It can be understood as using a hands-free reading function, it reads the model&#39;s output aloud to the user and converts the user&#39;s speech into text input for the model, thereby achieving voice interaction. Therefore, in SVM, users can fully utilize all capabilities of the model for in-depth conversations.</p> <p>If SVM is removed, users will no longer be able to engage in voice interactions with the model at the same level of depth.
