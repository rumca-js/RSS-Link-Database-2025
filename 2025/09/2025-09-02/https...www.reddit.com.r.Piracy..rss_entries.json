I&#39;ve been sulking on Soulseek and Nyaa/Squid/other where JP music usually sits, but to no avail (unless there are better places?). So I decided I will be THE ONE to get it and share it with everyone.</p> <p>But I&#39;ve been unsuccessful with it so far. I think Soulseek is no go, since it requires me to open ports which isn&#39;t possible for me.</p> <p>Same with creating torrents. Although I read that it should be possible, I&#39;ve been unsuccessful with it and the torrents I created either got Stalled or Errored. Not a single bit got uploaded/downloaded, which I presume is too an issue of private IP.</p> <p>I know that I could use a VPN and get through all my issues, but I don&#39;t have one, and if it&#39;s possible without it I&#39;d just do it that way.</p> <p>So what are my options ? What can I do, to share this beautiful ",
