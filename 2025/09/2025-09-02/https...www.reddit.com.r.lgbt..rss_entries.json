I\u2019ve been crying a lot lately because I don\u2019t fully understand myself. I feel both feminine and masculine, and I love both sides of me \u2014 I love dressing up and feeling soft and pretty, but I also love my masculine energy too. The thing is, I\u2019m straight, and that makes me so confused because I don\u2019t know where I \u201cfit.\u201d</p> <p>It feels really lonely keeping this inside, and I just wish I had someone to talk to who won\u2019t judge me. Even a kind word or a little chat would mean so much. I just want to feel like I\u2019m not weird for being this way.</p> <p>If anyone relates or just wants to listen, please reach out. I\u2019d be so grateful \ud83c\udf37 Sending love to anyone else who\u2019s struggling with who they are \u2014 you\u2019re not alone \ud83d\udc95</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AI_Geeks\"> /u/AI_Geeks </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1n6",

Before I even knew what gay was it was always just a \u201cknow\u201d in my life. What I\u2019m having trouble with is my attraction towards men. </p> <p>I\u2019ve always seen a massive difference in the way I feel toward women and men. I fall in love with women, everyone I\u2019ve ever been in love with has been a woman. Although, I do feel sexual attraction towards men. While I\u2019m unsure if I would be able to fall for them, I\u2019ve had a handful of experiences with them. </p> <p>The weird thing is, my body seems to know when a guy has sexual feelings for me. I\u2019ll get instantly, and rather seriously ill before my mind even catches on! It\u2019s as if I\u2019m attracted to them until it gets down to it, unfortunately.</p> <p>Does anyone else have this experience? Is there a term for it?

I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m a cis male, nothing feels wrong, and he/him pronouns are completely fine. But actually they/them also feels confortable. I&#39;m not a native english speaker, and in my mother tongue neutral pronouns are not widely known, so they don&#39;t feel natural to me. This means I wouldn&#39;t use them in real life, but online I think it feels good, but it never actually happened to me... what I mean is, if someone wrote to me in here, for example, using they/them, I think I would get some sort of euphoria. </p> <p>I know pronouns don&#39;t need to reflect gender identity, it&#39;s just a reflection and any suggestions about finding out if this actually is confortable to me would be welcome.</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div",

I love them so so much and up until I started dating them and helped them explore their gender identity, I hadn\u2019t known much more than the basics about trans people.</p> <p>Last night we were watching one of the American Pie movies which is their FAVORITE series. I hadn\u2019t seen it and they were so happy to be watching it with me. Midway, a character said something about having \u201creal\u201d women, purposely implied to mean cis. My partner immediately paused it and they just visibly looked so upset (they didn\u2019t realize the movie said this their first watch). They aren\u2019t even MtF but I could tell the fact that one of their favorite movies implied that they\u2019ll never be a \u201creal\u201d guy really got to them. I hugged tight and reassured them but man. It\u2019s so saddening for them have to deal with this kind of thing,",

My boyfriend is cis and VERY gay and he\u2019s never dated a trans man. He has dated a cis girl in high school but was never intimate with her. He has no interest in women or their anatomy or being intimate with them. Not even trans women. Admittedly I\u2019ve dated a woman and I wasn\u2019t comfortable being intimate with her and broke off a relationship after coming out as gay. I thought I could\u2019ve been bi but I am not interested in women. Similar experience to his. Is he still \u201cvery gay\u201d when he\u2019s dating me? Even though I haven\u2019t had any surgeries yet and just been on T for over 7 years? I have A cups and I pass pretty well topless in public when we\u2019re at the beach or just hanging",
