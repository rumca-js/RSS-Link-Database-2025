If y\u2019all could give me some fun recommendations I\u2019d be very grateful.</p> <p>I (23F) love a lot of young adult books because I find that many adult-marketed fantasy novels lean too heavily into depressing, super dark themes or are packed with sex scenes. While I like horror, I usually prefer stories that end happily, and I feel like some adult-marketed authors mistake lust for actual chemistry or love between characters. Or at least they over-rely on it.</p> <p>I don\u2019t mind if the recommendation is technically for younger readers. LOTR, Narnia, and other classics are well-written and not exclusively for kids. (And please don\u2019t come for me, but I did try Percy Jackson and found it less accessible as an adult reader.) I also love complex world building. </p> <p>I\u2019m a big fan of whimsy, and I don\u2019t mind darker or horror elements.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019m looking for some books that fast and fun. I would also <em>prefer</em> not a lot of gore, harm, violence, etc, but good old suspense is fine. I DNFed Lock Every Door (for now) because the thought of harm befalling others was too sad for me. I also much prefer first person for my binge reads. Some books I\u2019ve read over the last year or two that fit this description:</p> <p>-I Who Have Never Known Men -Yellow Face -My Year of Rest and Relaxation -I\u2019m Thinking of Ending Things (borderline a lil too scary/sad for me but I did finish it in a day) -The Housemaid</p> <p>Can also be nonfiction.

Seuss or The Little Prince vibes) bu also has some meaningful message that makes you think, perhaps even some criticism.</p> <p>The reason I am looking for a book like this is because I&#39;m starting to actively read very recently and I just CAN&#39;T read books without pictures, I completely lose focus and can&#39;t understand the story. So I think a book with pictures would be perfect for my comprehension, and yet, have a more deep and kind of mature story behind it. I&#39;d also love if it has some kind of poetry aspects in it too, but this is more like a preference than a requirement.</p> <p>I just feel at home and ease reading children&#39;s books, which helps me with my anxiety. But I also wish it could have a more mature and serious story that could make me think a lot.</p> <p>Thank",
