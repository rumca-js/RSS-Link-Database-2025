        "description": "Hello friends, it is with a heavy heart that I feel finally ready to open up and speak about what's really been going on in my family's life the last 2.5 years. I will let you watch the video for yourself to hear everything from my perspective. I have never shared anything so personal or painful before. I decided to do so now, to bridge a deep gap that I have felt for many years now, between what my life has been in the real world and what my life is on here. I know so many have gone through or are currently going through something similar, and I hope that creating a space where we can talk about this can help us all feel less alone. If you have experienced grief, loss or pain, and if you have the strength to do so, I would love it if this comment section could be filled with stories, love and support for one another. Life is confusing and painful, we need each other to make it through.\n\nStaffan and I decided to record a podcast about this because there was so much more to say:\nhttps:",
