I recently added a simple button to the GPIO pins to switch between each script on press. (On my 3b+ I have the button wired to GPIO 17 and the pin 9 ground)</p> <p>Since I have no clue how to program, I used chatGPT to write most of it (with a lot of trial and error), and shown below is the current code it has written for me. From what I have researched, the code seems like it should be fine. My problem is that when I push the button, nothing really happens except for the screen kinda bugging out, which is normal because I am shorting it out. Anyway, can anyone who is knowledgeable with this kind of stuff be able to point me in the right direction as to wha",
