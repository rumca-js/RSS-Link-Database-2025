        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello!</p> <p>My problem is pretty much as the title suggest. I&#39;m playing a game I installed from GOG. If I have my controller connected via USB on startup it will work perfectly fine. If for any reason it disconnects (wire fell out of controller, usb was unplugged, computer was put into sleep mode, etc.) the left and right triggers as well as both joysticks cease to work. I test it on an online game pad tester to confirm. Usually the left stick still registers in this but not in game. I have to restart my computer for it to go back to working properly. It does the same thing if I connect via bluetooth. If I load a game from Steam my controller works perfectly fine. I&#39;ve tried many different wires and a few different controllers. As far as I am aware I have all drivers updated. Any help is appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Due-Firefighter-9637\"> /u/Due-Firefighter-9637 </a> <br/",

Tried to log in with my child account, spits back &quot;there is something wrong, restart.&quot; put in the wrong password and came back with wrong password so i know it&#39;s processing the login. Tried the manual method, copied the link (looks like trying to log in to accounts dot google dot com slash android (something like that), opened firefox, tried to log in, same error. This is where I think it&#39;s google specific..to verify, I downloaded chrome and logged into the browser as my child, no issues. used the same browser to log in with the link from the launcher, and same restart error.
