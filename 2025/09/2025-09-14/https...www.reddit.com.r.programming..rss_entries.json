For example:</p> <ul> <li>RLS is either missing or misapplied, which leaves tables wide open even when teams think they\u2019re locked down.</li> <li>Edge Functions sometimes run under the service_role, meaning every call bypasses row-level security.</li> <li>Storage buckets are marked \u201cpublic\u201d or have weak prefixes, making it easy to guess paths and pull sensitive files.</li> <li>We even found cases where networked extensions like http and pg_net were exposed over REST, which allowed <strong>full-read SSRF</strong> straight from the database edge.</li> </ul> <p>The surprising part: a lot of these apps branded themselves as \u201cinvite-only\u201d or \u201cauth-gated,\u201d but the /auth/v1/signup endpoint was still open.</p> <p>Of the back of these recent pentests and audits we decided too combine it into a informative article / blog post </p> <p>A",

This time, I&#39;m introducing the &quot;Standardized Truth Table&quot; (STT) format. Using the STT, I&#39;ve developed an algorithmic method to find and remove &quot;irrelevant&quot; variables from a boolean expression. The core idea is simple: if changing an input&#39;s value doesn&#39;t change the output, that input is irrelevant. This is super useful for simplifying logic and making digital circuits more efficient.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Paddy3118\"> /u/Paddy3118 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://paddy3118.blogspot.com/2025/09/from-all-truths-to-irrelevancies.html\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1ngphf3/from_all_truths_to_irrelevancies/\">[comments]</a></span>",
