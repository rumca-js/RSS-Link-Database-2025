Its a very quick qn.</p> <p>Is the main character, Ryland Grace, supposed to be the so similar to the one in The Martian? By that I mean he seems the exact same type - smart scientist, and a sarcastic, wisecracking smartass. Just seems extremely familiar the way he responds to situations with the same sarcasm/jokes.</p> <p>Not that its a bad thing, I just find it rather strange. Or does the character change as the book goes on? Also I haven&#39;t seen the trailer (or read any synposis etc), but isn&#39;t Ryan Gosling entirely too good looking for the part?

I&#39;ll preface this by saying that I&#39;ve never read many Westerns before (only All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy), but I have seen some of the more well known movies so I know a lot of the traits and tropes of the genre. That being said, Lonesome Dove transcends all of those things by ditching the romanticized version of the West that people have seen countless times (the rugged gunslingers who always come out on top, the love interests that also resolve in the end, the idyllic and beautiful scenery with magnificent horses, etc) in favor of a brutal and more realistic take. The main gist of the story is that you have two former Texas rangers who, with their cattle company, decide to do a cattle drive from Texas on the border of Mexico all the way to northern Montana, a journey spanning over 3,000 miles. And WOW, what a journey it is. McMurtry pulls no punches here, with the",

I read 240 pages on a day I had off from work. I finished the remainder (book has 370 pages in total) just 5 days later. It was such a compelling read. The supernatural element was fascinating and the plot was so creatively thought out.

It was fascinating to read an artists point of view. The mystery of the book was complex, and although I read many mysteries, I did not figure this one out.
