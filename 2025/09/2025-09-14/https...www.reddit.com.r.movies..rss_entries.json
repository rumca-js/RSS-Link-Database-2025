Different stories but one awesome, charismatic leading man - Benoit Blanc is in for a long, long, epic run!! </p> <p>2) Smart and socially relevant writing - masterclass in mystery storytelling. Plot is layered but not confusing. Tight and clever. Everything has a purpose. It\u2019s all in the details!</p> <p>3) Thematic and high visual production - sharp and unique tone with great cinematography. Classic genre turn into modern flair - realistically grounded. </p> <p>4) Simple and fun! - you don\u2019t need to be stressed throughout the movie and just enjoy the humor and ride all the way.
