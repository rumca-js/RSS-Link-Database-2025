I just found a Stanford study that revealed a 13% drop in entry-level hiring for young workers (ages 22-25) in fields exposed to AI since late 2022. Hontesly speaking, even I skipped 2 interns this summer and used Claude Code (results are facinating to say the least). </p> <p>I think it will get really tough from people to compete. AI is eating up the routine tasks that used to be the training ground for a tech career. Seniors, now armed with AI, can handle more work, making entry-level roles redundant.</p> <p>What do you think?
