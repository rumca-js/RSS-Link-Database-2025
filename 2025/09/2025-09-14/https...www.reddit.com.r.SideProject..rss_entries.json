I spend a few minutes every day collecting free daily bonuses from sweepstakes sites. It&#39;s a popular and legitimate side hustle right now. </p> <p>Basically, you just log in and claim about $1 from each site. It only takes me about 5 minutes to run through my list, and it builds up to around $600 a month. There&#39;s no catch... it&#39;s just how these sites are legally required to operate (they need to give out &quot;free entry&quot;). </p> <p>A lot of people are skeptical at first, but it&#39;s completely transparent and it works.
