        "description": "Sucker Punch Productions are about to unload a blockbuster, but not in the way we\u2019re accustomed. Ghost of Y\u014dtei is, on the surface, a Japanese-infused open world adventure but its design, and its intention, is to present an experience imbued with cinematic elegance. \n\nChanneling the lineage of iconic directors such as Akira Kurosawa and Takashi Miike, Ghost of Y\u014dtei establishes a stylised sense of mood through its filmic atmosphere. This feature details exploration, combat, and narrative, but essentially it\u2019s a discussion on the game\u2019s cinematic influences. The game\u2019s a homage to mid-century Japanese cinema, in detail, in pacing, and in structure. This is why it\u2019s so compelling, and why it\u2019ll be in the conversation for one of the biggest games of the year.",
