I don&#39;t really know what that might mean tho. I honestly feel like I&#39;m 100% a woman/girl, 30% non-binary and 10% a boy, but it always changes a little. I also like looking feminine in a twinkish or non-binary way and masculine in a butch way, or just like androgynous. Does anyone know what label would fit this?

It took me a while to find my sexuality, I think perhaps due to my medical condition. </p> <p>I have Kallmann syndrome. It is a rare genetic hormonal condition that affects puberty and development.
