Strangely, so many stories written in current times scarcely mention social media or internet. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s the most surprising, we don&#39;t hear about characters taking their shits and every hour they spend asleep or every meal, it&#39;s time not important to the story. But social media has a lot more potential to be important to the narrative and how characters communicate. It seems underrepresented in stories to me. </p> <p>I&#39;m not just asking if there are stories which embed texts like &quot;hey.&quot; &quot;what&#39;s up? :)&quot; &quot;nothing wbu&quot; Think about how texting has been portrayed in TV and film and how it&#39;s changed in the decades since texting became ubiquitous. It&#39;s still a little clunky, but people are trying. Sometimes it works pretty well in a movie or show. I&#39;m wonder",
