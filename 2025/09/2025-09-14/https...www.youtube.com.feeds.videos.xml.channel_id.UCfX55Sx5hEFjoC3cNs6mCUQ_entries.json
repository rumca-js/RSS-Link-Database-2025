What began as simple code completion and suggestion within the IDE has become so much more. We're now seeing AI agents function like pair programming partners, similar to junior developers who can take on GitHub issues but still need guidance and review. At Coder, we've been testing AI agents within our Cloud Development Environments by letting them tackle actual development tasks. In this talk, I'll show you where AI pairing partners excel (docum",

This talk will begin by explaining the transition from traditional lexical search to vector-based similarity search, and how OpenSearch combines both approaches in one complete package. \n\nThe session introduces fundamental concepts of vector databases, including how they store and process embedded meanings of various data types (text, images, and audio) using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) functionality. \n\nWe'll explore practical applications such ",

We'll start by showing how reasoning models like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 enabled a move from iterative chat to single-shot problem solving. We'll then talk about the 10-30x in cost reduction with the newer models, deployment strategies with quantization, and the open source AI model landscape. We'll conclude with a practical framework for choosing the right AI model for your use case.",
