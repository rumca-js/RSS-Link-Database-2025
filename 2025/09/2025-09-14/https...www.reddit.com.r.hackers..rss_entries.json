There are also several strange accounts with my name and my mom&#39;s name saying some really upsetting things. I downloaded all my Instagram data and logged the IP addresses that have ever accessed my account. I&#39;ve also taken screenshots of every weird thing that showed up in my search bar on Google and Instagram. Whenever I scroll through my social media, I get really odd, direct, and invasive messages about personal health issues \u2013 like someone is liking those posts and they show up for me. I also keep getting a weird Joker or IT gif in my photos, which I never saved. Has anyone else had this happen? If so, what did you do? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MEmeow80087355\"> /u/MEmeow80087355 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comment",
