It is to contain fiction works of all kinds (exceptions being porn or other offensive topics). Ideally, I would like to start this out as a Quarterly magazine and am searching out for people who might be interested in submitting stories for inclusion into the magazine. Under 25,000 words is what we are looking for and it can be a part of a series (though mind we would prefer to have the entire series on board). I have a site, but it&#39;s in the process of being built and tweaked to where it&#39;s right. I would like to pay authors, but right now it&#39;s a waiting game to be able to get some subscriptions and/or sold issues. PM me here if interested in submitting a story.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vastrix2\"> /u/Vastrix2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fa",

I can imagine &quot;normally&quot;, but I can&#39;t actually see what I&#39;m imagining. Because of this, I&#39;m very picky with the books I read, specially with their prose and style. I don&#39;t look for high quality prose per se, but some authors just give me a lot of trouble. Strangely, Sanderson is one of those authors. Although his style is simple, he&#39;s way too technical (not sure if this is the right word) when describing things. He can write some cool and easy to understand fight scenes, but when he tried to describe more complex scenery or one of the fantasy animals in Way of Kings, my head just got confused. The more details he tried to give me, the harder it became, to the point where I just couldn&#39;t imagine them at all. But I recently finished Shadow of the Torturer by Gene Wolfe and had the opposite experience. Yes, the book is much mor",
