One that could actually turn libre software a convenient standard for most people.</p> <p>It\u2019s an extremely simple to use distro, minimalist. But most importantly in a way that allows great configurability, and flexibility to develop it quickly.</p> <p>This flexibility makes it easy to fix bugs and improve things with no hassle.</p> <p>I could give all kinds of details on how it is implemented, but I believe it\u2019s just better to try it and see that it actually works nicely.</p> <p>The important point I want to make is this: many things about the distro are quite counterintuitive, but most likely they are chosen like that after p",
