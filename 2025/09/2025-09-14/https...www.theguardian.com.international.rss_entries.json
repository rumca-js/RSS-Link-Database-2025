Welcome to America. I feel like I\u2019m tipping for everything, everywhere. And now it\u2019s only going to get worse. And for that I blame President Trump.</p><p>Of course, our tipping culture was in place long before Trump took office. But now that his \u201cno tax on tips\u201d promise became law, our government is officially enabling it. That\u2019s good news for tipped workers and for small-business owners who may feel less pressure to pay higher wages if their workers are getting enough gratuities. But at the same time, it\u2019s bad news for the rest of us who will likely feel even more obligated than ever to tip.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/14/us-tips-tax-trump\">Continue readi",

After the 31-year-old rightwing influencer was shot dead at a college campus appearance in Utah on Wednesday, many commentators rushed to condemn political violence, on the one hand, and to issue warm tributes to Kirk\u2019s life, on the other. The former of these is legitimate: that political policy should not be determined by force, or political disagreements settled through homicidal violence, is a baseline precondition of not just a democratic form of government, but of any functional society. The latter, perhaps, can be explained by the admirable human impulse towards gentleness and reconciliation. The horror and shock of Kirk\u2019s assassination prompted some to offer their generosity, and their sympathy, to the dead man.</p><p>Perhaps it was the",
