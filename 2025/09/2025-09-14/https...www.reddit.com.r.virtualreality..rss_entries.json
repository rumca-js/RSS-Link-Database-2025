I&#39;m looking at used since the prices are half for pretty much new headsets. I&#39;m currently looking at the quest 2 for around 200, quest 3s for around 260 and the ps vr 2 for 250. I&#39;m not really interested in standalone too much so that&#39;s not a factor. Just as a note i do have some vr experience with the quest 2, htc vive and about an hour of playtime on the pimax 8k (maybe 5k not sure). What should i go for? Also assuming price wouldn&#39;t be a factor would the quest 3 be better than the ps vr 2?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OddBoifromspace\"> /u/OddBoifromspace </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ngsz3b/first_vr_choice/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ngsz3b/first_vr_choice/\">[comments]</a></span>",

At first I thought it was the lightning as it doesn&#39;t appear as bright. But then I noticed a couple lamps and positioned them for better lighting. No effect. Then I thought maybe this game is hard to run. But I tested and went back to a game that&#39;s easy to run and it also had issues. The only other thing I can think of is the really low ceilings as I can reach up and touch them. Maybe this somehow negatively affects lighting? The game ran fine during the day with natural light pouring in. But it does appear to be sufficient lighting at night with the lamps and ceiling lights on. I don&#39;t know.</p> <p>Edit: just noticed I&#39;m getting frame skips just being in the steam vr menuvwithout a game even launched. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SlowDragonfruit9718\"> /u/SlowDragonfruit9718 </a> <br/> <",

I do see the VIVE 2.0 stations on the store, but they&#39;re $229 for one compared to the Index which is $149. I run Index controllers right now, so I&#39;m really only worried about the headset being tracked.</p> <p>With the background info out of the way, the title&#39;s qu",
