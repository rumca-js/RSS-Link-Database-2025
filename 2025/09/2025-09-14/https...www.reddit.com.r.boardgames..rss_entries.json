        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Simple deck building game, one of the first deckbuilders, with classical mechanics. Two resources: runes (gold) and power (attack). Runes are used to buy new cards from market, which consists of 6 random cards. Power is used to kill monsters from the same market (alternatively you can go for cultists, which provide very little victory points, but are always avilable). </p> <p>There is special card type: constructs, which instead of going into discard stay on the board and give you permanent boost. Slayed monsters give you some bonuses, too. Victory points are scored when you play your cards, when you kill monsters, and at the end for cards in your deck. When pool of victory points runs out, you calculate scores and determine a winner.</p> <p>I would not call Ascension a bad game, but nor particularly good, either.</p> <p>+ There is a space for not particularly complex, but still sometimes fun combinations</p> <p>+ Easy setup and fast sessions</p> <p>+",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My oldest son recently got married, so we&#39;ve started a new monthly family game night. We have an old edition of Cranium that came out 20+ years ago, so I thought I would buy an updated version that would have questions my kids would also know. But upon looking on Amazon, I find myself a bit confused between the different editions on offer. We will have 8 participants between ages 18 and 79, and so I would like a game with a good mixture of questions/challenges that can allow all ages to participate well. We will probably play in 2 teams but I would like the option to have more.</p> <p>Any insight you can offer about which edition of Cranium would suit our family would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Far-Adagio4032\"> /u/Far-Adagio4032 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ngcqm0/best_edition_of_cranium/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"ht",
