I&#39;m a desktop user and use my PC for web browsing, watching media, sometimes creating media and gaming. Start of July I installed Bazzite and decided that it was too basic for me after a few days. Ended up on Fedora and I really like Fedora. Today I got a laptop and installed Arch on it and it&#39;s not difficult at all. The hardest thing for me after installing Arch was realizing that -S is case sensitive so when I wanted to install flatpak it kept erroring out until I figured that out. Where is this reputation coming from? If anything Arch is just very manual, but imo thus far (its only been a few hours) it&#39;s no more difficult than Fedora.
