Unlike typical galactic centres, this displaced object is accreting material and blasting out jets, suggesting black holes can grow \u201coffsite\u201d. The finding offers rare evidence of elusive intermediate black holes and may help explain how supermassive black holes expanded rapidly in the early universe.",
