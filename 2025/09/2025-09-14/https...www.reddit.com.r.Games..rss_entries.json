Roll dice, reroll them, and create combinations and combos with their special abilities.</p> <p>There are 9 types of dice, in 6 shapes, each with their own special abilities. Dice with the same type or shape create synergies to unlock passive skills (a bit like in an auto-chess type game), giving you new combinations to score, more points, more money, a D100...</p> <p>Between rounds, you can visit a random shop to buy new dice, level them up, improve your board or get Lucky Charms.
