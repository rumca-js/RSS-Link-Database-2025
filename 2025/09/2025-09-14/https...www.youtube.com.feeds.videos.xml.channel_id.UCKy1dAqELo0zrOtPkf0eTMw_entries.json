        "description": "Shigeru Miyamoto explains how Nintendo crafted the perfect level in the form of Super Mario Bros. World 1-1. \nWorld 1-1. We\u2019ve all run, jumped, and brick-bashed our way through that familiar first stage. It seems so simple and second-nature to us now, but in this modern age of iterative entertainment, it is almost impossible to convey the magnitude of the leap Super Mario Bros. represented compared to everything that came before it. \nWorld 1-1 introduced game design principles and a geometry of motion so perfectly calculated that it endures as one of the great works of the art form to this very day. But how was this miracle performed? Well, let us tell you, with the help of its creator, Shigeru Miyamoto.\n\n#IGN #gaming",
