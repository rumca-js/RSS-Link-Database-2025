It was this big, flat, almost metallic looking vibrant yellow console with two knobs on either side, iirc. I remember it being rather large and very vibrant yellow, almost like the classic Pong cabinets. And I&#39;m positive that it said Atari on it too. But I wanna see if anyone recognizes what I&#39;m talking about, or if I can try and find it because my searches recently haven&#39;t been helpful.
