On a technological level, an explosion in available data generated by digital and connected processes has provided firm foundations upon which AI can train and infer outcomes. Simultaneously, advances in processor and accelerator hardware, coupled with the availability of AI-ready software platforms and tools, have supplied the performance needed to tackle data-intensive workloads. The AI boom has, in itself, fostered an environ",

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated kernel optimization, demonstrating success in CUDA domains with comprehensive technical documents and mature codebases, their effectiveness remains unproven for reference-scarce domains like RISC-V. We present Evolution of Kernels (EoK), a novel LLM-based evolutionary program search framework that automates kernel design for domains with limited reference material. EoK mitigates reference scarcity by mining and formalizing reusable optimization ideas (general design principles + actionable thoughts) from established kernel libraries&#39; development histories; it then guides parallel LLM explorations using these ideas, enriched via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RISC-V-specific context, prioritizing historically effective techniques.
