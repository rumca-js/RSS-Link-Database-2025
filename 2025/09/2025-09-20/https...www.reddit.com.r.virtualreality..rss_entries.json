        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just bought a Meta Quest 3S without controllers. I won&#39;t be gaming so I don&#39;t really care but I was wondering if I could still get through the setup with just my hands or by connecting to another device (PC, Keyboard, Mouse, Xbox controller)?</p> <p>I tried looking it up and found nothing. Google&#39;s AI said No originally but when I asked it to go further it said I can with hand tracking. So I really have no idea until it comes in the mail.</p> <p>One possible solution I thought of if not is to buy controllers from Walmart and return them after setup (I&#39;m broke).</p> <p>Aside from gaming what other features will I loose out on without a controller?</p> <p>I will update this posts with answers as they are received or found out by my self when I receive the headset as this is not a common issue I can find online, but many sold without controllers on eBay.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u",
