I saw that the article says that Graphite can access any device without the user&#39;s knowledge, even encrypted messaging services. This part is what I don&#39;t completely understand. I did see where the article mentions that it can read messages after they&#39;ve been decrypted, but it also mentions that it breaks encryption. And I didn&#39;t see any mention of how it does it (maybe it&#39;s not known). I know that you should avoid suspicious stuff and not click on links you don&#39;t recognize or respond to messages from people you don&#39;t know, etc. But some stuff is done well enough that it can fool anyone. Is this how Graphite is implemented? I guess I&#39;m just looking for any other insight to the software.

But switching away from them can be a major hassle, especially if you\u2019re used to the ecosystem.</p> <p>For those who prioritize privacy, how do you approach this?
