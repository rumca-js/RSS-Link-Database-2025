I know there were some options before, but they required you to have purchased the game on Google Play. Recently, I found a relatively new project that lets us play Minecraft Bedrock on Linux with full Microsoft account support: <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/Crow%5C_Rei34/CC-MC\">https://codeberg.org/Crow\\_Rei34/CC-MC</a>. It supports Arch, Debian, and Fedora, and is being tested to work with Void Linux. </p> <p>edit: For the people who are bitching about me having a new Reddit account: I don\u2019t use Reddit, I\u2019m a Linux and Minecraft enthusiast. The project isn\u2019t mine and my native language isn\u2019t English.

I&#39;ve tried disabling all mods and mod loader, disabling all resource packs, as well as changing some discord settings like hardware acceleration to no avail.

Is there a way to save the shaders manually?</p> <p>Hello! I&#39;m on Fedora 41 trying to play Overwatch 2 on Steam. Now I&#39;ve known that vulkan shaders are often annoying, but at most I had seen it take an hour. Admittedly my computer isn&#39;t made for this, I have a lightweight business laptop, the Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon. Lovely device, but not for gaming. Still, I do regularly play games on it, and I guess this one is more demanding than what I had tried before (?) in any case, it takes around 7 hours for it to process Vulkan shaders. I do notice a performance difference tho so I don&#39;t wanna skip it. </p> <p>Now if it was a one and done thing I wouldn&#39;t mind. But it does it after EVERY update, and, worse yet, it seems to do it after every library install on my laptop. I&#39;m a student, so I&#39;m constantly having to ",
