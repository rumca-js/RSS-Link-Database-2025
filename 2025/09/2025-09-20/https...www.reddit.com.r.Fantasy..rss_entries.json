Written in 1975, it&#39;s often assumed that Beasts is told in a style common to that area. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case at all.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Let&#39;s say you have written an amazing book. It is so good that you are not sure how you have come about it. But once you have an amazing book, what do you do? You go to your publisher since you already are a published author. Your editor reads it and realizes you have an absolute gem of a book. But then you both realize that what you have got is only a book and maybe enough material for a duology. But according to your contract you are supposed to write a trilogy. Well what can you do? You write fluff. You create issues where none needed to be. Your main characters get separated so you can write another half book to get them together. You force protagonists apart just to manufacture tension and stretch scenes that could have been resolved in chapters into entire volumes.</p> <p>And that&#39;s what you&#39;re left with: a trilogy that should have been a duology and would have been infinitely better for it.

The book follows The Warden, a jaded former soldier turned police agent turned drug dealer, in the grimy slum-town of Low Town that has agglutinated onto the prosperous city of Rigus. The book begins when the Warden finds the corpse of a young missing girl, and, upon being prodded into investigating that which authorities would rather just sweep under the rug, finds it more than just one isolated murder.</p> <p>This book is very well written.
