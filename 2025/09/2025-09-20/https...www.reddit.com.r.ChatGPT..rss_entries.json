I flaired it educational only but really, I&#39;ve got a problem and there were no other flairs.</p> <p>I am having a problem creating a project. I presently have 6 projects and I&#39;m on a plus plan. Each time I try to create a project (I&#39;ve done it multiple times because I&#39;m troubleshooting), I get the error: Error Creating or Updating Project. Nothing else. That&#39;s all. I&#39;ve cleared cookies, used different browsers, different machines and the error persists. I&#39;ve sent an email to chatgpt help but I suspect it&#39;s going into the garbage.</p> <p>Has anyone had this problem or knows what the fix might be?

About an hour in this message popped up. I wasn\u2019t playing the entire hour - took some 5 minute breaks here and there. Then it gaslit me trying to tell me it didn\u2019t send me that message it must have been from my phone, and then blamed the app itself and kept nagging me to decide on the moral dilemma it had given me.
