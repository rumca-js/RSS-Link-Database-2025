All micro-lot and top-rated coffees shipped to you within 24 hours of roasting. No shortcuts. No crash. This is coffee at its most refined, just without the caffeine.</p>\n\n<p>20% off for DF readers with code \u201cDF\u201d at <a href=\"https://dekaf.com/df\">dekaf.com</a>. </p>\n\n<p>We\u2019re betting you\u2019ll never look at decaf the same way again.
