        "description": "Scientists have uncovered how exercise suppresses appetite through a surprising molecular pathway. A compound called Lac-Phe, produced during intense workouts, directly quiets hunger neurons in the brain while boosting appetite-suppressing ones, causing mice to eat less without side effects. This discovery reveals a natural mechanism linking physical activity and reduced hunger, paving the way for new obesity treatments.",

        "description": "Despite strong evidence that salt substitutes can safely lower sodium intake and reduce high blood pressure, very few Americans use them. A new analysis of nearly 20 years of national health data found that usage peaked at just over 5% and then declined, even among those with hypertension. Researchers say this represents a major missed opportunity to improve heart health, especially since salt substitutes are inexpensive and effective.",
