        "description": "Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch! This week Daemon, Logan, Max, and Ryan look back at the Nintendo Switch 2's first hundred days. The system is Nintendo's fastest-selling to date, with strong third-party support and a slate of upcoming first-party titles that should sustain the console's momentum through the holidays. But Nintendo has raised eyebrows with their game pricing strategy ($80 for Mario Kart World is nuts), and the tariff situation in the United States could threaten to slow down the Switch 2's impressive sales pace. Plus we have last week's poll results, and a new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.",

        "description": "If you like this video and would like to see more like it, make sure to subscribe to Eurogamer on YouTube. \nDespite the power of PS5 Pro and new graphics cards, why are so many trailers, such as GTA 6 and Ghost of Yotei, captured on the base PS5? And why are developers treating the base PS5 as the target spec for everything? Even traditionally PC-focused studios like CD Projekt Red, with their recent tech demo of The Witcher 4\nAiming just below the maximum keeps expectations in check and reassures us that our hardware will still be good in two years time. And in an era of rising inflation and endless financial turmoil, that's more valuable to the games industry than the impending generational shift to PS6.\nThis video was created by Jim Trinca and was originally featured on Eurogamer.",

        "description": "Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds reviewed by Jada Griffin on PlayStation 5, also available on Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.\n\nSonic Racing: CrossWorlds is firing on all cylinders with a fantastic roster of 24 of my favorite hedgehogs, foxes, echidnas, and more. The tracks are the best designed selection we've ever gotten in any Sonic racing game, and there is a generationally great soundtrack to accompany them. The racing itself feels fast, fantastic, and intuitive, with lots of options to tweak your stats to your preferred playstyle. There are plenty of modes that entertained my friends and me for hours \u2013 though I do wish it had the option for splitscreen when playing online. The titular Crossworld mechanic is a fantastic idea that keeps each race fresh, and a great way to potentially turn the tables on opponents thanks to a lengthy list of customization options. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is one that I know I'll enjoy playing plenty more of in the months to come, crossing the fin",
