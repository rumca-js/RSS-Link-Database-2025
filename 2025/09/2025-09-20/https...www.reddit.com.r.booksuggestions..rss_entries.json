So i got nothing against new books but there is so much being published its overwhelming and probably hard to find the great works among them. </p> <p>Anyway my favourites so far are Don Quijote, many short stories by Tolstoi, Heideggers Experiment, a book about Magellan circling the earth by ship. I also love Mark Twain &amp; Shakespear</p> <p>For me, its not that much about genre or topic, but the way it is written. I love those little remarks / details some writers throw out there almost as offhand remarks, details that add richness. 1 liners that paint a whole picture, they add it as if it doesn&#39;t mean much but in a way it makes the whole book - to me</p> <p>ps i hate kafka and freud lol.. dno if that helps</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LordBiff2\"> /u/LordBiff2 </a> <b",

It&#39;s a year in the life of a regular serf woman, told entirely from her POV as she goes about her day taking care of her family, working, dealing with hardships like bad weather and illness, and interacting with her friends and fellow villagers. It&#39;s both cozy and depressing (in a fun way \ud83d\ude05), and refreshingly has no depictions of SA. I&#39;m dying to read mo",

I&#39;ve read countless books and articles on the topic, but most of them felt too theoretical. A friend recommended two books by the same author, and they\u2019ve been an absolute game-changer for me.</p> <p>The first is called &quot;The Fill-In-The-Blank Method&quot; and the second is &quot;Beat The Beat Sheet.&quot; They both focus on the idea that writing is a craft with a process, not just a burst of inspiration. They helped me stop staring at a blank page and actually start building the story one piece at a time.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure if this is normal for writing books, but it&#39;s been really cool to see them consistently ranking as top sellers on Amazon in the screenwriting and reference categories. It&#39;s a testament to how effective and practical the advice is.</p> <p>I&#39;m recommending these because they completely changed my mindset",
