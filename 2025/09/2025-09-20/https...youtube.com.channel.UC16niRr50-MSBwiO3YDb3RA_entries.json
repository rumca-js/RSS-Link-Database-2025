        "description": "A British couple detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months have arrived back in the UK after being released.\n \nPeter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbie, 76, who lived in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, landed at Heathrow Airport, on a flight from Doha.\n \nThey were reunited with their daughter in Qatar on Friday. Their son Jonathan Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was \"ecstatic and massively grateful\" to those who were involved in securing their release.\n \nThe Taliban, who detained the couple on 1 February, said the pair had broken Afghan laws and were released after judicial proceedings - but the Islamist group has never disclosed a reason for their detention.\n \nPeter and Barbie Reynolds married in Kabul in 1970 and spent the past 18 years running a charitable training programme that had been approved by local Taliban officials when the armed group reclaimed power in 2021.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and ",

A Nato spokesperson said it was \"yet another example of reckless Russian behaviour and Nato's ability to respond\".\n \nRussia denied violating Estonian airspace. But tensions have been escalating recently, after Poland and Romania - both Nato members - said Russian drones breached their airspace.\n \nArticle 4 of the Nato treaty formally starts urgent consultations within the 32-member alliance, which ties the US and many European nations together on collective defence.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#Nato #Estonia #BBCNews",
