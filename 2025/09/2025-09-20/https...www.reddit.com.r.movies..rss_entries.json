Today he chose Frailty. At first I thought it was going to be a boring movie that I would watch just for the sake of watching a movie of his choice with him. But fortunately, Frailty is one of those &quot;few exceptions&quot;. This movie is SO GOOD. I&#39;m surprised it isn&#39;t more popular. The story was gripping, the pacing was certainly slow but never enough to be boring, the performances are great (RIP Bill Paxton), and the final twist was good too. I was completely in awe while watching it, I totally expected it to get worse at some point but it&#39;s actually really consistent in my opinion.

How many action movies can you count where people chase eachother with tuktuks?!</p> <p>Like I said in the title what really makes this movie stand out to me is the fact that Tony&#39;s really hitting his opponents and it genuinely shows. The stunt guys are always wearing big wigs, hats, beanies, or layered clothing to hide the protective pads their wearing. It&#39;s nuts. The fight choreography is gorgeous in this, Tony Jaa&#39;s movement is so fluid and rhythmic, he really brought out the beauty of Muay Thai.</p> <p>The story is also pretty decent, the simple story of a country bumpkin having to team up with a scummy city slicker to return hope back to their village is pretty cute.</p> <p>I think it&#39;s a tie for me between the fight club battles and the final fight for the best fi",
