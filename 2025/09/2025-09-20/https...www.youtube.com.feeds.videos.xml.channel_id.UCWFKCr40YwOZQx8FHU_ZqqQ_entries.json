        "description": "I honestly had no idea it would happen this way... But here we are. Congrats to Apple for making the invincible iPhone Air - if you want to protect your frame from scratches, or glass from drops, grab a dbrand Ghost case here: https://www.dbrand.com/shop/iphone-air and use the code 'JERRYRIG' to get 42% off the Prism when you buy the screen protector and the case. \n\nPersonally im a fan of the ultra thin phones. Its cool that Apple is out here trying something new. Even if they do make it invincible. They're trying to put me out of a job - but stronger iPhones are better for everyone! \n\nWould you buy the new iPhone air? What are they going to call the next generation iPhone Air? \n\nBuy one large JerryRig knife and get a small knife FOR FREE (no limit) https://www.JerryRigKnife.com",
