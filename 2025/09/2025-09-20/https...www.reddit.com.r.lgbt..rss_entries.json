My partner and friend are being called terrorists(and I suppose her gf and I are accessories by association) while we\u2019re picking paint colors for the living room and watching stupid reality tv together and cuddling with our pets. What I\u2019m about to say is obvious to all of us, I know. But oh my fucking god we are just people. Not an agenda or a plot, just people. I\u2019m surrounded by so much love while the world tells me that our existence is the root of all evil and it\u2019s so frustrating and dumbfounding and I just want to scream sometimes. These feelings were always there but they\u2019ve been hitting like a truck lately\u2026.I can\u2019t imagine I\u2019m the only one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bored-in-bed\">",

What the fuck is that? Has TikTok blocked the use of trans and pride flags in their comments? I&#39;m positive I&#39;ve seen them used many times before.</p> <p>I don&#39;t want to jump to conclusions or make wild assumptions based on what could be a glitch or something, but this feels weird and alarming in the new era where trans people and allies are essentially being designated as terrorists.

I was just waking up from another fitful night of sleep and couldn&#39;t get my worries out of my head. Your kindness ended up being a source of comfort over the last few days, which have been very painful. While I didn&#39;t necessarily use the Lambda link that was most highly recommended, I appreciated the idea of seeking LGBT specific organizations in my area (Oklahoma) for guidance. I suppose a quick recap of my previous post could be summed up as my darling non-binary child who is about 17 (I&#39;m being mildly flexible with identifying details for their safety) was forced by their father to come out which resulted in extreme levels of fear over the idea of returning to their father&#39;s home after essentially being threatened all because they stated clearly that they are a &quot;they&quot; and wish to be identified by a different name",
