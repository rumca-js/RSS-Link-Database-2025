The music I like includes a lot of old/obscure stuff which seemed to have a tendency for disappearing! So the past few years I&#39;ve been backing up the whole thing using yt-dlp and it&#39;s been brilliant. There&#39;s half a dozen times where it&#39;s saved the day - video&#39;s disappeared from YT and I&#39;ve got the smug satisfaction of knowing I&#39;ve still got it saved \ud83e\udd23 (E.g. the last one that vanished was a music video of an extended version of Queen&#39;s &quot;Breakthru&quot;.)</p> <p>In case it&#39;s any use for inspiration, I&#39;ve pasted my conf file below.

Just wondering if anyone would be nice enough to help me install yt-dlp with a-shell app as I can\u2019t seem to find a good tutorial on how to install it via iPhone, I want to use it to download Instagram reels &amp; stories as I save stories and reels from the whole of Griselda / BSF as they\u2019re my favourite artists / group but for some reason the quality on Instagram is so bad now when downloading stories and reels &amp; was hoping to try &amp; install this as I\u2019ve heard that this could be my best option to get higher quality downloads but I\u2019m not so much of a tech savvy guy when it comes to all this with phones so if anyone can possibly link me a tutorial or help me install it on my iPhone it would be much appreciated! I have tried but it seems the commands Google has given me doesn\u2019t work for some reason &amp; I\u2019m not to sure if they\u2019re up to date or whatever, thanks ever so much! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfff</p> </div>",
