But this was my first metroidvania and I can tell the genre isn\u2019t for me.</p> <p>I got the base ending and after looking up what I have to do to get to super mega true ending, I can\u2019t be bothered. 1. It feels tedious (to me, not the game itself) and 2. Im extremely salty about losing 13k Geos and I don\u2019t want to grind them back.</p> <p>So, for whatever reason, what\u2019s a game you know is good/great but you refuse to and/or I guess can\u2019t beat.

The last new game I played was Tears of the Kingdom on my OG switch. I had played GTA V on my old laptop a few years back and I thought it was nice looking game but nothing could have prepared me for this. I set all my settings to extreme and I was getting around 30+ FPS but holy shit did it look beautiful. After I got over how good it looked I dropped the setting to get around 60 FPS. I&#39;m sure I can do better but since I&#39;m new to amazing graphics and having a choice about FPS this is a good compromise. The game does feel a little advance for my old ass ( I grew up on games that didn&#39;t give you these many options and I&#39;m new to real PC gaming). </p> <p>Now I want to get other games like RDR2 and BG3 but baby steps </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/iamwhoiwasn",
