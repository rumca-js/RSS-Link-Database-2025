I have an old 4 bay Synology DS423 but I want something that&#39;s more modular or allows me more freedom to change it and use it for various different things, because I know Synology has fallen out of favor after they tried to lock things down more. Or should I just build a mini-ITX PC and have it filled with dozens of hard drives and have my own custom/linux or network OS on it and just cut out the middle man?</p> <p>In terms of budget I don&#39;t mind spending a little more, but I can&#39;t afford a large professional rack mount system that would costs tens of thousands of dollars and takes up a lot of space, because I&#39;m running it out of my house.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bertrum\"> /u/Bertrum </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
