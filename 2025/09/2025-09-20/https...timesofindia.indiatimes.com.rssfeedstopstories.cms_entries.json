        "description": "The US department of labour has launched \"Project Firewall\" to target H-1B visa misuse, aligning with President Trump's \"America First\" agenda. This initiative aims to protect American workers by scrutinising companies hiring foreign employees and ensuring fair wages. The secretary of labour will personally oversee investigations, with violators facing penalties like back wage repayment and program debarment, impacting industries heavily reliant on H-1B workers, especially Indian nationals.",
