        "description": "Atomfall Red Strain is a pretty notable improvement from The Wicked Isle DLC. The new zone is much more interesting to explore and the added enemy types and fresh weaponry is more dynamic and fun. \n\nAnd while some old woes remain unchanged here, there\u2019s at least far less backtracking this time around. If you only have the budget to pick up one DLC for Atomfall, The Red Strain is the better option of the two.",

        "description": "Helldivers 2 continues to build on its unexpected success with its launch on Xbox, and it\u2019s a better time than ever to jump into the Galactic War and spread Managed Democracy. \n\nEven though it may be an overwhelming amount of content for solo players and newcomers, especially with its Warbonds, this is the type of multiplayer shooter that makes me want to continue progressing long past the point where I unlock every Stratagem or without purchasing a new battle pass. \n\nHelldivers 2 makes it as fun as possible to send in bombs and rain down bullets on hordes of bugs and robots, and it\u2019s about time we get back to the Galactic War and continue fighting for Liberty.",

        "description": "Little Nightmares 3 is poised to redefine the much-loved horror platformer\u2019s formula. The familiar ingredients are still here: grotesque monsters, surreal environments, and signature suffocating atmospheres, but with a new studio at the helm in Supermassive Games. \n\nThe biggest change is the inclusion of fully-fledged co-operative gameplay, a community requested feature that has forced a ground-up re-think on puzzle design, combat encounters, and exploration. \n\nPlayers now control a brand new duo of unfortunate heroes - Low and Alone - each equipped with their own signature item that\u2019ll prove crucial to the pair surviving the lurid nightmare in which they\u2019ve awakened. Sinister new Residents conjure themes of authority and anxiety, whilst a post-launch model is set to continue the story beyond the threequel. \n\nThis video outlines 15 key differences between Little Nightmares 3 and its predecessor, and what this means for new and returning fans.",
