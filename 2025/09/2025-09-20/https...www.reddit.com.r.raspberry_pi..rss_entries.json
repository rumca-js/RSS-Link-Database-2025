I appreciate any guidance or tips.</p> <p>I want to build a simple DIY camera. I did some research, I already read a few guides and watched some tutorials, and I&#39;ve gathered this list of components:</p> <ol> <li>Raspberry Pi Zero W</li> <li>Camera Module 3</li> <li>22-pin Camera Cable (Pi Zero compatible)</li> <li>LED RGB for feedback</li> <li>SD Card</li> <li>Button</li> <li>PiSugar S 1200mAh battery</li> <li>3D Printed Case</li> </ol> <p>I want the camera to be portable so I can take pictures wherever I want. The plan is to use the button for taking photos and power on/off, and the LED for photo confirmation and status indicators.</p> <p>Will the PiSugar S work well for making it portable?<br/> Am I missing anything important?</p> <p>Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",
