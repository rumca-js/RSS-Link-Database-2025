The app is built using Flutter &amp; Dart. The idea though was to make the app accessible for the layman, feel magical, and make common sense recipes for folks short on time. It also has a grocery lists feature that lets users easily search ingredients found in their local grocery store(starting with Kroger&#39;s QFC). Users can share &amp; collaborate on the list with partners &amp; housemates. </p> <p>I have some fun ideas regarding a physical inventorying system that syncs with the app using RFID that I\u2019m also toying with for a future release, as well as some fun integrations planned with grocery store APIs to make sure folks can easily re-stock their pantry/fridge with ingredients from recipes that they really liked. </p> <p>It&#39;s current for iOS only: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/recipepal-pro/id6476252066?platfor",
