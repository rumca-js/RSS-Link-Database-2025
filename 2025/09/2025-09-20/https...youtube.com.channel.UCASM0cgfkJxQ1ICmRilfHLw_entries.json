We\u2019ll look at what\u2019s actually driving high earners to consider leaving, how tax policy shapes behavior, and why trust in government and value for money matter just as much as the top rate.\n\nAlong the way, we\u2019ll separate myth from reality, compare the UK\u2019s approach to countries like Sweden and Switzerland, and ask what history can teach us about taxing globally mobile wealth.\n\nIf you want to understand the real story behind the millionaire migration debate\u2014and what it means for Britain\u2019s future\u2014watch now.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nTax Policy Associates - Why the rich paid less tax in the 1970s \u2013 despite 98% tax rates: http",
