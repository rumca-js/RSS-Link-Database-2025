I\u2019m sorry for suggesting Palestinians shouldn\u2019t be systematically exterminated while Donald Trump posts about <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309695/trump-gaza-video\">building a resort in Gaza</a>.

What can other countries learn from this \u2018ground zero\u2019 of misogyny? </p><p>On a November evening in 2023, in the South Korean city of Jinju, a woman called On Ji-goo was working the late shift at a convenience store when a young man stormed in, aggressively knocking items off the shelves. When she asked him to be careful, he turned to her, saying, \u201cI\u2019m angry to my bones right now, so don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>The situation escalated. When On tried to call for help, he seized her phone and threw it in the store\u2019s microwave. She tried to stop him and he grabbed her by the collar and arms, dragging her several metres while slamming her into display shelves. It was the start of a brutal assault. Throughout it, he repeatedly said he \u201cnever hits women\u201d but feminists \u201cdeserve to be beaten\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/20/inside-saturday-south-ko",

Under the trees, autumn arrives as a scent; the smell of damp decay, as the summer plants give way to fungi.</p><p>To the mycophile, this forest funk is a call to action, a reminder that mycelium in the leaf litter is proliferating and preparing to fruit. And so, as a self-confessed mushroom lover, I find myself, basket in hand, contemplating the scentscape of this shaded woodland. There is something different here, though, a sickly note of rotting flesh amid the background odour. Most would walk on, fearing a macabre scene, but recognising the olfactory calling card of a very special mushroom, I start to search.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/se",
