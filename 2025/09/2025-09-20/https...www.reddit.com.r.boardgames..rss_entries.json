It&#39;s location is in Border Space, so the location was invluded in the base game. The only reason the Blue Sun icon would make sense. is if the card was released with the Blue Sun expansion, but Blue Sun came out before Kalidasa so that couldn&#39;t have happened.</p> <p>Is the Blue Sun icon a misprint that no one caught?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BriMan83\"> ",

Got everything for Root finally, got my Dune Imperium expansions, and finally got around to grabbing Jaws of the Lion and played it but mostly just wanted it for new added characters to my base Gloomhaven. So overall my three would probably be Root,Dune and Elder Scrolls Betrayal of the Second Era.
