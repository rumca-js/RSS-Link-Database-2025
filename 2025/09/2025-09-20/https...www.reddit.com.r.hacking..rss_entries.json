After installation, I have 30 days of a free period (a time-limited version). During this time the whole program is in the full version. After that time the program becomes inactive.</p> <p>I figured out myself that this program is protected by Cryptlex. If I reinstall Windows and this program, then again I will have 30 days of the trial version, but it makes no sense to install a new system every 30 days. Therefore, I have questions:</p> <ol> <li>how does the Cryptlex protection work? I suppose that the program saves somewhere the start date of the license \u2013 maybe in the Windows registry or somewhere else?<br/> <ol> <li>how to find this place and where is it located?<br/></li> <li>I will look for the file cryptlex activator.dll myself and probably it ",
