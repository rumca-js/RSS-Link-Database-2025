I mainly bought four under the assumption that one might be DOA as I\u2019m wary of buying recertified/refurbished (price was irresistible), but I\u2019m considering keeping all four as opposed to just two if they all pass SMART long and there\u2019s an enticing RAID option you can recommend.</p> <p>What are some good options for me? They\u2019d be used in a OWC ThunderBay 4 connected via thunderbolt 3. My current media collection takes up about 23 TB (lots of 4KUHD rips). The library is constantly updated with new movies and shows, so maintaining good write speeds is a plus.</p> <p>Options that don\u2019t require all four would be great (save me some money) but I\u2019d consider using all four if it means I never have to worry about space again.</p> <p>Usage would be two streams at most at the same time. No encoding.</p> <p>Thanks for the help!</p> </div",
