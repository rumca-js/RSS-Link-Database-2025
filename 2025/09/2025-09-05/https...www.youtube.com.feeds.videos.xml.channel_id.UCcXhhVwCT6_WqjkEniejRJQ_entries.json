        "description": "We started a new collaboration project on the Marble Machine Engineering Server.\nIf you want to contribute with CAD design, you are more than welcome to the server here:\nhttps://discord.gg/CjkA5cNK\n\nThank you to everyone who has already submitted designs, I am truly grateful for everyone's efforts especially at this time. This project has already taught me a lot about how to collaborate with The Wintergatan Internet Team on a large scale. Very promising dress rehearsal ahead of the future Marble Machine Collaborations :)\n\nHannes has been on to me about dropping the ball on my daughters name though, she isn't going to be named Marbelle despite all Hannes efforts ;)\n\nThank you Elisabeth for always being there for me and for bringing our daughter to the world.\n\n/Martin\n\nSupport Wintergatan:\n- Patreon \u25ba https://patreon.com/Wintergatan\n- Youtube membership \u25ba https://bit.ly/4cQVM7C\n\nVideo edited By Martin and Hannes from the Trainerds YouTube Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/TRAINERDS\n\n\u2014\n",
