        "description": "I Played Crimson Desert AGAIN - NEW GAMEPLAY Impressions\nIn this video, I'm going to be talking about my hands-on impressions with Crimson Desert. I got to play at Gamescom about two weeks ago again. Played this game at Gamescom last year. I played this game at the Tokyo Game Show last year. This is a game that I cannot get my hands on enough times. It's so good. If you haven't heard, this game was actually delayed from releasing later this year and releasing in the first quarter of next year. We don't have an exact release date yet, but it's not going to be too much further until this game releases.\n\nTimestamps\n0:00  Crimson Desert Gamescom Preview\n0:28  New gameplay Sequence\n1:26 Massive Game World\n1:56 Castle Siege\n3:51 Fighting multiple enemies\n4:35 Boss Fight\n7:08 Graphics\n8:31 Combat\n10:05 Controls\n10:51 Final Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https:/",
