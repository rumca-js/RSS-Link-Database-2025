Denmark could justify leaving the 33-year-old out of their squad for the meetings with Scotland and Greece on the basis he remains unemployed. Yet as Denmark huffed, puffed and failed to unpick a magnificently drilled Scotland defence, the issue of what Eriksen could have contributed was such an obvious one. Denmark in this form will not play at next summer\u2019s World Cup.</p><p>Steve Clarke\u2019s Scotland were well worthy of their point. But for a lack of composure in front of goal, they would have departed Copenhagen with all three. The winners from this opening night of a truncated section were the Greeks, who swept Belarus aside, but Scotland richly deserved their full-time ovation from an appreciative support, while Denmark were booed off.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/05/denmark-scotland-world-cup-qualifying-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

Here\u2019s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>The joke is on journalism in this mockumentary by the writers of the US version of The Office, with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant as executive producers. Cameras follow life at the Toledo Truth Teller, a historic midwestern newspaper that now only prides itself on articles about how much Ben Affleck tips. But Domhnall Gleeson\u2019s Ned Sampson comes in as editor to shake things up. Look out for The White Lotus star Sabrina Impacciatore, whose comedy chops once again steal the show. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/05/tv-tonight-domhnall-gleeson-tries-to-save-a-failing-newspaper-in-new-mockumentary\">Continue reading...</a>",
