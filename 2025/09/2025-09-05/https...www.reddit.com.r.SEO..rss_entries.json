Initially the writing new content wasn&#39;t that frequent, but still could get 50-100 views on each post, mainly through social media connections. I worked on getting some generic backlinks, but getting backlinks from the Language learning websites, especially German ones, is extremely difficult. Either very few to no broken links across sites, or I do not get any response from the website. Simultaneously, Duolingo, busuu, Tandem, Preply, etc, big players will always get the first 20 results with their organic backlinking by various blogs.</p> <p>Even after ~30-40 topically relevant backlinks, some organic traffic as well, it still falls super-short in front of all the giants. I&#39;m ranking between 55-70 on Google. Though on Bing, I rank &lt;10 for all the pages. Some pages even have 20",

While cloudflare is working on a paywall solution, some further providers (like tollbit) are already in the market offering scraping bot paywalls. My question is, do these paywalls actually work? Or is it so far rather a glorified AI bot blocker? In theory the scraping bot will be forward to a third party domain with a paywall where a payment must be made before it is able to access the content of the respective website. How would a scraping bot even pay? Or would it just rather stop \u201escraping\u201c this website instead? I would assume that can only work with solid contracts in palace between the paywalls and the AI provider. I have never heard of such.
