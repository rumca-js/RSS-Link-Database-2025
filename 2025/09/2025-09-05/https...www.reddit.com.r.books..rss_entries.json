Both confront us with the possibility that consciousness is not what we think it is, maybe not even necessary, maybe not even rare, but they reach those conclusions from very different starting points. Watts, in Blindsight, gives us intelligence without awareness. His alien encounters suggest that consciousness isn\u2019t an evolutionary trump card but a noisy add-on, a liability that slows reaction time and clouds efficiency. If entities can perceive, act, and adapt without the drag of self-awareness, then what is the value of our inner theater? Watts\u2019 horror is that consciousness might be maladaptive, an accident we\u2019ve mistaken for essence. Egan, especially in Permutation City and Wang\u2019s Carpets, goes the other direction. His Dust Theory proposes that consciousness doesn\u2019t require a continuous physical substrate at all. If the right computational pattern exists, eve",
