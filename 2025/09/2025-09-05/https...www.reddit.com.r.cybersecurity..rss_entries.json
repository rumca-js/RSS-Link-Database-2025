While I\u2019ve grasped the basics, I often find myself feeling underconfident and anxious when new alerts come in\u2014especially when others are busy handling incidents and I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.</p> <p>To overcome this, I\u2019ve started exploring what skills, tools, and knowledge areas I should focus on to build confidence and eventually work like a senior SOC analyst. I\u2019d love to hear from those who\u2019ve been through this phase:</p> <ul> <li>What helped you transition from a junior to a senior SOC role?</li> <li>Are there specific certifications, labs, or resources you recommend?</li> <li>How did you build confidence in handling alerts and incidents independently?</li> </ul> <p>Any advice or personal experiences would be incredibly helpful. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",

(skills, certifications, work history, specialties, community contributions, etc.)<br/> \ud83d\udc49 For <em>companies</em>, beyond the basics (services, size, contact info), what features would actually help you decide whether they\u2019re credible?<br/> \ud83d\udc49 Are there existing directories you use \u2014 and what do you wish they did better?</p> <p>I\u2019m aiming to go beyond a simple listing and build something that truly adds value to both professionals and customers. Your input will directly shape this project. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",

Besides, the company does not have CISO. Thank you for any feedback</p> <p>Edit: it is a lot bigger than small shop.
