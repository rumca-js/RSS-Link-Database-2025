Anyway, for a while, I have been searching for gaming on Linux. I&#39;m aware of Proton and Steam, but I&#39;m not a fan of WINE; it feels like I should just run a VM.</p> <p>Anyways, if you&#39;re into gaming, especially indie gaming, check out <a href=\"https://itch.io/\">itch.io</a>. There are free games available some on browser, but also, native Linux games. I downloaded &quot;Crank It!&quot; which is a game about being left stranded at the bottom of an elevator shaft in a mine, and you&#39;ve got to crank to charge batteries. The <em>graphics and sound surprised me</em>, <strong>and</strong> it was one ELF file. And some are available through Web browser too.</p> <p>My main driver hosts are Debian (bookworm/release) and Fedora Workstation.</p> <p>Happy gaming.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I recently started messing around with something called 1Browser \u2014 kind of stumbled on it while looking for better ways to handle multiple accounts without getting flagged. What caught my attention is that it gives you up to 20 browser profiles for free, and each one can run on a separate IP using built-in proxies or basic VPN options (also free for a few profiles).</p> <p>I\u2019m honestly surprised it\u2019s not mentioned more often in these discussions. It feels like a pretty decent option if you\u2019re not trying to pay for a full-on antidetect browser or stack a bunch of VPN subscriptions.</p> <p>Has anyone here actually used it for a while? I\u2019m mainly curious how reliable the proxies are, whether there are any major fingerprinting leaks, and how it compares to traditional VPNs for basic privacy stuff.</p> <p>Would love to hear any real experiences \u2014 still figuring out if it\u2019s worth building into my workflow or just a short-term tool.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",
