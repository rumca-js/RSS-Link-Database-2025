I do know how to configure serial interfaces such as I2C and UART in my RPi4B through the config.txt file. The thing is, I usually find this method, not flexible enough for my applications, even more so when I&#39;m running a headless raspberry pi, I do know some dtoverlays can be loaded at runtime, but I&#39;ve tested using dtoverlay for these hardware peripherals, and apparently these modules are configurable only at boot.</p> <p>I&#39;ve done some research, and apparently the RPi linux kernel receives a Device Tree, and based on that it loads the kernel modules that correspond to the hardware mapping received from the DT. From my understanding boot.txt helps making this DT and setting up some firmware before the kernel even starts running. Does that mean that even If I were to program in the kernel space, I wouldn&#39;t be able to let&#39;s say, change th",

Can I do both of these things on a single Pi 5? It looks like my options for google play are Lineage or Emetria. I wanted to check here to see if this was a feasible plan before I start ordering things and jumping into my first Pi build. Thanks! I was planning on getting an 8gb Pi 5 that will be dedicated to just this build and the 2 functions above.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TrueEclective\"> /u/TrueEclective </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1n95gv6/pi_5_ips_touchscreen_for_granboard_google_play/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1n95gv6/pi_5_ips_touchscreen_for_granboard_google_play/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I bought a raspberry Pi 5 8gb this month and I was thinking to buy a Monitor for it but I found out about ssh so i thought of using it with my laptop wirelessly through ssh and vnc. So I flashed rpi os 64bit through my pendrive and proceeded and I got success and I used ssh two to three times but now when I tried doing the same the pi didn&#39;t connect to my laptop&#39;s hotspot network. I tried reflashing raspbian os multiple times. I also changed os but the end result was the same. I also tried switching my wifi from laptop to my phone but again it didn&#39;t worked. But since I don&#39;t have a monitor for this to do I have to do everything wirelessly therefore, it is necessary for the pi to connect automatically to my wifi to proceed with ssh. I have the ip address of my pi as I had done ssh vnc two three times with this. Can anyone help me figuring it out how to restart ssh on my Pi 5, like is there something th",
