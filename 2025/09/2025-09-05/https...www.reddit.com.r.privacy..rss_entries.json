But I need some other to use on the guest profile. I don&#39;t want to use my number for this, Briar keeps carrying the infinite contact I don&#39;t know why, and Simplex says that I can not install because someone else has already installed on the device. Session and Element are very decentralized in addition to that neither of the two has PFS.</p> <p>So what could be another very good alternative?</p> <p>I don&#39;t need anything really perfect. But some other approach would really be useful besides these 5.</p> <p>Some good things would be:</p> <p>E2EE Open Source (preference hearing) PFS . No telemetry</p> <p>None of them is mandatory. But they are desirable characteristics.</p> <p>Anyway. Do you know any good too?
