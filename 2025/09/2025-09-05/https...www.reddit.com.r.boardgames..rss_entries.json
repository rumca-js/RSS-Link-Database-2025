I love playing boardgames with friends and family.</p> <p>I have a bunch of boardgames, card games, table games etc. to play with my loved ones. I reside in the United States, but my parents mainly speak Spanish. They only use English when they have to. This has made playing certain boardgames with then difficult, especially those that involve lots of language use, which is most boardgames, really. Playing Scrabble without the \u00f1 and Connect four gets boring after a while. They&#39;re also not my favorites. I&#39;ve tried to search for Spanish language table games on Amazon US and eBay US, but with no luck for the games that I want. So, I&#39;m asking if any of you guys know if there is a website or something to get American board game in Spanish, even if its a just the big classics like monopoly. It would help a ton.

What did you like, what did you not like as much?</p> <p>I bought Twisted Cryptids (Exclusive) as my first Kickstarter. Probably going to be my only Kickstarter, since customs and shipping (to Norway) doubled the price for the game. I am trying to gather a couple of my friends to play it, but it takes time.</p> <p>It looks like a fun game with a little bit of strategy to it, and that matches with the few reviews I have seen or read. Have played Unstable Unicorns and liked it as a fun party game. We have Here to Slay, but have not been able to play it yet.</p> <p>Thank you in advance for all replies!</p> <p>For reference here are some board games I enjoy (both light and medium+ strategy):<br/> - Ticket to Ride<br/> - Bunny Kingdom<br/> - 7 Wonders (Duel)<br/> - Trekking through History<br/> - Under ",

But when a character power says that &quot;when ... is present&quot;, do they mean in the same location (like north ithilien or the shire) where an attack occurs or where a character is, not the region (gondor, mist mountains etc) right?
