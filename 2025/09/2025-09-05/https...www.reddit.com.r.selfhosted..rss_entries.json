After lots of investigation I finally managed to get my first OpenCloud server up and running in my +20yrs potato laptop! It&#39;s only 1Gb RAM with slow USB disks on RAID1 and yet OpenCloud shows transfer speeds &gt;10Mb/s. Really impressed!</p> <p>I also had to code a service to keep the server alive at all times after AC outages, since this potato lacks WakeOnLan (WOL) nor a BIOS boot timer. Of course it&#39;s FOSS, and you can get it for your potato too: <a href=\"https://github.com/pablogila/WakeMyPotato\">https://github.com/pablogila/WakeMyPotato</a></p> <p>Thanks a lot to the devs and to the awesome community in the forums who helped me realise my mistakes! It&#39;s been a great learning experience and now I have a super cool potato server up and running at home :D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pgilah\"> /u/pgilah </a",

Everything is stable I have a good backup strategy but im just tired of managing it. There will always be some random issue that I have to sink time after work into I mean not always but occasionally and im just wondering is it really worth it? I moved on premise to have full data privacy for email, family photos, password manager, nextcloud storage. Should I keep going or should I move back to cloud services and just accept the reality of the major IT players scannig through our data to sell information and the possibility of accounts being compromised.
