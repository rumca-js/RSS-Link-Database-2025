My parents see being a femboy as a problem, and they accuse me of harming them just by existing as their son. They want to send me to another psychiatrist even though my current one actually helps me.</p> <p>They made me throw away all my clothes and makeup. When I didn\u2019t tell them where I had hidden the rest, they screamed at me for an hour and threatened to hurt me. My brother, who has caused me trauma before, is defended by my mom, who also calls me a liar.</p> <p>What hurts the most is that my dad, who used to care about me, now believes my mom\u2019s lies. She spends his money on luxury items and gifts for my brother, while making me out to be the problem.</p> <p>I feel sad and empty, but I know I\u2019m not the problem.
