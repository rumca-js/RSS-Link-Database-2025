        "description": "Gold is the most expensive it's ever been. On September 2, 2025, the precious metal hit $3,508.50 per ounce. And this isn\u2019t the first time \u2014 its price has hit record highs several times this year. The high price is prompting more people to invest in gold \u2014 buying it from Costco, selling jewelry, and extracting it from electronic waste. But this modern-day gold rush is also leading to consequences in Africa's gold-rich nations.
