        "description": "Every cell in your body takes up 3GB of data and the average body has about 30 trillion cells! That means you\u2019re walking around with around 90 zettabytes of data just by existing. This means you could theoretically store all of the world\u2019s data in just two humans - but you\u2019d have to remove that genome data first! DNA is like a data bank which stores the instructions for how to make a replica of you, down to the smallest possible detail.",
