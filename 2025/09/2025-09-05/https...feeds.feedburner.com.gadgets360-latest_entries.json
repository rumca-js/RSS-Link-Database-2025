The S26 Edge stands out with a new rectangular camera island, while the Pro and Ultra keep a vertical pill-shaped rear camera design. A circular ring on the back suggests Qi2 wireless charging support, a first for Samsung flagships. Notably, dummies are based on leaks and may differ from final models. The Galaxy S26 series is expected in February 2026.",
