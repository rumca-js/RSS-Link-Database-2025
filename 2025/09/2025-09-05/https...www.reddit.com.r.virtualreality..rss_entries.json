I remember reading that OLED screens can be calibrated to remove the mura, by measuring the output of each pixel and then adjusting in software to negate the mura, or something.</p> <p>And I&#39;ve heard of other OLED screens with full subpixels.</p> <p>Being too dim for pancake lenses is another issue, but is it possible to develop a higher brightness regular OLED somehow? Alternatively, use them in aspheric lense headsets. </p> <p>Or is it just that no manufacturer is making or developing suitable OLED screens anymore?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zeddyzed\"> /u/zeddyzed </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1n8qnr5/why_did_regular_oled_screens_fall_",
