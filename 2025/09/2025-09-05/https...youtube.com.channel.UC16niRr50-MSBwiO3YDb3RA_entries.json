        "description": "Today, Angela Rayner has resigned from her role as deputy prime minister after an investigation concluded she had breached the UK governments' ministerial code by underpaying stamp duty on a flat in Hove. The Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer accepted her resignation \"with real sadness\".\n\nThe report into Rayner\u2019s conduct concluded she had \u2018acted with integrity\u2019 but had failed to meet the standards of the ministerial code by not looking for expert tax advice. Her resignation triggered a major cabinet reshuffle with former foreign secretary, David Lammy replacing her as deputy prime minister. Her resignation is also likely to spark a contest for the role of deputy leader of the Labour party. \n\nJames Cook is joined by Chris Mason and Laura Kuenssberg, to chat who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out, and how \u2018Phase Two\u2019 is shaping up for the Government.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #UKGovernment #Politics",
