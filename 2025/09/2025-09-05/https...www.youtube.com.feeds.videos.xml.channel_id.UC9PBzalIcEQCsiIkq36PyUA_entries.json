Join the DF Supporter Program and support the team: https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx\n\nCyberpunk 2077 was impressive on Switch 2 but Ubisoft Red Lynx and Ubisoft Massive take things a step forward with a hugely impressive port of Star Wars Outlaws for Switch 2. Hardware-accelerated RT, DLSS, high output resolutions, solid performance - this is the most impressive demonstration of Switch 2 technology we've yet seen. Oh, and it's a fantastic game too.\n\nGo here to check out DF merch! https://store.digitalfoundry.net\n\nSubscribe for more Digital Foundry: http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe\n\n00:00 Overview \n00:37 Switch 2 visual settings\n05:22 Image quality and performance\n08:43 Handheld mode \n10:52 Analysis and conclusion",
