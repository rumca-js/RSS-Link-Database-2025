You coached a college team, recruited high school players, set your lineup, and played the games. Two bars at the top of the screen advanced as the teams scored. You could view stats at the end of the games. There were text files for First names and Last names, so we would edit those so we would have crazy player names. I haven&#39;t been able to find this game despite searching for it for 25 years. Even AI hasn&#39;t been able to help me find it.

Typically, we can downscale from a huge resolution and get rid of aliasing due to games being easy to run, so I don&#39;t think removing aliasing should be a part of the discussion. I hear some people say dldsr can give the appearance of more detail on lower textured games, but I am skeptical. I haven&#39;t tested much on old games but I never liked it on modern games if I can help needing to use it.</p> <p>So early 3d I would define as from like 1990&#39;s-2010 but no hard boundary.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TRIPMINE_Guy\"> /u/TRIPMINE_Guy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1n99msk/opinions_on_dldsr_for_early_3d/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1n99msk/opinions_on_dldsr_for_early_3d/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I need to know the name of a really old game that came in PC game collections (CD-ROMs) where you control an American plane on one side, and on the other, several North Korean planes appear, and you have to shoot them.
