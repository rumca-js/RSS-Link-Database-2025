        "description": "This year\u2019s NHL title from EA revamps the Be A Pro mode to impressive heights. The dynamic braodcast presentation and addition of milestone cutscenes contributes to this, but minor league play is a crucial step in the right direction.\n\nNHL 26 as a whole just feels more energetic and lively. But the on-ice gameplay isn\u2019t slacking behind either. Authentic NHL EDGE data helps stats and player behaviors match their real-life counterparts while improving AI. Goalies are also expanded with 80 new animations and smarter AI.\n\nAll in all, NHL 26 packs quite a bit of punch compared to the past five or so years. It\u2019s got better presentation, more fleshed out modes, and slightly improved loading times across the board.",

        "description": "Remember when all those indie titles announced delays after Hollow Knight: Silksong got a release date? How some people said it was unnecessary because the hype is completely overblown, or for some other similarly suspect reason? Now that Team Cherry's sequel is finally available across all platforms (and Game Pass), those delays were undoubtedly the right call. Because as soon as the clock struck 7 AM PST, the very second, Steam broke.\n\nThe front page still seemed accessible at the very least, but I couldn't access Silksong's Steam page. \u201cSomething went wrong, we were unable to service your request\u201d accompanied by these cartoon creatures that I didn't even know existed on Steam, and it continued like this for a few minutes. Then it was back up and wouldn't recognize the game in my cart, but by this point, I had already bought it on GOG. For however long, SteamDB revealed that the game was \u201csustaining a very high amount of traffic,\u201d which I've never seen before.",
