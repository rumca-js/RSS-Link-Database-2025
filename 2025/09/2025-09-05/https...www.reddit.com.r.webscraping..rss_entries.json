This would require typing keywords into the search bar, searching, then presenting the names, emails, etc. to me in a table. It may require clicking on &quot;next page&quot; to view more staff. Havent found anything that can reliably do this. Additionally, sometimes the sites will just be lists of staff and dont require searching key words - just looking for certain titles and giving me those staff members. </p> <p>Here is an example prompt I am working with unsuccessfully - Please thoroughly extract all available staff information from John Doe Elementary in Minnesota official website and all its published staff directories, including secondary and profile pages. The goal is to capture every person whose title includes or is related to &#39;social worker&#39;, &#39;counselor&#39;, or &#39;psychologist&#39;, with specific attention to all variations inc",
