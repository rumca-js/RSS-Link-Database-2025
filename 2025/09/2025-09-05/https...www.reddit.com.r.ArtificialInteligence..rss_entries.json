In just a couple of weeks, I\u2019ve learned a ton more than I expected. I even had a test this week that I prepped for almost entirely with AI and I actually did really well.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I keep wondering though: am I really learning, or is the AI just making me work less? I\u2019ve always thought learning had to involve some struggle, and if I\u2019m not struggling, maybe I\u2019m missing something. Or maybe this is just the new way of learning?

In English, long words often get split into multiple subword tokens (\u201cunbelievable\u201d un / believ / able), while Chinese characters often carry full semantic meaning and stay as single tokens. Fewer tokens = less compute.</p> <p>Semantic ambiguity. English words have tons of meanings; \u201cset\u201d has over 400 definitions. That likely adds more training overhead</p> <p>Messy internet data. English corpora (Reddit, Twitter, forums) are massive but chaotic. Som",

A prestigious organization wrote me to tell me they were considering my project for an opportunity they had in line, and I used Opus to work out my responses for that very specific and technical email conversation. After not hearing from them for a few days, I asked Opus to write a follow-up email with unrequested info and additional arguments that nobody asked for, and Opus straight up told me not to do it because I would look desperate and unprofessional and advised me to wait instead. It laid down the reasons why I shouldn\u2019t send the email, and it was right. I\u2019m really impressed with this, because I didn\u2019t ask it for advice on whether I should send it or not; it just told me not to write it. I\u2019ve been using Opus for about a month, but I think it just became my favorite LLM.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jpirizarry\"> /u/jpiriz",
