For example, the rom for Street Fighter IV on the PS3 is 10.5 GiB, but for the Xbox 360 this same game is only 6.4GiB. That&#39;s over 4GiB difference in size. Furthermore, there are ways to shrink Xbox 360 roms even more by removing the padding.</p> <p>Is it because PS3 uses bluray discs and that file format is just bigger? If so, does this also mean that PS3 versions of a game has better graphics? Or does the Xbox 360 version have the same graphics quality at a smaller filesize?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/looloo86\"> /u/looloo86 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1n9bdo9/ps3_vs_xbox_360_rom_filesize/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1n9bdo9/ps3_vs_xbox_360_rom_filesize/\">[comments]</a></span>",
