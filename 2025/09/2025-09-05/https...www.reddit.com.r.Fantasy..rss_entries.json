And they had a lot that tied them together for me in their depiction of this ancient earth magic of the UK, conflict between faerie and Christendom, and with Grossman&#39;s Merlin and Norrell&#39;s &quot;gentleman&quot; being this ancient evil magic force that represented something bad/powerful with connections to that primordial magic. </p> <p>I gobbled these mf books up. And part of me feels like the inclusion of these kinds of characters was a way to justify or contend with our modern world&#39;s destruction the mystical, numinous, ecological, earthly world. Like &quot;yea, it&#39;s sad that we have destroyed the faerie world and moved away from magic, but look they had super evil bad guys too&quot;. Just a thought. </p> <p>I also found out that Clarke got chronic fatigue symptoms after publishing Strange and Norrell which leads me to wonder if she made some kind of deal with the fae to make her book successful.

I really enjoy stories about how we understand and think about ourselves, which also informs the fiction I have attempted to write in my own time. The following is a slightly edited (for privacy) copy of my own review of Katabasis that I put up on my own social media.</p> <p>I first heard of this book around the time of finishing Babel, a book which at one time was my favourite of any I had read since coming back to reading for pleasure after finishing university (Maurice has since reclaimed that honour).

As a celebration, the judges are going through and ranking their favorites to come up with the ultimate SPBO Champion. This is my review of The Lost War. Currently, it&#39;s in 3rd place for the Weatherwax Report Rankings. However, all three of our top 10 got 9/10s when we first reviewed them, so it&#39;s splitting hairs at the top of the charts. </p> <p>This is a classic epic fantasy set in a medievalish world, which has a classic, more \u201chandwavey\u201d kind of magic. So, in theory, this should have broad appeal across fantasy reader fans. That said, if you\u2019re generally turned off by those sorts of books, I\u2019d argue it\u2019s still fresh and reads quickly and excitingly, rather than feeling tired and \u201cdone.\u201d</p> <p>This is a world healing from a war that ended not too long ago. There are economic hardships as much of the kingdom has e",

It doesn\u2019t have to be traditional high fantasy, just something with a rich world full of monsters, unique magic/rune systems, varied biomes, and engaging storylines. Since I also draw a lot, I\u2019d love books where the monsters and worlds are described in detail.</p> <p>Because I sometimes struggle with reading, I\u2019d prefer something more modern (so maybe not books from the 70s with really heavy English). I speak both German and English, so recommendations in either language would be great.</p> <p>Thanks a lot :))</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cosmouu\"> /u/Cosmouu </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
