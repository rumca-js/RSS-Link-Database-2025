Those are the words of the centre Tatyana Heard as England head into their final pool match of the Rugby World Cup with the aim of topping the group and equalling their own world record of consecutive wins. If the heavy favourites come away with a victory against Australia, they will extend their winning streak to 30 games.</p><p>Their previous 30-match run ended in the 2022 World Cup final defeat, which is the last time they were beaten. Discussions in the buildup to this tournament had been around whether it would be beneficial for England to have lost a game between the World Cups to bank a different experience. But that is not the mentality in the Red Roses camp and the defence coach, Sarah Hunter, says the current run of victories has not been brought up.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/abby-dow-and-england-n",
