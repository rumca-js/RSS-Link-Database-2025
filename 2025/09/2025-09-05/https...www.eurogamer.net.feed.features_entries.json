It's finally here. I've played about seven hours of it already. Whether it's exploring the first few screens of the world and happening upon Bone Bottom or plucking away at the first real test of a fight against Lace, the game uses the same formula as <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight\">Hollow Knight</a> and wields it to equally incredible effect.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/im-picking-it-up-a-lot-faster-hollow-knight-newcomers-and-veterans-respond-to-the-first-few-hours-of-silksong\">Read more</a></p>",

That's my early tip for <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong\">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, which I've been playing for an evening and a morning by this point. On a high ledge? Above a promising gap? Look down. Chances are the developers have put something just within visible range to guide you a little.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/already-im-convinced-hollow-knight-silksong-is-a-hymn-to-the-art-of-paying-attention-and-it-absolutely-rules\">Read more</a></p>",
