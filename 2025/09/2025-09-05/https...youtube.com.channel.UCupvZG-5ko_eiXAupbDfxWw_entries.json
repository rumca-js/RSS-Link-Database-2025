The economy added just 22,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3% from 4.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. August\u2019s job report also included a downward revision to June, which showed the US economy lost 13,000 jobs that month. It\u2019s the first negative employment month since December 2020, and it brings to an end what was the second-longest period of employment expansion on record. #CNN #News",
