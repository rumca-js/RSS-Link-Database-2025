I&#39;ve been doing retro-adjacent projects for a while (<a href=\"https://christopherdrum.itch.io\">like rebuilding VisiCalc and Eliza in Pico-8</a>). This week I&#39;ve launched a new retro-enthusiast project, a blog called Stone Tools. Unlike a great number of other blogs, this one focuses entirely and solely on retro productivity software.</p> <p>The first full post is about Deluxe Paint on the Amiga, in honor of the 40th anniversary of both the hardware and software. I work through tutorials learning the tools hands-on, and give my honest assessment of the software. The goal is to look at these programs with an open mind: what was it like to actually use them, and do they still have utility today?</p> <p>I don&#39;t cover games at all, just the tools people once used to get work done. Deluxe Paint was a serious workhorse in a huge number of projects professionally and also a deep, personal love back in the day. It felt like",
