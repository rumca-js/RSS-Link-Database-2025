Even though there&#39;s multiple, Amazon, Apple, Pandora and Spotify, they all have the mostly the same stuff and they&#39;re all free.

Avatar maybe, but every else, too much money thrown at it.)</p> <p>So anyway, my idea is taking all the Movies and TV Shows, Anime, etc into a single like library with 2",
