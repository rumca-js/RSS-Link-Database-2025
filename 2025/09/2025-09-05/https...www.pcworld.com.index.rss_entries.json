They were <em>weird</em>. Ancient laptops were often as large as desktop computers but only had tiny screens that could only display a few dozen characters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, progress ironed out the flaws and peculiarities of those first laptops\u2014and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/460772/the_ultrabook_revolution.html\">ultrabook trend of the 2010s</a> pushed laptops to their natural conclusion: thin, light, and anonymous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in 2025, a new trend has emerged. As Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm compete to provide more options, and as experimentation becomes less risky on certain fronts, the PC laptop arena has witnessed an explosion of laptops that are unique, unusual, and (in some cases) just plain odd. And if you ask me? I\u2019m loving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-pro",
