I have read essentially everything from Baldwin besides &quot;If Beale Street Could Talk&quot;, so maybe that&#39;s next. I don&#39;t know in particular what I love so much about it. Perhaps the writing style, the atmosphere, the characters (probably this), the subtlety? Apologies for the vagueness, just wondering if anyone has read it and found a book that they thought was comparable for whatever reason. It&#39;s just perfect in my estimation, and if you have not read it, DO SO NOW, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE BALDWIN ALREADY. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Medical_Animator9370\"> /u/Medical_Animator9370 </a> <br/",

Since then it\u2019s been only horror/thriller and mostly audiobook. The other day I picked up \u201cA Fable for the end of the World\u201d by Ava Reid- it\u2019s described as a \u201clesbian hunger games\u201d type book and honestly that\u2019s a fair description. I\u2019ve loved every moment of it and I\u2019m hoping for books/authors that are similar.

I have dabbled in some other books over the years that explore similar topics but have never been able to get all the way through - and I think it\u2019s because they tend to read more like a MBA textbook than something that has any sort of narrative scope to it.</p> <p>I would love recommendations for anything that focus on time management, networking/relationship building while still reading with a bit more of a narrative through-line.</p> <p>I am considering \u201cWhat They Teach You At Harvard Business School\u201d.</p> <p>Thank you for your thoughtfulness",

Every book I find is usually either predictable or the text just bores me\u2026.</p> <p>A pet peeve of mine is when I already know how the story is going to end. For example a short story I\u2019m currently reading is about a man who sells books and walks into a garden. From the beginning of the book we find out that there was once a child that drowned in the pool. And then the author tells us that he\u2019s being haunted by a child and feels some urge to fall into the water? The ending just feels obvious, I think some people enjoy reading how it play",
