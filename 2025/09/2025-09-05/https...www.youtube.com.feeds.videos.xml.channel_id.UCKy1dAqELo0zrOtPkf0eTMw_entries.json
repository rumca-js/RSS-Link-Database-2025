This week Daemon, Max, and Ryan discuss the latest PlayStation 6 rumors, which predict Sony's next gaming hardware to be a handheld like the Switch 2. Nintendo's Switch changed the gaming landscape, ushering in a wave of handheld competitors like the Valve Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and more. Now with Xbox officially jumping into the ring with the ROG Xbox Ally X, is it time for Sony to follow suit? No, the PlayStation Portal doesn't count. And what would benefit them more, a dedicated handheld like the PS Vita, or a hybrid with a dock like the Switch? Or maybe just stick with a powerful console and leave the handheld market to Nintendo?\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
