The dungeon-crawling RPG series has been an iconic part of gaming as a pioneer in Western RPGs, setting a foundation for others to follow and build upon. Diablo 2 created an entire subgenre of similar titles originally referred to as action-RPGs (Diablo pioneered and popularized real-time combat in isometric computer RPGs) but are now more commonly called ARPGs to avoid confusion with behind-the-back action-RPGs like The Witcher 3. Regardless of what term you use to describe them, these isometric RPGs all aim to recreate Diablo's satisfying gameplay loop with an emphasis on dungeon crawling, monster slaying, character-enhancing loot, and multiplayer features. However, it's definitely fair to say that some Diablo-likes are better than others.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In case you're looking for s",

Depending on how confident you feel, the game can be fairly challenging with its blend of real-time combat and action-RPG elements.
