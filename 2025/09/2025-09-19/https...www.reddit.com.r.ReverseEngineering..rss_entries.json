You\u2019ve got motivation, maybe even a plan, but no one to bounce thoughts off, no partner to build with, no group to keep you accountable. So\u2026 I started a Discord called Dreamers Domain Inside, we: Find partners to build projects or startups Share ideas + get real feedback Host group discussions &amp; late-night study voice chats Support each other while growing It\u2019s still small but already feels like the circle I was looking for. If that sounds like your vibe, you\u2019re welcome to join: link in my bio , Trust me it&#39;s worth it!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dreamhighdude1\"> /u/dreamhighdude1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://discord.gg/Fq4PhBTzBz\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1nldkrp/looking_for_like_minded_people/\">[comments]</a></span>",
