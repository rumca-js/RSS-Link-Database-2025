I&#39;m just over 25 hours in and I&#39;m really enjoying it. I can certainly see how annoying this game was for people who played this originally on the PS1. The current area that I&#39;m in branches into two long paths, and one of them is simply a dead end. Since save points are scarce, you could really end up wasting time going along the wrong path and coming up against a tough group of enemies. Thankfully I&#39;m playing via emulation so I can use save states to make the journey smoother. I&#39;m going to keep at it this weekend, hoping to beat it and have enough time for other games before the end of 2025.</p> <p>What about you guys?

Where I think Bandi faltered was them spreading themselves too thin with milking their proprieties like Digimon, Gundam and One Piece.
