But there are also comments saying it\u2019s not true. So\u2026 who should I believe and what should I do? Any tips? And if you <em>do</em> get banned, how long does it last?</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if I did it right \u2014 I downloaded the game and launcher on Windows (on an NTFS partition), then mounted that on Linux via Steam, set the launcher to run with Proton Experimental, and launched the game from there.

After some research, I have discovered that Razer Synapse is not available, but programs like OpenRazer or Input Remapper are possibilities. Unfortunately, I cannot figure out how to get either of these working; I am finding it difficult to understand most instructions. Is there anyone who would be able to describe how to get one of these to work like I&#39;m 5? I&#39;m really unfamiliar with operating on Linux.
