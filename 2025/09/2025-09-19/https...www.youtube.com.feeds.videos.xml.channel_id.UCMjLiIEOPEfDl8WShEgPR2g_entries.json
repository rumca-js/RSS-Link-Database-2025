        "description": "Disney parks! The happiest places on Earth\u2026 with the highest concentration of mobility scooters per square mile. But look, beneath the Mickey-shaped pretzels and overpriced corn dogs, there\u2019s a lot of weird stuff going on.\n\nSo yeah, it turns out the most magical place on earth is also kinda the weirdest. But don\u2019t worry \u2014 I looked into all this, got distracted by a TikTok meerkat, argued with my wife mid-video, and still managed to bring you the secrets Disney doesn\u2019t exactly put on the brochures.\n\nAnyway, watch the video, learn some cursed facts, and then try not to think about them next time you\u2019re standing in line for Space Mountain.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Like the video, subscribe for more nonsense, and leave a comment with your favorite weird Disney fact (or your favorite ash-scattering technique \u2014 no actually don\u2019t do that).\n\n#Disney #RyanGeorge #ThemeParkSecrets\n\nThanks for watching!
