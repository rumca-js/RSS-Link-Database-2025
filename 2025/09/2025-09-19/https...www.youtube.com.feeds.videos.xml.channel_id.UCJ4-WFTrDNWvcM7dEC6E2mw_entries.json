        "description": "Welcome to Game 2 of out  Studio League Season 2!\n\nSix players will play over the next 5 months to crown one winner!  We keep track of Wins and losses which populate an ever changing leaderboard leading to a single elimination tournament at the end. Lets see which player comes out on top!\n\nOne twist this season is that while a player is allowed to play any faction they want, they can never play the same detachment twice!  Time to test your skill no matter what.  Lets see who wins the fabled crown of Chadocles!\n\n===============GAME INFO=============\nMubin's luck so far with his Thousand Sons has been middling to say the least, but hes back with a fresh coat of paint and some new armies and is ready to take down his foes.  Michael's Grey Knights are a threat not to.be underestimated.  I think we have all the makings of a solid game.  It's Friday 40k Fight!\n\n===============ARMY LIST=============\nCastellan Crowe (90pts): Black Blade of Antwyr, Purifying Flame, Storm bolter\nBrother-Captain",
