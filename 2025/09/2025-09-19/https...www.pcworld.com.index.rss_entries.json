Actually, they\u2019ve been here for years. But don\u2019t call it a comeback, because those laptops based on Qualcomm Snapdragon processors\u2014which Microsoft pushed so, so hard last year\u2014aren\u2019t selling so great. But according to Microsoft, those worries about app compatibility are pretty much over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the gist of <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/09/18/empowering-the-future-the-expanding-arm-app-ecosystem-for-copilot-pcs/\">a new Windows Developer Blog post</a>, which says that \u201cnative Arm versions available for apps\u00a0representing 90% of total user minutes.\u201d Which seems great! But that\u2019s a highly selective statement, which led me to follow into a disclosure page linked on the post. You can probably work out on your own that testing \u201cuser minutes\u201d isn\u2019t the same as saying that almost all <em>i",
