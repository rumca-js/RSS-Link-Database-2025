To give you an example, Biolum is a subnautica-esque short horror experience, and having thalassophobia (fear of deep water) I could barely finish the experience.

So, as the title mentions, I got myself a Pico 4 after years of using the Quest 2, since I only want to play PCVR games and every other headset is too expensive for me. I&#39;ve literally just got it and gave it a try and I have to say, I was expecting it to feel more like an upgrade, particularly on the lenses. Pico 4 has pancake lenses, but the edges still feel quite blurry, and I still struggle to read text displayed near them. I also feel like the focal point is way too high so I often found myself angling my head down in order to see better. The lack of an earphone jack is also very annoying but it can be dealt with. To those who owned or still own a Pico 4, what do you think? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IvanGogh99\"> /u/IvanGogh99 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nkrse5/new_pico_4_user_coming_from_the_quest_2_my/\">[link]</a><",
