The idea is simple: there are tons of open datasets out there, but they\u2019re scattered across different sources and hard to navigate. I wanted to build a single hub where people can find and explore them more easily.</p> <p>Right now it\u2019s still early - the site is live, but I\u2019m treating it as an MVP. I\u2019d really appreciate feedback from this community on things like:</p> <ul> <li>Is the interface intuitive enough?</li> <li>What features would make it more useful?</li> <li>Any glaring issues you notice?</li> </ul> <p>This is just me experimenting, but I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and ideas for improvement.
