I&#39;m a university student currently taking a Computer Architecture class, and we&#39;re learning through hands-on projects in RISC-V assembly.</p> <p>I wanted to share one of the first projects I managed to complete: a simple emoji that you can move around an LED matrix using a D-Pad! (Assignment 1) It was simulated using Ripes, and it really helped me understand memory mapped I/O and basic control flow in assembly.</p> <p>If anyone is interested in checking out the code or trying it themselves, here&#39;s the repo: </p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Yamil-Serrano/Computer-Architecture-II-Projects\">https://github.com/Yamil-Serrano/Computer-Architecture-II-Projects</a></strong></p> <p>It\u2019s still a work in progress as the class goes on, and I&#39;ll be adding more projects soon.
