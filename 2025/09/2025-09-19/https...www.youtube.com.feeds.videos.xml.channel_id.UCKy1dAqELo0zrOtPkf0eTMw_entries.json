        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nCD Projekt RED is staffing up for Cyberpunk 2 with a job post looking for a lead network engineer. Responsibilities would include developing and optimizing \"multiplayer systems, including matchmaking.\" So it sounds like Cyberpunk 2 is going to include a multiplayer mode, possibly similar to the scrapped mode that was supposed to be post-launch content for Cyberpunk 2077. Cyberpunk 2 isn't supposed to go into full development until after The Witcher 4 is out the door, so it may be a long while before we hear more. In other news, Fortnite is going head-to-head with Roblox in the creator economy space, with Epic revealing plans to allow players to sell user-generated content. The real kicker: Epic is pushing incentives for creators to earn quite a bit more than they would with Roblox. And finally, more DLC content for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds has leaked, thanks to some retailers selling copies early.\n\n#IGN",

        "description": "Donkey Kong Bananza's DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC reviewed by Logan Plant on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\n\"The best part about Donkey Kong Bananza\u2019s DK Island & Emerald Rush DLC is that it gives me a reason to keep experimenting in one of my favorite playgrounds Nintendo has ever created. DK Island is a nostalgic rush that prioritizes fun callbacks to Rare\u2019s golden era over stuff to actually do. Despite the warm, fuzzy feelings I had while exploring, I can\u2019t help but think this would have been more fitting as a final postgame reward in Bananza itself rather than DLC locked behind a paywall. But the bulk of this expansion is housed in Emerald Rush, which let me unleash DK\u2019s craziest parkour possibilities and strategically balance each transformation\u2019s strengths to set new high scores. Its perk system creates unique ways to play you\u2019d never consider in the original campaign, and it smartly returns to old locations and tests your knowledge of important places in a way that feels like a fitting",
