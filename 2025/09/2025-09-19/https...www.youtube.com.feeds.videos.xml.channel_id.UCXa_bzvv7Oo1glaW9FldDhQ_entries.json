        "description": "Revisiting Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is easy, but capturing that same feeling \u2013 the coziness, the tension, the camaraderie, the characters, even the soundtrack \u2013 in a remake might as well be an impossible task. \n\nIn this day and age, where remakes are dragged through the mud for either changing too much or not changing enough, how do you answer, Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter? \n\nQuite well, actually, striking a neat balance leaning slightly towards the latter.",

Here's hoping Amplitude can supplant it further and deliver a 4X experience that truly surpasses the original.",

        "description": "Ninja Gaiden 4 feels like one of the biggest games of the year because of its energy. There's a simultaneous meeting of the old and new school with a gorgeous aesthetic and fast-paced action that knows what it wants to offer, and escalates that at a steady, pulse-pounding rate. \n\nIt looks like a return to everything that we loved about the series, but also a big step forward, seemingly ushering in a new age. Granted, we won't truly know the franchise's future until well after its launch - success would certainly be the crescendo to this Year of the Ninja - but if nothing else, Ninja Gaiden is back, and I couldn't be more ecstatic to go hands-on.",
