The room's dark; strange light leaks through closed curtains, and a beady eye poking through a crack in the wall urges you to peek out the window.

That's a thought I've been chewing in my mind like gum for most of the year. How it settles; that's the clincher. There can be extraordinarily strong feelings when you're playing a game, but months later, do you want to go back? Ask yourself. The answer is telling.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-overlook-the-invincible-on-playstation-plus-its-a-gorgeous-sci-fi-mystery-that-lingers-long-in-the-mind\">Read more</a></p>",
