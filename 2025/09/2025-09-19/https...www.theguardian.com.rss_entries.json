We\u2019ve got the seemingly ordinary family with secrets: Ed Harris\u2019s Vincent, spouse Sandy (Gabrielle Union) and her nerdy teenage son DJ (Miles J Harvey). There are the disrupters: Vincent\u2019s ex-wife Ruth (Jennifer Coolidge), their errant son Rocco (Lewis Pullman) and his girlfriend Marina (Emanuela Postacchini), who spark revelations about Vincent\u2019s former life. And there are the comic-relief mob killers, nicely underplayed by Bill Murray and Pete Davidson. But it\u2019s Coolidge who is the film\u2019s trump card: funny, profane, horny \u2013 and wonderfully disinclined to take the revenge plot in any way seriously. <em><br>\n  Sunday 21 September, Prime Video</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/se",
