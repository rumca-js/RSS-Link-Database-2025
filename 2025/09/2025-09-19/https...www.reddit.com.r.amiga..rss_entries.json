I was rather upset when he sold his video toaster. I assumed he meant the entire computer. Fast forward decades and he told me he believed he had his a500 in his closet. He promised it to me. A few years later, I asked him about it. That was just this past weekend. </p> <p>He looked for it while on the phone with me. He could not find the a5000, but he did find his a2000. He shipped it to me Monday. It arrived today. So excited. I&#39;m sharing. Not gloating or showing off. The community should celebrate when ",
