Preferably with the ability to upload from other devices and have the result served back to me (not having to remote in and do all the &quot;legwork&quot; myself).

Born from the ashes of Libreddit&#39;s rate limiting issues, it provides a clean, ad-free Reddit browsing experience while keeping your data private and secure.</p> <p>What really impressed me is how it actually works reliably (unlike many Reddit frontends that struggle with rate limiting) while being incredibly lightweight. Plus, it&#39;s completely JavaScript-free, proxies all requests so Reddit never sees your IP, and includes features like RSS feeds, customizable themes, and SFW-only mode.</p> <p>The best part?

But there is one non-negotiable workflow I need somehow supported. I have linux HTPC connected to my TV and hifi stereo. Currently I run headless spotifyd on this HTPC, so when I am home on my wifi, I can just grab my android phone, open Spotify, &quot;switch&quot; to HTPC as playing device and play music. And my wife can do the same from her iphone spotify app.</p> <p>How to do this with self-hosted setup? I guess I&#39;ll setup Navidrome on the HTPC and Symfonium on my android phone. But can I &quot;remote control&quot; Navidrome from Symfonium (or maybe other mobile app)? Or do I need some (ideally headless) client on HTPC, that I can remote control from the phone?

My own bottles are already tracked in my spreadsheet, but I\u2019d love something smarter that tells me: <em>\u201cHey, drink this bottle now, it\u2019s peaking\u201d</em> or <em>\u201cThis wine just doubled in value on the secondary market.\u201d</em></p> <p>This got me wondering:</p> <ul> <li>Is there any open-source or self-hosted wine cellar tracker that does this?</li> <li>Or is the real barrier that drinking window/value data is proprietary, so unless you\u2019re licensing it (aka $$$), you\u2019re stuck?</li> <li>Do most of you just pay for an app, roll your own",

Then I went to ChatGPT for 20 mins and I got another pop up but for network configuration issues and I have zero clue what self-signedKey is and I immediately disconnected from my Wi-Fi and still am\ud83d\ude2d especially when I saw that it said someone could be tampering with my device or network because I know people can hack into Wi-Fi routers and i\u2019m very cautious with stuff like this.
