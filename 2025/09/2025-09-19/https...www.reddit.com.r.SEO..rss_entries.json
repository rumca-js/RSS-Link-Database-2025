One type of take that I have seen a lot of is either statements saying that SEO is &quot;dead&quot; or people asking if SEO is &quot;dead&quot;. I think that this has been an opinion that has been floating around for the past few years, and people can easily take this bate. Just to be clear, I am not shaming anyone who has that opinion, I just disagree with it. I have seen the opposite of this in my eyes. I see that for example many SEO&#39;s see the rise of AI as an enemy of SEO, where from what I have seen it is a major ally. I dont think this place is the space for me to advertise anything so I wont say any names, but I have seen big increase in rankings from clients the past year. Why? Because SEO is not dead, bit it has evolved simply. What are the keys to getting better rankings ",
