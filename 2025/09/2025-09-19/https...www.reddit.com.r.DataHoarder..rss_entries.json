Will put a m.2ssd for the server itself and any programs like jellyfin. I&#39;ll chuck in a spare ryzen 5 2600 and get a cheap GPU and 2x 16 GB of ram. On top of the case I&#39;d put a rack with the hdds. As a start 3x24tb of barracudas (new) now idk if I should buy 3 new ones at the same time of if they also fail at the same time. I plan to use raid 5 or 6 (I don&#39;t remember which one it was) so 2 hdds with data 1 parity so I can use 66% of the space with should be ~40Tb. I&#39;d then leave the server 24/7 on which is why I&#39;d buy a low power GPU. Problem is right now I don&#39;t know howd I connect the Motherboard to the rack containing the 3 hdds.

This question will be about what sort of upgrade path I would consider in my use case, so I don&#39;t waste money in the long run and I have redundancy. Note that I already have all the important stuff backed up off-site, which is why I want redundancy (as getting to those backups is a nuisance).</p> <p>My current drive is a 4TB CMR drive in a SATA to USB enclosure. I am planning on getting a second drive to implement RAID1. However, I am stuck on what capacity of drive I should get (4TB or 8TB). This is because although currently 4TB of useable storage capacity fits my needs, I predict that within around 1-2 years I will need more storage, judging by the rate the 4TB space is filling up. If I were to get the 8TB drive, I could configure both my current 4TB and the new 8TB drives in RAID1 and just deal",

I read SSD&#39;S are a newer technology and more reliable and also less likely to stop working if it gets dropped. on paper SSD&#39;S are better but is that true in tour opinion? </p> <p>The only reason i would buy a HHD is because it seems that can get more TB per hard drive on them than if i bought a SSD (that i can find anyway)</p> <p>also where do you guys buy hardrives from?
