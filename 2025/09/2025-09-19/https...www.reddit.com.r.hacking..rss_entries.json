Then using the command !xfs you can dispense out all the money in the ATM using the cash dispensing module it can be loaded into the RABIDS using the BYOVF module. Soo how it works is that all ATM are running xfs manager that controls the hardware of the atm soo what this script does is that it connects with the CDM(Cash dispenser SPI) and then send api calls to it to despense out all the money, all done with a remote shell on the atm. i am also writing a writeup explaining the code.
