Bright aqua artstyle looks amazing and fresh: a cheerful world, unlike endless stream of dark fantasy games. </p> <p>Mechanics are very well done, too. Each hero has a board with 3 x 3 grid, on each slot there are different symbols of basic actions (movement, attack, gaining resource). Grid will be getting gradually filled with more powerful and unique actions of cards played from your hand: one per turn. After drawing a card you can activate any horizontal or vertical row and get all the bonuses from these slots (but if row is completely filled with cards, they will have to be discarded). Very interesting and cool concept which makes you think about each move, what you need more right now - because there are so many activation options. A great idea.</p> <p>There is also management of several resources (shells, fruits, spirit, focus) which can be spent at the right moment ",

Where you absolutely have to rely on your teammates abilities because some stuff you just can&#39;t do as well as they can. Preferably with heavy player interaction.</p> <p>My favorite 1vMany game is Level 7 Omega Protocol, and each time i play it, it feels like the marine team is really diverse and everyone has a different job they are awesome at. They need to complement each other, or the mission won&#39;t be won.</p> <p>My favorite TeamvTeam is Captain Sonar, where everyone has a dedicated role, completely alien to the other roles. You need to rely on your teammates for vital functions of gameplay.</p> <p>Flash Point: Fire Rescue has asymetric roles, one is extremely good at extinguishing flames but is very slow, others are fast or can use first aid, but are worse at extinguishing. </p> <p>I played Spirit island before, and while it has asymetric gameplay and every play",

Ojal\u00e1 alguno de vosotros sepa reconocer el juego: recuerdo que a cada jugador se le daban dos cartas, las cartas estaban numeradas creo que del 0 al 10 y solo conten\u00edan el n\u00famero, si no recuerdo mal, compuesto con la forma de un animal, por ejemplo el 2 era un pato si no recuerdo mal y habia otro hecho con delfines y otro con una tortuga. Cada numero tenia asociados unos poderes, como por ejemplo intercambiar por otra carta y condiciones y no recuerdo muy bien la mecanica pero la gente se iba eliminando y creo que habia que irse descartando de las cartas, una por turno. Y no se si habia que intentar tener el numero mas alto de la ronda o algo asi. Tambien me suena que el 10 se llamaba el rey y era muy poderosa pero tenia unas condiciones para poder usarla o algo asi y el 0 era como un rey falso o ",
