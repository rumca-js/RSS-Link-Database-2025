I am a little autistic and have a really hard time reading books written in a style i dont like and I hate having to leave books unfinished (im looking at you 20,000 leagues under the sea). My favorite genres are realistic fiction, horror, and magical realism! If i were to recommend books I liked I would heavily recommend madeline Miller&#39;s &quot;the Song of Achilles&quot; (although &quot;Circe&quot; isnt a horrible read either) and Kathrine Arden&#39;s winternight trilogy &quot;The Bear and The Nightingale.&quot;, The Girl in The Tower.&quot;, and &quot;The Winter of The Witch.&quot; I appreciate anyone who offers recommendations, as i have no idea what I want to start next. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/crumbycrabcakes\"> /u/crumbycrabcakes </a> <br/> <span><a h",

Or if I find a good deal, a full series. I\u2019ve just been having a look on Books2door and found the whole Charlie bone collection for \u00a315 which I think mr 10 would really enjoy (I enjoyed what was available of the series at a similar age) But what series etc to get mr 12, he has all the cat kid and a lot of Dog man, last year he got the full \u2018bunny vs monkey\u2019 set, but he is almost 13 and while I know he enjoys graphic novels, I want to maybe find more \u2018age appropriate\u2019 ones? </p> <p>So any reccomendations for a good book series for either of my boys, I would say my 10 year old is probably a more confident reader than my 12 year old, I don\u2019t want to \u2018",

Armentrout&#39;s bestselling Paranormal Fantasy book series. The Lux book series, follows 17 year-old Katy Swartz, who moves to a small town in West Virginia, only to discover that her neighbor and new friends, Daemon and Dee Black, are part of a powerful alien race hiding in plain sight. After Daemon saves Katy&#39;s life by healing her w/his powers, an unbreakable bond forms between them, drawing Katy deeper into a world of supernatural threats, government conspiracies, and a forbidden love that could ignite a war. </p> <p>I&#39;m excited it&#39;s being turned into an upcoming new t.v. series. It&#39;s an easy to read book series. That I think can be turned into a really fun t.v. show. That hopefully will be good.

Climax it can be anything. But this is the setup I want. In such movies and books - after the realisation moment of what is behind all this, everything is same.

Where the world and characters feel authentic because the author is inspired rather than trying to be quirky, and where the themes are about universal human experience",

I find so many romantic comedy books are more for 20 somethings to enjoy and the writing is too immature. I want a more mature mid 30s vibe. I am trying to get back into reading. I really enjoyed eat pray love because I travel a ton myself and looking for self growth. I loved memoirs of a geisha as she had hardships but stayed strong and powered through. And they found love.
