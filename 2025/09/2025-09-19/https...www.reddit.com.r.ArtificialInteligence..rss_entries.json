First of all I&#39;m really sorry if anything I say doesn&#39;t make much sense as I&#39;m a complete layman, but, I bought a one month subscription with dreamcreator.ai to create a video for a family members business page (Didn&#39;t end up using it as the quality was so poor but that&#39;s besides the point, lesson learnt.) </p> <p>Anyway, I thought I&#39;d cancelled the subscription through their site but end up seeing a charge next month, I try to cancel again but this time it sends me to a different page where I need to login but it says I don&#39;t have an account.</p> <p>Going back to the previous page, it says that if I have an issue to email them, so I did, but have heard no response.</p> <p>Does anyone know this company? Is this something I&#39;ve done wrong?</p> <p>I don&#39;t mind being mocked haha but I really thought this company was linked to Google in some way due to their site&#39;s layout.</p> <p>Much thanks in advance and ",

Recently i started developing interest in AI majorly Alignment and Interpretability. I\u2019m reading, learning and watching lot of material taking help from chatGpt to create curriculum for me. But i can barely able to get anywhere. I came across programs like MATS and openAI residency and started preparing. My first instinct is they hire only AI/ML phd students working with top universities. I don\u2019t know if I even get any response as my experience is very different than what they want, more to that i don\u2019t have any formal research or paper published.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/According-Doctor-839\"> /u/According-Doctor-839 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1nkzsod/has_anyone_from_nonaiml_stem_gotten_their_way/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
