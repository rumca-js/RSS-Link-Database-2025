One of the last films I remember seeing him in was Three Fugitives (and I was happy to be reminded about Prince of Tides ... phew). I went in blind on Warrior, only knowing that Tom Hardy was in it and was shocked to see Nick. More shocking was how honest and sad his portrayal of Paddy Conlon was. The Casino and hotel scene were both so very different and so gut wrenching. It was hard.</p> <p>I know the movie wasn&#39;t necessarily about him but I thought the ending was a little too Karate Kid in the way it dismissed his demons so cleanly and simply had him looking on like a proud dad. </p> <p>Anyway, just finished and it&#39;s still raw and with me and thought I&#39;d share.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MightyMightyMonkey\"> /u/MightyMightyMonkey </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ww",

This film is really interesting, it is about a father whose teenage daughter goes missing in California and turns up in a porno film. This leads him to search for her and leads him into the subculture of pornography. </p> <p>I got to say, I honestly think this film is overlooked &amp; underrated. What makes the film is George C. Scott and his performance as the father, Jake van Horn, who immerses himself into the industry we would never dare go into, just so that he could find his daughter. George C. Scott is just a good actor, who always commits himself to the role and always is the best part of anything he is in. Season Hubley is also great as Joanne, a prostitute who help Jake find his daughter. What I like is that Joanne and Jake found a grudging respect for each other, in spite of the cultural differences between them. Also good was Peter Boyle as the private investigator</p>",

All of the cowboys riding into the town to avenge the deaths of their 2 fellow cowboys and the rest of that scene of them sitting down to eat the feast. And the music just adds to the drama. Meeting the cowboys and all that, especially Johnny Ringo, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9DChwPjMK5U?t=265\">who just straight up shoots a priest right between the eyes</a> bc he was annoyed with him talking all that shit. And then <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kEPVuP_q5hs?t=6\">our first intro to Doc Holiday</a>. Again, near perfection in my opinion. His mannerisms and gestures are so on point. He is just such a bad ass. The whole film was just so well casted, written, directed, scored, and edited.
