I also love how he portrayed the aristocratic society of Russia, the fancy balls, the social dynamics and the way he presented the scandals and gossip happening within.</p> <p>The story itself was truly a journey. Tolstoy built the characters up with deep psychological understanding, precisely capturing their desires, problems, and their emotional connections towards one another. Like Anna, for example, started off as a respected woman in the society but as her story progressed, and the consequences of her actions (like the affair she had with Vronsky) came into fruition, she spiraled into a world of jealousy and delusion which deteriorated her mentally and ultimately led to her suicide (at a",

Samosas are primarily a north Indian snack, not a south Indian one especially in that era.

I like to read everyday but my parents don&#39;t let me read fiction books , they say to read only academic books. I don&#39;t read literature whole day I also focus on academics but they don&#39;t even let me read 1-2 hours. I cant even buy books my parents won&#39;t let me so I always read in my mobile kindle app. Sometimes I get so bored by the mobile screen you know the real paper read is something else but no problem I can deal with that for some time. So I read in my mobile phone but my parents won&#39;t let me do that also. Yesterday I was reading the brother Karmazov and my parents caught me and I said I am not reading any book it&#39;s just some article but when they snatched my phone (she snatched my phone my mother always do that my father sometimes restrict me but he don&#39;t care about my reading fiction) she saw that I was 200 pages in that book so she scolded me th",

I watched a couple and a couple became alot. I really enjoy it and it has been great for escaping the horrible stuff going on in the world.</p> <p>I ended up buying Mistborn and started reading it. But when I read it its not in my voice but I&#39;m hearing Sanderson narrate it in my head. My mind is even recreating his cadence and tone. Its really off putting and I think I may have a budding parasocial relationship developing with Sanderson.</p> <p>I&#39;m not an avid reader but I read lots of fantasy books and I always meant to read him but never got around to it. Now I am and I feel like I got in the wrong way; not through his work but through his opinions. How do I work through this because it feels really weird\u2014like I&#39;m not alone in my mind.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mattson\"> /u/Mat",
