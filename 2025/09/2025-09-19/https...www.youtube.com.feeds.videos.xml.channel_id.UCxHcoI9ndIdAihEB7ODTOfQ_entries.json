        "description": "For the briefest moment in the early 2010s, Stomp Clap ruled the airwaves. The Lumineers were vying for chart places with Rihanna and Bruno Mars. Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters and Men and Vance Joy too were getting rich off hoedowns, hootenannys and rave ups. And everyone was dressing like they were in There Will Be Blood. It was a millennial-tinged Americana, Obama-era folk-pop, a whole lot of stompin\u2019, clappin\u2019, hootin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019. It was nostalgia for the old times, infused with blinding sincerity, an absolute aversion to irony and an overabundance of percussion. But what were its influences, the vital steps along the way? How did we get to the point where \u201cHo Hey\u201d was a pop hit? These are the 7 songs that made Stomp Clap Happen.\n\n#mumfordandsons #indiefolk #musicdocumentary \n\nFact-checking by Chad Van Wagner.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:49 O Brother, Where Art Thou?\n05:51 Wake Up\n11:26 Skinny Love\n17:50 Home\n23:39 Little Lion Man\n28:55 Little Talks\n32:43 Ho Hey\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citr",
