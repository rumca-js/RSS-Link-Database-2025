        "description": "The first step into our new Mordheim campaign drops four warbands into the streets and promptly trips over a pile of wyrdstone. Matthew pilots the Skaven Whiskerfang Assassins led by Scritchett Quickstab who insists on saying quick stab quick stab quick stab every chance he gets. Luka fields the Reikland Bridge Burners with Captain Whiskey Jack and a trio of roof hopping sappers who claim slings are fair and balanced. Steve brings the Witch Hunters of the von Drak family, complete with a warrior priest, pistol twins, and a very enthusiastic flagellant. And somewhere between the graveyard and a very unlucky well, the Undead arrive as Crimson Morvein and his necromancer Draven Nyx herd a pack of ghouls, a dire wolf, and the most lovable zombies in Mordheim, including Sideburns McGee.\n\n*Apologies that the audio is a little muddled.  We did our best to fix it.*\n\nMembers to watch Episode 2, go here\nYoutube Members - https://youtu.be/K3ljFtO739g\nVault Members - https://www.miniwargaming.com",
