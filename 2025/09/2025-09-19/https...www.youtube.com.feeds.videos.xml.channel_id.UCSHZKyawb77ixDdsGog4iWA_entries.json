        "description": "Norman Ohler is a historian and author of \"Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich,\" a book that investigates the role of psychoactive drugs, particularly stimulants such as methamphetamine, in the military history of World War II. It is a book that two legendary historians Ian Kershaw and Antony Beevor give very high praise to for its depth of research. Norman also wrote \"Tripped: Nazi Germany, the CIA, and the Dawn of the Psychedelic Age\", and he is working on a new book \"Stoned Sapiens\" looking at the history of human civilization through the lens of drugs.\nThank you for listening \u2764 Check out our sponsors: https://lexfridman.com/sponsors/ep481-sb\nSee below for timestamps, transcript, and to give feedback, submit questions, contact Lex, etc.\n\n*Transcript:*\nhttps://lexfridman.com/norman-ohler-transcript\n\n*CONTACT LEX:*\n*Feedback* - give feedback to Lex: https://lexfridman.com/survey\n*AMA* - submit questions, videos or call-in: https://lexfridman.com/ama\n*Hiring* - join our team: https://le",
