I have a non Samsung phone, therefore to manage the watch I have to install the galaxy wear app and the galaxy watch 7 plugin. These apps are only used to change watch settings, and the app store page for both say they collect no data. My understanding is that it is the Samsung Health app specifically which is used to collect and sync watch data to Samsung&#39;s servers. If this app is not installed on my phone can Samsung still collect my watch data. (Can&#39;t uninstall the app from the watch itself but all permissions are denied) I understand that without the Samsung health app most of the watches health tracking features do not work, however I don&#39;t really care about that. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Thepitiedfool1\"> /u/Thepitiedfool1 </a> <br",
