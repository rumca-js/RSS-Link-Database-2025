        "description": "The UK welcomed Donald Trump on an unprecedented second state visit this week, as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer invoked the help of King Charles III in his efforts to charm the US president. The trip comes as Washington insists it will only apply additional sanctions against Moscow if Europe stops buying Russian oil. So can western allies get President Trump to change his position, and does so-called soft power diplomacy actually work?\n\nTo answer your questions, Jamie Coomarasamy and Vitaly Shevchenko are joined by the BBC\u2019s diplomatic correspondent James Landale, who has been observing events in Windsor where the royal family hosted the president and first lady.\n\nListen to the full episode here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0m3lpzc\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #Ukraine #Russia",

        "description": "Donald Trump has finished his state visit to the UK and it ended with a joint press conference with the British PM Keir Starmer.  What did the two leaders say about Gaza and Ukraine, why was Epstein not really mentioned, and what does it tell us about the relationship between the two countries? Sarah - who was in the room with Trump and Starmer at Chequers - also reveals what Susie Wiles, the US president\u2019s chief of staff, told her about Trump.  \n\nThe other big topic discussed - and the story dominating US headlines - is the broadcaster ABC\u2019s decision to  take Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s late-night show off the air after his comments on the killing of Charlie Kirk.  Justin, Marianna and Sarah unpack what that means for late night talk shows and free speech in America.  \n\nHOSTS: \n\u2022 Justin Webb, Radio 4 presenter\n\u2022 Sarah Smith, North America Editor\n\u2022 Marianna Spring, Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent",
