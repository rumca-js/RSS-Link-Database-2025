The definition of being gay in this argument is being sexually or romantically attracted to a member of the same sex. The definition I will be using of being trans is identifying as a gender that does not match your biological sex that was given at birth. According to studies done by mutiple organizations (American academy of pediatrics, pan American health organization, American phycological association, etc...) there is little to no proof that life experiences like bad parenting or sexual abuse change or influence your sexuality. What about conversion therapy? Conversion therapy says that it can change your sexuality by treating it like a mental disorder, creating a reward/punishment system, using religion (prayer, Bible, quran, etc), and more.

My housemate is extremely religious and has made offhand comments about lgbtq rights, immigration, and other issues that make it clear that she is conservative (although she has not said anything explicitly problematic, just pushing the envelope). My other housemates are all liberal, although none of them are queer, and it seems as though they want to try and keep the peace as best as possible, as none of them ever push back on any of her statements. My conservative housemate is friendly to me, and wants to spend time with me and do things with me, but I leave every interaction with her feeling bad about myself and insecure. She is always talking about how she hopes I can find a boyfriend, and has such a male/marriage-centered view on life and womanhood. It makes me feel weird and insecure",
