I usually enjoy reading fantasy and the inital pages are my favourite since they feel like exploration of a new world with all the characters and political systems ( and magic systems) being introduced. </p> <p>Can you learned people tell me if it gets interesting ahead and i shall stick with it or shall i save myself the trouble of going through 5 books and drop it? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/QeemaKarailay\"> /u/QeemaKarailay </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nkzbij/reviews_and_recommendations_about_the_shadow/\">[link",
