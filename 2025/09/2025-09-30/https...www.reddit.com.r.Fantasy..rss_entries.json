It&#39;s so close to a modern 5/5, but has some serious problems that may or may not ruin it for you. Your enjoyment will really depend on how you view plot/character/magic inconsistencies. I won&#39;t get into each character with names and detailed plot descriptions. Instead, I&#39;ll focus more on the big arcs to answer the question: will you enjoy reading this? </p> <p>And, yes, this review is gigantic. I do discuss events that happen in the first quarter of the book. And I get into plots and if they&#39;re satisfyingly wrapped up, though I don&#39;t give specific spoilers. Meaning, I&#39;ll ask &quot;is XYZ plot wrapped up in the end? The answer is no.&quot; If you don&#39;t like that, then don&#39;t read this review. Because these basic questions will dictate if you will, in my opinion, enjoy the plot. </p> <p>And apologies if this review comes across ",

We have society broken into 8 groups by the entity that they chose to follow at 16. These entities have schools that are devoted to their philosophy and are key to advancing in the world.

I have read the Farseer Trilogy and I am almost done with the Liveship Traders Trilogy, but I already can not wait to get immersed further in the Realm of the Elderlings.</p> <p>I love the writing of Robin Hobb. It is really immersive, it does not makes big leaps in time or so that you stay engaged. I really liked the Farseer Trilogy, the hardship, the rollercoaster of emotions but most of all the brotherhood. Liveship Traders is a completely different writing style in which we follow multiple persons and gain valuable insights of why a person does something.</p> <p>For me, (up until now) I think I like Liveship Traders a little bit better. But of course, there are a lot more series in the Realm of the Elderlings. So i am wondering, what is your favourite?

I believe they&#39;re scattered across three anthologies she published. If so - do folks think they&#39;re worth picking up and spending the time to read?</p> <p>I came away from this reread remembering why I loved this book as a kid. The world building is awesome, and I&#39;m curious to know how the other short stories flesh out the world of Damar for fans of the two primary books.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>(Side note: Wow, upon rereading this, I couldn&#39;t help but keep thinking that this would make a great Studio Ghibli movie. How has this not been picked up? I&#39;m curious if anyone happens to know. In this day and age,",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone yesterday I made a list for series for people who enjoyed Wheel of Time and underrated series published around the same time. But I&#39;m making another list to discuss a specific plot point of WOT. The post-apocalyptic setting of the world. It&#39;s one of my favorite tropes and I&#39;m sucker for it. Especially when the authors slowly reveal the past and what happened and what actually happened contrary to the myths. Wheel of Time has The Age of Legends and then the Breaking of the World. Which led to the modern setting of the first book. </p> <p>So if you like that type of fantasy setting and vibes here are some recommendations like it : </p> <p>Shannara by Terry Brooks (I don&#39;t think this is a spoiler anymore but if this is your first hearing about this . stop reading) this takes place after the Great War, Nuclear War, but it morphed into something else many years later. The world changed into something akin to the fantasy books p",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just started Ship of Magic after LOVING the Farseer trilogy. It&#39;s not gripping me, but I was willing to stick with it to ensure I complete the whole series, but I just found out that sexual assault is a large part of the trilogy -- something I deeply struggle with reading. Someone else&#39;s post about this got an overwhelming response to avoid it with SA aversion, but I wondered, will I miss out on the total experience of the Realm of the Elderlings without it? How much would I miss? Would it be less satisfying?</p> <p>Regardless I may not be able to stomach it, knowing how fantastic Hobb is at character development and how much I&#39;ll likely be affected, but I&#39;d love to know if I&#39;m really missing out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tulipranfrom\"> /u/tulipranfrom </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ntyz80/can_i_skip_liveship/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",
