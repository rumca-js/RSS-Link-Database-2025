        "description": "Scientists have successfully produced healthy mouse offspring from spermatogonial stem cells that spent six months cryopreserved aboard the International Space Station. The study revealed that the space environment caused less damage to these reproductive cells than the freeze-thaw process itself, challenging previous assumptions about space radiation effects on fertility.\n\nSource Article: https://phys.org/news/2025-08-space-mice-babies-stem-cells.html \n\n#medicine #discovery #breakthrough #technology #shortsLinks:\n\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c Merch: https://www.rockstarscientist.org/\n\ud83d\udcf8 Insta: https://www.instagram.com/drbenmiles\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c \ud83d\ude80  Support my work:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUeZBocfxALSUdOgNJB5ySA/join\n\nI support scientific teams tackling global problems.
