It has a bunch of custom machines and patches that haven&#39;t been upstreamed (or haven&#39;t made it yet).</p> <p>This was a bit of a &quot;aha!&quot; moment for me. It makes sense that silicon vendors would need their own custom emulation environments.</p> <p>So, my question to the community: Are you aware of any other notable RISC-V forks of QEMU? </p> <p>I&#39;m especially curious about:</p> <ul> <li>Forks from other major vendors (SiFive, Andes, T-Head, etc.) that add their specific CPU cores or development boards.</li> <li>Academic or research",
