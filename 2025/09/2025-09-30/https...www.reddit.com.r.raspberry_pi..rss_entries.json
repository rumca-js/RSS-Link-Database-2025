So far, I\u2019ve checked a few generic 3D-printed frames and some acrylic cases online, but most are either too bulky or not designed with portability in mind. Since I want something sturdy but still lightweight for a portable setup, I\u2019m trying to figure out the best approach.</p> <p>If anyone here has experience building portable Pi + SDR projects, I\u2019d love to hear what worked for you in terms of framing or housing the display.

I&#39;ve recently been inspired to build a pocket synth using a Pi4 I have sitting around, an old disassembled mechanical keyboard, and an unused small screen.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been watching a lot of videos of small production machines like the OP-1 or the Chompi Sampler or the Hichord, and got inspired.</p> <p>I&#39;ve looked into Zynthian and sequencer builds, but they didn&#39;t seem like exactly what I was looking for.</p> <p>Are there any recent projects out there I can base off of? Or, would love advice on which software to build from. </p> <p>I would want the ability to loop multiple tracks, select different sounds, adjust the timber of the sounds as well in different ways if possible. I am looking to build something that is fairly small, so perhaps only has 1 or 2 octaves.</p> <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fubitpc\"> /u/fubitpc </a> <br/> <span",
