The idea is to stay ahead of stories that matter to me.</p> <p>I\u2019m not looking for a generic news digest or daily email. I want something that:</p> <ul> <li>Filters for specific <strong>keywords or themes</strong> across reliable news sources</li> <li>Sends a <strong>notification directly to my phone or inbox</strong></li> <li>Only pings me during <strong>certain hours</strong> (I don\u2019t want to be woken up at 3am)</li> <li>Ideally doesn\u2019t flood me with noise, just the important stuff, fast</li> </ul> <p>I\u2019ve tried patching together scripts and tools, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a smarter, more sustainable solution, whether it\u2019s an app, service, bot, or automation setup. Bonus if it\u2019s free or cheap.</p> <p>Anyone else obsessed with staying on top of certain topics? What\u2019s worked for you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",
