Although we&#39;ve been in business since 2009, we&#39;ve never looked into SEO because we work on very few projects each year (not looking for constant stream of clients) and relay on industry connections and links.</p> <p>Recently, we rebranded and my boss wants us to do SEO for our new website. I&#39;m wondering:</p> <p>1) Given the context, will we benefit from doing SEO for our business? </p> <p>2) How do I find out what kind of return doing SEO can give us?</p> <p>3) What kind of money are we looking to spend on this?</p> <p>4) How do you choose someone to do SEO. I&#39;ve read some stories here about bad SEO agencies, etc. How do I avoid them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/light3223\"> /u/light3223 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddi",
