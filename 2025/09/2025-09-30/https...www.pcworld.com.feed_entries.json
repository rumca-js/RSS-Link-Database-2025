When a new version of Windows comes out, for example, many people declare how much better its predecessor was, and now that Windows 10 is going the way of the dodo, a wave of nostalgia is washing over the tech world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is: Is Windows 10 really better than 11? I myself switched to Windows 11 when it launched back in 2021. So to find out the difference, I pulled out my old Windows 10 computer and ran it for a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The test made me realize how much better Windows has actually become\u2014and going back to Windows 10 was unexpectedly painful. Here are my key lessons learned.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2909284/your-windows-10-pc-is-reaching-its-end-in-30-days",
