Also available on Xbox Series S, PlayStation 4/5, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\n\n\"LEGO Party doesn\u2019t completely reinvent the tried-and-true Mario Party formula, but it does introduce some welcome tweaks to its structure, a uniformly high quality collection of minigames hard-tuned for hilarity, and an enjoyably silly game show-style presentation that\u2019s yet to overstay its welcome. The four game boards on offer might be a few less than Super Mario Party Jamboree\u2019s collection, but the transformative nature of their layouts brings welcome variety and surprise to each session, and the considerable minifig customisation options are a joy to tinker with. Creative, colourful, and a consistent crack up, LEGO Party is purpose-built to turn any boring old night into a block party filled with belly laughs.\"",
