For one, 3D All-Stars was bizarrely only for sale for a limited time - so this will be the first time this game has a 'standard', ever-available Switch version. More importantly, this is the first time that Galaxy 2 is on Switch, meaning we now have one of gaming's finest duologies reunited and available on modern hardware.
