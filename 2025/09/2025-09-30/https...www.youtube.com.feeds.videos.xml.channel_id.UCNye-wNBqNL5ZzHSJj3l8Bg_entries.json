        "description": "Russia has proposed a draft federal budget for 2026, prioritising defence and security funding amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine. The budget includes a controversial increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) from 20% to 22%, although essential goods like food and medicines will remain taxed at 10%. This increase comes despite earlier government assurances against raising taxes. Critics argue that the rising cost of living, driven by inflation and stagnant wages, is already placing a heavy burden on ordinary Russians.\nGovernment forecasts predict an economic slowdown, with GDP growth expected to reach just 1.3% in 2026, and a continued budget deficit. While officials claim the new measures are critical to fulfilling defence obligations and social commitments, some independent analysts suggest the economy remains resilient, buoyed by redirected energy exports to Asia. However, public discontent is growing, as citizens voice concerns over declining living standards.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Yulia Shapovalo",

        "description": "Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera\u2019s senior political analyst, argued that Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan is simply a continuation of decades of failed, US-backed deals that always favour Israel at the expense of Palestinians. \nHe said Hamas has been cornered since 2024, with the war on Gaza waged in genocidal terms, now rebranded as diplomacy. \nBishara described Netanyahu as a \u201cpathological liar\u201d and a political survivor who, like his predecessors, manipulates agreements to Israel\u2019s advantage. \nHe stressed the need for historical context, recalling how past peace processes only entrenched occupation, settlement expansion, and Palestinian marginalisation. \nBishara warned that while Gaza might get a temporary respite, nothing fundamental will change because Israel can always rely on unconditional US support. \nHe concluded that despite appearances of change, the cycle of occupation, settlement, and violence will persist, leaving Palestinians trapped in the same struggle.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: htt",

        "description": "Trump and Netanyahu announced they had agreed on a Gaza peace plan following their joint meeting, though their visions remain sharply divided. \nTrump presented a 20-point proposal centred on Hamas\u2019s demilitarisation, technocratic governance under international oversight, and leadership chosen by a \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d chaired by himself instead of elections. \nNetanyahu insists Israel must retain long-term security control and supports a civilian administration excluding both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. While Trump suggested the PA could return after reforms, Netanyahu rejects that option. Trump also warned that if Hamas refuses the plan, Washington would fully back renewed Israeli military action. \nHamas says it's studying Trump\u2019s proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza,  'in good faith'.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Mike Hanna reports from the White House. \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/",
