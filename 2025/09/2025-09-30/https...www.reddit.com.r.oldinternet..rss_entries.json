It&#39;s also likely he had a grin showing teeth with a lot of space in between them. His eyes might have been yellow. He had long gray hair, looking charcoal in some places and beige in others. Usually some shade in between.</p> <p>In another one of these thumbnails, a girl with long black hair with her mouth closed looked into the camera. A nearly-identical girl, in the mirror, did the same. Except, you know, aside from the &quot;reflection&#39;s&quot; face being visible showing that that&#39;s not a true reflection, the girl in the mirror also had her mouth open. If I gave one analogy for the vibe ",
