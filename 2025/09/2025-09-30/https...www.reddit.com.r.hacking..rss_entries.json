Most of what I do is search for people detained in a certain facility by using their online commissary site. Sometimes by using the official (locator dot ice) platform. The problem is the powers that be don&#39;t have a lot of concern for spelling folks names correctly or entering half of the pertinent information at all. So it ends up just being me searching for random three letters that might turn up a name that might just be our missing person. I&#39;ve spent hours doing this and I&#39;m just wondering if there is another way.</p> <p>My questions are, are there any ways to do a bulk search on a platform that I don&#39;t have admin rights to? Would something like that even be legal? Does anyone have any advice that would",

He ended up saying my Dad&#39;s birthday, so he didn&#39;t even bother with trying to get my own. Anyway, he did the usual of telling me I watch some really weird NSFW content and that he can tell all my friends and family and send recordings through my webcam. He said he used a &quot;temporary email&quot;, but he used an argenitinan university email to contact me. Which is really weird. I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s not dumb enough to use an actual email he uses, but just wondering if I can somehow use this to catch him in some way. Otherwise, all I can do is report and block, which I have already done. </p> <p>The email&#39;s from uces.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/X-Monster-Master\"> /u/X-Monster-Master </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
