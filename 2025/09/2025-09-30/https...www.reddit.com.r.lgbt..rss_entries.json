We\u2019ve been together for about 2 months, and when we started dating we both identified as bisexual. About a week ago he realised he\u2019s actually abrosexual and not bi, and now things are super weird between us. </p> <p>His attraction shifted to men and he doesn\u2019t feel sexually attracted to me anymore \u2014 which is fine by me, I can go without sexual intimacy for as long as he needs, but it isn\u2019t fine with him. He\u2019s a very sexual person, so it\u2019s a really important part of relationships to him, and it\u2019s something he can\u2019t really go without. I\u2019ve looked in here and in other places but none of the posts seem to really apply to our situation. I want to stay with him, and I know he wants to stay with me. I need advice, I really don\u2019t want to break up. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Altruistic_Ad6987\"> /u/Altruistic_Ad6987 </a> <br/",

I typically use it as almost background noise so I don&#39;t wholly soak in every detail as I am rushing about doing my chores. But it makes doing my work go by faster and less boring.</p> <p>Recently I discovered this youtuber Turkey Tom who does these documentary style videos on less savory individuals who have a lot of drama and antics (sometimes illegal) to their name. I usually don&#39;t subscribe to that kind of content because I&#39;m not usually interested in that kind of drama. But on a whim I decided to listen to a few because I was curious and the videos kept popping up in my feed. At first I was enjoying the content for what it was at face value. But then I started catching weird things like weird edgy jokes or not respecting someone&#39;s identity or etc, and I guess in his view, the people",
