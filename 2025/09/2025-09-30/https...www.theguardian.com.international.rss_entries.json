Historically they\u2019ve often been a side whose performances didn\u2019t match their results, but tradition has it they would be pretty and ineffective. Under Thomas Frank they\u2019ve become the opposite. Just as at Brighton they went 2-0 down and came back to draw; again, there was more to admire in their character than how they played. And if Andreas Helmersen\u2019s effort hadn\u2019t hit the bar with a couple of minutes remaining, it would have been a very different story.</p><p>This was Bod\u00f8/Glimt\u2019s first home game in the group phase of the Champions League, and they were determined to make the most of it. The pre-match singing of the club anthem was heartfelt and gently moving, and followed by the rhythmic detonation of a series of fireworks, startlingly loud in the still Arctic night. European football has little place these days for romance but Glimt remain an example of what can be achieved by enlightened leadership even in a remote town of just over 50,00",

The narrative about how Mourinho\u2019s return would show how far his old club\u2019s standards have dropped never materialised. There was no alchemy from the 62-year-old; no expert tactical plan to confound Enzo Maresca. Then again the Mourinho of 2025 is not in charge of one of the Champions League\u2019s giants.

In the same way that pouring Guinness is an art, actually. And as with all artistic feats, people think, \u201cWell, anyone could do that!\u201d before swiftly finding out that anyone could not, in fact, do that. An accurate Irish accent, for a non-Irish actor, takes dedication, research, talent. And as is the case with all art, failure invites utter brutality from the critics.</p><p>In the canon of Irish TV and film, there are sadly more misses than hits when it comes to nailing the gift from God that is a true Irish accent. Bad accents become famous for being bad, remembered for reducing all Irish speech to a monolith.
