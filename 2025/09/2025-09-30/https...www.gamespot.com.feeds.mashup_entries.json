They just fit so nicely together, don't they? <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/october-is-thankfully-stacked-with-new-horror-games/2900-5825/\">Last year</a>, I built out a calendar of all the horror games launching in October, and people seemed to really enjoy it. Since it was useful to our readers and a blast to write, I'm back at it for another year. If you've read my work on GameSpot, you may already know I'm a horror obsessive. If you're like me, this calendar of new horror games should fill up your schedule since you've probably already done well to play the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-games/2900-4900/\">best horror games to play in 2025</a>. Perhaps some of these will end up on that list soon enough.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">One difference between last year's list and this year's",

Kicking things off early this month is Ghost of Yotei, a slice of samurai action that you'll only find on PS5 consoles--for now--while Microsoft's big releases include Keeper and The Outer Worlds 2.
