Games not only run worse (with games like Hell Let Loose being unplayable, which were very playable on Zorin), but also look worse (except Arma 3, which actually looks a bit better imo).</p> <p>With that said, was this just an issue with the OS and included AMD drivers? I am not sure whether i should try out some other OS and see if its better or just switch to Windows 11 (with removed teleometry).

But the problem is that I cannot for the life of me to get dotnet40 or 48 to download which is required for mod organizer 2. It will NOT install through protontricks. I have already reinstalled bazzite and tried again and I cannot for the life of me get protontricks to install any dotnet components so I am resorting to WINE. I downloaded it off Bazaar but I really don&#39;t know any of the commands and I am having a really hard time finding anything remotely beginner friendly. I hope to get some help here. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Several-Educator-269\"> /u/Several-Educator-269 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ntzvk9/how_do_i_install_dotnet4048_on_bazzite_using_wine/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/",
