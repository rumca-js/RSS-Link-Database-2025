Was it too dark to release in spring of 1986? Would a fall/winter release have been better?</p> <p>The scene with an injured Sean Penn confronting Christopher Walken at his home is a master class in acting from Walken. Fear, bravado, nuance, resignation all in one scene. Brilliant.</p> <p>And the score by Patrick Leonard is iconic. Synth 80s moody. Loved it.

As he said, there was nothing like it on radio, and it was a long song, with stops in the middle. Her voice was very low, and it was a huge departure for her. Madonna said if they didn\u2019t release it first she wouldn\u2019t do any videos for True Blue singles. Pat said the execs at Warner were beyond angry at this power move and felt the song would flop hard. Madonna sai",

Just looking at how scenes are staged, shot, lit, and edited, had a very low-budget TV-like feel even though the budgets for his movies are massive. It feels like he got so used to the restrictions of working in TV that he was never able to spread his wings and fully take advantage of the film medium. I think the same could be said about JJ Abrams to a lesser extend, who I believe mentioned that he uses too many close ups in his films but only because he was too used to filming for the small screen as opposed to the big screen. Are there any other filmmakers who seemingly could not escape their TV sensibilities? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Magical_critic\"> /u/Magical_critic </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
