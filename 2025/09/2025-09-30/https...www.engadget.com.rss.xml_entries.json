As has been the case for the past few years, laptop deals are abundant for Amazon's Big Deal Days, bringing discounts to MacBooks, Windows laptops, Chromebooks and more. But we wouldn\u2019t blame you if you didn\u2019t know how to figure out if that laptop you\u2019re eyeing actually has a good discount for Prime Day, or if the deal is stale.<br><br>That\u2019s where Engadget can help. We\u2019ve poured over the Prime Day laptop deals available this year to pick out the best ones you can get across all kinds of computers. If you\u2019re super picky about the specs you want in a new laptop, we always recommend going straight to the manufacturer so you can configure the machine exactly to your needs. But if you\u2019re willing to work with premade models, October Prime Day deals could help you save some cash on your next laptop.</p> \n<h2 i",
