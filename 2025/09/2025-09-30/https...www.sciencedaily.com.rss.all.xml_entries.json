The study revealed that several mamba species launch a dual neurological attack, first causing limp paralysis and then unleashing painful spasms once treatment begins.",

Symbiotic bacteria called Streptomyces produce antimicrobial compounds that fight deadly bee and plant pathogens. Bees collect these bacteria along with pollen and store them in hives, creating a natural defense system. This could lead to new, sustainable ways of protecting both pollinators and crops.",

A new study shows longer commutes increase both insomnia and daytime sleepiness, while smaller housing also raises insomnia risk. Even with average-sized homes, commuting more than 52 minutes pushed people into the insomnia range. Researchers say smarter housing planning could improve both sleep and quality of life.",

Using attosecond pulses on diamonds, they showed these hidden carriers significantly influence optical behavior.
