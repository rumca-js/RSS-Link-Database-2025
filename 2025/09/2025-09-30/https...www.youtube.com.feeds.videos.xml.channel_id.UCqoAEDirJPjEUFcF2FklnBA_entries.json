        "description": "Can we resolve the crisis in cosmology? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Matt Kirshen take on Hubble Tension, the difference between the estimated ages of the universe, and how to solve it with legendary astronomer Wendy Freedman.\n\nWe trace the debate from the early days with Henrietta Leavitt\u2019s discovery of Cepheid variables through today\u2019s most precise measurements. Why do local distance measurements (Cepheids, tip of the red-giant branch, carbon stars) give a different expansion rate than the cosmic microwave background? Could dust be dimming our view, or systematic errors biasing our results? Or do we require discovering new physics?\n\nWe break down the Hubble tension and what caused it. How did the Hubble telescope complicate the existing debate, between 10 and 20 billion years old, through more precise measurements? We explore possible explanations: local density fluctuations, evolving dark energy, or something missing from the standard model. Are we missing something fundamental ",
