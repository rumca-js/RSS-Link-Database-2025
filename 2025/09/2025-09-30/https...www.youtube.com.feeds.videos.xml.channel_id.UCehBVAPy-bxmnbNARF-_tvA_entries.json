        "description": "Shady companies are now offering people \"medical credit cards\" to pay for procedures they can't afford.\n\nThese cards from companies like Synchrony\u2019s CareCredit can end up trapping people in medical debt.\n\nOne patient compared it to signing their life away.\n-----\n\nMore Perfect Union is an Emmy-winning, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to build power for working people. Here\u2019s what that means: We report on the real struggles and challenges of the working class from a working-class perspective. We attempt to connect those problems to potential solutions. We report on the abuses and wrongdoing of corporate power. And we seek to hold accountable the ultra-rich who have too much power over America\u2019s political and economic systems.\n\n To support our independent journalism, subscribe, donate, and follow our other pages through the links below:\n- Help fund our reporting: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mpu-splash\n- Substack: https://substack.perfectunion.us/\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.co",
