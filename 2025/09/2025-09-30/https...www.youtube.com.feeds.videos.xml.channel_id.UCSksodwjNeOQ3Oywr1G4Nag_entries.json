        "description": "My @shopify  store needed an over-engineered sale notification system\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nSetting up my online store with @shopify was incredibly easy- and the sale notification work really well, but there was nothing mechanical about a phone notification.  The split flap displays you can get from Shopify are technically mechanical, but they are missing a key ingredient\u2026 marbles.  That\u2019s why I decided to make an entirely unnecessary but very Engineezy style notification system.  When the machine receives a web hook from the backend of my store, the motor turns, charging and releasing a spring powered gear, which smashes into a compliant baffle, which sets of an explosion of marbles. Pretty cursed.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n#ad #shopifypartner #engineering #engineeringstudents",
