Here are my options:</p> <p>- Buy the game translated into my language. It just came out. But only the base game. And I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ll have to wait for the expansions...</p> <p>- Buy the Czech Chrome edition. It&#39;s on sale right now and doesn&#39;t cost much. The question is, how important is the language?</p> <p>- Wait for the Kickstarter and buy it in English. I often play with random language speakers. But we dont know when will be kickstarter.</p> <p>I would really like to buy this game (I like the idea and the theme), even though I&#39;ve never tried it, but I don&#39;t know what the best thing to do is.
