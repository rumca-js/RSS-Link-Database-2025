I want it to be relatable to them/somewhat age appropriate, but I also know they do have some interests in the more child like realm of characters. I want to try and avoid triggering topics such as violence and abuse. Any genre within children/YA is welcome (fantasy, fiction, nonfiction, etc).

I tried reading LOTR, Hobbit, GoT but they weren\u2019t to my liking from a writing and follow along perspective. Maybe I just dont like high fantasy. I also tried reading A Court of Thrones &amp; Roses and it just felt extremely boring. Dune was a great read but then I didn\u2019t like Foundation.

So now I&#39;ve been trying to rekindle a love of stories with audio books. The tricky part is I&#39;m picky with voice actors, like I got some Lord of the rings audiobooks and I couldn&#39;t get through the way the actor did the voices. I&#39;ve recently gone through the Darker Shade of Magic series and I love love love it. I really enjoyed that It&#39;s a book about a magical world and the struggles that come with that. There&#39;s a bit of romance, but It&#39;s not an asexual book, it&#39;s also not the main focus of the plot. I detest forbidden romance stories and I feel like that is a lot of fantasy/magic books main trop.
