It&#39;s the best of both worlds where i can keep all my content but can sync progress across several devices. But now I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s something like Jellyfin for books/comics. I tried looking it up myself and got several different answers from Calibre, to Calibre Web Automated, to Kavita, to something called audiobookshelf.</p> <p>So I&#39;m left to ask which solution for self-hosting books is the best? Because I&#39;d love to go from reading on ipad, to iphone, to laptop, and to desktop with books like I can with movies/shows.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Smellbringer\"> /u/Smellbringer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nupanp/jellyfin_for_books/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nupanp/jellyfin_fo",

Right now I am expecting between 10,000 and 100,000 users. I have a 1 gigabit fiber connection. Almost nothing is directly exposed to the internet, I run everything behind Cloudflare with a reverse proxy, and if I really need to connect to the server I use SSH only through a VPN.</p> <p>From a security point of view I keep the exposure minimal. The only real risks are power outages or a network cut, but in practice I almost never have those, unless something like someone hitting the fiber line happens. My main goal is to test, to run a dev environment and a pre-prod environment, and maybe prod env, and to see how my product behaves. Later on I can always move to a hosted server which is not a big deal since it would just be reinstalling and transferring the data.</p> <p>My hardware is decent, 32 GB RAM, a Ryzen 7 CPU, 1 TB SSD and 2 TB HDD.
