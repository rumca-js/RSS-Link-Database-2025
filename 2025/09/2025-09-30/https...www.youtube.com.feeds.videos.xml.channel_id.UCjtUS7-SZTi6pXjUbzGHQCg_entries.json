Aetherflux is ditching massive solar farms for single satellites closer to Earth for space solar power. They plan to use high-powered lasers to beam energy to small, mobile receivers. If this tech reaches lift-off, it could one day deliver power where infrastructure doesn\u2019t exist \u2026 from disaster zones to military bases. Could this be the special use case that finally launches space-based solar power? And if this approach works, could it eventually make orbital energy cheap enough for the rest of us?\n\nWatch How CATL Made Batteries 90% Cheaper (And What Happens Next) https://youtu.be/Wf84NJSiAeU?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/why-space-based-solar-isnt-entirely-stupid/\n\nGet my achieve energy security with solar guide: \nhttps://link.undecidedmf.com/solar-guide\n\nF",
