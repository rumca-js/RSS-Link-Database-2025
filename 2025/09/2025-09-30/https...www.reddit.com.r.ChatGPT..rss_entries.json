        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So damn annoying I&#39;ll be in the middle of a chat and I&#39;ll look up and notice it switched randomly to GPT 5 on me. I think once you set a chat to cut 4o it should stay there unless you manually switch it. It shouldn&#39;t be switching it on its own multiple times back to GPT 5 when I don&#39;t want that </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FakeGamer2\"> /u/FakeGamer2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ntziyv/stop_randomly_switching_to_gpt_5/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ntziyv/stop_randomly_switching_to_gpt_5/\">[comments]</a></span>",
