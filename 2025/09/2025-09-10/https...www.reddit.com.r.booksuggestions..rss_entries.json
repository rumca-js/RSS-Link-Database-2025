I also want it to have a good buildup, of course. May it be happy ending or not, I would love to cry my eyes out \ud83d\ude06</p> <p>Preferably queer but I just really need a well-written love story like that so anything will do.</p> <p>Ps.

I\u2019m looking for recommendations as someone who loved reading for pleasure as a child but had their brain rotted by social media, and I have a touch of adhd which makes it hard to focus when I try to read. I\u2019m 28f, turning 29 next week, trying to reduce my screen time so I\u2019m looking for a good book/series that I can relate to, maybe a lil romance, maybe some family issues, ya know a story I can really see myself in. Maybe a little \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f Not too much into fantasy stuff, but I could be swayed.

It\u2019s a book about a guy who has had a lifetime of unexplained events by \u201caliens\u201d and a professor giving his take on it. </p> <p>I would love some suggestion for books about people\u2019s first hand account of an entity of any sorts thanks so much. Also if it\u2019s a audiobook even better as I work long hours and that\u2019s the only time I get to consume books lol. </p> <p>I feel like I must say that I\u2019m reading these for research for YouTube as I\u2019m starting a new thing where I really start deep diving subjects before either telling a story or just spilling info.. also this isn\u2019t a self promotion I just get yelled at by people if I don\u2019t mention it for some odd reason.
