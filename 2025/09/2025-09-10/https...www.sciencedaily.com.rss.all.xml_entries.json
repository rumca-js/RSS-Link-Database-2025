        "description": "Scientists at Stellenbosch University have uncovered a rare class of plant compounds, flavoalkaloids, in Cannabis leaves for the first time. Using advanced two-dimensional chromatography and mass spectrometry, they identified 79 phenolic compounds across three strains, 25 of which had never before been reported in Cannabis. The surprising discovery highlights the complexity of the plant and its untapped biomedical potential beyond cannabinoids, opening new doors for research and medicine.",
