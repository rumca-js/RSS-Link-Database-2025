I don&#39;t think the games I&#39;m trying to get on there have linux native versions. I installed them with their dvd onto my windows PC and then transfered them with usb to my laptop. Then installed steam and added them as non-steam games to steam for them to go through proton and i checked they do have proton support. I also tried installing brawlhalla to test things, and it ran really poorly. I think it&#39;s probably because proton uses dxvk and neither of the GPUs support vulkan. It might be driver issues. While installing steam i chose lib32-nouveau something.<br/> And I&#39;ve been pulling my hair out using Lutris and Heroic. I&#39;m new to linux and i don&#39;t know if i&#39;ll stay on it.
