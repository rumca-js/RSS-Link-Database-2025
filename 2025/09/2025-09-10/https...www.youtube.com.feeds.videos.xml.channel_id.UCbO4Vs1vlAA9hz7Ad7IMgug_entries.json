        "description": "We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Thirty-Seven! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\n\nBack in 2023, KRD released a Cyberpunk edition of their hugely popular Forbidden Psalm system where augmented humans, mutants, dregs and machines fight the Mega Corp underlings and criminal competitors on the fringes of society. Drawing from Cy-B\u00f8rg for inspiration, let's check out Kev's take on a decrepit future of digtal and augmented chaos. \n\nCheck out the rulebook in digital HERE: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/416427/kill-sample-process-forbidden-psalm-cyberpunk-miniatures-gaming-compatible-with-cy-borg?affiliate_id=210041",
