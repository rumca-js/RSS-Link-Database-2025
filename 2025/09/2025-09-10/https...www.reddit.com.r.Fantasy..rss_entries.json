This book occupies such a weird space in my heart, and I feel like it&#39;s both brilliant and deeply, deeply flawed.</p> <p>My main hang-up is this: On one hand, the Simon and Baz romance is, in my opinion, a 10/10. It\u2019s a masterclass in character writing, tension, and emotional payoff. It delivers on the queer &quot;enemies-to-lovers&quot; dynamic in a way that feels foundational.</p> <p>But on the other hand... the actual fantasy world feels incredibly lazy to me.

I used to ADORE Skyrim but I tried to play Oblivion Remastered and couldnt for the life of me get into it again.

I think a primary reason why I breezed through them and not the EoTV series is these books are about twice as long, with each clocking in at over 700 pages.</p> <p>I will say, I enjoyed a good number of things about Empire of the Vampire. The world-building and religion were engaging, I was intrigued by the Silversaints and wanted to learn more about Gabriel&#39;s past and his heritage. Some of the action sequences were highly creative and I loved the different breeds of vampires that arose throughout, along with their hierarchy. Also enjoyed Dior as a side character and found her personality quite fun.</p> <p>Additionally, the ending of the first book was great. The direction it and the main character take were very intriguing.</p> <p>Beyond those qualities, it&#39;s also quite neat to see the various sketches and artwork peppered throughout the book,",
