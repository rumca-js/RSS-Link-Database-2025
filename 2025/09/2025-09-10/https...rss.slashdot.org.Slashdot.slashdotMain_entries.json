Their sugar water is getting better, and I think this year's seasonal concoction is particularly tasty. What is inescapable, however, is that while the company does still make new products -- I definitely plan on getting new AirPod Pro 3s! -- the company has, in the pursuit of easy profits, constrained the space in which it innovates. \n\nThat didn't matter for a long time: smartphones were the center of innovation, and Apple was consequently the center of the tech universe. Now, however, Apple is increasingly on the periphery, and I think that, more than anything, is what bums people out: no, Apple may not be a sugar water purveyor, but they are farther than they have been in years from changing the world.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a c",

Pineapple Street Studios shut down in June after producing hits like Missing Richard Simmons. Amazon dismantled Wondery in August, laying off 110 employees less than five years after acquiring the studio for $300 million. Spotify terminated Gimlet in 2023 despite paying $230 million for the company in 2019. Major outlets including Pushkin Industries and This American Life have conducted layoffs. Talk shows and celebrity podcasts continue growing while investigative audio series struggle to find funding.

Taken from a rock named \"Cheyava Falls\" last year, the sample, called \"Sapphire Canyon,\" contains potential biosignatures, according to a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature. \n\nA potential biosignature is a substance or structure that might have a biological origin but requires more data or further study before a conclusion can be reached about the absence or presence of life. \"This finding by Perseverance, launched under President Trump in his first term, is the closest we have ever come to discovering life on Mars.

On Wednesday, it put the blunder down to a \"data input error\" that was picked up by Eskom, according to a presentation to lawmakers. \n\nWhile the mistake had been identified before the tariff determination was made in January, it wasn't rectified as indicated at the time, and only discovered five months later, the regulator said. \"The error is regrettable; it should not have happened,\" it said. \n\nThe incident brought into the spotlight South Africa's surging electricity prices and will result in them increasing by 8.76% in the next financial year, instead of the 5.36% ",

Annual road fatalities fell from 5,000-7,000 deaths in the 1920s and 1930s to 1,700 in recent years despite a 16-fold increase in vehicles and 33-fold increase in miles driven. \n\nThe UK now ranks among the world's safest countries for road travel at 1.9 deaths per 100,000 people. Key interventions included mandatory breathalyzer tests in 1967 that reduced drunk-driving deaths by 82%, the introduction of motorways beginning in 1958, conversion to roundabouts that cut fatal accidents by two-thirds, and 20-mph speed zones around schools.

Netflix attracts established actors like Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz but struggles to retain acclaimed directors. \n\nThe typical Netflix director has less critical acclaim and shorter filmographies than theatrical counterparts despite handling larger budgets. Directors recently turned down Netflix's $150 million for Wuthering Heights and $50 million for Weapons, accepting lower offers from Warner Bros. that guaranteed theatrical releases.

The team used fMRI scans from 15 participants viewing various colors to train a machine-learning model that could then accurately predict which colors a second group was viewing based solely on their brain activity patterns. \n\nPublished in the Journal of Neuroscience, the study found that specific brain cells in the visual cortex consistently respond more strongly to particular colors across all participants.

Nominations are open for the 2025 AI Darwin Awards and the list of contenders is growing, fueled by a tech world weary of AI and evangelists eager to shove it somewhere inappropriate. \n\nThere's the Taco Bell drive-thru incident, where the chain catastrophically overestimated AI's ability to understand customer orders. Or the Replit moment, where a spot of vibe coding nuked a production database, despite instructions from the user not to fiddle with code without permission. Then there's the woeful security surrounding an AI chatbot used to screen applicants at McDonald's, where feeding in a password of 123456 gave access to the details of 64 million job applicants.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=AI+Darwin+Awards+Launch+To+Celebrate+Spectacularly+Bad+D",

        "description": "Dozens of polar scientists have warned that geoengineering schemes to manipulate the Arctic and Antarctic are dangerous, impractical, and risk distracting from the urgent need to cut fossil fuel emissions. The BBC reports: These polar \"geoengineering\" techniques aim to cool the planet in unconventional ways, such as artificially thickening sea-ice or releasing tiny, reflective particles into the atmosphere. They have gained attention as potential future tools to combat global warming, alongside cutting carbon emissions. But more than 40 researchers say they could bring \"severe environmental damage\" and urged countries to simply focus on reaching net zero, the only established way to limit global warming.\n \nThe scientists behind the new assessment, published in the journal Frontiers in Science, reviewed the evidence for five of the most widely discussed polar geoengineering ideas. All fail to meet basic criteria for their feasibility and potential environmental risks, they say. One suc",

One explanation, according to scientists from the Netherlands, is beer. To find out why the blood-sucking critters prefer some people over others, a research team led by Felix Hol of Radboud University Nijmegen took thousands of female Anopheles mosquitoes to Lowlands, an annual music festival held in the Netherlands.\n \nResearchers set up a pop-up lab in connected shipping containers in 2023, and around 500 volunteers took part. First, they filled out a questionnaire about their hygiene, diet and behavior at the festival. Then, to see how attractive they are to mosquitoes, they placed their arm into a custom-designed cage filled with the pesky insects. The cage had tiny holes so the mosquitoes could smell the person's arm but couldn't bite them. A video camera recorded how many insects landed on a volunteer's arm compared to a sugar fee",
