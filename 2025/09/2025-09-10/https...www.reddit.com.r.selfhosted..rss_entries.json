The problem mainly comes with the other services im hosting. Like emby. Split tunnel VPN on a random smart tv? Unheard of. </p> <p>The solutions I want would minimize ongoing costs to me and hardware purchases to the client. </p> <p>Background: I&#39;ve had emby behind a reverse proxy for some time, but had to rebuild everything. I know the easiest solution would be to wait until I learn to secure everything, but that has been a multi year project, so id like to get the service to my loved ones out of the door, so I could improve it in practice and not just in my head.</p> <p>My current setup is just a machine running opnsense and another running unraid. Opnsense is doing dhcp, firewall and wireguard and unraid is serving everything else. Including DNS through technitium. I&#39;m using a DNS-01 challenge",

However, on the second day after recharging, my instance was stopped for no reason, causing the interruption of the service I was running.</p> <p>Therefore, I had to migrate the service to Azure. After the migration, I requested the deletion of the suspended instances and a refund. However, 8 days have passed and still no one has handled it. This is simply a fraudulent company.
