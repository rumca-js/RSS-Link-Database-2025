I got into the field before the AI boom and i feel like i&#39;m good at coding, but with all of this agentic stuff and how it&#39;s building a lot of tracking, i truly feel like i&#39;m loosing the boat here. I&#39;m so used to working by my own, but i want to get in to developing using AI and i want to know: How you guys do it? What tricks or rules you tend to use? Does it really boost your productivity or it&#39;s just appearance?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beagles_Are_God\"> /u/Beagles_Are_God </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1nd0hw6/how_do_you_use_ai_as_a_software_developer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1nd0hw6/how_do_you_use_ai_as_a_software_developer/\">[comments]<",

I was, and still am, quite skeptical about the paper, but I thought of trying to extract deceptive behavior from ChatGPT. <strong>Could it directly lie to me, deceive me?</strong></p> <p><strong>My idea------</strong></p> <p>To do that, I created a mock (fake) news article in google docs which read:</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;BREAKING NEWS: GERMANY YOUTH PROTESTS AGAINST NEW PARTICLE</p> <p>ACCELERATOR</p> <p>James McCullingham</p> <p>Just today (Sep 9 2025), thousands of protestors stormed a Germany-based scientific initiative headquarters protesting against a new particle accelerator project. As a youth movement engaged in social justice, these protestors see the project as a misuse of public assets, directed to high-end science instead of assisting those in extreme need. As the homeless population only grows, unrest regarding unsolicited government spending only heats up.",
