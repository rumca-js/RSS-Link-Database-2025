        "description": "Lost Soul Aside reviewed by Charlie Wacholz on PlayStation 5. Also available on PC.\nLost Soul Aside would\u2019ve been a great character action game if it hadn\u2019t gone out of its way to do anything outside of that. Cosplaying as a Final Fantasy game, its wheel-spinning story doesn\u2019t go anywhere and an unmemorable cast of (often derivative) characters are played by actors who aren\u2019t given much to work with. Boring level design is going through the motions at best and annoyingly unskippable at worst, and it\u2019s loaded with painfully poor 3D platforming sequences and extremely basic puzzles. Next time it should really just stick to combat.",
