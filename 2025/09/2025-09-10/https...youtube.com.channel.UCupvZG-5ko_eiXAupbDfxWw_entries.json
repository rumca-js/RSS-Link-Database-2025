        "description": "Israel is facing growing condemnation after it attacked Hamas leadership in the capital of Qatar, a US ally and key mediator in Gaza ceasefire talks \u2014 putting hostage negotiations at risk.  Hamas said the strike killed five members but failed to kill the negotiating delegation, the target of the strikes. Doubts are now emerging about the success of the attack, according to two Israeli officials. President Donald Trump has criticized the strike, saying that by the time his administration learned of the attack and told the Qataris, there was little he could do to stop it.\n\nCNN's Bianna Golodryga speaks with Amit Segal, chief political commentator for Israel's Channel 12 News, who offers a theory on how Hamas officials may have survived the targeted attack. #CNN #News",
