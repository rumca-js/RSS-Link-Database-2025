The system is built around an Intel 12400, 16GB ram, 1 x 256GB ssd cache for apps and a 2TB ssd cache for media storage before it hits the array. All works as it should. My question is will the nzb unpacking process benefit from a processor upgrade as I have a 13600FK with an Intel ARC A310 waiting to go somewhere. </p> <p>They system overall works well and sips power, but if the processing of files can benefit from an upgrade. then a bit more power would be fine.</p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dlargo1\"> /u/Dlargo1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1nczou2/sabnzb_and_cpu/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1nczou2/sabnzb_and_cpu/\">[comments]</a></span>",
