I&#39;ve only made a couple of small steps so far (including changing my browser) and clearly it couldnt have come at a better time all round. </p> <p>I got an email recently from crypto.com with a link to finish setting up my account. Only, I didn&#39;t request one and have never had a crypto account of any kind. It told me I could also ignore it safely if I didn&#39;t request it (I hope that&#39;s true - my gmail has 2FA anyways). Do I need to be worried? I couldn&#39;t find much info about this online. </p> <p>Honestly I&#39;m so tired of having some kind of access attempt every other week or month because my gmail is literally everywhere by now. I&#39;ll be so glad when I&#39;m fully on Proton!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Amber_Acorn\"> /u/Amber_Acorn </a>",

We&#39;ve been in the Google web-net for a long time which made us sign-in to multiple services using Google, some of which you may not even remember because you haven&#39;t used it for years but this doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll never need it. Every now and then I&#39;ve seen people crying over lost access to stuff because they deleted their Google account, so don&#39;t delete your account completely instead backup your data and save it somewhere safe(physical hard drives recommended) and then log/sign out and disconnect your Gmail from everywhere possible and stop using it completely which (will automatically protect you from being tracked).
