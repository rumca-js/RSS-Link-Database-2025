Before his book and the accompanying movie, almost no one outside of paleontologists had even heard of velociraptors, for one example. Now it&#39;s most kids&#39; favorite dinosaur.</p> <p>A lot of this is due to the popularization of his books in movies, and in that regard he&#39;s probably rivaled only by Stephen King. There was &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; obviously, and the entire industry around that, but also &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; became the vastly underrated &quot;The 13th Warrior,&quot; and there&#39;s &quot;Congo,&quot; to name just a couple, but also: Crichton created and was executive producer of the show &quot;ER,&quot; which launched the entire medical drama genre. </p> <p>Anyway, if you haven&#39;t read Crichton, check out his work. The books are always better than the movies, and a lot of his work is shockingly prescient.</p",
