I started out buying random games at my LGS just based on how the box looked. Progressed to watching review videos and backing Kickstarter and got a lot of flops that just looked cool. Now I&#39;m in a more conservative phase where I really vet a game a LOT before purchasing. I watch several playthroughs, read reviews, and really want to get a feel for not only how much I&#39;d like it, but how much my friends might like it. And even more recently I&#39;ve started thinking like &quot;do I really NEED another resource management Euro?&quot; or &quot;Do I need another deckbuilder?&quot; if I&#39;ve already got a game that does XYZ do I need a similar one?</p> <p>So I am curious how you decide what to get and what stays? Do you play multiple games regular that &quot;scratch a similar itch&quot;? How much research do you do on a game before buying? How often do games ",

If you&#39;re into fast, easy-to-learn dice games, this one\u2019s definitely worth checking out. It&#39;s a rework of the classic Choice game by Sid Sackson, but in a more casual, quick-play format that\u2019s perfect for those who like a mix of luck and strategy.</p> <p>In Can&#39;t Stop Express, you roll five dice each turn, trying to make pairs with the highest sums. The challenge is that there&#39;s also a &quot;5th die&quot; you can use, which adds some extra strategy to each roll. It\u2019s not just about getting the highest numbers but making smart choices based on the numbers you have. The game ends once you\u2019ve marked off all the spaces for one of your 5th die numbers.</p> <p>What I really like about it is how fast it is. Games are over in 15\u201320 minutes, so it\u2019s perfect for a quick gaming session. You can play with 1 to 4 players, and it scales really well. It\u2019s one of those games where ",

Sorry for the lack of news.</p> <p>Just wanted to share that a prototype is done after much playtesting and a rulebook written. The publisher is working on art, graphic design, etc. There was an original plan to make an announcement at Gencon, but due to tariffs and other instabilities in the industry, an announcement has been pushed to a later convention. I&#39;ve been told that this shouldn&#39;t push the actual campaign date as long as the world doesn&#39;t explode. Fingers crossed!</p> <p>If you want to join the discord server and become a playtester, you can check out the prototype. The game is still not announced though, so asking anyone with inside knowledge to continue to keep things discrete and just enjoy things as they are. Thank you!</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"h",
