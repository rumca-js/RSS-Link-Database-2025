In the early days, we had separate interfaces for logs, traces, and metrics, which led to a fragmented experience. Our next attempt to unify it with a SQL-based UI was fundamentally flawed, especially for logs, as it couldn&#39;t handle complex boolean logic or parentheses.</p> <p>After 2 years of accumulating issues and user feedback, we realized we had to completely overhaul our approach. A key lesson for us was that no matter how technically &quot;obvious&quot; a feature seems, if it isn&#39;t discoverable, it&#39;s useless. We also learned not to make assumptions on behalf of users, as it only leads to a frustrating and surprising experience.</p> <p>This led to Query Builder V5, a full architectural rewrite that not only fixed the core issues but also allowed us to pay off a lot of UX debt. It was a humbling journey, but the result",
