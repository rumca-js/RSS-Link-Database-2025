Faced with the prospect of moving from home, it\u2019s easy to convince yourself you\u2019ll need every mug, blanket and kitchen gadget you\u2019ve ever touched, just in case. However, speak to students who\u2019ve already lived through the chaos of it and they\u2019ll tell you \u2026 most of it sits unused, taking up space and making the end-of-term move a nightmare.</p><p>There are some things worth the space in your suitcase, though. From the practical spare phone cables to that one pair of sliders everyone swears by, here are the things students say they couldn\u2019t do without \u2013 and the ones they wish they\u2019d left at home.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/10/what-to-take-to-university\">Continue reading...</a>",

Like if you go on holiday and you go into a church, even if it\u2019s empty, you can feel the energy it\u2019s got in there. A football stadium is the same.\u201d</p><p>Kemp, the kind of Gooner who performs his own statistical analysis of Arsenal\u2019s season (\u201cI look at the league and I do a side-by-side comparison of points gained, points lost\u201d), brings to his passion for football the same all-encompassing enthusiasm that has made him a star of TV, radio and podcasting. And he believes that the game, and its unique place in society, can play an important role in addressing another subject close to his heart: suicide.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/10/roman-kemp-premier-leag",
