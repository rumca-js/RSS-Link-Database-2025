The asymmetrical, one-sided objective mode originally saw Spartans and Elites attacking or defending in Halo: Reach, with the objective for the attackers changing depending on what phase of the map was currently being played. Each team also sported unique weapon loadout options depending on whether they were on the Spartan or Elite side, further emphasizing the mode's asymmetrical nature.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwreSlUctI\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\">          <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CXwreSlUctI\" height=\"100%\" width=\"",

Today, the first-ever Play Acclaim Showcase highlighted nine games that are already part of the new Acclaim's portfolio, including a few that are available to play right now.</p><p>The selection of Acclaim's new games is a mixture of sports, side-scrolling action, 2D metroidvania-style games, and at least one game where a pig cleans a bunch of stuff with a hose it's holding in its mouth. All nine games are brand-new, never-before-seen titles, but there are a few that seem to call back to beloved games from yesteryear.</p><p>You can watch the full <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bckTJ7o8xdk\">12-minute Play Acclaim Showcase</a> on the official Acclaim YouTube channel.</p></p><br/>     <p><h2>GRIDBeat<",

Pokemon entertained me with its lighthearted antics and the catchy rhythms on Pikachu's Jukebox. Meanwhile, Digimon kept me invested with the chemistry between the characters and their relatable struggles.</p><p>Digimon's stories forced me to think about my life in a way that Pokemon didn't, and I carried those lessons with me into adulthood long after I stopped watching. I've stayed connected to Pokemon largely thanks to its video games and the marketing madness that has solidified its international presence. But, even now, I feel Digimon beats Pokemon when it comes to storytelling.</p><p>This isn't a particularly rare opinion.
