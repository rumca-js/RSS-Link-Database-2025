        "description": "Metal Gear Solid 1 released at the height of the PlayStation 1 era, a era where cinematics and 3D visuals were just starting to pop off. There\u2019s a lot of things that made Metal Gear Solid truly special, but the uncontested quality of the voice acting is among the most impressive. \n\nThe way the camera angles dynamically shifted to create tension and gameplay clarity was also very unique at the time. But most players probably remember MGS for its memorable story and boss moments. The game had surprisingly deep themes that very few, if any, games dared delve into at the time. \n\nAnd there\u2019s still no greater 4th wall breaking moment than Psycho Mantis in gaming. Join us as we reminisce on the brilliant unique quality of Metal Gear Solid on the PS1 and why we just don\u2019t get games like that anymore.",

        "description": "There's something inherently compelling about getting lost in a world that outright hates you. FromSoftware fans will understand, which is probably why so many are reportedly drawn to Hollow Knight: Silksong. The first game had its dangers and frustrations, its traps and hazards, and its challenging boss fights, but there was an inherent beauty to all the adversity, and not just from the incredible presentation.\n\nIt's probably why I enjoy Silksong so much more - the increased challenge and hostility of Pharloom has made me appreciate how everything feeds into the world design and vice versa. In fact, it may be one of the best video game worlds ever created, transcending its side-scrolling boundaries to feel like an actual living world.",
