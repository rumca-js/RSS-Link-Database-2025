I\u2019m currently working as SWE but I don\u2019t know too much about the framework (I\u2019m a Jr), and the project here is huge, so there is so many lines of code, modules and functions, but to be honest I feel a little lost when I\u2019m trying to understand what can do a function. Some times it appears like Django does magic with some reserved words haha. So what resources recommend to learn more about DRF (books, videos, courses, etc)</p> <p>Thanks for take the time to read this :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zombie_Slayer720\"> /u/Zombie_Slayer720 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1ndfe8k/im_new_in_django_rest_framework/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1ndfe8k/im_new_in_django_rest_framework/\">[comments]</a></span>",
