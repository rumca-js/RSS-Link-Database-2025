But it stopped working suddenly, and now I just get a &quot;server not found&quot; screen. But it will randomly connect, but once I try to search for anything, it dies again. I use a vpn (PIA), which I set to either Switzerland (most of the time) or the Netherlands (just the odd time). I&#39;m based in the UK. BTDig doesn&#39;t connect with either of them. I can go through each country one by one, but it will be a rather laborious, and most likely fruitless, exercise.</p> <p>So, are any of you experiencing issues with BTDig?
