Everyone today claims The Godfather is one of, if not THE greatest film of all time. I have to ask, while it was always considered great upon its release, was it immediately considered a Mount Rushmore film? Was it always THE GODFATHER? Or was it a matter of \u201cwe love this\u201d and as time went on, the legend grew and grew? On the same hand, Part II is also considered to be one of the greatest sequels of all time and even some consider it just as good as the original. Was that always the case?</p> <p>I\u2019m fascinated because in the year of our lord 2025, online discourse would have you believe everything is either considered to be a masterpiece or complete dumpster fire, so I\u2019m curious to know what exactly people thought at the time.

Martin Campbell, what a run. He rebooted 007 twice, succesfully-Goldeneye, Casino Royale, and did his version of Batman with the Zorro films. </p> <p>Interestingly CR benefitted by leaning into the tone set by Batman Begins, a film which owes some of its charm to Zorro. Back to Zorro. The romantassy subgenre would be lucky to have a romance like Zorro. A wholesome sizzler!</p> <p>Anyway just wanted to share that I saw a proper fun movie of this kind after a while. Stunts, check; good acting aligned with the tone, check; terrific writing (PiratesoftheCaribban guys!), check; solid filmmaking on display for a summer blockbuster, a la Maverick, check!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PrasannaVighne\"> /u/PrasannaVighne </a> <br/> ",

I went to see this in the theaters with a friend and I remember thinking that I liked it, but I mostly took away Juno&#39;s quirky one-liners and tried to adapt them in real life, and failed miserably. I had watched it a few times after and always enjoyed it, but never really had any strong feelings towards it other than a &quot;no way do I want to ever be a pregnant teenager&quot; mindset. </p> <p>I just rewatched Juno for the first time in probably 12 years. Oh My God. Now, I&#39;m 32 and have a child of my own (she&#39;s 2). There was so much more that jumped out to me this time around, so much that I missed as a teenager. I think it was really beautifully done, how a teenager&#39;s perspective and an adult&#39;s perspective were both so truthfully represented in this movie. Juno&#39;s character is one of the most original, strong, hilarious, and self-aware that I&#39;ve ever seen in a film. As a teen",
