Exe is indeed TDE and it works fine.</p> <p>However, from the start I found a huge problem: no GCC and no Clang. And a hell lot of other important packages also aren&#39;t available. It doesn&#39;t seem to share a package repository with Devuan, for some reason. Exe doesn&#39;t support btrfs/xfs either, and when I tried to see if the devs had any forum or community, I found out that the webpage is literally just the about section, and that&#39;s it. No community, no forums, no docs, no nothing.</p> <p>Don&#39;t waste your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://",

I really like these options and have been using them like for 5-6 years. I looked for if it&#39;s possible to use it on Linux or not, however, I couldn&#39;t find a way.

Isn&#39;t WSL essentially a Linux environment running on top of Windows, rather than a Windows environment running on Linux? </p> <p>If that\u2019s the case, it feels like the naming is a bit backward. WSL stands for Windows Subsystem for Linux, which makes sense in a very literal sense: it\u2019s a subsystem provided by Windows to support Linux. But when you think about it, the direction of the virtualization is key. Typically, when we talk about virtual machines or subsystems, we name them in the format of what is running <em>inside</em> what. Here, Linux is the thing running on top of Windows, not the other way around. So wouldn\u2019t it be more logical to call it LSW, Linux Subsystem for Windows?</p> <p>I&#39;m posting here for the first time so sorry if this breaks the rules, I don&#39;t know whether we&#39;re allowed to discuss Linux VMs</p> <p>EDIT: Since most of you agree that the naming is shit, should I raise a PR?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --",
