I noticed few months ago that there was random new chat history subject popping up\u2026 then I realised they were conversation based from my old work place in a different city.

Anyway so I change password and that of my Google logged out of all devices and enabled an authenticator. Then I noticed still every other week a chat window would appear in my ChatGPT again previous work related stuff. Again I logged out of all devices change all my passwords. But it still persists? The logged out of all devices seemed to have worked since as well I had to login in my iPad again etc. But this phantom device still seems using my account?

But what\u2019s the equivalent for chatbots?</p> <p>If you build one inside Zendesk or HubSpot, you do get some metrics (case resolutions, conversation counts, etc.), but I\u2019m looking for something deeper. I don\u2019t just want to know the number of conversations or tickets closed, I want to know <em>if the chatbot is actually helping customers in a meaningful way</em> without having to manually read through thousands of conversations.</p> <p>So, how are you doing it? Do you rely on built-in metrics, third-party tools, custom analytics, or something else?</p> <p>Thanks ",

I generated several images on Friday and ran out of the credits. I tried again Saturday and it said I didn&#39;t have any credits (24 hour rule). I tried again Sunday and the same issue. I waited about 30 hours and tried again Monday and got the same issue, tried again now and again.</p> <blockquote> <p>You&#39;ve hit the free plan limit for image generations, so I can\u2019t create this <strong>Dynamic Cinematic Action</strong> image for you right now. The credits refresh on a <strong>rolling 24-hour timer</strong> from when you last used your final generation.</p> </blockquote> <p>Does anyone know if I somehow locked myself out of generating images or what I can do to fix this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Unkoalafied_Koala\"> /u/Unkoalafied_Koala </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comment",
