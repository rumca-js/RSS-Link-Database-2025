        "description": "I used a new colorization technique, restored and applied face restoration, and created a sound design for this video of Japan in the 1920s (see so much of the Japanese culture before the war). This rare footage brings to life daily traditions, clothing, and urban life from nearly a century ago. It offers a vivid window into a world that has largely disappeared, preserving history through restoration.\n\nVideo Restoration Process:\n\u2714 FPS boosted to 60 frames per second \n\u2714 Image resolution boosted up to HD \n\u2714 Improved video sharpness and brightness \n\u2714 Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)\n\u2714added sound only for the ambiance\n\u2714restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) \n\nPlease, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.\n\nB&W Video Source: A/V Geeks\n\nMany thanks to A/V Geeks for all their hard work and dedication in preserving archival sources.
