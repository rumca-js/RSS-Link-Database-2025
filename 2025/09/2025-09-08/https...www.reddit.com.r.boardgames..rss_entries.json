The airships were the hardest part Id say, as trying to make them all look unique was challenging. The characters were the most fun, a lot more fun than I was expecting.

A lot of cards and abilities seem to be useless if you&#39;re playing only with 2 and it lacks a bit spice.</p> <p>Last week, we finally played in a 3 player scenario and it was honestly a blast. A lot more cards seemed more useful and it is far more dynamic. Especially when having to pay other players and fighting for individual cards. It just seemed like such a better deal.</p> <p>However, I frequently see that people recommend this as a 2 player game but I cannot honestly see why this game is popular with only 2 players. I feel like I might be missing something.</p> <p>What are your experiences for Port Royal with only 2 players? Are the add-on or coop more enjoy",

I could go on, but I guess you understand what I&#39;m trying to say. I really, really like the game. </p> <p>To figure out if there are more games like Claim out there I started a little research.
