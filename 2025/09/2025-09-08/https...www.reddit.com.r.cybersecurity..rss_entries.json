The idea is to fine-tune a model that looks at flow context to better judge if an alert is likely a real threat or a false positive. </p> <p>Currently my biggest challenge is to find appropriate data for fine-tuning the model, which i am struggling a little bit with. For my project, I need flow-level data with labels that specifically distinguish between true and false positives. I haven&#39;t had any luck finding such data, and its not feasible for me to manually label false positives. </p> <p>Therefor I am reaching out to the professionals on reddit, to ask: Is anyone aware of any datasets containing flow level data, that labels false positives? Any pointers would be hugely appreciated, even papers that mention how they built such datasets would help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",
