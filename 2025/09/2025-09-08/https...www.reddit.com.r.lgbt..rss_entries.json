I\u2019ve been looking at other names too and only one out of like 395 of them that I saw I like. It\u2019s Noah. I love the name Noah and have always loved it not even on me. And I want to change it again once I get into High school. But the problem is there\u2019s 2 other Noahs at my school. And I don\u2019t care that one of them is named that but the other one is my friend. I don\u2019t want to make it seem like I\u2019m stealing his name or smth. And it would be kind of weird.
