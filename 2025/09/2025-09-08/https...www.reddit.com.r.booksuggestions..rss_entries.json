If you think the book has it in there it probably does and more.) It has romance, suspense, danger, and most of all strong family ties. It started as a fan fic of Supernatural and went from there. I pictured if Sam and Dean weren&#39;t fighting supernatural beings, but just awful humans. I also wanted them to find love, but that love doesn&#39;t come without obstacles.

For me, it\u2019s Ali Hazelwood\u2019s Love, Theoretically. I feel safe and cozy reading it, even though the storyline itself isn\u2019t the coziest. So I figured maybe some of you also enjoy rereading books that aren\u2019t traditionally cozy-like thrillers, maybe? I\u2019d completely understand that, since my favorite comfort TV show is Dexter \ud83d\ude05</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EmuAnnual8152\"> /u/EmuAnnual8152 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1nbowfl/your_comfort_book_you_return_to_occasionally/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1nbowfl/your_comfort_book_you_return_to_occasionally/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Lush, descriptive language that pulls you in, and a solid plot that supports your weight. Ideally with a FMC, but I&#39;m not picky. I&#39;m looking for spooky, for thrillers, for horror, for a novel that you finish and just have to stare at the wall for 10 minutes wondering how somebody managed to create the story you just read (SHORT STORIES ARE NOT TO BE DISCLUDED- I LOVE A GOOD SHORT STORY); something that&#39;ll haunt my dreams. Some of my recent reads that fall into the sphere of what I&#39;m looking for :</p> <p>-Mexican Gothic (Sylvia Garcia-Moreno)</p> <p>-Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke (Kyle LaRocca)</p> <p>-What Moves the Dead (T.
