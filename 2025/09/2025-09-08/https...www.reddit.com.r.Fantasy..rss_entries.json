While doing some research on what I wanted to read next, I came across the Tyrant Philosophers series by Adrian Tchaikovsky. And the covers floored me. There&#39;s so much going on, the ideas evoked, and the color schemes just really resonated with me. Now, I know Tchaikovsky is very talented and prolific. I really enjoyed Children of Time. I like the premise of Tyrant Philosophers. But yeah... just phenomenal covers is what drew me there.</p> <p>So the question goes: What&#39;s a book series that the cover won you over to either reading or enjoying, because it was that good? Are there any book series you think the cover actually is to the detriment of an otherwise really good read? (For example, I hate the U.S. edition covers of Empire of the Vampire. The UK&#39;s seems way more impressive.)</p> <p>For context: <a href=\"https://adriantchaikovsky.com/tyrant-philos",

I think it is because Rowling did such a good job of making Snape so hateable while at the same time leaving subtle clues as to his redemption</p></li> <li><p>Jaime Lannister: imo the best character in ASOIAF. His arc is perhaps the most interesting as he starts off as a mockery of Prince Charming, utterly loathsome and despicable. But as the story progresses, you realise there is a nobility beneath the biting cynicism and ruthlessness. The line where he says he wanted to be the Sword of the Morning but ended up the Smiling Knight is great character interiority.</p></li> <li><p>Boromir: The elder son of the Steward of Gondor.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, I&#39;m looking for some recommendations as a fantasy reader that got through the most streamline (in my opinion) books. When I was much younger (now I&#39;m 23 ) I got into fantasy through the Conan the Barbarian books my dad gave to me. Since then I read a fair bit but I wouldn&#39;t call that a lot. So without further ado here are the books I read that I can remember from the top of my head : 1 Conan the Barbarian 2 Inheritance Cycle (Christopher Paolini) 3 Hobbit 4 LoTR 5 Silmarilion 6 The Witcher 7 All there was from Rick Riordan 8 Black Mage trilogy and sequels from Trudi Canavan 9 Milleniums rule (Canavan) 10 Demonic Cycle (Peter Brett) 11 SOIAF 12 All there is From Brandon Sanderson 13 Assassins Apprentice 14 The Kingkiller Chronicles And as I am sure at least another 15-20 titles that I cannot remember as of now as some of them were read quite some time ago (I still remember waiting for the Daylight War release by Brett in 2013 ) Wou",
