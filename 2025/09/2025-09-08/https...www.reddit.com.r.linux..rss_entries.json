The other day I helped my friend remove chrome os from their Chromebook and install Linux, but the process was a lot more painful than it should have been. All the articles I found disagreed with each other or didn\u2019t give a straight answer, so I\u2019m here to put all that in one place. One straightforward post with everything you need to know in order to install Linux on a Chromebook.</p> <p>Dependencies: You must have a Chromebook that is compatible with the BIOS installer script. You can easily tell if your Chromebook is capable by going into your Chromebook\u2019s recovery screen. If it looks like the image attached then this tutorial should work. If it doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s probably an article somewhere else.</p> <p>You also need a bootable usb with a Linux image flashed to it. If you don\u2019t, and you don\u2019t have any other device you can use to flash the drive, then use this tutorial on how to use a Chromebook to create Linux images. ( <a href=\"https:/",

I want to dip my toes into the world of Data Analysis and currently I&#39;m following Alex The Analyst&#39;s boot camp.</p> <p>I dual boot Win10/Mint and I&#39;m at the data visualisation part of the boot camp where you go through Tableau and PowerBI. This got me questioning what tools do you use for data visualisation? Python with libraries? On Windows and in general I know PowerBI and Tableau are the norm. Is there any user friendly alternative? </p> <p>I know there is Superset but from what I heard it&#39;s not suitable for beginners and Metabase but you have to self host it.</p> <p>Any tips would be appreciated and if it&#39;s even feasible to be a Data Analyst with Linux or do you need to use Windows.</p> <p>I know I&#39;m really in the beginning and I&#39;m still away from actually having to worry about it. But hopefully within the span of a few years I&#39;d like to go freelance and I&#39;d like to see my options...</p> <",
