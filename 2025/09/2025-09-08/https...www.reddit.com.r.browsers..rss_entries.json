I have a hard time closing tabs and like access to recently closed tabs if I need to recall anything. But the Arc (current browser) seems so buggy. I can&#39;t watch any video on full screen without losing the open split view windows functionality. I like having the links on the left side and all of my browsing split into multiple split windows, but I have to restart the browser a couple of time a day because I lose the open &quot;tabs&quot;. Am I the only with this issue? I have a power MBP (128GB Ram) and plenty of processing power, but am stunned that the Arc makes more complicated than it simplifies. I do a lot of video work, so going full screen is important to me. Any guidance I&#39;d appreciate it. PS: I switched to Arc because of its clean aesthetics, but it seems since launching Dia, the Browser Company has left the Arc in",

Besides that, I had some issues with Gecko and basically got bored with Firefox, I have used it for years. I switched to Brave and I love it, but I have an issue with it which I can&#39;t deal with anymore. Every minute or so I have graphical issues which occur only on Brave, I basically click or do something but the screen doesn&#39;t change or it changes for only half of screen and the only solution I found is to alt tab or change the window size and maximize it again. I am very annoyed by it so I want to switch to another browser but not sure which one to use besides those 2.
