By stimulating this receptor with a new compound called AP503, they were able to boost bone strength in mice, even reversing osteoporosis-like conditions. The breakthrough highlights a promising path toward safer and more effective treatments for millions struggling with bone loss, while also hinting at broader benefits for aging populations.",

The culprit is a protein called ApoD, which rises with age and disrupts the body\u2019s ability to fight infection. This protein damages lung tissue and weakens immune defenses, leading to worse outcomes. By pinpointing ApoD as the driver, scientists now see a promising new treatment target that could protect elderly patients from life-threatening influenza and dramatically cut flu-related deaths.",

Hidden bacterial biofilms inside arterial plaques can remain dormant for decades, shielded from the immune system, until activated by a viral infection or another external trigger. Once awakened, the bacteria spark inflammation, rupture arterial plaques, and cause blockages that lead to heart attacks.",

Instead of histamine, a different chemical called leukotrienes drives severe reactions in the gut.

Drugs already approved for asthma may block this pathway, opening the door to new ways to prevent or treat food-induced allergic emergencies.",
