I have a good PC that run the nonVR version normally, it&#39;s a Ryzen 7 5700G, with a RTX 4060 8GB, 32GB DDR4 RAM on a QHD 165Hz Monitor. The nonVR mode runs at 120 fps on ultra settings with DLSS with frame generation x2. I&#39;m using the PSVR2 with the oficial adapter thing, in a USB 3.0. To run the game i have to set all to minimum (resolution still at QHD) and enable FidelityFX (AMD) on ultraperfomance mode. I play the nonVR version with DLS because of my GPU but for some reason, the only option that works on VR is FidelityFX 2.0, ANY other option (DLSS, DLAA, FXAA, TAA, XeSS) makes the game run at 1-2 fps. I know that NMS has some performance issues and instabilties, but I just want to play this amazing game on VR, and I can&#39;t because 20 fps on VR is 100% chance of nausea.

A good mobile app does more than provide a digital checklist; it should allow organizers to customize tasks, track team progress in real-time, and maintain the thrill of discovery without constant manual coordination. Apps like GooseChase or Scavify stand out because they merge creativity with practicality: from uploading photo or video submissions to GPS-based check-ins, they remove the logistical headaches while giving participants an immersive experience.

I&#39;m having a very hard time looking for info on how to merge a 1st Order Ambisonic track and a Head-Lock Stereo Track for a VR180 video for YouTube. I know about the 6-track method, merging the 4-track ambisonic with the 2-track stereo to create the 6-track, getting that merged with the video and uploading to YouTube, but I think that process doesn&#39;t work anymore. I tried it though, and I got a very weird incorrect output. I also know about the new Eclipsa that can create such tracks, also for YouTube, but it&#39;s not yet released for Windows. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible for me to create an ambisonic/head-locked stereo track right now. Is there another way? Lol I&#39;ve got subscribers who have been waiting for almost 3 months for my next video and they may have to wait longer since I can&#39;t yet create this type of video.
