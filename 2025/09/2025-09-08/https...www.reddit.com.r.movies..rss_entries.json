        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Annabelle Creation was the first horror movie that I tried and since then I have followed the Conjuring Universe but I do not like the newer ones because they have a bunch of jumpscares and just don&#39;t have that creepy feeling that prior movies had. I remember watching this Vsauce video about &#39;Why things are creepy&#39; or something like that and then I understood that I am not a fan of horror movies but of creepy movies. I don&#39;t want there to be some moving devil/ghost who wants to eat/possess the main character and screams like a maniac because that just breaks the illusion for me. It becomes extremely clear that it is just some actor with heavy makeup and help of some VFX and post processing. I like the fear of unknown, where the villain is not something remniscient of a being but is more like an evil force. That was the reason why I liked some parts of Annabelle Creation where there was just the doll sitting there and things happening. ",
