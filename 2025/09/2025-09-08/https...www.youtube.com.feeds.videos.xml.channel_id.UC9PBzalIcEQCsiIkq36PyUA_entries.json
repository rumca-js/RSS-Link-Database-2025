Join the DF Supporter Program and support the team: https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx\n\nIn the latest DF Direct, we finally get some idea of Switch 2's ray tracing capabilities via Star Wars Outlaws - and the team likes what they see. Meanwhile, details emerge of just how much slower Switch 2 carts are compared to internal storage and MicroSD Express - and it's a touch concerning. A reported storage downgrade for PlayStation 5 isn't exactly great news, and neither is the final death of Perfect Dark - but 007 First Night and Hollow Knight: Silksong have much to commend them.\n\nGo here to check out DF merch! https://store.digitalfoundry.net\n\nSubscribe for more Digital Foundry: http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe\n\n0:00:00 Introduction \n0:01:06 News 1: Star Wars Outlaws impresses on Switch 2!\n0:23:58 News 2: Switch 2 carts are too slow for Star Wars Outlaws\n0:34:43 News 3: Report: PS5 Digital to get storage downgrade \n0:44:19 News 4: 007 First Light gameplay debuts \n1:0",
