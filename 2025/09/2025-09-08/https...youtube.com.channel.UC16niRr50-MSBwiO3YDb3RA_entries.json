The Labour NEC has announced the timeline for a deputy leader election campaign.  \n\nAdam and Chris unpack the Home Secretary\u2019s plans, and ask \u2014 who could be the next deputy PM?  Adam also speaks to the new Scotland Secretary Douglas Alexander about his new brief. They discuss the upcoming deputy leadership election and how the reshuffle may impact the direction of the party.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
