        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, we dive into the design behind the Iris replication system, an opt-in replication system that works alongside Unreal Engine's existing replication system. \n\nYou'll learn about the compromises made during design to remain as backward-compatible as possible, and about the most efficient path for migrating your existing serialization, replication graph code, and configuration to Iris. \n\nTopics covered in the session include a tour of the core components of Iris such as prioritization and filtering, and how to maximize backward compatibility and performance using these systems. \n\nLearn about the new serialization path using NetSerializers, and their benefits and differences to the existing serialization. The session also includes a look at tools, tips, and tricks for debugging bandwidth to optimize performance and maximize the gameplay experience. You'll also find out about new features coming to Iris in the future.\n\nLearn more about U",
