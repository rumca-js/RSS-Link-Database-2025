I&#39;ve fiddled with a few options but have yet to get the mod working, tried using the windows program VBF browser to manually modify the game file to use it, acted like it worked but changed nothing. Attempted to use another program called draklab mod loader, didnt work. Attempted using Limo that didn&#39;t seem to do anything either. I haven&#39;t Attempted the older vortex install script mostly because I remember it being super buggy. My question is, has anyone successfully modded ff12 in linux and how did they accomplish it.

However, I have a few concerns that I can&#39;t really find a solid answer to, how will my existing peripherals hold up? I&#39;m currently using full Razer peripherals, I&#39;m not really a die hard Razer fan, my peripherals have just become Razer ones over the past few years for some reason. Specifically, I&#39;m using a Blackwidow V3 Tenkeyless keyboard, Viper V3 pro mouse &amp; a Blackshark V2 Pro (wireless) headset. I know there&#39;s no official synapse support on Linux for Razer products and I&#39;ve seen OpenRazer, I was just wondering if anyone had any experience using Razer products on Windows and then using them on Linux (especially the wireless blackshark v2 pro&#39;s), was it much different at all?

The performance uplift is amazing obviously, but with the 9070 XT being a new card, I was wondering, should I swap to something rolling like CachyOS or OpenSUSE Tumbleweed? I know Fedora gets fairly new software but it still lags a bit relative to true rolling release distros doesn&#39;t it? For instance Fedora is still on mesa 25.1.7, when 25.2 has been out for a month now </p> <p>Will getting the slightly newer mesa (or maybe amdgpu, kernel, or whatever else) really help at all? Or am I just subconsciously trying to distrohop?

I play a lot of coop old games and some modded coop games using radmin. I tried to run radmin on Linux using bottles since it&#39;s officially not on Linux. It did not run and was having this issue trying to connect to the adapter so I went for some alternatives, one of them which peaked my interest was zero tier. I played stalker coop mod using this vpn and it worked like a charm, even better than radmin when it came to latency, like a lot better but stalker uses ipv6 so there was no problem. What I&#39;m having problem with is playing games that have only working LAN networking, that utilize ipv4 specifically. I tried playing chaos theory coop but it did not route through zero tier leading to me and my friend not being able to connect with each other. I did setup zerotier to use ipv4 so that it can act as a LAN network but still no luck. I tried giving zerotier a lower merit ",
