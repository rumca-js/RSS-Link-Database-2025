(He\u2019s not an SEO guy but an actual website developer.) Now I\u2019ve learned that they might actually play a role in SEO, especially for local businesses like mine. He never gave me access to my site up until recently so now I\u2019m currently spending hours (literally) going back through old photos, organizing, renaming, and adding alt text. It\u2019s exhausting, and honestly I\u2019m annoyed that nobody mentioned this sooner.</p> <p>My question is does all this work actually move the needle for SEO?

My situation is this:</p> <ul> <li>I&#39;m building a site that only targets Canada. </li> <li>The domain is a com (I can&#39;t buy a ca domain).</li> <li>The site is English-only. There will be no other language versions.</li> </ul> <p>Since i cannot use ccTLD targeting with a .ca domain, my question is if I can use hreflang regional targeting (en-CA)? But I&#39;m not sure if this is recommended for single-language sites?</p> <p>I asked in my network and getting mixed signals. Some people say it helps with regional targeting. Others say hreflang is only for when you have multiple versions of a page, so it&#39;s useless here or even could harm my site. Would love to get some opinions from the experts in here. Thanks in advance!</p> <p>(Btw, my business niche makes getting a GBP difficult, so I&#39;m trying to use every other signal I can.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --",
