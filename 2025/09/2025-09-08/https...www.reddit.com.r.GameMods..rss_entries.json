I\u2019ve seen people like Stelmo98 do tutorials for how to do it on windows but there is no video tutorial on how to do it on steam deck! Does anyone know like a video or something like that to help me get these mods working? If it helps I\u2019m mainly having trouble where I have to add the directories to the mod manager and it just pulls up a different files menu.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CaledonianTwins910\"> /u/CaledonianTwins910 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1nc1xyu/how_to_mod_sonic_06_on_xenia_on_steam_deck/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1nc1xyu/how_to_mod_sonic_06_on_xenia_on_steam_deck/\">[comments]</a></span>",
