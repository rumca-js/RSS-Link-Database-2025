        "description": "Hell is Us - WHY It's SO Compelling (Behind The Scenes)\nIn this Fextralife video, I have something special for you guys. I'm going to be showing you an interview that I did with Jonathan Jacques-Belletete, who is the Creative Director and Art Director on Hell is Us. This interview actually took place several months ago at their studio in Montreal, Rogue Factor Studio, and he is an absolutely incredible guy. I spent lots of time with him outside of this interview, talking to him about Hell is Us, and despite our review of Hell is Us. Hell is Us is one of those games that I was absolutely pulling for the whole way. I'm still pulling for it. I had tons of fun playing that game. It just fell short in a couple of key areas, but I think this is a studio that we're going to see big things from in the future, and I think it's a studio that really deserves the support of gamers because of what it's trying to do.\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Hell is Us Creative Director Interview\n1:04 Question 1\n2:56 Quest",
