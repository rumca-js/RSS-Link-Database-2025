        "description": "A federal judge ruled Google\u2019s search operations are an illegal monopoly \u2014 but in a huge loss to consumers (you) the company received the regulatory equivalent of a slap on the wrist.\n\nBut, Google is awaiting a ruling for their other illegal monopoly, over advertising, and it could be the last chance to break up the tech giant.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Google knows that its monopoly over ad tech hurts consumers. Back in the \u201890s, the company\u2019s founders wrote a paper outlining how search engines funded by ads are inherently biased against users.\n\nGoogle predicted this would happen nearly 30 years ago \u2014 and they profit off of it anyway.",
