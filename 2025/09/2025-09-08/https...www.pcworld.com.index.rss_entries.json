External drives are also extremely handy for transporting data between locations and devices in what used to be known as sneaker-net.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a cloud-based, networked world, local storage still offers distinct performance advantages. Transferring 4TB of data across the usual home network is generally far slower than offloading it to a 20Gbps/40Gbps SSD, then walking it to its destination. Similarly, restoring a backup from local storage is far, far faster than pulling down your data from the web. We\u2019re talking gigbytes per second instead of megabytes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your needs or intent, these are the best external drives we\u2019ve tested, both in terms of performance and budget.",

Five years ago, when I first started covering this smart home category, there were just two brands to choose from: Husqvarna and Worx. Today, there are dozen or so manufacturers vying for the mantle of best robot mower, albeit with varying success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices have come down dramatically, too. In the early days, you\u2019d need to spend at least several thousand dollars for the most basic machine. These days, you can find models for smaller yards that cost $1,000 or less. And like robot vacuums, robot lawn mowers have become more sophisticated, with features such as onboard positioning to know where they are in your yard, cameras to spot obstacles, and even AI to remember the tricky parts of your yard and how to navigate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"our-",
