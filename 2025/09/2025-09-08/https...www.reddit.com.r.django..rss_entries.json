        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So recently i deployed backend made on django on render and frontend made on react on vercel so locally it was working perfectly but when i deployed on homepage i was calling an api which was GET request and it also worked perfectly on deployed version as well but on POST request its giving me forbidden error when i looked into it further it was something like CSRF error like from react i have to POST it with CSRF added to it .. so for calling any api i made a file called apiClient.js which i call for every api request (A small API client file that i call that fetches data from the backend, attaches CSRF tokens to non-GET requests, retries on 403 by refreshing the token, and always returns JSON.) and in the code itself i tackle an issue like i was not getting the csrftoken itself , like if i print document.cookies it gave me null all time .. i am trying to solve these issue from past few days tried chatgpt, gemini, deepseek , not solved the error yet ",

Right now, my pages only update when I manually refresh them. I need the data to update automatically as soon as new info comes into the database.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard about auto-reloading every 10 seconds, but that doesn\u2019t seem like a good solution, what if a user is in the middle of doing something and the whole page refreshes? That could cause problems during our thesis defense since we need about 6 different windows/panels to always display up-to-date info.</p> <p>What\u2019s the best way to handle this in Django? Should I be looking into AJAX polling, WebSockets, Django Channels, or something else? Any advice, examples, or resources would really help because I want to make sure this looks smooth and not like a hack.</p> <p>Thanks in advance </p> <p>EDIT: I forgot to include that I already have it deployed in render</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",
