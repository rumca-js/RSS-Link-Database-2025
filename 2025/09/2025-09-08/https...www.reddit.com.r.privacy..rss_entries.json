Ideally, I\u2019d like features like: \u2022 the ability to send an SMS to the phone that will trigger a full factory reset, \u2022 extra protections like automatically wiping/resetting if the wrong USB cable gets plugged in, \u2022 basically, strong safeguards in case the phone gets stolen or tampered with.</p> <p>Does anyone know which OS or setup would be best for this? And if it\u2019s even possible to get all those features on a Pixel?</p> <p>Also, if anyone has a video or a full step-by-step explanation, that would help a lot \u2014 I\u2019m not the greatest with tech (not stupid, just not super experienced).</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RedfaceBaby0\"> /u/RedfaceBaby0 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1nc1663/safe_phone/\">[link]</a></span>",
