This service has become incredibly frustrating to use. The phrasing drives me crazy. Every time I ask a question, it always replies with something like: <em>\u201cOkay, I understand what you\u2019re looking for and, honestly, I\u2019m going to give you an uncompromising answer that respects the integrity and intelligence you put into your question.\u201d</em></p> <p>I\u2019m really losing it, it used to be so much better. I felt like I had woven a relationship, even if artificial, with the AI. There was continuity in my artistic projects, a pleasant linearity. Now it randomly switches to addressing me formally every other message, it rambles nonsense in its replies. It forgets prompts after three messages. I don\u2019t understand how OpenAI managed to produce such crap, in the middle of such a wave of success.</p> <p>I also can\u2019t",
