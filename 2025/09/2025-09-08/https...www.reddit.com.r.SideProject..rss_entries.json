The weather was perfect calm water, clear sky, just that feeling of freedom that you can only get while paddling. Every single time I go out, it somehow feels like the first time: the first strokes, the balance, the silence around me. It never gets old.</p> <p>And here comes the part I really want to brag about \ud83d\ude48. I tracked this session using my own app <strong>Paddle Track</strong>. I built it because I always wanted a simple way to keep a memory of my paddles, not just in photos, but also in stats.<br/> This time I used my Apple Watch while paddling and it was honestly super fun to see my speed, distance, and calories live on my wrist. Afterwards, checking the route and results on my phone made me even more hyped about the whole session.</p> <p>Sharing here a photo and the tracking screenshot because it felt like the perfect combo: enjoying the paddle and then seeing the story of it written",

I was tired of trying to memorize my IP address just to run localhost on my phone to test websites I was working on (ex: personal website, other side project etc).So I build VSQR (Visual Studio QR) that takes the hassel away. It uses you local IP address along with the port you project is running on and generates a QR code which you can scan to see the site on your phone.</p> <p>Below is a video showing how it works:</p> <p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1nbz3bu/video/ovabz44i40of1/player\">https://reddit.com/link/1nbz3bu/video/ovabz44i40of1/player</a></p> <p>also here is the link to the extension:<br/> <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Srivats.vsqr\">https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Srivats.vsqr</a></p> <p>Do try it out and let me know what you think!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sr",

By the time we opened a notes app, the thought was already gone.</p> <p>That\u2019s what led us to build <strong>ListN</strong>. It\u2019s our attempt to make capturing tasks as quick as possible: you tap once, speak, and it\u2019s saved. We also added brain dumps with a timeline view so we can keep track of scattered ideas, and an AI buddy to help us stay on top of everything.</p> <p>We just opened the iOS beta on <strong>TestFlight</strong> and would love for this community to try it out and share feedback:<br/> \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://testflight.apple.com/join/xTgUZCbG?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">https://testflight.apple.com/join/xTgUZCbG</a></p> <p>We\u2019re especially curious if the task flow feels natural and if it actually helps you capture things before they slip away.</p> </div><!-- SC_",

Essentially i made a app that lets you turn your book into an audiobook using ai for the fraction of the cost of hiring someone to make the audiobook for you. I found some VA have done hard to read books with around 40k words for around $1000. My app save you the time and can convert a book with 40k words for just $100. I hope this can bridge the gap between making your own audiobook and paying &gt;$1000 for a VA to make it. I understand there is some hate on AI but it actually has gotten lot better recently. Ai voices are getting used more and more everyday by big companies(I literally saw a full on ai influencer the other day and i honestly didn&#39;t realize it was ai at first) . Now is that a good thing or a bad thing, idk. But the world seems to be leaning that way. So if you wanna try it out its called voicescri",

Instead of rigid genres, you can type moods like: \u2013 \u201cMind-bending thriller\u201d \u2013 \u201cScary but no haunted houses\u201d \u2013 \u201c90s nostalgic vibe\u201d</p> <p>It instantly returns real films that fit the tone, and I added a feature where you can generate \u201cTop 3\u201d share cards to send to friends.</p> <p>Try it with the link above</p> <p>It\u2019s still early, so I\u2019d love feedback on two things: 1. What feature would make this actually stick for you long-term? 2. Would you pay $5 for something like this (e.g., filters/bookmarking), or should I just keep it totally free and grow it out?</p> <p>Happy to answer questions about how I built it (Next.js + AI backend) too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://",
