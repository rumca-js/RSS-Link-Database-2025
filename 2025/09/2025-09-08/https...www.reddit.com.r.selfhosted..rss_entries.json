Their free tier is perfect for my needs (Like I send, 50 emails a year if that) and integrates perfectly with my mailcow server. And you get a neat dashboard with fancy stats. So shout-out to them for solving a problem I think many people considering self-hosting mailserver likely have (and probably deters others fellow self-hosters from doing so in the first place). Amazing service. EU",

(you can follow exactly the subs you want without affecting others)</p> <p>Personal Flair &amp; Keyword Filters: Fine-tune what gets through to your feed with per-user flair and keyword filters.</p> <p>Improved Quiet Hours: Quiet hours now properly suppress both live notifications and digests. Never get pinged during your downtime again.</p> <p>Better Seen-Posts Handling: Each user now has their own tracking, so if two people follow the same subreddit, they won\u2019t interfere with each other\u2019s seen posts.</p> <p>Adm",
