Sometimes I feel powerful when it refactors many things all at once.</p> <p>The low information entropy is very helpful. Context switching to browsers and research has always been an occupational hazard. leading to distraction. And Copilot has been good for stymieing that trend.</p> <p>But, lately it doesn\u2019t seem to be working correctly.
