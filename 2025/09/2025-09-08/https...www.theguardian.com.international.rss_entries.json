Within its 19-minute running time it appears to try summarising the action of an entire 90-minute feature film. There isn\u2019t a moment to really relax and explore any relationship in any satisfying and plausible way; the line-readings are rushed and uncomfortable and, most bewilderingly, Seal doesn\u2019t actually get to sing all that much, although as an actor he has a strong and confident address to the camera.</p><p>The premise is that Millicent (played by Nse Ikpe-Etim) runs a vibrant and hugely successful club in Lagos, but she is very ill, and the qu",
