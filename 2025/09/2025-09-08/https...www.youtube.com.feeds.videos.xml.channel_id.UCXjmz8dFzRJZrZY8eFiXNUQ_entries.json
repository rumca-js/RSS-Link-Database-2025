        "description": "In today\u2019s nonstop stream of Marvel and DC blockbusters, it feels like the idea of \u201calternate superheroes\u201d has completely disappeared. Before superhero fatigue set in, studios were more willing to take risks on fresh, lesser-known heroes from the comic world.\n\nWith films like Kick-Ass, Super, Darkman, and Chronicle, audiences showed there was a real thirst for superhero stories outside the Marvel/DC machine. But somewhere along the way, that trend faded.\n\nDo YOU miss alternate superhero movies? Or do you prefer Marvel and DC\u2019s approach? Drop your thoughts in the comments!",
