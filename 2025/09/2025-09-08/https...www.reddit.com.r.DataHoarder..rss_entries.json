I currently have around 10 TB of imaging files, and the amount is still growing. Because of this, I\u2019m considering setting up a disk array (DAS) to store my data securely.</p> <p>Based on my situation, I think it might be best to go with 2 or 4\u00d7 18 TB (or larger) drives in a RAID 1 setup. I\u2019ve researched potential sources for drives, including re-certified enterprise drives from Servicepartdeal or Goharddrive. I\u2019ve also seen people shucking external hard drives, such as Seagate Expansion 18 TB (which contain Exos drives). Unfortunately, I missed out on those during the recent sale.</p> <p>However, today I came across a local store selling four WD 18 TB My Book units for about $220 each (\u2248$12.22/TB). This seems like a very good deal, but since I have no experience shucking, I\u2019m unsure. Should I go ahead and grab",
