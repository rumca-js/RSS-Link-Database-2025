        "description": "Scientists at the University of Bath have developed a simple three-minute brainwave test called Fastball EEG that can detect memory problems years before Alzheimer\u2019s is typically diagnosed. Unlike traditional memory tests, it passively records brain responses to images and has now been proven effective in people\u2019s homes. With breakthrough Alzheimer\u2019s drugs working best in early stages, this low-cost, accessible tool could transform early detection and treatment.",

Using a scanning tunneling microscope, they indirectly read the nucleus through its electrons, finding the nuclear spin surprisingly stable for several seconds. This \u201csingle-shot readout\u201d breakthrough could pave the way for manipulating atomic-scale quantum states, with future applications in quantum sensing and simulation.",
