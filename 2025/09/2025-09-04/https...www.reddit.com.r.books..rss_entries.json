Having recently finished the SLA books I was expecting it to get dragged out and not have suck an easy resolution. With Brandon Sanderson as soon as you think a story&#39;s line is about to conclude you find out that that&#39;s just one end of an unraveling ball of bullshit yarn that interconnects a ton of other universes. </p> <p>It was nice to get a quick and easy conclusion to something you had no idea how they would make it out of..</p> <p>Sorry this post was very vague I&#39;m not trying to spoil anything. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/iamwhoiwasnow\"> /u/iamwhoiwasnow </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

To get a sense of timing, <em>House of Mirth</em> was written in 1905. <em>Ethan Frome</em>, considered by many to be one of her shorter masterpieces, in 1911, and <em>Summer</em> in 1917.

So much that I finished The mortal instruments, Infernal Devices and Lady Midnight in 2 weeks! I do love the characters and intricate story and interweaved history. But I wanted an outsiders perspective on those books. Because many people say that they are not really that great and they mainly hook you to know what happens next. To a certain level, I agree, because I do look for C Clare&#39;s new content to know for additional events in the character&#39;s lives. Also, now being an adult in late 20s, I don&#39;t think I would have liked the first 2 or 3 books as much as I did when I was in high school.
