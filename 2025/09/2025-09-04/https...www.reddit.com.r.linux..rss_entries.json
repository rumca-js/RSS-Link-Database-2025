Operating system - This is why I am posting here. I used Windows laptops for most of the last 20 years - so I\u2019m familiar with it, and this will be my default option (vs. Mac).

So here is the backstory. Back in December I wanted to build a plex server, i bought an old Dell OptiPlex 7040 for about $80 and I decided to throw Ubuntu on it because its not the most powerful thing in the world and I didnt want to spare a lot of processing power for Windows&#39;s bloat and ive been hearing so many good thing about Linux and how user friendly it is. So I threw the latest version of Ubuntu desktop on it (I dont remember which one), Lo and behold I saw that ubuntu had RDP in the settings, this worked but only when a display was connected to the Optiplex. I wanted the machine to be by itself behind a desk so leaving a monitor connected to it was not possible. So I went on one of the linux support subs and fired off a question.
