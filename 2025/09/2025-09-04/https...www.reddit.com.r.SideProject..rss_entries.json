Every. Single. Time. I found myself copy-pasting the same auth setup, database configs, testing boilerplate, deployment scripts... you know the drill. It was driving me nuts.</p> <p>So I did what any reasonable developer would do - I spent months building the ultimate FastAPI template to end this madness once and for all. Meet <a href=\"https://fastlaunchapi.dev\">FastLaunchAPI</a>.</p> <p><strong>What it actually does:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Gives you a production-ready FastAPI setup in under 30 minutes</li> <li>Handles all the boring stuff: auth, database, testing, Docker, deployment configs</li> <li>Lets you focus on building your actual product instead of wrestling with boilerplate</li> </ul> <p><strong>The real talk:</strong> I&#39;m literally one customer away from hitting $1k in sales, which honestly feels surreal.

I wanted a tool that could do the heavy lifting for me.</p> <p><strong>Our Solution:</strong> NoteDeck is an AI-powered web app that automatically generates high-quality flashcards from pasted text, PDF uploads, or even a web article link.

I shared the app with a few student communities, and within a very short time, we&#39;ve had <strong>over 200 signups and more than 20 users upgrade to the Pro vers",
