        "description": "Josh takes to the skies (and then promptly crashes back down) with a beautifully elite Imperial Guard list that screams plasma and nostalgia. Command squads in Chimeras, stormtroopers in triple Valkyries, and enough blast markers to make a ruin blush. His opponent today is Joe, bravely fielding Tyranids with custom monster rules, some classic gribblies, and a few sinister surprises, including a Carnifex that seems to have skipped breakfast... and lunch.\n\nWhat follows is a cinematic throwdown of airborne Guard tactics versus relentless Xenos tide. Valkyries swoop, plasma guns overheat (a lot), and somewhere in the wreckage, a lone Lictor stages a Michael Bay-worthy ambush. Meanwhile, Joe patiently waits for his 300-point deep-striking monster to show up and make a dramatic entrance... eventually.\n\nWill the Guard\u2019s firepower be enough to burn through layers of synapse and chitin? Or will the Hive Mind grind them down beneath a tide of claws and missed leadership checks?\n\nMembers to watc",
