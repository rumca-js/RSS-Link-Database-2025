One way of solving this is to pipe stdout and stderr to a file (if you remember how to do that) and then <code>tail -f</code> that file while the command is running to see what it says. My grievances with this process was that it took up time, I had to either choose to see loading bars and progress meters and have them clutter up the logs or to forego seeing progress bars entirely by disabling them.</p> <p>OutputBuddy allows you to easily redirect stdout and stderr to files and/or the terminal while stripping the the ANSI characters for terminal colors and loading bars/spinners when writing to the files.</p> <p>The minimum you have to do to use it is:<br/> <code>ob -- &lt;your-command-here&gt;</code></p> <p>T",
