        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been looking for an Eco-safe browser for a while, and I settled on Ecosia. It was a really nice browser and seemed fine, but the planed implementation of Ai is driving me away, as I feel it kinda defeats the purpose of an Eco-safe browser. I see that Vivaldi is a browser that is strictly against Ai which attracts me alot, I just want to do my due diligence and see how safe it is with like user information, malware, and other potential safety concerns. If possible, i&#39;d like detailed answers, or sources/articles/pages I could read to get that information. I appreciate brief answers as well though, thank you for reading :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YellowPinkYellowPink\"> /u/YellowPinkYellowPink </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1n81hji/how_safe_is_vivaldi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1n81hji/h",
