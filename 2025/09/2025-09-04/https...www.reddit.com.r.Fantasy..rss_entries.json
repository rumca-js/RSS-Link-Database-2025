Instead of just retelling stories, she goes deep into the <em>spiritual and philosophical side</em> of the divine feminine. It feels less like a \u201cnovel\u201d and more like a journey that makes you pause and reflect. If you\u2019re looking for something beyond surface-level mythology, this one stands out.</li> <li><strong>Devdutt Pattanaik \u2013</strong> <strong><em>Jaya</em></strong> <strong>/</strong> <strong><em>Sita</em></strong> <strong>/</strong> <strong><em>Myth = Mithya</em></strong> He\u2019s probably the most popular mythologist in India today.

Now I\u2019m Canadian and know quite a bit about this so I found this appalling.</p> <p>I am in no way defending his actions because it was horrible, but I don\u2019t see how the book fully shows anything other than how hurtful and stupid racism is (the story itself I mean), TJ Klune is stupid for even saying he tried to water down this horrific event to make it more \u2018palatable\u2019, but the book itself seems to be show casing the horrors of the orphanages and foster system while also showcasing how racism can lead to violence. Which I can see how it parallels the inspiration.</p> <p>Can anyone give me a better understanding of this as I would like to learn genuinely.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Intelligent_Big3164\"> /u/Intelligent_Big3164 </a> <br",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So just like the title says. I believe as as far as contemporary fantasy goes, The Locked Tomb series takes the fantasy genre to a different level. The author is really good at the story build up and in my opinion more masterful at the late game twist than M. Night Shyamalan.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a ton of subtle symbolism that upon a second read through I didn\u2019t even realize was there. I feel like the author put a ton of thought into how this story unfolds and it roles together extremely well. Plus the characters are dynamic and keep me guessing. </p> <p>Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Immediate_Toe3844\"> /u/Immediate_Toe3844 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1n7wn5p/the_locked_tomb_takes_fantasy_to_a_new_level/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1n7wn5p/the_locked_tomb_takes_fantasy_to_a_new_level/\">[comment",
