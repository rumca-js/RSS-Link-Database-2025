        "description": "After hundreds of crashes and major lawsuits, Tesla\u2019s misleading \"autonomous driving\" claims might be coming to an end.\nElon Musk and Tesla have promised full self-driving cars, but they haven't delivered.\nNow they might have to fully retract the claim and face consequences. \n-----\n\nMore Perfect Union is an Emmy-winning, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to build power for working people. Here\u2019s what that means: We report on the real struggles and challenges of the working class from a working-class perspective. We attempt to connect those problems to potential solutions. We report on the abuses and wrongdoing of corporate power. And we seek to hold accountable the ultra-rich who have too much power over America\u2019s political and economic systems.\n\n To support our independent journalism, subscribe, donate, and follow our other pages through the links below:\n- Help fund our reporting: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mpu-splash\n- Substack: https://substack.perfectunion.us/\n- TikTok: h",
