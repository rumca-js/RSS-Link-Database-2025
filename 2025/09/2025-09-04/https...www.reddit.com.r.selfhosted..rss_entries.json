The application is a single HTML file that you can save to your computer or phone and then bookmark or open the file in your browser. It&#39;s available here <a href=\"https://www.dgendill.com/content/crop-wizard/\">https://www.dgendill.com/content/crop-wizard/</a> </p> <p>Just open Crop Wizard, choose an image to edit, then select the crop area, and save the new cropped image. After you choose the crop area, you can also change the &quot;Output Width&quot; or &quot;Output Height&quot; to resize. There are some options to control the crop size aspect ratio too.</p> <p>Hope this is useful to you! Feedback, bug reports, and feature requests welcome.

But from my days in gaming communities, I know a lot of folks back then used things like CPanel, Plesk, etc. to host things like forums, databases, CRMs, etc. So my question is, is it worth the effort to package my product for these kinds of platforms as well as the modern container image approach?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Southclaws\">",
