        "description": "Florida has a massive problem - their coral reefs are 98% gone. Get your own Insta360 X5 HERE: https://store.insta360.com/product/x5?utm_term=INRKSLZ First 50 people get a free selfie stick! and HUGE thanks to Insta360 for donating to the Coral Restoration Foundation. \n\nToday we are going to dive deep under the ocean waves and help replant some staghorn and elkhorn coral. These stony reefs are vital homes where small fish live. 25% of all marine species rely on corals, and 70% of the worlds oxygen is produced by the ocean - so if you like oxygen - the health of the ocean is something to keep an eye on. \n\nMore information on the Coral Restoration Foundation can be found HERE: https://www.coralrestoration.org/ tell them I said hi \n\nMore information on the High Seas Treaty can be found here. https://highseasalliance.org/treaty-ratification/ PLEASE call your elected officials and make sure they have ratified this agreement.",
