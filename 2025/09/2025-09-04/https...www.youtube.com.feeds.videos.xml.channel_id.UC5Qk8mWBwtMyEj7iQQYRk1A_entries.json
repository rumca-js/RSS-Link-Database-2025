The skin is automatically available in-game, only when purchasing Hell is Us on the Epic Games Store. https://epic.gm/hell-is-us\n\nThe game features no quest markers or magical compass. Without those artificial aids, it relies on organic exploration and gives back players the freedom to uncover its story on their own.\nYou are Remi and as you set foot in Hadea, the only thing you recall is that your father was the blacksmith of a village named Jova. But the search for your past may bind your destiny to Hadea in ways you never expected. You are now part of it.",
