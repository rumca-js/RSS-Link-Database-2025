        "description": "Knit fabrics are everywhere. You're probably wearing them right now. But even though we've been making them for centuries, there's a lot we don't know about how knitting works, and physicists think that unraveling these mysteries has the potential to give us all kinds of high-tech fabrics of the future.\n\nHosted by: Hank Green (he/him)\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon supporters for helping us keep SciShow free for everyone forever: Eric Jensen, David Johnston, Alan Wong, Cye Stoner, Bethany Matthews, Adam Brainard, Friso, Matt Curls, Chris Mackey, Garrett Galloway, J.V.
