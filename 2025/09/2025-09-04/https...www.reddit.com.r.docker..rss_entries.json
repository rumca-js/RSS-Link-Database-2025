First of all, I want to say I am new to docker and my question might be trivial, but I decided to ask here as none of the tutorials I&#39;ve watched or pages I&#39;ve searched seem to have encountered this. So my setup is Docker Desktop on Windows, and WSL2, in which I have my project. I connect to WSL, then run docker-compose --build up to boot up my containers the first time. Then, I see them in docker desktop, all good, everything works as expected. But sometimes, not sure when, like maybe after a couple of restarts, or shutdowns, just not sure when because it&#39;s random, I then go in to my adminer and poof, my database is gone!. So, I do docker exec into my DB and all records seem to be there, so I do docker-compose down, then I go docker-compose up, my containers boot up, and same issue. So then I try to insert records into my adminer, and I see them into my adminer. Then I use the backend to get that data and it returns the data",
