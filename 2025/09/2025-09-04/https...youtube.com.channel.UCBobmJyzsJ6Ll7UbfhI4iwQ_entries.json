        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, Thomas Meeker of X-Rite | Pantone explores how UE and AxF can transform your approach to product design and 3D visualization. \n\nThe need for accurately measured virtual materials is becoming a new standard to overcome challenges in advanced visualization. But how do you create these measured materials? \n\nThe PANTORA application simplifies digital material creation, offering a standardized platform for storing and sharing complex material data to streamline design workflows. This standardized material output is the AxF (Appearance Exchange Format) material package.  \n\nLearn how to create digital material twins using PANTORA and a spectrophotometer, and how to streamline complex material communication using the AxF format. The session also covers PANTORA integration with Unreal Engine, including ensuring compatibility across all rendering targets (VR, AR, Lumen, Path Tracing) without the need to manually author new material graphs.\n\n",
