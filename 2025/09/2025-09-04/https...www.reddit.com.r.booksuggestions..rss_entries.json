I would prefer to read something that\u2019s more popular and people already know and love, and I know the boys of tommen series and the magnolia parks series are pretty popular.

I keep thinking about this one YouTube short that I watched about a girl being obsessed over her crush which lead to her drugging and kidnapping him, but we find out that he\u2019s conscious and also just as obsessed with her as she is with him. Based on the comments, it seems that it\u2019s from a music video, iirc. I really wanna read something like that. </p> <p>Also, could I get recommendations on stories where the stalkee is completely aware that she/he is being stalked and of all the bad things their stalker has done, but lets it happen and is even flattered by it. Maybe even, help the stalker do their stuff. I\u2019ve read this in a fanfic, but I want more!!

Similar vibe to that I read just The cruel prince thrilogy which I really love.</p> <p>I would most like a fantasy book (but not romantasy please , I am more into like a political fantasy)</p> <p>And please some well written and thought out books, not something that is just telling and no showing</p> <p>And if there would be a love element to it, please slow burn but you can suggest me even a book where they don&#39;t end up together. And for that enemies part I really do need tham to be enemies not just saying that they hate each other they must really hate eatch other and show it through actions.</p> <p>Thanks for any suggestion and sorry if i have any spelling or grammatic error",

No gore, no body horror, just relying on suspense and mystery for horror like the twilight zone. I love the dummy episode and how everyone doubts the protagonists sanity until the unnerving finale. I like mirror image and the mystery of what could be wrong until the end. I love person or person&#39;s unknown and how the rest of the world think he&#39;s crazy until the twist at the end.</p> <p>Any kind of short story collections like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LiliaAmazing\"> /u/LiliaAmazing </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1n7yvgk/psychological_horror_books_for_twilight_zone/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1n7yvgk/psychological_horror_books_for_twilight_zone/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Life as a farmer in the Japanese countryside was tough\u2014hard manual labor, low pay, and a significant power imbalance favoring the male side of the family. She couldn\u2019t travel abroad or even to other cities in Japan. It seems far from what we imagine as a happy life today. But in the end, she seemed very calm and content. Her last words were a goodbye to her son (my dad). Since she wasn\u2019t very religious, I don\u2019t believe her calmness came from a belief in reincarnation. But I felt truly relieved and respectful toward her for accepting her life.</p> <p>Turning to our modern life, I feel we are all so busy with various projects or constantly distracted by social comparisons\u2014I&#39;m not sure if this is the best way to come to terms with our eventual death or to live a meaningful life. I think we are just ignoring death, rather than denying it.</p> <p>Do",

I like to read them near an open window so I feel like im transformed into the story. Another example i could think of was the Delerium series or the Uglies.

For most of my life I&#39;ve been depressed and found little to no hope but recently there has been this one thought popping up in my head daily : &quot;What if it&#39;s possible to find love and happiness amidst pain and suffering even if we can&#39;t escape this suffering?&quot;. </p> <p>I&#39;d love to read some books that have this motive, especially if they touch the topics of childhood trauma, guilt, self-esteem, forgiveness and redemption. I&#39;d like to read something that could inspire to learn to be content and happy and to be able to love even if the world around you is crumbling. </p> <p>I am tagging this in self-help seeing as the topic is connected to self-improvement, however the book does not have to be strictly a self-help book. </p> <p>Thanks in advance for replies. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"http",
