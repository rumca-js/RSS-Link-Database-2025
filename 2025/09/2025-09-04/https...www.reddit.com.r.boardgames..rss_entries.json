I also started to like turn-based computer games with tokens on the board. Have you ever felt something similar? I have friends who love board games and don&#39;t play computer games at all.

I fell in love during a game of Carcassonne and I never looked back. </p> <p>We aren&#39;t having a traditional wedding reception with dancing (guest list is 15ish - seemed strange to have a dance with that few people, plus we&#39;re awkward. Dancing for us would be pointing finger guns in the air and twirling or just overall trying to one up the other on who looks the most foolish). </p> <p>What are your favorite games to play with a group? Some in our group are board game aficionados like us, while others may be newer and not as comfortable with complicated rules. The game also needs to be portable enough that it isn&#39;t taking up an entire suitcase (looking at you, Gloomhaven). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",

It was super hot some years ago, but I haven&#39;t heard about it in any board game media for quite some time. Has it just been forgotten with time, or is there some consensus that it&#39;s flawed in some way? Or have other better games replaced it? If you have/had it, do you still play it? And if it&#39;s still good, is the base game or the Long Night the way to go?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FlyingLlamasaurus\"> /u/FlyingLlamasaurus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1n88ljj/how_does_dead_of_winter_hold_up/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1n88ljj/how_does_dead_of_winter_hold_up/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Are any of the other expansions worth getting, or the new \u201cbig box\u201d sort of thing that I\u2019ve seen recently? I kinda like the tightness of what I have but it seems cool to maybe add a new colour and person? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/edsjfhek\"> /u/edsjfhek </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1n7xl60/what_expansions_for_shards_of_infinity/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1n7xl60/what_expansions_for_shards_of_infinity/\">[comments]</a></span>",
