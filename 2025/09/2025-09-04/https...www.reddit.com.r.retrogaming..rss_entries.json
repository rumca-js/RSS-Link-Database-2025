My journey starts now (just to be a bit dramatic haha).</p> <p>In the past I\u2019ve had CIB (when I was a kid), cart only (when I started collecting as I got older). I\u2019ve had all of Krikzz\u2019s EverDrives after selling said carts, then after selling them I missed gaming and bought the Analogue Pocket &amp; Dock w/ a 8bitdo Arcade stick.</p> <p>In 2025 and if you were to start playing/collecting again, what would you do?</p> <p>I could buy CIB games with around 30 for each console on original hardware. Consoles I would buy; Mega Drive, PS1 &amp; N64\u2026 possibly Master System \ud83e\udd14 </p> <p>Or; do I rebuy the EverDrives and get a Mega Drive, SNES, NES, PS1 &amp; N64?</p> <p>Orrrrr; do I just rebuy the Analogue Pocket &amp; Dock, plus Analogue 3D (when available) and an XStation with HDMI &amp; MemCard Pro?</p> <p>Thanks for your time and hopefully help!</p> <p>Bonus question; do I still buy games even ",
