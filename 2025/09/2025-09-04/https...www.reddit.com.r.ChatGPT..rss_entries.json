I only noticed these errors because some answers seemed so off that they made me suspicious.

This creates a tangible legal vulnerability for users.</p> <p>This forces a re-evaluation of the common narrative that non-American AI models like DeepSeek are inherently riskier. While data sovereignty is a valid concern, the immediate threat of a US company legally compelled to hand over your data to police and prosecutors is a demonstrated reality. In contrast, the risk of a foreign government weaponizing personal data against an average individual, while not zero, is far more abstract and less probable for most users. China having my legal/ health data is of little use to them for a pleb like me. </p> <p>Is this shortsighted and wouldn\u2019t it make more sense to use a non American AI mode",
