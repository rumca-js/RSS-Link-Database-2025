I have multiple controllers connected to my rig, including a steering wheel, shifter, handbrake, and a hotas setup. That means that my Xbox controller cannot be used for Sekiro while all those other stuff are connected. Having to squeeze behind my desk to unplug all the other peripherals before and after I play Sekiro is not something I am ready to do. So I need a workaround.</p> <p>There are 2 potential ways that I can think of:</p> <ol> <li>Some script that can disable the other controllers when I launch the game. Maybe a proton argument.</li> <li>Something that can change the detection order of controllers, maybe system wide, or maybe only for proton.</li> </ol> <p>Does anyone have any leads on whether any of this can be achieved? Or perhaps another workaround?</p> <p>System Info:<br/> Nobara, Sekiro through Steam, Flydigi",

Idk why I didn&#39;t know this earlier, but as late as 6 month ago I discovered the Steam Deck and Proton (I am always really behind on news). Bought a Deck, saw that Proton is a game changer, than switched on Linux on my laptop.</p> <p>I chose CachyOS, wanted to try arch for the first time, and CachyOS for reasons you guys already know seemed perfect. But I installed GNOME.</p> <p>Oh boy.. So i have a 14inch laptop with 2560\u00d71600 resolution. The fonts and icons and everything were really tiny. I needed to upscale to 150%. But immediatly I saw that in games I could only go up to 1700xsomething resolution.

I was thinking of switching to Bazzite or CachyOS. I&#39;ve heard good things from both, but which one do you all suggest for me to switch to? And If you can tell me as well, what&#39;re the steps to ensure that I switch distros with no problems or erasure of my data/games on my disks? I&#39;m also not an expert in troubleshooting linux via terminal, best I could do is probably install flatpaks, some sudo commands, view system info, and other novice/simple commands, it would help me if the Distro doesn&#39;t need much terminal tweaking for troubleshooting, updates, and etc.</p> </div><!--",
