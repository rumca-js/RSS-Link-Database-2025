But after researching, I have seen people saying a lot of cons to many headsets and I am having a hard time figuring out which one is the best for the price. I have been looking into the Meta Quest 3s (128GB) , which is $440 for me. Also don&#39;t just blatantly say that the Quest 3 is better, it&#39;s obvious that it is, but it costs a crazy $720 for me.
