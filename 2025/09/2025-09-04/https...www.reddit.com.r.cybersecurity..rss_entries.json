I tried using the standard script kiddie tools like Metasploit onto my Macbook that ran a Windows 10 VM but as you can imagine, I was kind of limited as far as what I could do. Still learned stuff, though. </p> <p>Anyway, so besides the Macbook and my Kali machine, I&#39;ve got an Arduino that I haven&#39;t used since I took a class with it and I want to learn how to use/configure hardware into security tools. In particular, I&#39;m interesting in pentesting as well as defending attacks and anti-surveillance/&quot;ghost mode&quot; (but I know being completely hidden online is kind of a pipedream). </p> <p>What can I do with my Arduino and Kali Linux that will, if nothing else, give me some important basic knowledge on how certain things work? Obviously I don&#39;t expect much from an Arduino, and if anyone wants to suggest a different distro that&#39;s more &quot;seriou",
