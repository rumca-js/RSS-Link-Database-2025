Some posts here mention automated retries, notifications via email or Telegram or even scripts that can remove or restart &quot;problem torrents&quot;.</p> <p>But which one works best and is the most simple? And how do you not have endless loops or spam notifications when something genuinely can&#39;t download? I&#39;m not very technical, so sorry if the questions are basic.</p> <p>The seedbox I use is from <a href=\"https://www.appbox.co/\">Appbox</a>, the cheapest tier, and I don&#39;t know if it has built-in apps or anything that can help with that. If there is, please tell me. Would appreciate to know what works irl.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Active-Tour4795\"> /u/Active-Tour4795 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1n8hies/how_do_i_man",
