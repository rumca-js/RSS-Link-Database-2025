People are reporting issues on Steam, with players saying they cannot launch the game or even add it to their cart. Issues have also been reported on the eShop, PSN, and Xbox, including Game Pass. Despite those issues, the game has blasted off to more than 100,000 concurrent players in the first 45 minutes availability on Steam alone.</p><p>For context, that's more concurrent players than the original Hollow Knight's all-time record of around 72,000.</p><p>The game's store page on Steam even totally vanished from the Steam home page. Players also reported that they cannot access the Steam store at all--this can happen sometimes at the launch of a new Steam sale. However, there aren't too many instances we can recall of this happening for a game launch.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and",
