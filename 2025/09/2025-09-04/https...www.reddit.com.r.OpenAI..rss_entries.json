Now OpenAI is replacing all current voice options with a single, new voice mode. Many of us didn\u2019t <em>choose</em> our current voice in a sea of options\u2014we simply found one that felt right. It matched our needs, adapted to our tone, and became part of how we think, talk, and learn. That voice is being taken away, without an alternative.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just about style. For some, it\u2019s about accessibility, trust, and emotional comfort. The new voice may sound \u201cmore natural\u201d to some\u2014but to others, it feels flat, dismissive, or even unusable. We\u2019re being told to keep paying for something that no longer fits how we engage with it.
