        "description": "We've been talking a lot about legacies recently, so I wanted to go back to a band that inspired some of my favourites including Pixies and Nirvana. As I'm in Minnesota, it seemed like the perfect time to look into a trio who emerged from the Twin Cities music scene to help build a genre:  I'm talking about H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. Bob Mould, Greg Norton and Grant Hart formed the band in 1979 and split in '88. Grant sadly died back in 2017, but Greg and Bob are still active and Bob Mould is currently on tour: https://bobmould.com/\n\nThanks to Nate at the Vinyl Guide Podcast for his interview with Greg Norton, the full episode can be found here: https://youtu.be/jrpt3IrvNzg?si=fvf8vQ5eYP5wCWH_\n\nTo see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from me and JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dre",
