Games do work fine though but some games, especially games using Proton / Wine just randomly freeze untill I tab back in even though I never left the game, this happens with dying light the beast for me. I fixed it in alan wake 2 by going into winecfg and enabling fullscreen windows grabbing cursors. would anyone here know of a fix on how I could prevent dying light the beast from freezing? I use arch but I am also getting this on other DEs and Distros (currently on KDE Plasma).

I&#39;m trying to set up my <a href=\"https://www.8bitdo.com/arcade-stick/\">8bitdo Arcade Stick</a> to work in Arch and having some issues. It works fine via bluetooth and wired, but not with the 2.4ghz dongle. I&#39;ve used Windows to update firmware on the stick (no update was available for the dongle) but no change. Dmesg recognizes the device is connected but I think it doesn&#39;t know what to do with it:</p> <p>[ 1205.611310] usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 74 using xhci_hcd [ 1205.765795] usb 3-1: New USB device found, idVendor=045e, idProduct=028e, bcdDevice= 1.14 [ 1205.765799] usb 3-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3 [ 1205.765801] usb 3-1: Product: Controller [ 1205.765803] usb 3-1: Manufacturer: 8BitDo [ 1205.765805] usb 3-1: SerialNumber: [REDACTED]</p> <p>Udev rules appear to be in place correctly, but I know little to nothing about this area so correct me if I&#39;",

I can get to the menu to select which game I want. However, when I try to play ME1 it throws an error saying something is wrong with my game and please reinstall. ME2 seems to work. I did not try ME3.

I removed that launch option and now it works. I needed it to even make the game launch before but now it&#39;s only preventing ME1 from working.

My new SFF PC has a Ryzen 7 870OG and 32GB of RAM. I&#39;m using it with a 4K 27-inch monitor for desktop use and plan to switch to 1080p for gaming. \u200bI&#39;m not new to Linux, as I&#39;ve used it on my laptops before. \u200bI&#39;m not a serious gamer, but I&#39;d like to try some games like Hollow Knight. \u200bMy question is: Would a distro like Ubuntu 24.04 be sufficient, or should I use something more up-to-date? I can&#39;t imagine how much of a performance benefit I would gain between 24.04 and a rolling release or a newer Fedora. \u200bI know Ubuntu uses the HWE kernel, which should be relatively up to date, and they also seem to care about Mesa.<br/> \u200bWhat would you do? Would you stick with the LTS version or use something newer and accept the more frequent updates?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

I also noticed in games like Cyberpunk that have native FSR4 support i still needed to type a command to get it? Kind of turned me away. Im all for Linux but i really need a more streamlined experience and HDR to just work. Don&#39;t mind a command for HDR but Stalker 2 still has issues with blueing highlights. GameScape or Wayland.
