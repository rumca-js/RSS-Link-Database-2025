I am on MacOS and I have Safari. At first I was going to use WFDownloader but I realised once I deleted my instagram which is the goal those files would be invalid. Now I&#39;ve been messing with Terminal Bash 3.2 I think ALL DAY. I&#39;ve NEVER opened up this application before and I feel like I&#39;ve been SO CLOSE but SO FAR. I am so overwhelmed and the worse part is that I have nothing to show for it.
