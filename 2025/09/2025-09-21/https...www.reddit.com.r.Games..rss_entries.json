The mech building is similar to Armored Core where you combined parts like legs, torso, reactor, arms and weapons to build your mech while the combat is more like Mech Assault with a lot of variety based on your build.

Aside from over 300 parts, you&#39;ll have access to 3 campaigns focusing on different mechanics between missions and a sandbox to test out any part you&#39;ve found.
