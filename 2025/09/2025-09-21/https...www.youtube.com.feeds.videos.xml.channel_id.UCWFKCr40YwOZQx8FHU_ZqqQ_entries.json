        "description": "There are only 2 ways to keep your new iPhone 17 Pro safe. Either never set it down, or, get a case. I recommend the dbrand Ghost Case https://www.dbrand.com/shop/iphone-17-pro-max Use code 'JERRYRIG' to get 42% off the the Prism glass when you put it in a bundle. Huge thanks to dbrand for sponsoring my channel for nearly a decade. The new iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max look AMAZING. I am a big fan of the metal camera bump, and aluminum unibody design. \n\nHowever - in pursuit of aesthetic perfection - Apple has forgotten about the limits of coating durability. Anodizing does not stick to corners very well. And that law of physics will come back to haunt the owners of this new iPhone 17 Pro if they run without a case. The new iPhone 17 Pro camera plateau *will* chip. \n\nEither way though - I would prefer a chip off the ol' anodizing over a cracked back glass panel any day of the week. \n\nWould you buy the new Apple iPhone 17 Pro? Or do you like the Glass slab style smartphone better?",
