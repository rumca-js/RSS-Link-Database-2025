I have finished most of the software and got the hardware working. </p> <p>The problem is that I have been hesitant about how to power this all reliably. Because of this, I&#39;ve ended up with 1 power brick for the Pi and 1 power brick for the pumps.

I&#39;ve been working with AI and I (really, it did) made a mobile app to control my computer with one finger through a python script due to a physical disability. Working perfectly. No complaints there. I have a gamepad, keyboard and mouse. Now I want to be able to use this app on consoles through a pico and a Cronus. The logic there is sound. But I know so little about coding (in general but especially) a pico that I can&#39;t even get a build that will let me connect it to my wifi (I&#39;ll be sending cbv0 packets that it turns into HID reports.). The furthest I&#39;ve gotten is being able to connect my phone to the pico, but the webpage for adding the ssid refuses to load. ERR_ADDRESS_UNREACHABLE. Is there a barebones git that has that function nailed so I can move onto the HID and packet decoding stuff?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",
