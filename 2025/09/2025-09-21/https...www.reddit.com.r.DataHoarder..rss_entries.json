I\u2019ll write 2TB of movies to the drive (multiple times over the year), then read from it multiple times a year (very frequently, &gt;100 times maybe) by plugging it into my PC to copy files to a pendrive for TV playback. which would be better suited for my use case.

Now im wondering around the compatibility for the SSD+Enclosure combo. If im buying only external SSD i will buy the crucial x10 or x10pro (2tb versions). If im buying the SSD+enclosure i will buy the WD black SN7100 2tb plus MeanHigh 40Gbps enclosure. Now im wondering because i know the crucial will work both on mac and iphone, will the ssd+enclosure work on the Macbook M4 and on the iphone 16 pro (for ProRes filming)?</p> <p>Note: if i buy and test it i cant return it because im buying the storage overseas as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/marokomita\"> /u/marokomita </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1nmnfhs/external_ssd_vs_ssdenclosure_for_macbook_m4_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder",

They can be ignored when a door is closed so my family isn&#39;t all the fussed, however, I plan on moving out with a guy from work and I want to get quieter drives that will not cause undue annoyance to him, as well as getting a increase in my capacity as its getting close to its limits.</p> <p>I was curious if there are any 20TB drives that make less noise than the ones I have. I understand that you won&#39;t know verbatim what loudness they are like, but the quietest / largest capacity drives that you guys could recommend would be a god send as I can&#39;t see how much sound they generate on spec sheets (unless I have missed that",
