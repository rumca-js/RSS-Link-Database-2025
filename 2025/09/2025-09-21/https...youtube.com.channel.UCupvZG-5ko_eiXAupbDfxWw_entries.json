The 31-year-old\u2019s memorial features top figures from the Trump-aligned movement, including former President Donald Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, and Kirk\u2019s widow, Erica Kirk, who has stepped into her late husband\u2019s leadership role. On Friday, the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution condemning Kirk\u2019s assassination and political violence, while praising him as a \u201ccourageous American patriot.\u201d The measure passed 310 to 58, with Democrats deeply divided.
