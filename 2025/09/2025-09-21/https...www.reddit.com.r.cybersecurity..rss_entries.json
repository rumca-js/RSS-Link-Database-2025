They\u2019re here all week to share how they handled tough situations, what they learned, and how those lessons can help others facing similar challenges.</p> <p>This week\u2019s participants are:</p> <ul> <li>Dan Holden, (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/desmondholden/\">u/desmondholden</a>), CISO, BigCommerce</li> <li>Montez Fitzpatrick (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beneficial-Expert635/\">u/Beneficial-Expert635</a>), CISO, Navvis</li> <li>Steve Zalewski (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cybersecsteve/\">u/cybersecsteve</a>), co-host, Defense in Depth</li> <li>Nick Espinosa (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NickAEsp/\">u/NickAEsp</a>)",

I need to pass math and get into algebra II which will take a longgg time so, if I don\u2019t pass I won\u2019t be able to start my cybersecurity classes. When I was speaking with the advisor over the Phone for like thirty minutes going over other stuff too. Well I looked further on my own and I found there is a class to take on like introduction to Linux and I got really excited, I don\u2019t know the structure of it at school would help. I have other classes as well,if I can get into cyber security classes I can start more classes sooner but not until I get through all of those math and I suck at basic math\u2026 so that\u2019s gonna be fun. and go in debt probably lol. But anyways is it worth it to take that class you think? I think so? The advisor thinks it\u2019s not relevant or would count towards my degree but Google says helpful for cybersecurity?</p> ",

I remember spending hours grinding VulnHub VMs, learning Linux privesc, web vulns, and just trying to root every single box I could get my hands on. At that time, TryHackMe was just starting out and didn\u2019t have the huge following it has today.</p> <p>Fast forward a few years\u2026 I randomly checked VulnHub again today, and I was honestly shocked \u2014 the last release I can see is from 2022. That\u2019s 3 years without a single new box.</p> <p>What happened to our legend? Why did VulnHub stop getting updates? Did people just move away to THM/HTB and creators lost interest? Or is there some background reason I don\u2019t know about?</p> <p>Feels kind of sad because VulnHub was a huge stepping stone for a lot of us in the community.</p> <p>Anyone here knows what\u2019s going on?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YouthKnown7859\"> /u/YouthKnown78",
