I wanted to try ElementaryOS System 8 now that it&#39;s out, because I hadn&#39;t used it since the old Freya days, but it&#39;s way too slow in my machine... Anything else I have tried: xfce, cinnamon, mate, ricing my own Fluxbox and TWM... I am currently running LM with NsCDE on top and it&#39;s better, but I&#39;m still bored as ",

We can argue every day to Sunday about how, &quot;objectively&quot; Nvidia is a worse time on Linux than AMD (this is not an invitation to argue this is the comments haha).

My new SFF PC has a Ryzen 7 870OG and 32GB of RAM. I&#39;m using it with a 4K 27-inch monitor for desktop use and plan to switch to 1080p for gaming. I&#39;m not new to Linux, as I&#39;ve used it on my laptops before. I&#39;m not a serious gamer, but I&#39;d like to try some games like Hollow Knight. My question is: Would a distro like Ubuntu 24.04 be sufficient, or should I use something more</p> <p>up-to-date? I can&#39;t imagine how much of a performance benefit I would gain between 24.04 and a rolling release or a newer Fedora. I know Ubuntu uses the HWE kernel, which should be relatively up to date, and they also seem to care about Mesa. What would you do? Would you stick with the LTS version or use something newer and accept the more frequent updates?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

I was on there less as I got to where I could answer most questions myself or with google. I went to just browse it the other day and it seems to be gone.
