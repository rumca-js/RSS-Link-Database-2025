        "description": "Factory farming is the greatest moral crisis we ignore, says farm animal welfare champion Lewis Bollard. He exposes the truth behind the \"all natural\" labels on your groceries and shows how technology and public pressure can uncover the unseen struggle of animals, drive the industry to reform and harness our collective capacity for moral progress.
