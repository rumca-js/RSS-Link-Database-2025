Mysteries are appreciated. I dont mind very harsh content and any triggers so long as they arent there just to shock. Urban fantasy/sci fi is fine, I just dont want it to focus on that more than the characters. I&#39;m also looking for something that hooks you, need a good dose of escapism, but it&#39;s hard for me to suspend disbelief. Character consistency is especially a big thing for me.</p> <p>Another thing that I am interested is if there is anything like first law but in a modern age that you know of?

People can only protect themselves with runes, and only a few truly understand them. The protagonist starts drawing or carving runes into their skin, which was previously thought impossible. Cities are shielded by massive protective circles but still get attacked regularly. The protagonist eventually heads into the desert and becomes something like a myth. The series has at least 3 parts, maybe more, plus a book with side stories and lore. This was the state about 12 years ago.
