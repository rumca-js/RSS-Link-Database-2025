For me, there are games that I can see from the components that I would not like to play. There are games I try and then I end up not liking it, and there are ones that I play just because a friend suggested it and end up liking it, but there instances where a glance at the component makes me say that a certain game is not my cup of tea. The most prominent example I can do is &quot;Everdell&quot;. I know a couple of people that love the game and asked me to try it and when I looked up how it looked like I knew it wouldn&#39;t be a pleasure for me to play. After a while, tho, I told myself to not judge a book by its cover and tried it, and it confirmed my allegations. Too much written text divided on small and even smaller cards, knowing from the get go that I will never have a chance against experienced players because they know how to play certain cards to maximize them, ",
