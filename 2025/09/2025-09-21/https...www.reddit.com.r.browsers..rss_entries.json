However, I have run into a rather annoying problem: the built-in ad blocker (and the ones it offers as extensions) leaves empty spaces where the advertising should go. It&#39;s as if the ad doesn&#39;t load, but the gap is still there, breaking the visual experience.</p> <p>I come from using Edge and Brave, where blocking is much cleaner and more effective. That&#39;s why seeing Samsung Internet fail at something so basic is frustrating to me. I want to use their apps, I want to integrate into the ecosystem... but the browser makes it difficult for me.</p> <p>In short, it&#39;s a bittersweet experience: I like the idea of \u200b\u200busing what comes with the phone, but if the browser doesn&#39;t do something as essential as blocking ads well, it becomes difficult.</p> <p>Has anyone else had this problem? Any solution or",

All of these CPUs had issues with Chrome (within the last few years) where the CPU usage would randomly spike to 100%, completely freezing my computer. This would happen when I didn&#39;t even have many tabs open - maybe 10-15 tabs max. I had a 32GB of RAM in all of these cases, so I had plenty of RAM.</p> <p>On my 5700X/5700X3D, it would freeze my computer to the point where it needed a hard reset. I originally thought it was a CPU issue since I had my CPU under-volted, but this issue never happened with any other programs. I recently switched to a Ryzen 7700 CPU and it has the same problems. I then switched browser to Firefox and never encountered the issue/the issue completely stopped. </p> <p>Has anyone else encountered similar problems, and did they pinpoint the problem being Chrome?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",
