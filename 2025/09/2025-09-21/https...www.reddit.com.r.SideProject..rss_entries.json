At first, I didn&#39;t believe him, but then I tried it, and now I make about $300 a day.

A little over 50% of them completed the user journey and generated between 1 to 5 ads. The other half signed up to the free account but did not complete the workflow. Zero ad generations. My free account sign up allows users to generate upto 10 free ads.</p> <p>Sign up numbers are directly proportional to the time and effort invested in Reddit. Part of me is happy that free sign ups are climbing steady in the 2nd week but the other part of me is worried that I haven&#39;t got a single paid user yet.

The best part is the complete flexibility to earn whenever you want, wherever you are.</p> <p>\u27a1\ufe0f <strong>If you&#39;re interested and want to sign up, feel free to check out the link in my profile.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NricTurtle\"> /u/NricTurtle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1nmeqh3/make_100_per_week_playing_mobile_games_as_a_side/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1nmeqh3/make_100_per_week_playing_mobile",
