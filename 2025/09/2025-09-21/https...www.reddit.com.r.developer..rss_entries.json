However, in that time (covid time) it was a real hype, search and pay for IT jobs was pretty solid and I got really hyped - A young fella already landing IT job and he did not even finished his college.</p> <p>However in that time when I got employed, I didn\u2019t know shit about large number of frameworks,ways to create an app, architecture, basically nothing.</p> <p>As in that startup, we created from small ",

I have basically no experience; however, I&#39;m willing to learn. I&#39;ve heard that GDevelop 5 is a good client for making your first mobile game. Additionally, once I&#39;ve developed a couple of games, I would like to publish one of them. As I understand it, you must be 18 to do so? I&#39;m currently 16, so I&#39;m still relatively young. Is there any way to publish the game even if you are under 18?</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Victolry\"> /u/Victolry </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1nmwx7l/question_from_a_newbie_developer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1nmwx7l/question_from_a_newbie_developer/\">[comments]</a></span>",

She say that she is jokingly \u201cscared\u201d seeing and agent just running and doing stuff.</p> <p>I\u2019m tech-literate but not a developer either (I did some data science years ago), and I\u2019m more moderate about what these tools can actually do and where the real value lies.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear from experienced developers: where does the value of these tools drop off for you? For example, with products like Cursor.</p> <p>Here\u2019s my current take, based on my own use and what I\u2019ve seen on forums: - People who don\u2019t usually write code but are comfortable with tech: They get quick wins, they can suddenly spin up a landing page or a rough prototype. But the value seems to plateau fast. If you can\u2019t judge whether the AI\u2019s changes are good, or reason about the quality of its output, a $200/month plan doesn\u2019t feel worthwhile.",
