It can open draft PRs or hand you files directly.</li> <li><strong>ReviewAgent</strong> \u2013 connects to your code review flow, runs linting + reviews before merge.</li> <li><strong>QAAgent</strong> \u2013 generates test cases, runs them, and reports results.</li> <li><strong>ReleaseAgent</strong> \u2013 prepares release notes + announcements once milestones are hit.</li> </ol> <p>The idea:<br/> \ud83d\udc49 Instead of pushing tasks ",
