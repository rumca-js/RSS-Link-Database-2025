Secluso tries to provide functionality similar to a Ring camera, but without violating the user privacy (as most mainstream consumer cameras do!) The functionality includes sending video recordings to the app when the camera detects an event (motion, person, pet, etc.) as well as on-demand live-streaming. To detect events, Secluso performs AI on the camera feed fully locally (i.e., on the camera).</p> <p>Secluso uses end-to-end encryption to send videos from the camera to the mobile app. It uses OpenMLS for end-to-end encryption.
