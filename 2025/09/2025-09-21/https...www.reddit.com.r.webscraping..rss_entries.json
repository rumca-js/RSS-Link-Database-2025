So I&#39;m wondering if this project is even possible or worth attempting. I don&#39;t want to give too many details about what I&#39;m trying to do because if my idea gained traction it would ruin it for me. The data is updated weekly so I check the new data weekly.</p> <p>Starting on a .gov website I would like to use a search form with about 10 different filters and search by date. The results present as 4x10 data table (with the option to expand it to 500 rows, more than my search ever returns). I would like to scrape the data from one of the columns and perform a web search on each result individually. Bonus if I can add a word to each search. From there I would be viewing the results to see if any of them fit the criteria I&#39;m looking for. If I could weed some out by a sequence of words that might help.<",
