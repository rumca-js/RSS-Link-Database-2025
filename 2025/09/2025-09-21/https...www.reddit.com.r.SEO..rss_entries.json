I understand that this only scratches the surface of what SEO really is.</p> <p>What I\u2019m wondering is: if I decide to hire an SEO agency, what exactly would they bring to the table that goes beyond what I can already do myself with free tools and plugins?</p> <p>Also, pricing is really confusing. Some \u201cagencies\u201d advertise SEO for something like \u20ac50/month, which honestly sounds too good to be true. At the same time, I see others charging \u20ac1000+ per month.</p> <p>So my questions are: 1. What specific value does an agency provide that a motivated individual can\u2019t easily replicate with some learning? 2. What\u2019s the realistic monthly range (in Europe/US) for a legit, professional SEO service that actually delivers long-term results, and how can I avoid low-quality pro",
