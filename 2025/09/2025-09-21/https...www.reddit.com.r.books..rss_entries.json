I broadly remember the new characters, what happened so far. I don&#39;t want to reread the book from the start as this is not the first time this is happening. I had to reread the first 100 pages the last time since I took a similar break before. Hence rereading again is not an option for me. I don&#39;t want to feel like I am stuck.
