For example (minor spoiler) in the Colour of Magic, the characters are falling from a dragon and to their death. Then they get teleported into an airplane in our world, and back into the Discworld, and because of the conservation of momentum, they are now above water. I get it&#39;s meant as a joke, but when the story is this deep into &quot;anything can happen&quot; territory it&#39;s hard for me to take anything seriously.</p> <p>I like comedy, but if I&#39;m not invested in the characters in the first place, it gets little laughs from me.</p> <p>I got recommended Guards! Guards! as a better entry point to the Discworld and I couldn&#39;t agree more. I instantly fell in love with the characters. They have exaggerated traits ",

I never really thought about publishing my original work as a physical book until recently. But now, after completing the first book of my fantasy-romance trilogy, I really want to see it in print. This is totally new to me, so I\u2019d love to hear from people who\u2019ve gone through this\u2014what was your experience like publishing your first book? What challenges did you face, and what would you do differently?</p> <p>One more thing\u2014I wrote my book in Sinhala (my mother tongue). There aren\u2019t many fantasy books in Sinhala (most are just translations), so I\u2019m worried many people will not read it. Has anyone here published in a language that doesn\u2019t have a big fantasy readership? How did it go for you? Any advice, tips, or personal stories would mean a lot!</p> <p>Thanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",

I am currently researching on some fantasy books about brotherly bond that may or may not be interpreted as queer subtext?</p> <p>I am an mlm queer guy, myself, who&#39;s working on a passion project. I am a huge fan of stories with romance being a second plot that is lowkey, not upfront, or not obvious at all. Even if there&#39;s no gay romance in it, I&#39;d like anything that has a brotherly bond. Sworn enemies, childhood bestfriends, etc. Preferably about knighthood and camaraderie, or lonely warriors. A great story example would be one of my favorite movies, The Eagle. It&#39;s not even explicitly gay, but I really loved the enemies to brotherhood dynamic in that story. I also really like Final Fantasy XV&#39;s character dynamics, just a group of baddass guys on a mission.</p> <p>I was also looking for like a lone warrior type of stories (heavy on Berserk, or some sad depressed warrior/knigh",
