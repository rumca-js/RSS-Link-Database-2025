        "description": "If you are already a fan of the series, then you will find plenty to like in this game across the board. From the changes made to the on-pitch gameplay in response to player feedback to ones made to the structure of the specific modes, to even the franchise\u2019s long overdue recognition of the fact that its immense audience may want two completely separate styles of play \u2013 EA Sports  FC 26 is a great game for those already on board with the series. \n\nBut if you\u2019re not? Well, if you have played previous games, and didn\u2019t care much for them, or were hoping for dramatic changes, this title is not for you. If you haven\u2019t played these games before and just wanted a good football game, then this is as good of a title to look into as any other EA Sports FC game.",

        "description": "Ghost of  Yotei  is not aiming to rip up the rulebook, but it is bringing a comprehensive list of refinements over its predecessor which - if every element aligns - promises to be Sucker Punch\u2019s greatest game yet. \n\nA new protagonist awaits - the revenge-fueled Atsu - armed to the teeth with medieval Japan\u2019s greatest blades. Her mission? To enact revenge on the souls who massacred her family, destroyed her home, and left her for dead. As brutal as this tale seems, Sucker Punch have made space for numerous thoughtful, reflective endeavours throughout Atsu\u2019s unhurried quest for vengeance. \n\nThis video outlines 15 such things we cannot wait to do once we roll up in the shadows of Mount Yotei on 2nd October.",
