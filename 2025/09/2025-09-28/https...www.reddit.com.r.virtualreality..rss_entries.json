Are certain games dependent on steam? At this point it&#39;s no use using VD.

I didn\u2019t mind the low storage since i\u2019m going to play on a gaming PC anyways so i won\u2019t need much storage. They stopped selling brand new 128GB in stores so i looked to buy one used. They are the same price if not more than they were in store, brand new\u2026 Since i don\u2019t respect paying an extra 300 bucks for what is escentially just a 384GB storage upgrade im kinda upset.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, I&#39;m currently trying to figure out if getting a quest 2 is worth it for cyberpunk vr, I have a 3080 so should run fine the issue is I have a cyberpunk folder with over 200 mods, my solution instead of purging the mods and starting again is creating a new profile on Nexus mods. But still I only have one cyberpunk file on the c drive. I know for a fact it won&#39;t work with my modded profile. My question is, if I download the mod and drag and drop it in to vortex then I&#39;m guessing install it to staging will it work still? As I think this is my only option, unless any of you smart people have any thing better. Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Geralt-Of-England\"> /u/Geralt-Of-England </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nsbp1i/help_with_cyberpunk_vr_luke_ross_mod/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/c",
