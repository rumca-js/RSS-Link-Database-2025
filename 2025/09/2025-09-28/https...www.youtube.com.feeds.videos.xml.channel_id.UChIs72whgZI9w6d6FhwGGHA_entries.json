It has some incredibly impressive attention to detail in some places, including unexpected ones (like BIOS and the CMOS battery), but also some unfortunate damage. The PCIe slot on the GPU was cracked beyond repair, unfortunately killing the rare Buzz Lightyear themed NVIDIA GPU. Fortunately, it's a reskin of an existing model, so we could swap and save the shroud.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
