Bullet contains Dodge City, Fistful of Cards and High Noon expansions as you may know. I am accustomed to play games with the base Bang with either Fistful of Cards or High Noon, sometimes with Dodge City mixed in. The Great Train Robbery is quite new to me. Should I only mix it with the base game, or does it work as well if Dodge City is also used? (Secondary question, can you use Fistful or High Noon as well when playing Train Robber?) I am really getting confused. Or do you have advice about the player number? Because another thought I had that for 4 players mixing in Dodge City is not as rewarding as for 7 players? Any guidelines or personal experience?<br/> I thank you all in advance for any replies. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/barengineer\"> /u/barengineer </a> <br/> <span><a hre",

So possibly a native Dutch game? </p> <p>There were 4 identical boards that each family member had, they all had pegs in their own boards. Each player would roll a set of dice. </p> <p>The pegs and boards were grey. Relatively small boards that all fit in a travel box. </p> <p>Not the best information to go off and I&#39;ve been trying to search for about an hour and haven&#39;t found anything online.</p> <p>Hopefully some of you might be able to point me in the right direction? Looked like a fun game and wanted to do some research on it. </p> <p>It also had &#39;poppen&#39; written on the cardboard box.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hard_Fox23\"> /u/Hard_Fox23 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1nsmshl/trying_to_find_a_game_dutch_board_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",
