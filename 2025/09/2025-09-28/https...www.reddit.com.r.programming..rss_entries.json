Midway I heard about convex, I haven&#39;t ever used convex before but as far as I can tell from the reviews and experiences its an awesome product with auth, dbs and a lot more. So my question is, should I follow the conventional path of using dixie.js with the ws layer built from scratch for the entire product, or should I switch to convex and utilise their product suite moving forward?
