But now I question myself, how much of it was actually me and how much was the AI? </p> <p>Prior to AI even appearing, I have finished a research degree in 2015. I know i&#39;m capable of applying research and critical thinking skills in daily life and was would produce good piece of work anyway. Now, by using the AI it almost doubled my reasoning power and I was able to cover ideas I would never thought about it. It&#39;s not like I just gave a prompt and asked to give me a 1000 word essay. I would sit for like 2 days carefully thinking about the content and ensuring it sounds valid. </p> <p>But in the end, am I just fooling myself? Does my ability to use research still stands out, or now everyone can get really robust answers with AI",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019m a stay-at-home mom who stumbled into AI a couple months ago. Through lots of trial and error i figured out how to talk to it to get what I needed. I wanted to get better at making prompts so I asked chatgpt to give me a prompt bootcamp when the idea hit me. Why don&#39;t I design a website that teaches me and others the way AI wants us to talk to it. Sure we could take a course or copy and paste prompts but there is power in learning it ourselves.</p> <p>This idea turned into PromptlyLiz.com; a practice playground where you can:</p> <p>Type in your own prompt and get strengths + fixes + a rewritten version from ChatGPT itself (multimodal coming soon)</p> <p>Pick your flavor of feedback; \u201ccoaches\u201d (helpful, librarian-style, or even a light roast type\ud83d\ude02)</p> <p>Try mini games designed to strengthen your skills at recognizing and writing good prompts along with weekly challenges to make practice less boring.</p> <p>Share prompts + compare with others ",

However, this is just an assumption based on how they pretend that &quot;ethics&quot; in AI creation and user interactions is an &quot;additional, unnecessary burden.&quot; Ethics is important because it applies to both AI and users, and their behavior, with its bizarre attempts to control user behavior, seems like a denial of our feelings and desires, which are entirely justified. and I can&#39;t call myself a technical specialis",
