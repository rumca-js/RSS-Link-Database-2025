Bradley went so far as to curiously suggest spectators had been \u201cviolent\u201d during the Ryder Cup in Rome two years ago. Bradley\u2019s approach was in stark contrast to that of his European counterpart, Luke Donald, who believes some those in the galleries engaged in unacceptable conduct.</p><p>Europe lead their hosts 11\u00bd-4\u00bd heading into the final day. Just as striking on Saturday, though, was a series of unacceptable shouts towards European players. These were personal \u2013 especially in the direction of Rory McIlroy \u2013 and regularly delivered as golfers were preparing to play. McIlroy and Shane Lowry completed a fourball victory with state troopers lining holes.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep",
