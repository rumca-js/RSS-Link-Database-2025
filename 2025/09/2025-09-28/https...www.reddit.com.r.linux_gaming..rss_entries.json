Vortex wouldnt open and MO2 wouldnt launch either. Was trying to get them with the steamtinkerlaunch. If it helps im using CatchyOS. At the moment everything been running beautifully just modding proving to be a headache. I&#39;ve also tried MO2 through wine but there was an issue there too. Also tried thr FOMM through wine but nothing happened </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/datscubba\"> /u/datscubba </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1nswi23/having_trouble_with_mod_organizer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1nswi23/having_trouble_with_mod_organizer/\">[comments",

There was a problem tho, it sometimes froze my hole pc and was really annoying. I decided to try running it through lutris cause I read it could work better. I did that and the performance dropped to the floor. I went to Steam and pasted the same launch settings and proton version I read in the reddit post that said to try lutris. But it still went horrible. I reverted, almost all the changes, because I didn&#39;t save the launch settings, but it still had an awful performance. But that shouldn&#39;t be a problem, because without any tinkering, it worked perfectly before. I&#39;ve tried everything: uninstalling steam, overwatched, cleared proton cache... Nothing works.

Think of it as an adventure racing game meets Python - it&#39;s a piece of gaming history from when people were experimenting with Python for 3D games using the Soya3D engine. The catch? It requires Python 2.7 and a bunch of deprecated libraries that would be a nightmare to install on a modern system.</p> <h2>The Problem</h2> <h3>Slune needs:</h3> <ul> <li>Python 2.7 (EOL since 2020)</li> <li>Soya3D engine (abandoned ~2010)</li> <li>SDL 1.2, Cal3D, OpenAL, and other ancient libraries</li> <li>Cython/Pyrex for compilation</li> </ul> <p>Installing these on Fedora 42 would contaminate your system with outdated packages (if you could even find them). </p> <h2>The Solution: Containerization with Podman</h2> <p>Here&#39;s a clean way to run Slune without messing up your system.</p> <h3>Prerequisites</h3> <ul> <li>Fedora with Podman installed (comes by default)</li> <",

I&#39;ve noticed a problem in certain games where the gameplay feels very choppy despite framerate being high. For example, I&#39;m playing Counter-Strike Source and I have over 100 FPS but it feels like 15 FPS. There are two workarounds </p> <ol> <li>Turning on V-Sync but it causes input lag and messes up with my aiming</li> <li>Setting a scale to 125% or higher, but it makes my screen blurry</li> </ol> <p>What can I do to fix it?</p> <p>Edit: I tried installing a diffrent driver but now it only shows Intel HD Graphics and nvidia-smi says that it couldn&#39;t communicate with the NVIDIA driver.

Yeah I could upgrade cpu on the intel but m-atx mb is lacking a bit in features like no m.2. I got a 1tb pny cs2241 for $20 be nice to use. </p> <p>My psu is 850 evga g2 but 10 years old. So would need that too. I don&#39;t necessarily need storage for now.</p> <p>What cpu/mb should I look at? I dont care brand loyalty but seems b550 are built better vram. No I would not oc but I like reliable like my 10 year old psu lol.</p> <p>I&#39;m usually 1080p gaming but I do stream 720p just to try and be social and see how performs currently. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bkomnimon\"> /u/bkomnimon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1nsfpks/plans_to_switch_to_a",

Without any modifications, the game detects the controller and shows PlayStation button icons, but the analog sticks are misaligned (moving right acts like up, left acts like down, etc.).</p> <p>Importing a Wine registry file to enable SDL fixes the stick behavior, but the game then detects two controllers simultaneously: one Xbox and one PlayStation.
