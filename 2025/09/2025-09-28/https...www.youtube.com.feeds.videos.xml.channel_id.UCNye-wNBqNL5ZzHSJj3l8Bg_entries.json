Organisers, including musician Michael Barenboim, emphasised Germany's obligation to prevent and punish genocide, referencing the country's own historical context. \nMeanwhile, at the UN General Assembly, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul reaffirmed Germany's commitment to Israel's security while calling for a two-state solution. \nHowever, Germany's position appears increasingly isolated as other European leaders, including the European Commission president, propose trade restrictions and sanctions against Israel.\n\nAl Jazeera's Dominic Kane reports from Berlin, Germany.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: h",
