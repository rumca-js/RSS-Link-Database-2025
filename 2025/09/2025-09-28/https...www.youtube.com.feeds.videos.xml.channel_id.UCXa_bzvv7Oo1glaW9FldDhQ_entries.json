        "description": "The sheer flexibility of stories is but one of many reasons why I enjoy the horror genre. Being frightened isn't exclusive to titles within the genre itself. Anything, anywhere, could elicit a fright, the scale of which often varies depending on the person. \n\nSome prefer nonstop tension, perhaps a consistently paced stream of scares assaulting their senses. Others may prefer a palpable atmosphere of dread - nothing is going to jump out and scream at them, but it continuously escalates, messing with your mind until the anticipation drives you nearly insane. And there's no end to the list of things that can make someone afraid.\n\nThroughout the decades of horror games, films, comic books and novels, it's interesting how some of the best horror stories can be so different from each other, yet often find the same destination. \n\nTwo of the best horror games released this year - Dying Light: The Beast and Silent Hill f - found their way to audiences within the same week.",

        "description": "DICE are positioning Battlefield 6 as both a return to form and a bold new chapter for their flagship shooter series following Battlefield 2042\u2019s fallout. Bolstering Battlefield 6\u2019s hype is as much what it leaves out by what it adds: 64-player battles are in, replacing large-scale 128-player matches; the more refined Classic Class System returns in place of the divisive Specialist Class System; and a semi-modern, more grounded setting restores the series\u2019 signature grit in place of 2042\u2019s futuristic dystopia. \n\nExpanded destruction mechanics across a suite of tightly designed maps, soundtracked by a hyper-aggressive War Tapes audio mix, headline Battlefield 6\u2019s additions. \n\nEarly beta feedback suggests this could be the comeback the series needs; if Battlefield\u2019s core ingredients - squad-based gameplay, immersive, large-scale battles, vehicles, tactics, and emergent moments - are present and correct, there\u2019s nothing stopping Battlefield 6 from reuniting its scattered fanbase.",
