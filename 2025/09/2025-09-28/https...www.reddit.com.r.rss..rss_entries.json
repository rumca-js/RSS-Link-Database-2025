Maybe I \u201creinvented the wheel\u201d here, and some might ask: isn\u2019t this just more of the same? Well, perhaps \u2014 but it\u2019s <em>my</em> take on it \ud83d\ude42.</p> <p>For a while, I\u2019ve been searching for a straightforward way to share my feeds with friends. I found many amazing tools, but they often came with too much complexity. What I really wanted was something simple: a page that updates regularly with the feeds I control, on my own schedule \u2014 basically a kind of <strong>public magazine</strong> I could share with anyone through a link, without extra setup or distractions.</p> <p>So, I built <strong>The Feeder</strong>. I don\u2019t know if it will be useful to others, but it fits exactly what I needed, so I decided to share the code here.</p> <p>At the moment, it works with FreshRSS, but if the project gains traction, I\u2019ll expand compatibility to other servers as well.
