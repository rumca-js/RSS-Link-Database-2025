This is a movie that &quot;I&#39;ve been meaning to watch&quot; pretty much ever since it came out. I remember being in grade school and seeing the trailer and thinking &quot;that looks cool, I should watch it&quot;, and then I never actually did. From time to time the movie would pop up somewhere and again I&#39;d think to myself &quot;I should watch it&quot; and then I&#39;d forget and years would go by again. Well yesterday was finally the day I sat down and watched the film and I was honestly blown away. I seriously did not expect it to be that good.</p> <p>For starters I am a huge sci fi fan, and usually I tend to gravitate towards realistic, &quot;hard&quot; science fiction as much as possible. Think of the Martian, The Expanse, Gravity, Apollo 13, etc, stuff that tries to be as realistic as possible. That being said it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t understand the concept of creative license",
