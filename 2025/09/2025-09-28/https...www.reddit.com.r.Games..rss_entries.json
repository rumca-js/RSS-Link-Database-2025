If you&#39;re into <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/1975520/eventcomments/\">patch notes we&#39;ve got some here</a>. Ceres Vesta will introduce new Data Resources alongside some cool equipment and mysterious phenomena on the asteroids. </p> <p>Astronomics is an asteroid mining automation game. Navigate your freighter to the asteroids passing through your deep space mining claim then pilot the shuttle to land on the surface where you&#39;ll explore and set up the infrastructure to automate the extraction of resources with the help of your faithful workerbots. Resources you bring back to the freighter can be refined or used in manufacturing.</p> <p>",

Think modern deckbuilders, but with some of that old-school strategy vibe mixed in. We\u2019re aiming for the best of both worlds, tight card play + those chunky mechanics we loved growing up.</p> <p>We&#39;re actively working on our demo that we\u2019re hoping to share later this year.
