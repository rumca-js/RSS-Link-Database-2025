        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Do any members here remember that group when it was in it&#39;s heyday? We are talking ~20 years ago and content was actively moderated. I, in fact registered the charter way back when. We are talking 1999 when Jon Johansen and crew released DeCSS. It was a big deal. Back then due to both download bandwidth and suitable compression codecs limited good quality movies to DVDs. Making it more complicated a DVD player or computer DVD ROM, limited to the only &quot;portable&quot; movies. Back then there were only 4.7GB single layer DVDRs so the program material needed to be compressed to fit on a single layer disk. The DVDR was really the only way to distribute movies, etc so given the software then was the Pegasys Coding program TMPGEnc and it required quite a bit of talent and expertise to pull it off. Any old heads hanging out here? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Withheld_BY_Duress\"> /u/Withheld_B",
