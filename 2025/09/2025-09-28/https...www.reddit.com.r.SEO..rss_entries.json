Like when I tried to use a Google keyword planner or Google trends, I find that if I don&#39;t already know the niche that I want to research, the tool is limited. I want to Find out what people are already searching for with intent to buy in my area with out having to manually search every idea that comes to mind. I want to be able to see the data all at once.</p> <p>Any ideas on how I can accomplish this? So far, I thought about putting together an AI web scraper that will automatically just keep searching for me and compile the data.
