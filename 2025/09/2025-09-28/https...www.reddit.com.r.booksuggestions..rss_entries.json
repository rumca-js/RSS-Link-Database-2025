She also keeps asking when she can start dating, so clearly she wants to experience something like first love, or at least read about it. What are some age-appropriate books that have a romantic aspect? She also enjoys mysteries and detectives, especially something that requires taking notes and figuring out clues.

It\u2019s a short story of about 14,000 words in the military, horror, thriller, and dark fantasy genres. The story is about a man who flees from war into a dangerous jungle to save his life and protect his family.</p> <p>There is a war going on between two armies: the Searpur village and the Teahataa. A grudge no one can forget. They have spilled each other\u2019s blood for years. Many soldiers have died in a war that lasted longer than any clan has ever seen.</p> <p>Today might be the day this war finally ends, because the Bambose army of Searpur village has run out of luck. Their best warriors are falling one by one. Wherever you look,",

Some of my favorite sci-fi books are The Murderbot Diaries All Systems Red by Martha Wells and The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide To The Galaxy by Douglas Addams. I also love anything that has time travel because I am a huge Doctor Who fan. I&#39;m fine with sci-books that have horror, romance (bonus points if the romance is queer). I&#39;m a queer person btw . I&#39;m also fine with space or time travel, found family trope, takes place during an apocalypse. Book series suggestions would be appreciated too.
