The whole idea is that your data stays <strong>completely under your control</strong>, and you can make forms really fast from the command line. It\u2019s perfect for quickly creating a form on the spot during a meeting or class.</p> <p>It\u2019s super simple to use: just write a YAML config, run <code>qforms [config.yaml]</code>, and a web form opens in your browser. You can collect text, files, allow radio or checkboxes buttons, and export everything as JSON or CSV.</p> <p>The only tricky part is sharing the form with others if you don&#39;t have any ports open. For that, I recommend using <strong>ngrok</strong>\u2014we used to bundle it, but it stopped working, so you have to use it externally.</p> <p>This project is very early stage so any feedback or contributions are more than welcome.</p> ",

I have a Synology DS220+ NAS, and while testing it with a locally stored 1080p movie, I noticed that even one user streaming a video pushes the CPU usage to about 80-90%.
