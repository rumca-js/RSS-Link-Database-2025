This appeared to impact both 4o and 5 models. Users would attempt to work with 4o or 5, but were unknowingly getting rerouted and were receiving responses from the 5 thinking/mini models.</em></p> <p><em>The decrease quality of responses was clear to users. There were no bugs reported on their website and no public announcement from OpenAI. Users took to Reddit and X to share what was happening, tagging and commenting under posts from members of the OpenAI leadership team. Users also wrote the <a href=\"mailto:support@openai.com\">support@openai.com</a> email address, receiving automatic AI responses back.</em></p> <p>",

Is it really that hard to let something be?? </p> <p>The lack of transparency from OpenAI is also disappointing.
