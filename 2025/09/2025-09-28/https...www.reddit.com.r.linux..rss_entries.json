Lately I&#39;ve been spending hours (and still aren&#39;t done with) setting up a Windows VM with good graphics support on NixOS. I&#39;ve opened <strong>&gt;300 tabs</strong> as counted with a browser addon, having looked up stuff like &quot;best way to install Windows VM on linux with , &quot;best VM software for linux&quot;, and more specific things like how to setup WinApps, but I&#39;ve been told that it has very poor graphics performance, since it doesn&#39;t include anything to make it better, so now I&#39;m torturing myself trying to get Looking Glass to work. I opened an feature request today to make better support for NixOS but it was closed stating that documentation is for deb-based distros and &quot;a niche distro such as NixOS&quot;, RIP.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTwelveYearOld\"> /u/TheTwe",
