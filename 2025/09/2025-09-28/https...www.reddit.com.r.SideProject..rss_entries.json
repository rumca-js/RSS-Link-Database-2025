A ton of words are borrowed from Dutch (colonial era), Arabic (trade routes), Portuguese/Spanish, Sanskrit, Chinese and others. Indonesia was basically this giant crossroads where traders passed through, so the vocab is very diverse. </p> <p>For example:<br/> Shoes in Indonesian are sepatu (from Portuguese/Spanish sapato/zapatos)<br/> Rest in Indonesian is istirahat (from Arabic \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062d\u0629 aistiraha) </p> <p>Every time I learn a new word, I go down this rabbit hole of where the hell did this word come from?

If you are new to sweepstakes sites, 1 SC equals $1, so you are essentially getting $200 for only $100.</p> <p>The condition is that you need to play through the 200 SC once before you can cash out. This means a 1x wagering requirement, so you must bet at least 200 SC before withdrawing.</p> <p>This is super simple to complete. Just find the game &quot;Plinko,&quot; set your bet to the minimum (0.10 SC), adjust the Risk setting to LOW with 16 rows, select 10 balls per play, and run it 200 times to meet the playthrough requirement while keeping roughly 90% or more of your bonus. Most users retain around 96%. In other words, you can withdraw about $195 directly to your bank after spending $100 (about $95 profit in under 10 minutes).</p> <p>\u27a1\ufe0f <strong>The sign up link to farm this promotion is here: <a href=\"https://tracker.gemified.io/r/8gAMYu7D",

I\u2019ve been around finance for quite some time working in a bank, while also testing diferent tools to scale and grow my capital. As a result I already managed to pull in more than $2,000, which for me is a clear sign to keep moving forward</p> <p>Back in student years I started with small crypto tries, half of the deposit got \u201ceaten\u201d by the market, and the other half by pizza (classic). Later I shifted into more system things: small-cap stocks, startups, and now my banking experiance helps me look at everything with more balance</p> <p>Main lesson money loves movement. If it just sits still, it slowly disappears. Even small experiments can give you new perspective and sometimes results that honestly surprise</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
