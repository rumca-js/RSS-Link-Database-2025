It kinda doesn\u2019t do the plot justice because the emotions just aren\u2019t really addressed or addressed in an almost comically insufficient way. It wasn\u2019t enough to truly detract from the very engaging story but this could\u2019ve been a story to cry over!! Instead it was mildly detached. I was genuinely a bit surprised it was adult fiction cause it would suit YA perfectly.</p> <p>Second, MY SCIENCE TEACHER GUY he\u2019s slightly patronizing?? All the time?

I asked all of my friend group at work to give me authors from their country that they loved so I could read while I was away, and my Korean and Japanese friends came through in a major way. Reading is essentially my only media consumption now that I&#39;ve left the gaming industry and so the last few years I&#39;ve read almost every book I could get my hands on by an Asian author, and in particular women from the area. I thought I would lay out some of my favorite authors since there it can be easy to overlook things when you&#39;ve got seemingly millions of options. I think going by book instead of author would make the list too long since I&#39;ve enjoyed reading <em>a lot</em> since I&#39;ve started reading these authors. </p> <p>Shoutout as well to <a href=\"https://asianreviewofbooks.com",
