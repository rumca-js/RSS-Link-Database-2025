        "description": "Scientists in Finland have developed the world\u2019s largest sand battery, using 2,000 tonnes of soapstone to store thermal energy at up to 600\u00b0C for long-duration energy storage. This 100 MWh system significantly reduces district heating emissions and offers a scalable, low-cost solution for renewable energy storage independent of weather conditions.\n\nSource Article: https://www.livescience.com/technology/engineering/a-scalding-hot-sand-battery-is-now-heating-a-small-finnish-town\n\n#technology #energystorage #breakthrough #sustainability #shorts\n\nLinks:\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c Merch: https://www.rockstarscientist.org/\n\ud83d\udcf8 Insta: https://www.instagram.com/drbenmiles\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c \ud83d\ude80  Support my work:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUeZBocfxALSUdOgNJB5ySA/join\n\nI support scientific teams tackling global problems.
