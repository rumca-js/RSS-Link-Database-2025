It's happening!\n\nLet me share a couple of stories of learning, appreciating and rewriting stuff in Rust. How we came to love Ferris: cargo cult or real need?\n\nWhat is it like to come to Rust from two very different directions: C++ and C#? What are the gaps, the needs, the gems and the tools you should know about? Here's a real journey and the various experiments leading up towards the success stories at Microsoft.\n\nWhat have we learned and can bring back to day-to-day C++?\n\nWant to compare notes? Let's chat.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJoin think-cell as a C++ Developer and work on cutting-edge challenges with a focus on code excellence, innovation, and working alongside an international team of experts \u2014 apply now to be part of a team shaping the future of business presentations. https://www.think-cell.com/e",
