        "description": "Did MythBusters' popularity put an \"unnecessary strain\" on Adam Savage's relationship with Jamie? Does Adam have any tips for a cosplayer who wants their costume's weight to rest on their shoulders? Does Adam have any advice for a child whose art was destroyed by students at school? How does Adam manage to retain his different skills? Is it weird to ask to keep your hip bone after replacement surgery? In this live stream excerpt Adam answers these questions from Tested members Manuel Urrutia, Danny Daniel, Exalted Cheese, Grumpy Gophers and David Marden, whom we thank for their support! Any advice from you about any of the above?\n\n00:00 MythBusters\n01:48 Costume weight\n03:09 Kid's destroyed art\n06:00 Retaining skills\n07:26 Keeping a hip bone\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks, like asking Adam a question: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/sub",
