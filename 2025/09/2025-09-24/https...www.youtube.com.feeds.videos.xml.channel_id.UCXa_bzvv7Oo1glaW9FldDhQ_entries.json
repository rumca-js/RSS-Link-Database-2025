        "description": "Hades 2 is, bluntly, more of Hades 1, sure, so if you couldn't really get into the latter, it may not exactly change your mind. But even with the addition of more regions, Boons, build opportunities,  and so on, I'm impressed with how deeply it feeds into the run-based progression that made the original so endearing. \n\nWhether it's a failed or successful attempt, I'm eager to see how the Crossroads has evolved, or if someone has something new to say or venturing to the Cauldron to see what new incantations have become available or retooling my Arcana for the night ahead or undertaking the Chaos Trials with their specific loadouts.",

        "description": "We've come to expect Dying Light titles to end with massive cliffhangers. But the one at the end of The Beast was one we simply couldn't ignore! It had us obsessing endlessly over what could be on the cards for Kyle Crane and the allies he has now made, and had us questioning everything we witnessed as part of his adventure to get there.\n\nWe thought you might like to join in on the fun, and this one's our way of reaching out and telling you what we think that ending could mean for a sequel that's looking quite inevitable at this point. Our heroes are in for the fight of their lives in Dying Light 3, and there are a whole lot of ways things could go right, or horribly wrong, in the process. Join us as we explore what the future could hold for Techland's flagship franchise.",

It's also extremely terrifying - even those versed in writer Ryukishi07's works will find plenty to be disgusted at (kera's art also helps in that regard).\n\nHowever, this is still a survivor horror title, which means conserving resources and carefully tackling enemies is as essential as not losing your wits. Here are 15 tips and tricks that will help you survive the trials and tribulations of Ebisugaoka and the Otherworld.",
