On this week\u2019s episode, host Matt Kosinski and panelists Cris Thomas, Suja Viswesan and Troy Bettencourt debate whether we're headed straight for an AI security disaster. We also react to reports on Scattered Spider\u2019s return (surprise!), a potential new strain of the devastating Petya ransomware and a survey of common cloud misconfigurations. Plus: Hot takes on dumb cybersecurity rules.
