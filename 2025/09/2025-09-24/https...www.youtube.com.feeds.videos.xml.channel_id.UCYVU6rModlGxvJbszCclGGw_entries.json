        "description": "Imagine that every person now is completely trackable because each person emits a radio signal. And no! this has nothing to do with conspiracy theories on nanites from vaccines. This one is real and I will actually show you the real radio signals.\n\nAnd unlike other threats, this one is different because we can also use this against our threats. You see, everyone as a signal, whether they are good guys or bad guys. And surprisingly, those of use with privacy phones (de-Googled), have NO SIGNAL. Yay!\n\nBut we can track everyone with a Signal. And the biggest signal emitters, Apple iPhones, Apple Airtags, Apple Watch.\n\nThere is a danger to anyone who emits the signals since someone can track you even when they can't see you (like when you're at home). And the counter-surveillance is that you can also track those who are tracking you. No Airtag will be safe on your person. You can find it.\n\n----------------------------------\nBraX3 Privacy Phone is on https://braxtech.net\n------------------",
