        "description": "Go to https://shortlinus.com for all your case, screen protector, and overpriced stickers needs.\n\nLinus takes a first look at Apple\u2019s controversial new iPhone Air. It\u2019s thinner than ever, but comes with compromises like a single speaker and missing telephoto camera. With strong performance, a stunning display, and some genuinely clever features, does it balance out the trade-offs, or is it just Apple\u2019s most impractical phone yet?\n\nCheck out Apple's iPhone Air: https://lmg.gg/50DrI\n\nWant us to unbox something?
