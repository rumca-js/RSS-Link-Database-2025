That\u2019s literally the title of the final episode of Season 1, \u201cThe Real Monsters,\u201d but it\u2019s also the theme the whole season has been playing with on FX and Hulu \u2013 or at least, one of the big ones. There are the obvious monsters, of course, like the xenomorph and everyone\u2019s fave horrible octopus thing, the Eye. But as usual for the Alien franchise, those are mostly external factors causing stress on the more human and synth characters, leading to a big question at the end of the season as to whether the monsters have lost the delicate game being played, or if they\u2019ve taken over the asylum.\n\nWritten by Noah Hawley and Migizi Pensoneau, and directed by Dana Gonzales, the surprisingly short finale has a lot going on. But what does it all mean for The Lost Boys, led by Wendy (Sydney Chandler), as well as their human (and xenomorph) counterparts? And how can this all connect to the Alien movie",

To get that, you'll need to do a bit of extra work cleaning up Pharloom and helping its denizens by fulfilling their wishes, among other things. Here's everything you need to do to unlock act 3 in Silksong and get on the right path to reach the true end.",

        "description": "Skate Early Access reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. Also available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 4/5.\n\n\"If I said there weren\u2019t times while playing the new early access Skate when I found myself hooked on clearing a task, or engaged in executing an impromptu line I\u2019d challenged myself to make, I\u2019d be lying. Thanks in large part to its smooth controls, it is true that cruising around in Skate does have the capacity to tickle the dusty part of my brain that still delights in booting up Skate 2 every now and then, just to turn back the clock, noodle around, and unwind. However, these moments are fleeting. Skate is just so aggressively different in tone, style, and spirit from its ancestors that any brief trance I found myself in was constantly broken by its embarrassing dialogue, trite art style, and sterile, mobile game-style progression. Arming Skate with a faithful facsimile of the incredible feel of old games means little if the rest of it is constantly turning me off. ",

        "description": "It\u2019s been nearly six years since Disney released a new Star Wars movie in theaters, and finally, that drought is about to end. The studio just released the first trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu, the big-screen spinoff of the popular Disney+ series. And after watching the footage, we only have one question - what the heck is this movie actually about?\n\nWell, maybe we have a few questions. With the trailer being light on dialogue and heavy on action, there\u2019s a lot we still don\u2019t know about Din Djarin\u2019s (Pedro Pascal) latest mission. Let\u2019s break down the biggest burning questions surrounding The Mandalorian and Grogu and what we actually know about the next Star Wars film. These are the questions we delve into here:\n\nWhat Mission Has The Mandalorian Been Hired For?\nWhy Is the Razor Crest Back?\nHow Big a Role Does Zeb Have?\nWho Is the Main Villain?\nIs This a Movie or a Long Episode of the TV Series?",
