My problem is that I would like customers using Outlook to be able to open such messages directly in Outlook without having to go through the OWA portal, as is the case with customers outside the Microsoft ecosystem. Unfortunately, at this point, every message, even those opened in the customer&#39;s Outlook, is opened through the OWA portal.</p> <p>PS.

I earn about \u00a347k per year, and work 4 on 4 off (daytime only as the SOC is 12/7).</p> <p>Now, going back to the recruiter, he contacted me for a similar position (L2) in a very large MSSP (not naming it here), the role is Mon-Fri 9-5, remote (but free to go to the office if one wants to), with \u00a35k per year to spend on certifications; this is an important point, as they&#39;re a SANS partner and have massive discounts. Furthermore, there is a performance bonus of up to 10% a year, and the Cyber team is large, with over 200 between analysts, engineers, incident responders, consultants, etc., so the exposure alone will likely mean learning ",

About 3 years at a service desk. 1 year at a managed service provider which would be considered the traditional IT help desk role and going on 2 years working as a software support specialist for a digital X-ray company that has their proprietary software and I also troubleshoot the PCs on the systems. I am not ready to give up on tech even though every where I look and everything I read is super discouraging. I found the WGU school and I\u2019m going to go for my undergrad. I keep hearing that the cyber security degrees are a joke but that\u2019s what I want to do. I have a lot of computer science knowledge just because I love reading books learning online with videos. I just feel like if I do the cs degree I\u2019ll spend a whole lot of time completing that and not have any security certs or time on htb, thm or similar learning platforms when I\u2019m done and I have a kid on the way so I wanted",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why do you think CyberArk is better than MFA?. I used CyberArk in my previous two places, both are renowned consulting firms. Both places we used only to keep safe passwords and regenerate them after time-out (48hrs). We used copy the passwords from CyberArk to notepad on our desktops. CyberArk generated passwords are hard to remember for 48hrs. When I used CyberArk, MFA was never heard about. Now we have MS, Google, OKTA to provide those services. So I am wondering why corporations go into the hassle and spending fortune on implementing CyberArk?

I\u2019d love to hear from people who are in the field or have worked alongside auditors about what the long-term picture looks like.</p> <p>One thing I\u2019m curious about is how much the skills you gain in audit transfer to other areas of cybersecurity. Does it open doors to things like risk management, GRC, consulting, or even more technical paths like cloud security or incident response? </p> <p>I\u2019m also wondering how artificial intelligence is going to change the game. Will AI tools that automate compliance checks and analyze logs cut down the need for human auditors, or will they just free people up to focus on higher-level risk analysis and advisory work? Do you see the demand for human judgment around controls and governance staying strong over the next decade?</p> <p>Basically, if you were starting a cybersecurity career today, do you think IT audit is still a g",
