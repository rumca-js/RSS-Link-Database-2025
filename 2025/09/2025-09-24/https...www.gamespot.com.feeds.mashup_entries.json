This event gave me access to three full campaign missions, which collectively highlighted a wide variety of environments and mission types. From storming the beaches of Gibraltar in tanks to gritty close-quarters fights in New York City, the preview contained everything you'd expect from a Battlefield campaign: iconic weaponry, grounded military-style aesthetics, and no shortage of explosions and destruction.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Battlefield 6's campaign takes place in 2027 after NATO gets reduced to shambles, and a private military corporation known as Pax Armata has risen to power. This corporation's attempts to further accumulate power threaten to send the world into global conflict. The story follows members of the elite US Marine raiders unit known as Dagger 1-3 as they fight against Pax Armata's forces on a global scale. ",
