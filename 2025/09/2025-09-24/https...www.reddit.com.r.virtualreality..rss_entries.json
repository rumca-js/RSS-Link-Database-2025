        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone! Looking for some help getting the controller Bluetooth to connect properly. In short Ive had this headset for 6 months and it has been plagued by disconnecting controllers. I used to use the tp link ub 500 adapter and my controllers kept disconnecting. I learned this is a common issue with this specific adapter so I used the supposed &quot;best&quot; one the asus ub 500, the setup went smooth but I am now plagued with a worse issue, on the psvr 2 app it says that my Bluetooth quality is 59 for both controllers and it is TERRIBLE. So then the most recent Bluetooth fix attempt was to use a pcie card that is supposed to also work with the psvr 2 its called the, &quot;intel Wifi-6 AX200&quot; (it has Bluetooth included) The controllers set up and I thought everything was going well but when ever I turned my back to the card the controllers would disconnect and the overall stability wasn&#39;t very good, so thanks in advanced :)</p> </div><",

On my previous unit mura was visible literally everywhere.
