I love coding and sharing ideas with AI, it really makes my life both easier and more interesting as a programmer. However, there is something that has been buggering me for a while now. When you start a project with an AI, for instance a Web application, the AI will always proposes an implementation based on existing technologies. There is an actual risk IMO that existing technologies will be <em>sanctuarized by AI.</em> If someone comes up with a better framework, but very few examples exist around, then to force the AI to use it might prove difficult. AIs tend to use what they know in coding, not what is new or better. It is already pretty fascinating to see that the most popular languages are also the oldest, Java, C++ or Python are more than 30 years old. With AI, there is a real risk that this trend will be enforced, because the largest your initial base of code is in a given language, the bet",

It was an interesting experience and I think most of the limitations to the games on Rosebud AI are because of Rosebud AI&#39;s business model, not the limitations of AI. It&#39;s kind of wild what you can do with AI for game creation.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the review: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/d89PriVUbIA\">https://youtu.be/d89PriVUbIA</a> </p> <p>I think AI games have a long way to go but you can do some impressive stuff with what&#39;s currently out. It feels like we&#39;re in the Will Smith badly eating spaghetti stage of AI games and in a year from now, we might be able to generate GT6 with a few prompts (maybe not that extreme but you never know). I would like to see chatgpt like NPCs in more games and maybe even an endless story mode through generative AI. Came across the first but not the second. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",
