And decided to settle with CachyOS as I&#39;m willing to tweak the system if needed and I&#39;m primarily using my laptop for gaming. Everything is going great, but I have a question: the laptop is only using and apparently recognizing the dedicated GPU (NVIDIA RTX 4060) and not the integrated GPU (don&#39;t know what it is, CPU is a Ryzen 7 7435HS).

Have decent-ish knowledge of Linux via running my NAS and a little Optiplex server for years. System is a 9800X3D with a 9070XT.</p> <p>Specific Questions: * I have a HDR OLED Ultrawide. I know that HDR is still pretty hit or miss on Linux, but looks like some flavours of Proton can now get it working via env variables. Are there any other gotchas I should know about? How is the SDR -&gt; HDR mapping in Linux for desktop? I know it&#39;s bad in Windows and recommended to leave it off until playing a HDR game. * How&#39;s FSR4/RDNA4 support on Linux now? I know it was experimental for quite a while. And by extension - how&#39;s Optiscaler with Linux?
