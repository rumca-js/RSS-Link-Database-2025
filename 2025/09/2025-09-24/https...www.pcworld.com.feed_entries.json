It\u2019s a key development for local AI and the chips that power its use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, Microsoft quietly said that <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/09/23/windows-ml-is-generally-available-empowering-developers-to-scale-local-ai-across-windows-devices/\">Windows ML is now generally available</a>, seven years after <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/401656/windows-ml-will-tap-your-pc-hardware-to-smarten-up-windows-10-apps-with-ai.html\">first introducing the technology at Build</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Windows ML will hopefully solve a persistent problem: consumers care about AI, they simply don\u2019t care where it lives.

When you are, the app displays a pop up to tell you to sit up straight. It also tracks your posture over time so that you can see your progress over the course of the day or a week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app works with both sitting and standing desks and you can start and stop the monitoring with just a click of the mouse.
