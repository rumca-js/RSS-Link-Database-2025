The books were non-spec fiction.</p> <p>However, late in his career, in 1980s-1990s, he decided to try writing some books with SFF elements. The books, &quot;The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years&quot; and &quot;Cassandra&#39;s brand&quot; ended up being not very successful. Like in &quot;The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years&quot; the realistic parts are quite well written, but SFF parts are just terrible.</p> <p>So, what are other examples of writers who usually do not write SFF writing SFF and whether it was successful or not?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/adalhaidis\"> /u/adalhaidis </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nph6c6/what_happens_when_nonsff_writers_write/\">[link]</",

If you&#39;re looking for a high fantasy novel in a unique world with some fantastic characters and scenes, I highly recommend it.
