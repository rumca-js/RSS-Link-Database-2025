I have created an app called PowerMinds that helps you become more self-confident through small, proven, cool challenges that you can complete every day and for which you can also write a journal. You can also collect points with the challenges and reach levels to make it more fun. The nice thing is that there is also a feature that allows you to invite friends, so you can see their status (level and points and whether they have completed today&#39;s challenge). Maybe there are a few people here who could use the app. I would be incredibly happy...

You\u2019ve got something cool built, but how do you get real users without blowing money on ads?</p> <p>That\u2019s what led me to build <strong>Rocketo.co</strong>. Instead of paid ads, you can set up \u201cquests\u201d (like join your waitlist, follow on X, give feedback, etc.) and reward your early community directly \u2014 with discounts, perks, or unique project benefits.</p> <p>The idea is to:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Help side projects grow</strong> with authentic engagement, not fake clicks.</li> <li><strong>Give early adopters a reason to care</strong> (and something fun to do).</li> <li><strong>Save cash</strong> by turning traction into a game.</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s live in beta, and I\u2019d love for this community to try it \u2014 sign up free, create one quest, and let me know if it\u2019s actually useful for your project.</p> <p",

Unlike Grammarly, it\u2019s minimal, fast, and even allows you to pick a style (formal, informal, friendly, academic, etc.).</p> <p>Here\u2019s my challenge: since the app relies on an AI API, every request costs money. That means I can\u2019t really offer a generous free plan like many SaaS products do. The only realistic option is a paid subscription model.</p> <p>My questions are:</p> <ul> <li>How do you attract your very first paying users when there\u2019s no free plan?</li> <li>Is it better to provide a very limited free tier (e.g., 10 checks/month) just to build trust?</li> <li>What marketing channels worked best for you in a similar situation (Reddit, Product Hunt, YouTube, etc.)?</li> <li>How do you convince people to try a tool when the space already has big players like Grammarly?</li> </ul> <",

For me, it\u2019s never about chasing quick wins I just like testing things, seeing what actually works and what doesn\u2019t</p> <p>The biggest lesson? Sitting still is the worst option.

I noticed I was wasting time every Friday night trying to remember what I needed. The idea is to save you time and mental energy by handling the boring part of the grocery process. I\u2019m currently testing it manually (no app yet). If you send me: A few past grocery receipts (photos or digital), Your preferences (brands, household size, must-haves), I\u2019ll send you a customized grocery list every Friday(or your preferred day) for free, and you can tell me if it helped or not. If you\u2019ve ever thought \u201cugh, I hate writing this list every week,\u201d I\u2019d love your feedback. Drop a comment or DM me! (Also open to feedback on whether this solves a real problem or is just a minor annoyance I\u2019m overthinking.) Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",
