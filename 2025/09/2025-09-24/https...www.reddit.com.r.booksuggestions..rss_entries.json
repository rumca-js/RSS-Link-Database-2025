Basically I\u2019m drawn to darker fantasy, mythological themes, supernatural vibes, and morally gray characters.</p> <p>Since I\u2019m basically starting from scratch, I\u2019d appreciate books that can hook me in right away.

Later, I read Can\u2019t Hurt Me and really connected with how Goggins taught lessons through his life story. I also enjoyed The Alchemist, where lessons came through a fictional narrative.</p> <p>Basically, I\u2019ve realized I love books that teach lessons, values, or perspectives through stories\u2014whether real-life experiences or fiction. I don\u2019t mind pure fiction either, as long as it\u2019s engaging and meaningful.

I have LOADS of favorite writers that I read as a child, teenager, and as an adult (for the first time or rereads), and more specifically those whose styles line up closer to mine that I take as more particular inspiration instead of just liking them.
