CNET social producer Faith Chihil was amazed that the scents didn't linger for long and didn't feel overpowering, as she played a modded level of Minecraft that incorporated smells like cherry blossoms, campfire, wet grass, and even an interesting scent to indicate her health was going low.\n\nOVR is working with game developers to make scent part of the gaming narrative, using Omara's Unreal and Unity plug-ins.\n\nOmara is coming to consumers in 2026 along with a suite of compatible games, price TBD. \n\nWould you give this a whiff? #omara #videogames #weirdtech #fragrance #perfume",
