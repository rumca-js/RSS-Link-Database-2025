I swapped in Goldberg\u2019s steam_api64.dll (~6 MB), added steam_appid.txt (1888930) and a steam_settings folder, even tried SteamAutoCrack so the game is detected in AW.

I want to have an app that allows access to all the content from streaming sites but blocks all their ads and has a good built-in video player like aniyomi basically does. On FMHY, I could find stremio. But I am in Germany and I want to avoid torrenting and torrent streaming completely. The second option would be cloudstream if I got that right, it doesn&#39;t say torrent streaming so I should be fine? FMHY leads to the github page, is this what I&#39;m looking for? I&#39;d prefer German audio but if necessary, English is fine, too.
