Only female mosquitoes bite because they need nutrients from blood to develop eggs. That drive makes them dangerous, allowing them to spread viruses such as Zika, dengue, malaria, and yellow fever, which together kill over 1 million people a year.",

But this explanation has limitations, leaving open questions about how these events line up with the consistent patterns astronomers actually observe.",

But there are those who would try to \"constrain\" it, at least in terms of physics. A new paper from Pankaj Mehta of Boston University of Jan\u00e9 Kondev of Brandeis that was recently posted to the arXiv preprint server looks at how the fundamental constants of physics might be applied to life as we know it\u2014and even life as we don't know it yet. Their idea doesn't necessarily give the answer to the ultimate question, but it does tie two seemingly disparate fields nicely together.",

This came as a surprise, considering the low concentrations of oxygen\u2014which is required for the formation of rust\u2014on the moon. Researchers proposed several theories to account for the origins of the oxygen in moon rust, including the degassing of volatiles from lunar magma, asteroids, comets, or large impact events.",
