Here\u2019s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong><strong><br></strong>In 2011, the Guardian uncovered widespread illegality \u2013 including phone hacking \u2013 at the News of the World, with far-reaching repercussions. Perhaps this drama can do for the scandal what Mr Bates vs the Post Office did for post office operators. Written by Jack Thorne, The Hack stars Toby Jones as the Guardian\u2019s former editor Alan Rusbridger and David Tennant as Nick Davies, the reporter who broke the story. Journalism is notoriously difficult to dramatise and not all the flashbacks, subplots and narrative tricks quite work. But it\u2019s a worthwhile attempt to refocus on events that still feel significant. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/24/tv-tonight-the-phone-hacking-scandal-gets-the-mr-bates-treatmen",

In the UK, with its distinct seasons, that weather influences mood, so pairing the right dish with the climate and season feels deeply nourishing, and goes far beyond mere sustenance. To me, pasta is the most versatile of food types and lends itself perfectly to such seasonal cooking: a walk through damp woodland, say, often makes me crave wild mushrooms, sauteed with garlic and herbs, then tossed with fettuccine, while, as the days shorten and the air cools, a slow-cooked game ragu with penne always hits the spot, as does a warming blast of \u2019nduja in a creamy sauce. And when indulgence calls, a rich walnut, egg and parmesan sauce is wickedly satisfying.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/24/autumn-pasta-",
