        "description": "Researchers reviewing 46 studies found evidence linking prenatal acetaminophen (Tylenol) exposure with higher risks of autism and ADHD. The FDA has since urged caution, echoing scientists\u2019 advice that the drug be used only at the lowest effective dose and shortest duration.
