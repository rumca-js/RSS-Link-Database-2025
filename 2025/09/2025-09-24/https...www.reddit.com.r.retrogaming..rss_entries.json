It\u2019s not turning on, battery port doesn\u2019t look bad aside from a bit of dust. So in peoples\u2019 experiences - how hard are they to fix? I\u2019m aware it\u2019s impossible to say what\u2019s wrong with my gameboy based on it not turning on alone, but I mean as machines are they simple enough that I\u2019m likely to be able to have a go at fixing it? Like if my phone wouldn\u2019t turn on I wouldn\u2019t even attempt to fix it myself, I know it\u2019s too complicated and an absolutely 0% chance I\u2019d be able to work out what\u2019s wrong with it. But is the gameboy simple enough for someone with some basic tech understanding and a bit of experience tinkering around with broken PlayStations/Xbox\u2019s to suss out?

I already have a BitFunx GameCube to HDMI adapter and I\u2019m getting an N64, a PS2, and a Wii, but the RetroTINK 5X seems really expensive.</p> <p>I\u2019d also like wireless controllers that work across all consoles. From what I understand, the N64 is the only one that really needs original hardware.</p> <p>Do I need an HDMI/component box/upscaler for each console, or is there a simpler way to connect them all and get good picture quality?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Razuto22\"> /u/Razuto22 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1npgi3l/best_way_to_hook_up_multiple_retro_consoles_to_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogam",
