I still worried bc it said error even tho it used to say disabled whenever I checked before, I powered off my iphone and now it saying disable again so unsure if it was at all even tapped or just a carrier glitch (weird it happened for so long tho). I then heard it shouldn&#39;t affect my phone and the code only works for like 3G carrier stuff? I use virgin so idk about that I heard it shouldn&#39;t affect it so idk, it said &quot;interrogation failed&quot; for each code or smt. so was this all just a hoax I fell for or should be actually worried? idk if this means there is a keylogger on my phone and now that someone can see all my calls and stuff... I just know this all happened bc I was messaging someone who had an android who from my school bc I was talking to em abt support stuff since their cousin works in IT.",

This is not something I have browsed for in years.</p> <p>However as I got myself a chair today and I talked with my friend on teams on voice call and I mentioned both gaming chair and office chair, as I went from gaming chair to office chair and found out office chairs are too small for how I normally sit in the chair at home. This was like 6-8 hours. Now I was at Youtube and since my adblocker did not work after last update I got an ad for an office chair.</p> <p>I also had a discussion on Facebook messenger 2 days ago about getting a chair. Never was in this conversation was in mentioned a gaming chair nor an office chair.</p> <p>Since I know ads can appear really shortly after searching for something on the internet based on past experiences, I believe that this most likely come from my voice call on teams. Which basically means Microsoft is listening in on conversations for how to sell",
