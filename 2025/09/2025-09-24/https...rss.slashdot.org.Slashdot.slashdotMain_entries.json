        "description": "Longtime Slashdot reader schwit1 shares a report from ICO Bench: As of September 1, 2025, banks across Vietnam are closing accounts deemed inactive or non-compliant with new biometric rules. Authorities estimate that more than 86 million accounts out of roughly 200 million are at risk if users fail to update their identity verification.\n The State Bank of Vietnam has also introduced stricter thresholds for transactions:\n- Facial authentication is mandatory for online transfers above 10 million VND (about $379).\n- Cumulative daily transfers over 20 million VND ($758) also require biometric approval.\n \nThe policy is part of the central bank's broader \"cashless\" strategy, aimed at combating fraud, identity theft, and deepfake-enabled scams.

        "description": "Microsoft is preparing a Publisher Content Marketplace to pay publishers when their work is used in AI products like Copilot. Neowin reports: Microsoft is reportedly discussing with select US publishers a pilot program for its so-called Publisher Content Marketplace, a system that pays publishers for their content when it gets used by AI products, starting with its own Copilot assistant. The PCM will launch with a limited number of partners before Microsoft hopes to expand the program over time. The company pitched the idea to publishing executives at an invite-only Partner Summit in Monaco last week. Microsoft was allegedly courting them with the message: \"You deserve to be paid on the quality of your IP.\" No concrete launch date for the pilot was shared.\n \nAs Axios notes, Microsoft is the first major company to try to build a proper AI marketplace for publishers.
