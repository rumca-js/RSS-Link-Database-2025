This year, we made a few representative mooncakes and also gathered local delicacies from all over the country. When they were all placed together on the map, my family sighed with emotion: truly, China\u2019s bounty is vast, and every place has its own unique flavor.\nWishing everyone a joyful Mid-Autumn Festival, filled with peace and good health. \n\nHello, everyone! I am Dianxi Xiaoge, a Yunnan native. If you enjoy my videos, please keep subscribing to my channel. I'll continue to share my life and Yunnan-styled food in my uploads.
