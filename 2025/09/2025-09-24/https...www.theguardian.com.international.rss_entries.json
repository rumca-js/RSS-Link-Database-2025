At night, after her kids go to bed, mum of three Suzanne (Val\u00e9rie Bonneton) gets a box down from a high cupboard. Inside is her stash of vodka, which she carefully siphons into mineral water bottles for the next day. There is no pleasure in her drinking; it makes her foggy at work and detached from her boys. Bonneton, better known in France for comedy roles, is terrific, with her warm, worn performance, not a scrap of sentimentality in it.</p><p>Suzanne hits her rock bottom after a car accident; the court puts her sons into the care of their grandparents and orders her into rehab. First comes denial. \u201cSome wine with dinner,\u201d she tells the doctor who asks her about her drinking at the all-female unit. Other residents include Diane (Mich\u00e8le Laroque), a",
