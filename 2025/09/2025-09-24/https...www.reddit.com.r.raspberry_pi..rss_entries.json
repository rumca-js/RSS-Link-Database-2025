However, when I try to run the webpage locally on Pico without pc, it works 50% the time, opening the HTML page, but I cannot get responses to do anything, and it always times out. I tried pinging it with pc terminal, and it works, but the actual info sent through doesn&#39;t reach. When I do it separately through the Flask webpage, it always opens and connects to Pico, but still no response, and always times out. Is there any way to fix this issue? </p> <p>As well, using socket 80 or 8080 doesn&#39;t seem to work, I&#39;ve turned off the firewall, restarted my modem and still nothing. This is very new and very confusing, andI would like to get it to work and understand how it works so I can make more complex projects</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",
