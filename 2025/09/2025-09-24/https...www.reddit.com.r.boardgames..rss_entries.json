Personally, I enjoy it when games push players to interact more directly, and I\u2019m worried this might feel a little too isolated.</p> <p>I know there are expansions (Saboteurs, Director\u2019s Cut) that attempt to address this, but from what I\u2019ve read, they mostly add interaction during combat. That\u2019s not really where I\u2019d want it.

I find it really thematic and clever with amazing strategy and very good combinations of combos to score points. Anyways, it might seem a bit old now but definitely worth a try if you haven&#39;t played it.</p> <p>I was playing with my 7-year-old daughter and see just so impulsively and instinctively said that she would love to play this with her cousins. She loves the game although she sometimes gets bored after an hour and wants to stop. After this I was thinking, has anyone tried to play it with 4?</p> <p>The though is to have two teams of 2 and each one to have either 1 or 2 Targi figures to place. Team players cannot talk to each other during the round so that it&#39;s totally up to their instinct which cards to go for. It kinda reminds me a bit o Skyteam but with an opponent also. It&#39;s a long shot I know but does anyone care to try this? Is there anything like it that anyone might have found?</p>",

There were different coloured marbles, something like 5 yellow, 4 red, and 3 blue, and the there were different odds for different combinations of colours (e.g. 3 yellows might pay out 5/1 or something). He said they each take turns being the &quot;banker&quot; and would basically gamble for tiny amounts of money. </p> <p>The closest thing I&#39;ve found that sounds like this is Avalanche, but he said it&#39;s not that.
