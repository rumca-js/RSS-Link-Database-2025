I understand the reason behind it (isolation of the publicly exposed services) but I&#39;m not sure how realistic it is as some services in the DMZ simply might need access across the network in my opinion.</p> <p>A prime example would be Home Assistant which needs access to pretty much your whole network (depending on how you use it of course but it provides integrations for much more than just IoT devices). Another example could be NFS - if some of your publicly exposed services needed an NFS storage (e.g. on your NAS), you would have no choice but to create an allow rule for it, would you?</p> <p>That&#39;s why I was thinking how strictly you guys follow the &quot;DMZ should be completely isolated&quot; approach.

The camera will run object detection directly on-sensor, while a separate PC will handle a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret events and generate alerts. I want to confirm whether a Pi 5 (8GB) is sufficient to handle the IMX500 and stream only detection metadata to the server, and whether this setup would be better than using a normal Pi camera with an external accelerator like a Hailo-13T or Hailo-26T for this use case. in addition, im also considering which is most cost efficient.
