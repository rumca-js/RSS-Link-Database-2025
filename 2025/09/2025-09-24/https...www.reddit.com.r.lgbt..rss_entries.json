All they say is not to commit the same sex acts and not to &quot;dress like a woman&quot; if you&#39;re a man. But guess what? This was addressed to pedophiles who were certainly NOT gay or trans!</p> <p>So anyone who thinks the ideologies are genuinely sinful needs to reconsider the meaning and reasoning to the Scripture, think about God&#39;s character and stop making God seem like something He&#39;s not.</p> <p>(Written by a theist who strongly supports LGBTQIAP+)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Essiana35yAnZ\"> /u/Essiana35yAnZ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments",

I was not expecting it, so I was surprised but supportive. I told him how brave I thought him, and said that I love him no matter what. He\u2019s asked me not to tell anyone, even his dad who I know would also be supportive. I promised him I wouldn\u2019t, but I don\u2019t want my husband to be as blindsided as me. I\u2019m not sure if I should tell him or not. However, my second reaction, that I\u2019m keeping to myself right now, is terror. Terror about what this means for him. We live in a conservative state. Our friends aren\u2019t, but our family is. The world is changing day by day and I am scared of what his experience will be like. I can\u2019t stand the thought of someone not seeing this beautiful person and only seeing someone they don\u2019t approve of. How can I navigate this with him? How can I navigate this as a person who wants to protect him from the world?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
