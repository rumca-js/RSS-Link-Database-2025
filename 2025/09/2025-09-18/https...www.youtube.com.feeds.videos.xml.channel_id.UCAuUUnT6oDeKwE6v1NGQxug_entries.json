        "description": "Making art isn\u2019t self-indulgent \u2014 it\u2019s an essential, radical act of creation, says writer Amie McNee. She explores the importance of having a creative practice, whether you\u2019re a long-time artist or an aspiring one, and shows how to move past self-doubt and start expressing yourself. If you\u2019ve ever felt like your creativity doesn\u2019t matter in a world with so many problems, this talk is for you.
