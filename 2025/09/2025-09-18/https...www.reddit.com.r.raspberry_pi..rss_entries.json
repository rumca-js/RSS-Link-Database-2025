I end up adapting all of my 5 PIN and 3.5mm TRS MIDI (Type A and Type B) to 1/4 TRS plugs so I can use a patch bay to move stuff around. I would like to repurpose a Pi4 I have to:<br/> 1) Act as a USB host for my MIDI controller and send messages out via a TRS jack<br/> 2) Take MIDI messages coming in from the sequencer via a TRS jack and replicate them to 4 different outgoing TRS jacks<br/> 3) run readonly and headless </p> <p>In my googling of RP MIDI projects I am not seeing much that dives into using I/O pins to add multiple jacks.
