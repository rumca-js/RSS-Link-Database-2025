I have also tried free tools like Google trends and Google keyword planner but didn&#39;t find it really helpful with the limited data. Is it okay if I just focus on my niche and write blogs on the topics that I feel would be helpful for my target audience? And check the related searches and paa for those topics. Or is it a must to do a proper keyword research, find search volume, competition and then decide how to go about my pillar and cluster posts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; ",
