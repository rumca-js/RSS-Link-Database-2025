Some people believe Kimmel was suggesting Charlie Kirk's assassin was a MAGA supporter, which led to his suspension. On Wednesday, the chairman of the FCC, President Donald Trump appointee Brendan Carr, urged local ABC stations to \"push back\" against Kimmel. Shortly after, Jimmy Kimmel Live was suspended.",
