        "description": "Techland's expansion turned standalone sequel winds up being the most enjoyable Dying Light so far, because it dials back the power fantasy.\n\nIt wouldn't seem to make sense to call Dying Light: The Beast a more grounded game than its predecessors. It's a game in which you routinely shift into something like X-Men's Wolverine, slashing at the undead with the ferocity of a preying mountain lion and carving them to shreds with what is basically an instant win button. But beyond the feature that informs the game's title, this expansion turned standalone sequel actually leans further into horror and survival than anything in the series, making it the most fun I've had with Dying Light to date.\n\n#dyinglightthebeast #gaming #gamespot \n\nCredits: Edit Max Blumenthal, Gameplay Kurt Indovina, Tom Caswell, Jean-Luc Seipke, Written by Mark Delaney, VO by Kurt Indovina",
