        "description": "We go hands-on with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the next evolution of Meta\u2019s smart glasses with a full color heads-up display embedded in the right side lens. They\u2019re also the first product to make use of a neural wristband to control the glasses interface, reading micro gestures from your hand that feels like a brand new computer control paradigm. We dive deep and dissect how these technologies work, and once again sit down for a technical conversation with Boz, Meta\u2019s Chief Technology Officer. \n\nShot by Josh Self and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\nAdditional media courtesy of Meta\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nSavage Merchandising: https://adamsavage.com/\nA",
