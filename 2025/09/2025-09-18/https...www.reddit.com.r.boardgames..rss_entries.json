I\u2019m working on designing a board game and wondering about games with vertical tiles that are used for walls that use little plastic stands or connector pieces that I can use for proxy/playtesting. Will create my own if need be but would like to maybe save some time. Ideally looking for something in the medieval/fantasy genre, castle walls, wooden barricades, rock or dirt cliffs, etc. Not looking for games with plastic terrain, I\u2019m aware of a few of those. Any help is much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sensitive_Ant9946\"> /u/Sensitive_Ant9946 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1nke4qh/games_with_cardboard_vertical_wallsterrain/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1nke4qh/games_with_cardboard_vertical_wallsterrain/\">[comments]</a></span>",
