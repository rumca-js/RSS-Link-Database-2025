Politicians and pundits are calling for laws against \u201chate speech,\u201d threatening prosecutions, and urging employers to fire anyone celebrating his death. But is this really justice\u2014or the destruction of the very liberty Kirk defended? From Trump\u2019s defiance to Matt Walsh\u2019s critique, the debate exposes a dangerous hypocrisy: weaponizing censorship in the name of honoring a man whose life\u2019s work was built on open expression. At stake is more than politics\u2014it\u2019s whether America still believes in free speech as a principle, not a tool of power.\n[UNPACKED]\n\nGo to http://rumble.com/premium/brand and use code BRAND to save $10 on your annual subscrip",
