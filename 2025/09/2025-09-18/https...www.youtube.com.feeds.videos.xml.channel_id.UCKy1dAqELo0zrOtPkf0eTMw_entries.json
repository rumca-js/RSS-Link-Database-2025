        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nTencent has fired back at Sony in the ongoing lawsuit over Tencent's Light of Motiram video game. Sony is alleging Motiram is a 'clone' of Horizon Zero Dawn; now Tencent is saying Sony has copied other games when Horizon was being developed, citing Ninja Theory's Enslaved: Oddsey to the West as an example. In other news, former IGN staffer Destin Legarie was sent what he believes to be legitimate leaks of the price for the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X, and it's not going to be cheap. And finally, Borderlands 4's latest patch hopefully fixes some of the performance issues plaguing the PC version of the game.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

The gimmick of amping yourself up into a scary monster to fight other monsters sticks the landing and mostly makes up for a generic story and a map that has few surprises in store. However, aside from your new rampaging abilities and some freaky new boss fights, The Beast does stick pretty close to what worked in the last two games, so it may feel a bit rote to those who have played those recently. Its signature blend of parkour and melee-focused combat remains largely the same, but there\u2019s certainly nothing wrong with having more Dying Light.",

But as the games industry has evolved, so have tastes and gameplay systems, and thus remakes have changed, too. Now, a remake can offer a truly new experience to both long-term and new fans, with fresh new takes on decades-old ideas. The very best remakes are carefully observed balancing acts that find the sweet spot between faithful recreation and exciting new ideas. In some cases, that\u2019s the game exactly as you thought you remembered it, now unshackled from old hardware limitations. In others, it's radical recreations that provide an alternate vision of the original\u2019s core idea. \n\nWith all that in mind, let\u2019s explore the very best video game remakes. From Resident Evil 2 to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series, these are the 15 strongest examples of remakes, judged not by their overall quality as games, but by how each project achieved its ne",

It\u2019s best enjoyed with a group because co-op games almost always are, but also because there are plenty of relatively quiet moments where it\u2019s basically a chill chat room in space. There are some parts of this ship that need a little TLC, but I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t nearly always having fun playing it. Even when things seem all but lost and everything\u2019s on fire, you can still pull it out if you and your crew work together, play smart, and get a little lucky. Even though there\u2019s still work to do to get Jump Space shipshape, particularly when it comes to adding more variety to its mission objectives, it\u2019s already proven its concept is a winner.",
