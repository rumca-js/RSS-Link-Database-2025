I&#39;ve loved these:</p> <ul> <li>The Talent series by J. M. Miro</li> <li>The Bone Season series by Samantha Shannon</li> <li>Miss Peregrine&#39;s Peculiar Children by Random Riggs</li> <li>The Series of Unfortunate Events (vibes) </li> </ul> <p>I&#39;ve heard of magical libraries, Alice in Wonderland type deals, and secret societies so I need to know which ones I should start with. I love romance but I really want the story to be plot and character development driven. I need something to sink my teeth into but standalones are more than welcome. If you wanna be super nice add why you like your rec so much. </p> <p>Thanks for everyone&#39;s help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fascinatingblueshirt\"> /u",

Btw romance it\u2019s not especially needed but a good female cast or male cast for the mc is always appreciated(especially if it\u2019s obsessive\u2026\u2026 Blame the iBooks not me !!!)</p> <p>Tragedy, revenge, complex characters and moral gray Mc\u2019s are a good combination from my point of view. The Mc doesn\u2019t have to be a demon but not a saint either.Which may seem kind of edgy for some of you but mhe, it has already kind of grown upon me. </p> <p>I am not strictly asking you to adhere to my preferences.

But I know he talked quite a bit about it before he died; I&#39;ve been trying to track down info on it from Theoryland and elsewhere, but does anyone know if there&#39;s a good place where everything we know about what the series might have entailed is assembled in one place?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello! I\u2019m Shiromi Arserio. For the past 11 years I\u2019ve made my living narrating audiobooks. Nearly half of what I record are in the fantasy genre. I\u2019ve narrated for a World Fantasy Award winner, Hugo, and Nebula nominees, as well as indie authors. You may know my voice from The Burning kingdoms series by Tasha Suri and Kate Elliott\u2019s Crown of Stars series amongst many others.</p> <p>This past January I released my first novel, The Order of Grimm. It\u2019s a fantasy heist set in a post-fairytale world. Think, Snow White meets Ocean\u2019s Eleven. I self-published it wide, meaning it\u2019s available everywhere in ebook, print, and, of course, audio. That\u2019s been a huge learning experience for me. But apparently it didn\u2019t scare me off, since I\u2019m getting ready to release the sequel, The Glass Coffin Society, in November.</p> <p>Visit my website to learn where you can buy copies of my book, and to sign up for my newsletter. If that\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in. I pr",

It was dark, intense, action packed, and very emotional but also had strong strong christain themes. For example the MC\u2019s love interest is obviously christain and so is his father figure that he lives with and the themes of redemption and all of it was so good! Also another one of my all time favorite books is between two fires by Christopher Buehlman! Loved it and for very similar reasons. The brutality was amazing and it was extremely dark but the thematic elements of Christianity was amazing and just made the story so much more impactful with once again the redemptive qualities and it being very straight forward about Christ and basically revelation from the Bible coming true in a medieval setting. I was wondering if anyone had any other recommendations like these? I\u2019m not really looking for explicitly Christian fantasy boo",

I enjoyed <em>Kaiju Preservation Society</em> for what it was (which is exactly what Scalzi intended it to be - he called it the book version of a \u201cpop song.\u201d). <em>Starter Villain</em> didn\u2019t really work for me - I was just bored with his style, and I decided I wasn\u2019t going to read anything more from him.

I started BOBH because I really enjoyed Babel and I saw a lot of reviews saying that it has a similar premise with more complex and fleshed out characters and plot lines. However, I don\u2019t really like Thomil and Sciona\u2019s relationship so far. I don\u2019t get how Thomil has managed to fall for Sciona when they\u2019ve only known each other for like a couple months (?) Furthermore, BOBH read very YA-like to me (which isn\u2019t an insult! There are many YA books I enjoy reading), but I kept imagining the characters as like 17-18 yr olds when in reality they\u2019re in their 20s-30s. I also started bobh bc a lot of ppl said it had dark academia vibes but to be honest they weren\u2019t really there for me.
