The TL;DR is that I&#39;ve added support for program migration, cleaned up the code massively, and started work on making it distro-agnostic, to eventually be able to support targets other than Kubuntu. It&#39;s still very much alpha software, though.</p> <p>It&#39;s also been released under the AGPL 3 license, and I&#39;m looking forward to welcoming more contributors!
