In most cases that\u2019s a standard operating temperature of between 32 and 158 degrees Fahrenheit (0 to 70 degrees Celsius). If temps stay within that range, performance will be optimal, and you don\u2019t have to worry about extra cooling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if an SSD gets hotter than 158 degrees, it will start to throttle its performance, and extra cooling will be required for best performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-motherboard-might-already-be-cooling-it\">Your motherboard migh",
