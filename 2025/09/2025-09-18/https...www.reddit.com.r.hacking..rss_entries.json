I got into hacking at a very young age when my cousin demonstrated how to reinstall the windows OS in our schools so we had admin. Of course I was a child then and only participating in ethical hacking now. However, one thing I&#39;ve never learned is email spoofing. I became interested when that same cousin got a job in IT for a school. The school he works for had a student email address but stopped using it because a few kids learned how to exploit it and would send emails from &quot;fake&quot; address. Apparently it was a security and social engineering nightmare because the main vulnerability was having 500 students who all had shit passwords and didn&#39;t use 2fa but also the teachers wouldn&#39;t take the spam folder seriously and just take out sensible looking email address.</p> <p>I don&#39;t imagine it&#39;s very hard to spoof emails (I don&#39;t think he cares if I do it easily, he just wants me",
