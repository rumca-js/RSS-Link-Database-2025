I thought I was desentized to fiction enough. But recently, it feels like my empathic circuits are in overdrive. (This was happening before my grandma&#39;s recent heart attack, but the attack really brought these feelings to the forefront).</p> <p>For me, that book is Xenogensis/Lilith&#39;s Brood by Octavia E.

But the word for it wasn&#39;t quite there. Even Brian Selznick, the creator of <em>The Invention of Hugo Cabret</em>, called his book <em>&quot;not exactly a novel, not quite a picture book, not really a graphic novel, or a flip book or a movie, but a combination of all these things&quot;.</em> So I figured I&#39;d make a subreddit for it--plant a flag, so people can gather, and so on.</p> <p>To start the community, right now, I&#39;m putting together a",
