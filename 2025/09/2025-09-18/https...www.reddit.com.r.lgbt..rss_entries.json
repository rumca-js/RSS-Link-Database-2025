He lives a bit farther away, so we don\u2019t see each other too often, but when we do, we like going to the sauna/thermal baths together. He\u2019s straight, but he\u2019s always been very physically comfortable with me \u2013 hugging, cuddling, joking around, slapping my ass, sometimes touching my chest playfully. This kind off stuff.</p> <p>Here\u2019s where it gets complicated: my boyfriend actually gets turned on by the idea of me being naked with this friend. He\u2019s even fantasized about us doing something sexual. So when I visited my friend recently, I told him about it. He said nothing would ever really happen between us, but he was fine with playing along.</p>",

It is quite dangerous to be gay, especially in public because it can get you in legal or physical trouble. The constant anxiety is terrible and exhausting.</p> <p>I am actively seeking ways to leave the county to live somewhere I feel I can be safe and free, but I am overwhelmed. I have very little support and I do not know how to begin. I really hope someone could offer insight to help. I know it is a very niche situation, but maybe you or someone you know has dealt with this.</p> <p>What countries do you know are more welcoming that could provide asylum or immigration because of orientation?
