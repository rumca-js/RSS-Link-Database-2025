As a general rule, the boys continue as usual while the girls \u2013 who tend to be more politically progressive \u2013 face a choice: they can speak up, which usually results in them getting the reputation as annoying and unable to take a joke, or they can let it pass and be regarded as a chill girl who isn\u2019t angry or woke.
