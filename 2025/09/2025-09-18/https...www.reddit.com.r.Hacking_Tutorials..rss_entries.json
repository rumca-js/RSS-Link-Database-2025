I am starting in Networking Hacking and stumble upon cracking WPA/WPA2. Bruteforcing as well as dictionary attack works but my laptop is slow. I stumbled upon another method which is renting gpu on the cloud. I want to try linode but according to other people&#39;s stories, the 100$ credit is difficult to obtain and to use their gpu requires a lot of process. Is there any gpu on the cloud that I can rent also in low cost per hour? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/UIUXaccountph\"> /u/UIUXaccountph </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1njy7v9/rent_gpu_on_cloud_to_crack_wpawpa2/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1njy7v9/rent_gpu_on_cloud_to_crack_wpawpa2/\">[comments]</a></span>",
