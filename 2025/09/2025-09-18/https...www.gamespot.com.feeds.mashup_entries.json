The pitch--a fictional retro game collection consisting of 50 full-fledged retro-style games, all connected with sequel iteration and a winding meta-narrative--was impressive from the first moment I heard about it. I <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ufo-50-review-space-shuttle-discovery/1900-6418288/\">loved the game</a> when I reviewed it last year, and it ranked highly on my list of the year's favorites.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But even still, I wasn't prepared for how UFO 50 would follow me into this year with ritualistic regularity.

When Sonic the Hedgehog broke out on the Sega Genesis, I couldn't help but compare it to Mario's platforming to measure the similarities and differences. So I have to admit that it's difficult to approach an arcade kart racer like Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds without Mario Kart in the back of my head--especially since that series just had a new entry this summer. But it's that contrast that really makes CrossWorlds stand out in some positive ways. Whereas Nintendo's latest racer excelled due to its simplicity, CrossWorlds offers a massive wealth of options and customization to help you find and craft your own style. There is a <em>lot</em> going on, and it can be a little overwhelming, but ultimately the level of depth rewards experimentation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">From the start, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds offers three main offline modes, two of which need little introduction: G",
