        "description": "Josh brings out his beloved 3.5 Chaos Space Marines Codex to unleash the terror of the Night Lords, complete with shrieking maniacs, stealth adepts, and a healthy dose of questionable reserve rolls. Across the battlefield, Cory\u2019s Imperial Fists arrive in shining yellow armor with more tanks than sense, backed up by the indomitable presence of Captain Lysander himself.\n\nThe mission is Patrol, which means both armies start with almost nothing on the table and spend the early turns trickling in reinforcements like latecomers to a convention hall. What follows is a classic 4th edition escalation slugfest: lascannons firing into smoke, dreadnoughts lurching into the fray, and bolters doing their very best against anything in Terminator armor. Josh\u2019s Night Lords lean into their sneaky fluff, while Cory\u2019s Fists embody the Codex Astartes\u2019 love for redundancy and overwhelming armor. The dice, however, have their own plans.\n\nOld school rules, swingy reserve rolls, and plenty of retro hobby vibe",
