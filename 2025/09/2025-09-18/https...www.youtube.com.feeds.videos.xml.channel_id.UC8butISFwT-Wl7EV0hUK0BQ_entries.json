        "description": "When it comes to securing ASP.NET applications, authentication and authorization play key roles. Authentication verifies a user\u2019s identity by checking their credentials, while authorization verifies a user\u2019s roles. This video provides an overview of token-based authentication, contrasting it with cookie-based methods. Learn how tokens and refresh tokens function, why token-based systems offer enhanced security with shorter expiration times, and the process of generating new tokens. This course is perfect for understanding secure data access in web applications.\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course from @DotNetHow \n\n\ud83d\udcbb Code\n- Beginning: https://github.com/etrupja/securing-aspnet-apps\n- Final: https://github.com/etrupja/securing-aspnet-apps-final\n\nLearn more from Ervis and get coupons for his other courses: https://dotnethow.net/freecodecamp\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Support for this channel comes from our friends at Scrimba \u2013 the coding platform that's reinvented interactive learning: https://scrimba.com/freecodecamp\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Chapters \u2b50\ufe0f\n",
