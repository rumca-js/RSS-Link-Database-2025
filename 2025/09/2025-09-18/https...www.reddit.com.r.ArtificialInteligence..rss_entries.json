We all know large language models (LLMs) are the big thing, but I\u2019m curious if anyone sees value in using smaller, domain-specific language models (SLMs) that are fine-tuned just for one niche or industry. Instead of using a big general model that\u2019s more expensive and has a bunch of capabilities you might not even need, would you prefer something smaller and more focused? Just trying to see if there&#39;s interest in models that do one thing really well for a given domain rather than a huge model that tries to do everything.

How on earth does an AI <em>know</em> about a physical feature it wasn&#39;t shown? Is this a one-in-a-billion coincidence, a random digital artifact that happened to be correct, or is something else going on?</p> <p>My theory is that perhaps its <strong>Cross-Referencing.</strong> Its scraping the web for other photos of the user to build a more complete &quot;model&quot; of them?</p> <p>Honestly speaking I feel that AI has the entire profile mapped via the social media profiles.
