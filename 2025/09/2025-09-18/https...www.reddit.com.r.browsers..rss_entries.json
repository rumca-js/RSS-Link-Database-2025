Could you please suggest options and also clarify when it\u2019s safe to sign in and when you should stay signed out? I really like Brave (the ad-free one).</p> <p>Also: should I use Tor? I already sometimes use a VPN for especially sensitive sites.</p> <p>But aside from that, for everyday browsing, what browsers do you recommend so that my searches don\u2019t leave a trace of my digital identity? Please suggest based on the most crucial privacy features.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/uriahLys\"> /u/uriahLys </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1nk3xy8/privacy_browser_for_iphone_android_and_mac/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1nk3xy8/privacy_browser_for_iphone_android_and_mac/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I really like Brave&#39;s interface and speed, but lately I&#39;ve been running into issues with some websites not fully blocking ads, and certain trackers or recommendations might still appear. So, I had to switch.</p> <p>Over time, FAB is generally pretty good. At least I haven&#39;t encountered a site where it can&#39;t block ads. It&#39;s also more lightweight than Brave and doesn&#39;t have as many bells and whistles. Since I don&#39;t really care about extensions or the blockchain ecosystem, this pure browser is perfect for me.</p> <p>I know you&#39;re all familiar with various browsers, so if anyone knows or has better recommendations, please let me know! (I&#39;ll stick with FAB until I find something better.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/freeadblock_browser\"> /u/freeadblock_browser </a",
