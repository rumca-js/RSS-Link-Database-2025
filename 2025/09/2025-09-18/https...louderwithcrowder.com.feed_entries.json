We\u2019re going to give you three stories to keep your eye on. Jimmy Kimmel has been pre-empted. You know what time it is. With the \u201ccancellation\u201d of Jimmy Kimmel, the Left is attempting to label anyone on the right who is celebrating the cancellation as hypocrites, but actually, these two things are not the same. It\u2019s almost like the Left doesn\u2019t know the difference between legal and illegal. President Donald Trump is in the fallen state of the United Kingdom this week. The Left is attempting to claim that he is disrespecting King Charles. But, isn\u2019t the Left the party of No Kings?
