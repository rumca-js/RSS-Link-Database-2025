For google drive I think I will go with pcloud the life time subscription is a really important thing for me but I need to know if it supports automatic backups for phone and mail, for mail I think protonmail, for search engine I use ecosia and for browser I use brave, I also need somthink for passwords, play store, and VPN. If ther is something with option of lifetime subscription it would be lovely. Thanks in advance for any advices. Edit. I would also like to move away from Android, I have OnePlus 10T but I haven&#39;t try anything yet, I don&#39;t want to do something wrong.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/maciejjuejeu\"> /u/maciejjuejeu </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1nkefvo/google_replacement_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://",
