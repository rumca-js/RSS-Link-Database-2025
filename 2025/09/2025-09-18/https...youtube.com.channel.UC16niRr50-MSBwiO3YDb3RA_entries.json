        "description": "Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has told the BBC in an exclusive interview that he has \"no relationship\" with US President Donald Trump.\n \nLula has frequently criticised Trump, but this is the clearest signal yet that he thinks communication between him and his US counterpart is now broken.\n \nEven though the US has a trade surplus with Brazil, Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods in July. He cited the trial on coup charges of Brazil's right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro as a trigger. Lula described the tariffs as \"eminently political\".\n \nThe two leaders have never spoken directly to each other. Trump has previously said that Lula can \"call him anytime\" - but Lula insisted that members of the Trump Administration \"do not want to talk\".\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog \n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n \n#Brazil #US #BBCNews",
