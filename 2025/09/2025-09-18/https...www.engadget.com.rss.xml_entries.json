These boards split, tilt and/or angle the keys in so your shoulders and chest feel more open and your forearms and wrists stay aligned.<br><br>Some ergonomic keyboards are fully split, some are unibody split (Alice designs). Some use a columnar orientation, have thumb clusters and take advantage of programmable keys.
