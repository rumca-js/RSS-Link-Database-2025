        "description": "ZipWall reusable dust barrier tips\u2026I\u2019m remodeling this bathroom and want to seal off the work site. The ZipWll ZipSheet is a great option because it\u2019s big, reusable, and has a built-in zipper door. When combined with a few poles this sets up fast and keeps dust out of the rest of the home. Many thanks to ZipWall for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#dustbarriersystem #zipwall #homeremodel #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
