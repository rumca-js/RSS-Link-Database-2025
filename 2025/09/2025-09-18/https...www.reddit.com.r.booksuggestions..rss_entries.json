For years now I have been curious to find a series of books I read in middle school or early high school, so around 2009/10/11 most likely. I believe the cover of one was a photo of a moon, and I think there were at least 3 books in this series. It was for young adults, obviously, and was from the point of view of a young girl. She had her mother and father and I think a brother. Sadly the only real details I remember are that the skies were covered with ash and smoke so it was cold, something about gathering firewood, and one day she sort of breaks and downs a whole bag of chocolate chips her parents were saving to give her on her birthday.

I just finished The Count of Monte Cristo, the unabridged version. I can easily say it was the most enjoyable and fantastic book I&#39;ve ever read. Nothing has really come close, imho. The character development, short chapters that switch back and forth among different scenes, timelines, relationship dynamics, and complete closure at the end...</p> <p>What should I read next that matches the same pace, structure, historical context (I do love to travel, so the scenes in France, Italy, etc. were the cherry on top). </p> <p>Are there other books you can recommend? Not necessarily the same author or genre. I don&#39;t believe I would want to read Les Miserables, tbh. Even if it&#39;s more contemporary authors or settings, that&#39;s fine with me. </p> <p>Thanks for any suggestions. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",

I understand that this is a fairly broad topic. To narrow things down a little, I\u2019d like to steer my argument towards more of an anthropological perspective. I\u2019d like to discuss how our will to not murder might have come from a primitive survival instinct to become allies with others.

I have never read a spy novel in my life, but I read a few fantasy books where that is a major plot point (I&#39;m currently halfway through Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson and I am delighted about the parts involving that). Escape from New York is my comfort film exactly for this reason and I also like pulpy science-fiction. If somebody knows a science-fiction book that involves a character having to infiltrate somewhere, preferrably a stand-alone, I would love for a suggestion. The plot does not have to stay focused on the stealth part but it has to be an important plotpoint. I would like something that has a bit (or also a ton) of lore to the setting and characters, and some angst and violence, but which is still fast-paced and gripping.

I would prefer not a romance novel, but am fine with a book that includes romance. Give me your favorite happy, breezy, easy reads! I also love pulpy crime fiction (think Elmore Leonard), so even a not too intense crime read would be fun.

I read a poor translation of The Piano Teacher but still enjoyed it, and I\u2019m reading Malina currently and still hungering for more already. Maybe notable to add that I loved Days of Abandonment by Ferrante too. I love the protagonists and journeying through their deeply motivated spirals and the kind of psychoanalytical edge to their choices and struggles. I love the madness, and frenetic and insecure styles of description. I hope that that\u2019s adequate explanation of my tastes. I guess I like books that only Isabelle Huppert could act out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/girlbryanferry\"> /u/girlbryanferry </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1njusfl/if_i_liked_malina_by_bachmann_and_the_piano/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1njusfl/if_i_liked_malina_by_bachmann_and_the_piano/\">[com",
