Problem one: Waydroid works on Wayland and I am on Mint. Well fuck. I found a way to run it via Weston. Easy enough? Noooooo. For some reason, it showed communication errors. Spent 2 days tryna fix it. In the end, made it work (even had to use Timeshift but whatever). Then the Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t work, device is not verified. Another day gone to hell. Finally, after 3 days, I thought now I can enjoy my game. Shi ran at 30 fpy (frames per year). So my first thought was: ahh obviously I have an iGPU, must be that. Searched around a bit more, found a script that lets you choose your GPU. Ran the script, yada yada yada. I open the game again\u2014still 30 fpy. Me confused. Me do more Google. Well guess what, Waydroid says: \u201cfk u Nvidia users, have fun with your software rendering.\u201d Hahaha. (I know Nvidia Mesa is the problem but still, fk u Jensen Hago).</p> <p>Now what ",

I have an older laptop from 2017 with a GeForce GTX 1050 Mobile GPU and im using the recommended Nvidia drivers. Other games I&#39;ve tested on my laptop work fine, but CK3 does not and this is an absolute deal breaker for me as it is my favorite game on pc and it ran perfectly fine on windows but it crashes everytime I start it up on linux, and no fix seems to work. A common solution I&#39;ve found online is to launch it without going through the paradox launcher by using the terminal but that does not work for me as the game loads but never makes it to the start menu before freezing my entire computer and forcing me to shut down with the power button. I was wondering if anyone can help me find a solution as I might have to go back to windows which I dont want to do. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mouldy_Oranges\"> /u/",

Like a software mouse, as in it lags when my game lags. I tried different versions of Proton and the latest GE seems to almost work (it works half of the time) in Guild Wars 2 (the game I was testing with) (it actually works in fullscreen, bugging only in borderless). Anyone knows any fix?

Installation was relatively smooth but when launching the game I noticed that my FPS, despite being high at ~123, was incredibly choppy with my screen stuttering severely while turning the camera. </p> <p>While scrolling through my phone idly I found a thread somewhere that suggested to try closing the ESO launcher in the background (I cannot find this thread again so sorry for not giving credit). After closing the ESO launcher in the background, ESO&#39;s FPS became super smooth. I do not know why this fixes the issue, but it was a surprisingly simple fix and I wanted to try to make it more visible for people in the future.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CappucinoJack\"> /u/CappucinoJack </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/commen",
