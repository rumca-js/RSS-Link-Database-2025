        "description": "One of the exciting elements of Intel's Xeon 6 Granite Rapids launch last year was introducing support for MRDIMMs alongside DDR5-6400 memory support. After the Xeon 6900P series debut I posted some of the first independent DDR5-6400 vs. MRDIMM-8800 benchmarks. One year later, today is a fresh look at the DDR5-6400 vs. MRDIMM-8800 performance for Granite Rapids with new/updated benchmarks, the latest Linux software improvements, and also looking at the impact on power and thermals of MRDIMM memory.",
