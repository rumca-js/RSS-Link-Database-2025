A big one for me is Twitter/X since I got years of posts that don\u2019t reflect who I am anymore and id like to clean em up.</p> <p>I know there are a bunch of tweet delete tools and scripts out there but im torn. On one hand, they save hours of manual work. On the other hand, granting full account access to a third party app feels like a huge privacy trade-off. Some even keep logs or archives im not sure id want to be living on someone else\u2019s server.</p> <p>For those of you who\u2019ve actually gone through this:</p> <ul> <li><p>Did you use a third-party tool, open-source script or just delete manually?</p></li> <li><p>How did you decide it was safe to grant account access (if you did)?</p></li> <li><p>Did you make a local backup of your tweets before removing them?</p></li> <li><p>Any issues with account locks or weird behavior after mass deletion?</p></li> </",
