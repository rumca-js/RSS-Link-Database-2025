I have a NUC (16GB RAM, i5-7300U CPU @ 2.60GHz) that runs Zorin distro and I run a bunch of self-hosted apps in docker (Nextclound, mealie, Home assistant, Joplin etc). Zorin is installed because sometimes I like to remotely connect and use it as a remote desktop machine for general browsing while away, and I find it easier to set up stuff with GUI. I have a bunch of automations around the house through HA, but it is not a full experience as it is not the full HAOS.</p> <p>I was wondering if it is better to run Proxmox on my NUC and have full HAOS rather than running it in docker? Can I run a separate VM with Ubuntu Mate or other lightweight distro for the occasional browsing? Would that be a better solution?

However, the folder from which it sources the files is &quot;invisible&quot; in the container console. I don&#39;t understand how this is possible as Jellyfin is streaming movies from that folder. I have tried many workarounds like UID/GID mapping using <a href=\"https://www.apalrd.net/posts/2023/tip_idmap/\">this</a> but it still does not work. I can see this folder with all its contents on the host but cannot see it on the container. The only reason that this is an issue for me is because I am trying to use samba or another service like copyparty to send files to my server from my desktop. However, I am unable to do this if I cannot see the folder. User: &quot;brady&quot; is b",

After struggling with this for a while, I gave up.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a better alternative where full-article fetching is reliable (ideally default)?<br/> The most important thing for me is support for both web and Android, synced together.</p> <p>Thanks a lot in advance! \ud83d\ude4f</p",
