The park covers an area of almost 80 acres, with approximately 7 million flower bulbs planted each year.\n \nThe Keukenhof is open for eight weeks, from mid-March to mid-May, with mid-April generally being the best time to see the tulips in full bloom. It\u2019s a brief window to witness such a spectacular display, so every visit feels truly special.",
