One was right click (b button) on the exe and look for launch game. I don&#39;t see this. It just matches what would be on my pc. The other method was to open the hidden options from the VD taskbar, I assume the one with the keyboard option, and then select inject and find the exe. I see no such hidden options.

My pc specs are: RTX 3070, Intel Core i7 11700f, 32 gb ram DDR4. My SteamVR doesnt work per oculus wired link. If i try to open it it always says &quot;error code 309, key components missing&quot; i&#39;ve verified the files on SteamVR and reinstalled it, still doesnt work. If i use ALVR wired, it does connect and work, though it only outputs a greenscreen to my quest 3. It also actually renders the SteamVR environment with no problems, i can see it if i look onto my desktop and click the buttons to see what im supposed to be seeing on SteamVR. Thing is: i&#39;ve used SteamVR flawlessly with oculus Link and ALVR. Its just that after returning to ALVR and using SteamVR, after 2-3 sessions those issues started. Im using the latest SteamVR and ALVR, downloaded ALVR for both windows and quest from the launcher for windows. If you want to know more about my problem, please ",

I want to get a Meta Quest 3 and do Wireless PCVR. I have an RX 7800 XT, Ryzen 7 5700X3D. I mainly do Sim racing. However, I got to play around with the Quest 3 eco system and I want one now. I&#39;m coming from an HTC Vive Cosmos Elite. What do you recommend? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RegularStrawberry7\"> /u/RegularStrawberry7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1npwnbx/diminishing_returns_for_gpus/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1npwnbx/diminishing_returns_for_gpus/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019m working on a concept inspired by Norse mythology \u2014 think realms like Asgard, Midgard, Jotunheim, and encounters with creatures from the Eddas.</p> <p>The big question is: what type of gameplay would you find most exciting in this setting?</p> <pre><code>1. Combat-heavy experience \u2013 battles against giants, Valkyries, mythic beasts (fast, action-packed, almost \u201cGod of War\u201d vibes in VR). 2. Exploration/narrative adventure \u2013 walking through mythological realms, interacting with gods, uncovering lore, and making story choices. 3. Puzzle + rune-based gameplay \u2013 solving rune challenges, unlocking magical artifacts, and progressing through mythic trials. </code></pre> <p>I want to shape this around what VR players actually want to play, not just what sounds cool on paper.</p> <p>- Which of these directions excites you most?

So I was able to use sidequest to help with my resolution, how my game looks but I wasn\u2019t able to get better fps which is what i really want. I\u2019m not sure if I had the wrong configurations or something but can anyone tell me how to get that fps I want wether it be on the sidequest vr app or not?
