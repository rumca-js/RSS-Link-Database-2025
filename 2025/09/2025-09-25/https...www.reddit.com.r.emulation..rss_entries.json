First of all, with the proliferation of ARM-based notebook computers, we\u2019re going to try offering binary packages for people running 64-bit ARM versions of Windows 10 or later. Please be aware that most MAME developers are still using x86-64 systems, so you may encounter issues specific to ARM systems (this goes for people running MAME on Apple M series CPUs and ARM-based Linux systems as well). When reporting issues, remember to specify the operating system and CPU family. And speaking of ARM CPUs, we\u2019ve fixed a few lurking bugs in the 64-bit ARM recompiler back-end and improved performance a bit more. Emulated systems with Hitachi SuperH and Hyperstone E1 CPUs should benefit.</p> <p>There are some big software list updates this month, with lots of original floppy and cassette dumps and modern homebrew releases added.
