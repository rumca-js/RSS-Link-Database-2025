This is why AH and Sleeping Gods have intrigued me. My only issues with them is that I feel AH might not have enough replay ability whereas Sleeping Gods I probably won\u2019t be able to keep it set up for long enough.</p> <p>I\u2019m curious as to which of these games people generally prefer and would recommend or, if you have any other suggestions that\u2019s also appreciated, thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Apprehensive_Form_73\"> /u/Apprehensive_Form_73 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1nq1l8k/2_player_game_spirit_island_ah_sleeping_gods_or/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardg",
