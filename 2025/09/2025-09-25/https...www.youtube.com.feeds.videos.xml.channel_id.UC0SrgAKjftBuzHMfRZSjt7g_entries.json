But what if I told you that one of its key inspirations came from a lesser-known Hong Kong film \u2014 Ringo Lam\u2019s City on Fire?\n\nIn this video essay, we\u2019ll break down the origins of Reservoir Dogs, explore Tarantino\u2019s meta-cinema, and analyze how he transformed elements of City on Fire into something entirely new. From the infamous warehouse to the tragic undercover cop story, this is a dive into homage, reinvention, and the thin line between influence and imitation.\n\nIf you\u2019re into film history, crime movies, or just want to understand why Reservoir Dogs remains so iconic, this deep dive is for you.\n\n#ReservoirDogs #QuentinTarantino #CityOnFire #FilmAnalysis #CrimeCinema #Tarantino #HongKongCinema #VideoEssay #IndependentFilm #MovieAnalysis",
