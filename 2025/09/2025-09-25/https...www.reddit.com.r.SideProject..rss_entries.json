The idea of working a normal 9\u20135 job doesn\u2019t really excite me, I\u2019d much rather build something of my own.

It\u2019s a website security scanner that helps check for vulnerabilities before hackers do. Basically you put in your site\u2019s URL and it runs a scan for common issues like SQL injections, XSS, CSRF, missing security headers, outdated software, etc. It also looks at speed and performance (Core Web Vitals) so you get the full picture.</p> <p>At the end you get a clear report with explanations and recommendations. The quick scan runs in under a minute, and if you want a deeper audit you can order a more detailed one that takes up to a couple of days. It\u2019s safe to use and only checks publicly available stuff, so it won\u2019t break anything on your site.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve got a site and want to see how secure it is, give it a try: <a href=\"https://vulnaly.com\">https://vulnaly.com</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rema",

Out of curiosity I checked something shared here on Reddit (by <strong>Poyoarya</strong>) and gave it a shot. To my surprise, within just a few days I managed to pull in around $600, which was exactly what I needed to cover my apartment</p> <p>I\u2019m still a student and not rolling in cash, so for me this was huge. I\u2019ve tried side gigs before food delivery, tutoring, surveys and they never really made a dent. This time, it actually worked and gave me some breathing room</p> <p>The main lesson? Don\u2019t ignore small experiments. Even if you doubt they\u2019ll work, sometimes they turn out to be the exact thing you need. If I hadn\u2019t tried, I\u2019d still be stressing about rent right now</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cloudeman\"> /u/cloudeman </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
