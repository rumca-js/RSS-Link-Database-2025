        "description": "The Tsunami of content slop online... is self defeating. As companies perfect massive spam operations for podcasts, shorts, regular videos and personalities, the effect is that people retract from watching or trusting that type of content, in a cycle that will lead to the bursting of a massive tech bubble unlike anything we have seen in years. \n\nThankfully the trend of spam that has taken over practically every user generated content feed, created by people using AI tools to inundate the online world with garbage, is receding. In the Gartner hype cycle, we are closing in fast on the stage of total disillusionment. \n\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https://linktr.ee/upperechelonse",
