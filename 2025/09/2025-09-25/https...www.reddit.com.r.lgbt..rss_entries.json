We\u2019ve been together since 8th grade, and I love him. We first got intimate when we were 18, after he opened up about his desires. I was fine with it. It\u2019s hard for me to feel sexual attraction, but I still do things with him because I\u2019m emotionally attracted to him. He gave me time, respected my boundaries, and never forced anything\u2026 even though he\u2019s straight. He genuinely loves me\u2026</p> <p>Now here\u2019s the catch: people assume that if I\u2019m fine being sexual with him, I must be fine doing that with anyone. Bruh, no. I\u2019m EMOTIONALLY ATTRACTED TO HIM ONLY. That\u2019s it. But then people I call or used to call my friends asked for nudes, as if I should be comfortable with that just because I don\u2019t \u201cfeel attraction\u201d in the same way others do, so sending nudes should mean nothing to me. The assumptions are wild. Some even tell me I\u2019m ruining his life, can\u2019",

In the first two months \u2014 from when we started dating up until we made it official \u2014 we were super passionate. Honestly, we\u2019d hook up like four times a week and things were pretty wild. We even used a couple of toys together and it was fun.But recently, I\u2019ve noticed a shift. She doesn\u2019t seem as eager, and I found out she\u2019s started using toys on her own instead. The other night, while she was asleep, I (stupidly, I know) looked at her phone and discovered she\u2019d downloaded some kind of AI voice \u201clover\u201d app. It seems like phone sex but with AI \u2014 you can pick different story scenarios and voices. WTF\u2026</p> <p>Now I can\u2019t stop wondering: is this why she hasn\u2019t been as into being physical with me lately? She\u2019s been kind of secretive about it. On one hand, I don\u2019t mind her using it \u2014 I get that people need different outlets. But part of me is worried: is it just that the honeymoon phase is ending, ",
