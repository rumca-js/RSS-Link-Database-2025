It captures daily life on hot summer days: bicycling, tag, hopscotch, and the spray of an open fire hydrant. Connected with St. Pius V Catholic Church and School, the scenes also include school buses, supervising nuns, and lively schoolyard play equipment.\n\nVideo Restoration Process:\n\u2714 FPS boosted to 60 frames per second \n\u2714 Image resolution boosted up to HD \n\u2714 Improved video sharpness and brightness \n\u2714 Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)\n\u2714added sound only for the ambiance\n\u2714restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) \n\u2714face restoration\n\n\nB&W Video Source: Prelinger Archives \n\nPlease, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.\n\nJoin this channel to benefit from exclusive advantages and also to support us: https://www.youtube.com/channe",
