I\u2019m a die-hard fan of his and have probably read 20+ of his books, starting mostly when I was seventeen. I found them extremely funny and insightful, and most of why I put off reading The Shepherd\u2019s Crown was because I didn\u2019t want to admit there wasn\u2019t gonna be any more of the story set after that. I found the basic shape of the book very entertaining, and while I can tell it suffered from not getting the rewrites it needed before Pterry\u2019s unfortunate passing, nothing dragged it down enormously, and if anything it metatextually enhanced the themes. </p> <p>That said, I\u2019ve spent a lot of today looking up old Discworld stories, and after those and Crown, I\u2019m finding myself not liking the material as much as I did before. 80% of it is still the same, but 20% - a leading 20% - feels worse.

Twelve years \u2014 almost as long as Dante spent on <em>The Divine Comedy</em>! For this reason, I do not think the novel is merely a satire on the Soviet regime, as some read it. Bulgakov, the author of many feuilletons and stories, was perfectly capable of writing satire, and it posed no difficulty for him. I am convinced that the satirical chapters in <em>The Master</em> were the easiest for his pen. It is therefore obvious that Bulgakov sought to put into this book something far greater than satire alone.</li> <li><strong>All the Gospel events in the novel</strong> a",
