It is not clear that the companies that make custom CPUs and XPUs are saving money, but they are certainly gaining control and that is worth something.</p> <p>Arm made a push based on the power-efficient nature its architecture, and Nvidia has become a key player in AI with its powerful GPUs and now its \u201cGrace\u201d Arm server CPUs. A reinvigorated AMD has given system makers an x86 alternative to an Intel that is still trying to find its footing after a few years of missteps and missed deadlines. And now, the community for RISC-V, the open, modular, and highly customizable architecture overseen by the RISC-V International collective, is looking to make inroads into datacenters.</p> <p>It is still early days for RISC-V, much as it was for Arm in the datacenter back in 2010, but the RISC-V architecture is being emb",
