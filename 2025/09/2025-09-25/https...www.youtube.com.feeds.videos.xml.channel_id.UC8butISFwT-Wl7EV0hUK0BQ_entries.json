        "description": "Tom Mondloch quit programming after he finished community college. After a few years of odd jobs, he decided to get back into programming and discovered freeCodeCamp. \n\nHe was just learning his own way, and didn't think freeCodeCamp's linear curriculum would be worth his time. But he stuck with it, got good, and ultimately started contributing to our open source project.\n\nHe's since joined freeCodeCamp's staff and archetected freeCodeCamp's entire relational database curriculum, which you can run in your browser or right inside your VS Code editor.\n\nTom shares tips for:\n- Brushing up on your programming skills if you've taken a few years off\n- Contributing to open source\n- Using AI codegen tools sensibly and not relying too heavily on them\n\nHe also talks about the role of vocational college, his love of the outdoors, and how working remotely allows him to continue to live in small town middle America without the need to move to a big city.\n\nA huge thank you to the 10,889 kind folks wh",
