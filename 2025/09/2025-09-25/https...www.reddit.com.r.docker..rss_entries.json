First steps involves setting up the lab. <a href=\"https://github.com/stratosphereips/stratocyberlab/wiki/Running-the-StratoCyberLab-on-Windows-11\">This</a> is the link. Since I used Windows 10, I have followd most of the steps including installing WSL in Windows and installing Ubuntu using WSL. I have also installed Docker Desktop client. </p> <p>The problem is Build and Pull the docker images step. Upon running the command $docker compose build. </p> <p>The process starts after a while I&#39;m getting the error as shown in the images. I&#39;m unable to build the images. Also I have not installed the Ubuntu inside Docker, rather outside in Windows using WSL. And every time I use either powershell or cmd its always been in Admin mode. The images are in the comment section. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/srinisreddit\"> /u/srinis",
