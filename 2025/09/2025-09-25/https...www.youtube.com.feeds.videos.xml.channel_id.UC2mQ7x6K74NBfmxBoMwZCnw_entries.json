        "description": "Luka dusts off his old fourth edition rules and welcomes back Joe, who brought his classic third edition Tyranids all the way from Maryland. The two dive headfirst into an era of Warhammer 40k where instinctive behavior tables, Vox casters, and hand-written vehicle construction rules still reigned supreme. On the field, we have the endless swarms of Tyranids clashing against the disciplined ranks of the Cadians, with the occasional modern twist courtesy of a Rogal Dorn that has been shoehorned into fourth edition using Jervis Johnson\u2019s beloved \u201cbuild-a-tank\u201d rules.\n\nWhat follows is a spectacle of nostalgia, dice rolls that defy statistics, and the eternal question: did Luka bring enough bullets to stop the swarm? Joe\u2019s monstrous creations and Luca\u2019s cautious command style make for a game that feels equal parts history lesson and chaos experiment. As always, it\u2019s less about who comes out on top and more about the spectacle of seeing old rules collide with new models in the grim darknes",
