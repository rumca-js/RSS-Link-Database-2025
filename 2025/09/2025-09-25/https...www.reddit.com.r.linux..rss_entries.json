        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Bonjour. Today I&#39;ve decided to find out how many space Flatpak apps and runtimes occupy on my PC. And I&#39;ve found an unpleasant surprise. In /var/lib/flatpak the heaviest folder wasn&#39;t apps or runetime, but ~/repo/objects . More frustrating was that it all was just bloat of icons and some screenshots from flathub and not related to what I&#39;ve installed. I&#39;ve nuked the folder and everything was working, except Bazaar, it died. But all other flatpaks were fine. I&#39;ve even installed one more via Discover and it worked no problems. According to Google I&#39;m not the first one to see this bug, but I&#39;m interested in its root. Do you have bloated /var/lib/flatpak/repo/objects/, how much disk space does it take and do/did you use Bazaar?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/durbich\"> /u/durbich </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/vl7alfptwdrf1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <sp",

It has a lot of unpolished things like gui-tui install frankenstein, fish by default, strange pre-installed app list (alarcity AND konsole) and it out-of-the-box it lacks support for flatpaks (while still having the discovery app installed and pinned to the taskbar).

Stopped using Windows 11 within a month, it was insanely slow. Using Linux Mint XFCE, but the experience isn&#39;t great. Issues everywhere, and old versions or missing packages thanks to Ubuntu base. Want a non-Ubuntu Linux distro and a DE that will run good on such hardware. Not that good at Linux yet, so do not reccomend Arch or Gentoo. Use it for daily stuff, like web browsing, some YT, Reddit. Also some student work. Text editing, and some extremely light gaming (browser games). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/absolutecinemalol\"> /u/absolutecinemalol </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1npwqrh/linux_for_a_17_ghz_16_gb_ram_laptop/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1npwqrh/linux_for_a_17_ghz_16_gb_ram_laptop/\">[comments]</a>",
