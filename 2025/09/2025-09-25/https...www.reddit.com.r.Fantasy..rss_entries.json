(Maybe a plot-line they wish they had done, a controversial writing choice they made, or something they would redo if they could go back) Of course the beauty of writing is that most of these authors improve over the years, and that these \u201cmistakes\u201d often lead to growth. Still, it\u2019s kind of interesting.</p> <p>For example, after the negative reception of Crossroads of Twilight, I think Robert Jordan admitted that the choice he made regarding that book\u2019s structure was a mistake and if he could go back, he wouldn\u2019t have done it that way. (He then wrote an absolute banger of a final book before he passed away)</p> <p>I\u2019m curious if there are other examples everyone can think of, of authors discussing writing choices that they regret or would change in some way?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",

Fantasy tends to be very long and I just can&#39;t start a book that will take me six months to finish.
