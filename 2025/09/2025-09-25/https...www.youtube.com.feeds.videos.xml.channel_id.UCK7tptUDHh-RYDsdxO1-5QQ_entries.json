        "description": "Diamonds grown in a lab aren\u2019t just for jewelry; the fundamental technology is a rapidly advancing field with much broader applications. WSJ goes inside the global innovation center at Element Six, one of the world\u2019s leading synthetic diamond labs, which grows diamonds for a wide and rapidly increasing range of uses \u2014 from drill bits to medical equipment and laser components. One day, its diamonds could even be used in semiconductors, but getting there will take some significant advances.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Synthetic diamonds\n0:44 Synthesis\n3:06 Diamond structure and applications \n4:28 How defects can be used\n\nTech Behind \n'The Tech Behind' explores the amazing engineering, computing, science and algorithms that power our favorite tech.\n\n#Diamonds #Semiconductors #WSJ",
