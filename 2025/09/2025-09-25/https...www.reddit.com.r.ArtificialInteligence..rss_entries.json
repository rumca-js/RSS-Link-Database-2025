After all, our current economy is built on people working, earning wages, and then spending that income on goods and services.

Initially I liked it and it gave me a decent mix of most-played songs and genres. However, after using it for a couple of weeks, it was always the same songs playing over and over. I was kinda surprised, because my daylist and recommended mixes are usually good, so I was wondering why it wouldn\u2019t rely on those at least. I guess it was just the beginning, but I really had to stio using it as it kept playing the same stuff over and over and over\u2026</p> <p>Forward to 2-3 months and I decided to give it another go. Wow, it\u2019s actually really good now!! It started with 5 of my most played songs, then that\u2019s when it got really good! It eased me into my usual genres and started introducing tons of new songs and new artists I wasn\u2019t even aware of and they were all amazing!</p> <p>This is how I originally envisioned it to work, play my most listened to stuff as that\u2019s what I\u2019m",
