It will be playing ambient audio on a loop. (I.e. nighttime nature sounds) until it&#39;s triggered by an RFID sensor, at which point another audio sample will play (a huge gust of wind followed by silence).</p> <p>When the device is tripped, I&#39;d like for the ambient noise to quickly (but smoothly) fade out, but the second noise to start immediately, avoiding an abrupt momebt of silence between the tracks. This would leave a little overlap, which would require some real-time processing as the trigger could be tripped at any point in the loop. </p> <p>I&#39;ve made controllers using Arduino unos many times, but they&#39;re simply not capable of accomplishing this.

Even though I didn\u2019t solve the problem, I had a very good idea of what I was looking for. I know basic LINUX scripting, but want to learn more.</p> <p>So I\u2019m looking for a project that is enjoyable, tangible result, uses LINUX, and is not too frustrating.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Emotional-Abroad4455\"> /u/Emotional-Abroad4455 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1npuj5y/help_request_finding_projects_with_basic_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1npuj5y/help_request_finding_projects_with_basic_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>",
