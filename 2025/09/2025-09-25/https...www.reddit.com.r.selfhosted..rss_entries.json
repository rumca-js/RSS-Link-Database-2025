I am using a cloudflare tunnel. I have the same sites monitored remotely as well using Uptime Robot and Uptime Robot reports no issues. Whenever I get a site down notification, I go to the site and it loads fine. I even decided to add <a href=\"http://amazon.com\">amazon.com</a> and it also reports amazon down intermittently every few minutes. This only just started happening a couple days ago and it has been running flawlessly for months before that. Any ideas whats going on or what I should do to troubleshoot? I have the latest stable release of Uptime Kuma but also upgraded to the beta just to see if anything changed and it didn&#39;t.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Lunch-1560\"> /u/Ok-Lunch-1560 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted",

(example - jellyfin.domain.com).<br/> The issue I am facing is that the speed at which my services open up and even tasks are performed in them is significantly slower over a cloudflare tunnel as compared to using a not-secure public-ip:port.</p> <p>I understand the security risks of using an http connection over the internet and leaving ports open to my network. But the difference in speed really gets annoying when it comes to already heavy and slower containers like nextcloud.</p> <p>It is worth noting that I am using NextDNS all the time with my PC running docker (to access geo-blocked indexer sites). Does that impact speed when it comes to cloudflare tunnels? Also, my internet plan is 200mbps up and down for anyone wondering.</p> ",
