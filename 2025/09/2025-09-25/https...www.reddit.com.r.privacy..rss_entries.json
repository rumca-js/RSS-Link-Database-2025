They had a short clickbait video about it, that showed footage of the robbery (linked here: <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/us/video/armed-robbery-california-jewelry-store-vrtc\">https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/24/us/video/armed-robbery-california-jewelry-store-vrtc</a>) ...but what really stuck out to me was the end of the video when all the thieves ran outside to their vehicles and made their getaway at the same time.</p> <p>My first thought was how lucky it was that there is a skyscraper right there to catch that on video. But, I thought I&#39;d check. I found the business on Google Maps, and found the location seen in the getaway video via streetview.
