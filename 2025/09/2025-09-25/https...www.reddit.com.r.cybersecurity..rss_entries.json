Honestly, for me and myself I think certifications are the better path but that is due to what I want to do and where I want to end up. However that doesn\u2019t mean that certifications are for everyone. Some people are better suited for what they want career wise to get a masters since the roles they want a masters in cyber will get them further than an entry level cert say a sec+. What are everyone else\u2019s opinions on this? Do you think it\u2019s masters is always the best or does it depend on your goals you want? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/phillies1989\"> /u/phillies1989 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1npves1/masters_vs_certifications_what_is_your_opinion/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1npves1/masters_vs_ce",
