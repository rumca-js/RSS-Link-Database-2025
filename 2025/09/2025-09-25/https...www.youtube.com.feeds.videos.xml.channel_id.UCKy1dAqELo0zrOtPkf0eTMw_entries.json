With a strong lead in Atsu as a vigilante who does not care about honor in her quest for revenge, you get a stronger lead character and an expanded toolset that elevates the principles set by Tsushima. Although the novelty has lost a bit of its sheen, the Kurosawa imitation is still strong and used to great effect. So while it may not be transforming open world games, Ghost of Yotei is a superb distillation of the samurai fantasy.",
