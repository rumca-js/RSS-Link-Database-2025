I am looking for books where there is a female lead character. I don&#39;t want a children or teenager but rather one that has already &quot;lived&quot;. I am looking for a story where romance can exist but I would hate for it to be the point. Ideally the lead is not all mighty, has a lot of flaws, she could almost be as hated as admired. I would really love to read about morally grey female leads and/or one where she suffers and overcome whatever is thrown at her with her wits (yes I love Mulan). I don&#39;t know if that helps but I love the bene gesserit from the Dune universe specifically the 5 and 6th books.
