Two of them I know, as they are facing the camera and are ancestors of mine. It&#39;s also why I can confirm this photo was taken sometime between 1947 and 1957, probably in Tanzania. The man on the far right was a physician with the Canadian foreign service and was stationed in Dar-es-Salaam during those years. The woman in the centre, his wife, was my great aunt. But the two people whose backs are to the camera, I&#39;m not sure of. Does anyone know who they might be?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; ",
