        "description": "HoldRite fixture outlet box tips\u2026I need to install shutoff valves and these fixture outlet boxes are fantastic. The valve is pre-installed to the box flange which can then be fastened to the 170 bracket. Debris covers protect the valves from being damaged and escutcheon covers screw into the box flange after drywall installation. Many thanks to HoldRite for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#plumbing #holdritesolutions #bathroomremodel #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
