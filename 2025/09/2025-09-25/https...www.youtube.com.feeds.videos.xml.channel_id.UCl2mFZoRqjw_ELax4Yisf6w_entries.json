This means you'll hear one person in your left ear and the other in your right ear.\nIf this bothers you, you can enable mono audio on your device:\niPhone/iPad: Settings \u2192 Accessibility \u2192 Audio/Visual \u2192 toggle on \"Mono Audio\"\nAndroid: Settings \u2192 Accessibility \u2192 Hearing \u2192 toggle on \"Mono audio\" (exact path varies by manufacturer)\nThere's actually a small benefit to this setup - if both people talk over each other, you can mentally tune into whichever conversation you want to follow. But I get it, it's not ideal for most people.\nThe edited version of this video will have proper mono audio so both voices come through both ears normally. For now, the raw stream is what it is ",
