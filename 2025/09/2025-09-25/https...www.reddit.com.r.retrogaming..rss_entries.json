I managed to get GameCube and PS2 games to load, but it&#39;s super limited by the internal graphics. I&#39;ve been seeing some videos online of people successfully connecting older AMD graphics cards and running games with ease! I think I want to tackle this as my next project, but I could really use some tips and advice from the community. I&#39;m super new to coding and emulation, but I&#39;m a quick learner and eager to give it a shot! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Log-9225\"> /u/Fantastic-Log-9225 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1nqbpl6/pi_5_gpu_project_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1nqbpl6/pi_5_gpu_project_help/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It was fun but a bit laggy with all the roms on it and could&#39;nt play systems past ps1/n64.<br/> So right now i bought the <strong>Ayaneo AM02 Retro PC</strong>. Strong enought to play AAA PC games and Switch games, looks like a small NES and i can use it for many things too because it run on Windows.<br/> I want it to become a real plug-and-play retro console, or almost plug-and-play. I want to just plug it into any monitors or TV and play retro games with friends, without the need of a mouse and keyboard to boot Retrobat, EmulationStation or LaunchBox. I know there is a feature on windows to auto-boot software, so could auto-boot frontends and then play, but it takes times and doesnt feel like a real &quot;console&quot;, because of the windows logo, login, etc. What is the best solution for me? Does Batocera is the best solution for me? Do i need to change m",

Not only did PlayStation allow for more mature games into the market, but more cinematic and graphicly outstanding looking games.</p> <p>So my question stems from what if the PlayStation was just never developed? What if for some reason or another Sony just decides &quot;fuck it&quot; and just does nothing about their falling out with Nintendo.</p> <p>Could the other less successful consoles get more of a spotlight? Could the Sega Saturn have seen the giants of Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII? Would the Nintendo 64DD become available in the west? Would Microsoft have even bothered to join the console wars in the 2000s?</p> <p>What do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/StarCode5000\"> /u/StarCode5000 </a> <br/",

I did disassemble the console and boil the pin connector in water and vinegar as well. It really feels like more of an accomplishment than it probably should. </p> <p>Im wondering if anyone knows what it is glowing through the top cover on the back right corner. Never noticed that before.
