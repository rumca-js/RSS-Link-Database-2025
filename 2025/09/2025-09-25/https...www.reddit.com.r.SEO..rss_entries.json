These sites were just publishing quality opinion content, even when it wasn\u2019t political.</p> <p>Now, with data released by the U.S. House of Representatives, it\u2019s clear that Google\u2019s algorithm changes had a significant impact on YouTube content. While the report focuses on YouTube, I personally think this could also indicate similar effects on website search results.</p> <p>I always felt that Google\u2019s E-E-A-T and HCU guidelines were more like a \u201csmoke screen\u201d to justify why certain content was ranked lower.</p> <p>With this perspective, I\u2019m wondering: could there be legal consequences? Or is this just how the algorithm plays out for both YouTube and search results?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/meuga",
