It told the story of three generations of women in 20th-century China \u2013 Chang\u2019s grandmother, her mother and herself \u2013 and became one of the most popular nonfiction books in history, selling more than <a href=\"https://www.jungchang.net/wild-swans?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">13m copies in 37 languages</a> and collecting a&nbsp;fistful of awards and commendations.
