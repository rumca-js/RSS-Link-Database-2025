But instead of success, she finds herself facing sinister presences and uncovering the cursed past that haunts the village.\n\nThe game, enriched by original statues from Italian sculptor Bruno Lucchi, blends realistic visuals with stylized low-poly sequences, and was developed in consultation with a psychologist to ensure genuine emotional depth.\n\nHideki: \u201cTime flows in its own way in Kirisame Mura.\u201d\n\n#ps5 #ps5games #brokenlore",
