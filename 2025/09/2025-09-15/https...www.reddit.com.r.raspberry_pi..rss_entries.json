For the temp sensor, sitting here at room temp I get a raw output of around 848. Both of these values jump around 40+/- unit or so, as I take constant measurements of them. I understand ADC readings aren&#39;t very stable and its normal to have constant fluctuations, that&#39;s fine, but I can&#39;t figure out how to scale them properly.
