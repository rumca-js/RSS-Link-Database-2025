        "description": "Note: The NPS Museum Conservation Lab's future is uncertain; it had its lease canceled by Doge, then extended by one year only. \n\nAdam Savage LOVES taxidermy, so THIS stop was a highlight of his visit to the National Park Service Museum Conservation Lab! Organic objects conservator Fran Ritchie takes Adam through some of the techniques and challenges that she and her team face as they begin treatment on a collection of mammal taxidermy mounts from the William Floyd Estate at Fire Island National Seashore. Taxidermy conservation is a lesser-known specialty in the field of museum conservation, and what was supposed to be a five-minute conversation became almost 34 minutes instead! \n\nNational Park Museum Conservation Lab: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/hfc/museum-conservation-services.htm\nNational Park Service: https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\nWhere America\u2019s Historical Artifacts Are Being Preserved (Well ...
