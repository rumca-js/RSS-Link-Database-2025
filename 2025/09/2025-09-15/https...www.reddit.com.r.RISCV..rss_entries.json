The professor is focusing on assembly language programming and will teach the following topics:</p> <ol> <li><p>Data representation in memory.</p></li> <li><p>Using arithmetic and logical instructions.</p></li> <li><p>Working with stacks, functions, and parameter passing.</p></li> </ol> <p>Therefore, I&#39;d like a lot of programming challenges (exercises), as I believe they will help me solidify these theoretical concepts.</p> <p>Do you know of any communities, websites, or GitHub repositories that offer these challenges?</p> <p>I&#39;d greatly appreciate your help!</p> </div><!-",
