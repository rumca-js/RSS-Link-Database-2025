The game looks like a seesaw (maybe black or dark purple). Each side of the seesaw has divisions on it, and inside each small rectangle is a light. Think of a Hershey bar and how it&#39;s divided into those breakable rectangles, just make them horizontal. I believe the object of the game was to draw a category (ex: zoo animals) and then take turns naming something in that category until someone ran out of ideas. The red lights would light up as time passed, and each time the sound went up a note and got faster. If you couldn&#39;t think of something and flip the seesaw to the other side, you&#39;d lose the round. The game even kept score; at the end of the round, the red lights would blink on both sides showing how many rounds each side had won. </p> <p>It was NOT Tilt &#39;n&#39; Shout.

Gold is used to buy new unit cards, attack is used to attack other players, neutral cities and citadels (they generate extra influence) and enemies, influence is used to buy neutral units and cities.</p> <p>Another unusual for a deckbuilder feature is everyone being asymmetrical since the very start; all units have various interesting abilities. For example, undead likes to spam skeletons and skeleton archers, elves generate a lot of influence and spend it on useful abilities, demons Uthuk wound or even destroy both allied and enemy units.</p> <p>Rune Age also has very different scenarios, something to fit everyone`s tastes: there is a scenario with active PvP, with less active PvP and PvE (against powerful bosses dragonlords), pure PvE coop, competition without direct interaction. Sadly, there is only one scenario",
