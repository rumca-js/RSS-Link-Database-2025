        "description": "Gen V really hit the ground running in Season 1, and Season 2 doesn\u2019t entirely continue that momentum right out of the gate. There\u2019s certainly a jarring disconnect in the early episodes of Season 2, as the series steps back from the status quo teased last time around and returns to the traditional college setting. But the series only improves as it moves forward and deepens the drama for Marie and her circle of wannabe superhero friends.
