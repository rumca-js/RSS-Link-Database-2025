And since the format is a timestamp basically, they are nicely listed in chronological order all the time.</p> <p>However some manufacturers tend to separate the file type by using &quot;IMG&quot; or &quot;VID&quot; before the timestamp (e.g. IMG_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS) making it impossible to see both photos and videos in chronological order if they are both in the same folder.</p> <p>I am fully aware that some apps can list the photos/videos chronologically using the &quot;Date Taken&quot; metadata, but not all of them have this capability so for me personally, having the filename start with the timestamp was and is a lifesaver.</p> <p>What is your approach when you have mixed &quot;formats&q",
