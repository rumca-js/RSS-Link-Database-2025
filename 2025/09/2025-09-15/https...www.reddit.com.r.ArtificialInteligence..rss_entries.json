Sometimes agents forget there instructions, you ask connected agents to check other connected agents and they just refuse to do so and its just awful and temperamental. I was having a meeting with a data engineer this morning and we were chatting with the agent in the playground and it was working fine and then boom, it completely forgot it was connected to the AI Search tool and started giving us general knowledge instead the business knowledge it was provided.

Perfect problem-solving is blocked by inherent computational complexity, not just lack of hardware. A truly omniscient AI would require more information storage and processing capacity than the universe allows. Sensor noise and information loss mean no AI can have perfectly accurate data.
