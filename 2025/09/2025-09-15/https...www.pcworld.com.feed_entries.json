If you want to be extra safe, pick up a non-contact voltage tester to ensure the wires you\u2019ll be dealing with aren\u2019t electrified. You can find a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099SJ6469\">name-brand voltage tester on Amazon</a> for less than $20.

But it\u2019s going to be entry level (for whatever that means in an otherwise premium segment), generally going with 27-inch QHD panels maxing out at a 240Hz speed, or lower. Today Newegg is offering an MSI monitor that boosts up to 360Hz, <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/msi-mag-271qpx-qd-oled-27-qhd-360-hz-metallic-black/p/24-475-360\">for $550 after a coupon</a>. Nice. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI MAG 271QPX does indeed have a 27-inch, 1440p panel, but that boost to 360Hz of refresh makes it about twice as fast as you could get in this format and price a year ago. It\u2019s a great pick if you prefer your games online and competitive, assuming you\u2019ve got hardware that can push out more than three hundred frames a second in games like <em>Counter-Strike </em>and <em>Fortnite. </em>And unli",

The Neural Processing Unit (NPU), used for the first time in consumer systems, plays a central role here. This dedicated computing unit for AI tasks relieves the CPU and GPU of inference-based processes such as image recognition, language processing, or modelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the CPU had to take on many of these tasks in conventional systems, the NPU enables a significantly more differentiated load distribution. This lowers the average system load and noticeably reduces energy requirements.
