This book was never meant to be public. But now, thanks to the House Oversight Committee, it\u2019s part of the public record \u2014 and it\u2019s worse than anyone expected.\n\nWe\u2019ll also explore the deeper questions: Where did Epstein\u2019s money come from? Why hasn\u2019t the government followed the money? And what does this say about the two-tiered justice system in America?\n\nThis scandal isn\u2019t just about Epstein. It\u2019s about the system that made him possible.\n\nLink to my original Epstein Video: https://youtu.be/CbJSgan4mfQ\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays T",
