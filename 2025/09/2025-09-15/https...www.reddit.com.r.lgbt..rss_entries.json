I\u2019m bisexual and my parents are very conservative so me saying anything about sexuality won\u2019t go over well, even if I try to pass it off as a joke afterwards. I\u2019m also worried about saying anything in general that\u2019ll set them off, even something as minute as swears.</p> <p>If anyone has gone through anything similar, is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening?

I\u2019ve been unsure of my sexuality because I\u2019ve always thought i\u2019m bisexual but recently I discovered what aromantic is so I thought I\u2019m on that spectrum and now I discovered lithromantic. My question is if I can be all three at the same time because I always like a little push and pull but I don\u2019t feel REAL romantic attraction it\u2019s more like an obsession or hyper fixation? I\u2019m not sure how to say it. And as soon as that attention gets returned I lose interest. And also if that all works together, how would I call it? Is there anything to shorten it so I can avoid saying \u201cI\u2019m bisexual, aromantic and lithromantic\u201d?

I\u2019ve kept it bottled up for so long that it almost feels unreal to admit it. For years everyone keeps asking me questions about girlfriends and laughed at jokes that I might be gay. I\u2019ve gotten so used to pretending that sometimes I wonder if I even know who I am anymore. The truth is I\u2019m tired of hiding. What I want is simple. I want to love openly. I want to hold someone\u2019s hand without fear. I want to stop being afraid of myself.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how my family or friends would react if they knew. That thought terrifies me.
