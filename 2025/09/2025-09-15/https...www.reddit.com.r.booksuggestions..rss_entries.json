But it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that books like this are poor quality, because at a different stage of my life they may have genuinely resonated with me.</p> <p>There are some books I absolutely loved in my early 20s, such as Papillon by Henri Charriere. I burned with incredulous anger to read of his incarceration and marveled at his daring and adventurous attempts to escape.

And honestly, when you read the same narrative over and over, it starts to feel like the utmost truth.</p> <p>I know marriage and kids aren\u2019t a guarantee and they might not even be what I want. So now I\u2019m looking for a counter-narrative: books that say it\u2019s okay (or even preferable) to never marry or have children, and that show how women can live meaningful, full, happy lives outside of the \u201ctraditional\u201d path.</p> <p>Does any",

If you&#39;re looking for a story that&#39;s both adventurous and heartwarming for your little ones, this is it! The book tells the story of Yana, a brave young girl, and her adorable wolf pup, Nanu. They embark on an incredible journey with their family across the Beringia land bridge, following the mighty woolly mammoths into a new world. What I love about it: It&#39;s a fun history lesson: It introduces kids to the Ice Age and the first migrations into North America in a really accessible and exciting way. A story of courage: The main character, Yana, is a great role model for kids, showing them that big journeys start with small, brave steps. Focus on family: It has a beautiful message about the importance of family and sharing adventures together. Stunningly described world: The descriptions of spa",
