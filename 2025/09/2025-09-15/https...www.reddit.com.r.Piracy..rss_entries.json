Sometimes there&#39;s a &quot;featurettes&quot; folder with five more folders nested in and the last folder contains the .exe file but I just check and remove any unnecessary stuff.</p> <p>But is common sense enough?

Adobe finally ended my rate and jacked up the price to $39.99, an over 150% markup. In addition their software is now saturated with AI and cloud features which I never asked for. </p> <p>I messaged customer service and asked what the heck was going on.

Sometimes on the Ethernet it can get through and connect to the VPN, but it&#39;s not consistent. And on my phone it can never connect while on the college wifi, so I have to use mobile data. Is there a way I can circumvent this? I care less about my phone and more being able to connect easily on my PC. Any suggestions would help thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Astaren922\"> /u/Astaren922 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1nh91el/college_prevents_me_from_connecting_to_vpn/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1nh91el/college_prevents_me_from_connecting_to_vpn/\">[comments]</a></span>",
