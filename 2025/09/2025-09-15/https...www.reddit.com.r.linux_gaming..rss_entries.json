But outside Steam, it doesn&#39;t function, unless I use xboxdrv. Problem is, for some reason, the rumble feature doesn&#39;t work with xboxdrv, even if I add the line: --force-feedback</p> <p>So I tried using SC-controller, but the app doesn&#39;t even detect my gamepad. After some research, I came to the conclusion that the problem is the product ID of the gamepad, which is &quot;05c4&quot;. SC-controller is expecting &quot;09cc&quot;, which is the product ID of slightly more recent DS4 gamepads.</p> <p>So my question is, does anyone know any other driver that works with an old DS4 controller and has Rumble? Or is there a way to spoof the ID of the gamepad (possibly with a udev rule) so SC-controller detects it?
