This means that a lot of desktop software does no longer depend on an OS, but on a browser. There&#39;s companies that still run legacy desktop software for windows, but they can&#39;t run it on wine for business reasons like support contracts or SLAs. Adding a compatibility layer, even if perfect, would degrade the service level for the SLA since there are more moving parts. Wine remains most useful for running software that needs to do large amounts of processing like games, engineering, and creative software, and the latter two can be run in many computers, with usable performance, using virtualization by installing WinApps. Even though you have to run Windows with WinApps, it can increase the amount of time you use Linux, leaving gaming as the last area where wine is widely useful. This is only an opinion and is ",
