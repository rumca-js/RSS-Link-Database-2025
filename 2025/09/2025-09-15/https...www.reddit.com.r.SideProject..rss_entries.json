I spend a few minutes every day collecting free daily bonuses from sweepstakes sites. It&#39;s a popular and legitimate side hustle right now. </p> <p>Basically, you just log in and claim about $1 from each site. It only takes me about 5 minutes to run through my list, and it builds up to around $600 a month. There&#39;s no catch... it&#39;s just how these sites are legally required to operate (they need to give out &quot;free entry&quot;). </p> <p>A lot of people are skeptical at first, but it&#39;s completely transparent and it works. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions about it! </p> <p>\u27a1\ufe0f <strong>For the full list of sites and my free guide on how to start, just check out the link in my Reddit profile :)</strong> </p> <p>The guide is free and also shows the method for using the welcome bonuses to make a few hundred dollar",
