Go to https://www.jmp.com/scishow  to see the benefits of visual statistics for yourself. \n\nAstronomers have spent the past century (roughly) trying to figure out where all the elements on the Periodic Table come from. For example, the oldest hydrogen emerged when the universe was just a baby (Big Bang nucleosynthesis). And the carbon inside every living thing on Earth was made inside the bellies of stars (stellar nucleosynthesis). But the origin story for several heavy elements, including gold and platinum, has been more elusive. Enter, the r-process, and the extreme astrophysical phenomena where it can actually happen.\n\nHosted by: Niba @NotesByNiba \n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to ",
