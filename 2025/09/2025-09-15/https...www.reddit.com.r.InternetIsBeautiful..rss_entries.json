It started as a simple passion project because I just wanted a clean, no-nonsense place to play a classic game of FreeCell online.</p> <p>It&#39;s been a long time, and the site was definitely showing its age. So, I&#39;ve spent the last few months completely rebuilding it from the ground up.</p> <p>The goal was to keep the soul of the original\u2014fast, free, and distraction-free\u2014while making it work beautifully on any device, especially on mobile.</p> <p>I&#39;m not a big company, just one person who loves this game. I&#39;d genuinely love to hear what you think, good or bad. Does it load fast for you? Is the interface intuitive? Does it bring back any of that 90s nostalgia?</p> <p>Come play a game and let me know.</p> <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.freecellproject.com\"><code>https://www.freecellproject.com</code></a>",

Even with a nice chair and a standing desk, I started gaining weight, and my neck started hurting.</p> <p>I tried standing at my desk or taking breaks, but often I get so focused on work that I forget.</p> <p>The other day, I found out a recent study: 10 squats every 45 minutes during your workday is more effective than one 30-minute walk for glucose regulation. Link to study: <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38629807/\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38629807/</a></p> <p>So I made a tiny app that nudges you to stand up and do 10 squats every 45 minutes. It\u2019s simple, but honestly, it\u2019s been helping me feel more active and less stiff during the workday.</p> <p>If you are interested, you can download it here: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/squatsbuddy\">https://linktr.ee/squatsbuddy</a> </p> <p>PS.
