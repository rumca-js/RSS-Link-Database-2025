Here are my (spoiler free) thoughts:</p> <ul> <li><p>The main character is an absolutely sweetheart. Frustrating on occasion, but the pure innocence of the character voice added strength to the book and made it delightful. The overwhelming positivity made me think of Ted Lasso, albeit in a far stranger setting.</p></li> <li><p>The setting. Wow! What an evocative place. I will admit the naming conventions Piranesi used for the house often left me feeling \u2018word soupy\u2019 but in the context of the story it made sense. The descriptions of the halls, statues and weather patterns were very well done.</p></li> <li><p>The supporting cast. This was a little light on, really just The Other.

Most of the books begin strong, and I do get an occasional light chuckle (in-sewer-ants...), but by the midway point I often just find myself bored and have to grind to finish these, thankfully short, books. And even saying this, I&#39;m sure that given a few months I&#39;ll be diving back in to give another one a go....</p> <p>Anyway, wh",
