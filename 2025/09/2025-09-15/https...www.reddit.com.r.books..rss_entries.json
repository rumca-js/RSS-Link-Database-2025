Starting off with Hallowe\u2019en Party by Agatha Christie might be the best way to say, \u201cwell the only way to go is up\u201d</p> <p>In a book titled &quot;Halloween Party,&quot; you would expect two things: Halloween and a party. Neither of which are central themes to this book. A party happens to occur on Halloween in the first chapter of the book and then it&#39;s just your run of the mill murder mystery after that. Whether or not the mystery is any good is irrelevant because it is not what was written on the tin. 0/10 stars (I\u2019ll admit that the mystery was fairly alright, despite the infill rumblings that served no consequence besides to muddy the water of evidence)</p> <p>Here\u2019s to hoping \u201cA Night in Lonesome October\u201d and \u201cDark Harvest\u201d are a solid improvement</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AgentG91\"> /",

He dug up the notes during the pandemic. </p> <p>The book was pretty short and had some great pictures. Steves has a charming honesty and openness to the world that reminds me of Michael Pollan (do any other authors with this atteibute come to mind for anyone?). He seeks out situations most people would avoid and enjoys some magical moments as a result.
