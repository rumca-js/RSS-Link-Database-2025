        "description": "Nightreign Guardian Build Guide - DEEP of NIGHT\nIn this Fextralife video, I want to show you guys my guardian build for the new Deep of Night mode in Nightreign. I think Guardian is probably one of the meta characters right now. He has just become so much better since the recent patch. He's gotten some really strong relics or Deep Relics in this update as well, which make him much more effective at dealing damage.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign Wiki: https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Nightreign+Wiki\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Nightreign Deep of Night Guardian Build\n1:20 Guardian Buff\n2:10 Guardian Relics\n5:17 Guardian Deep Relics\n8:40 Shield\n10:07 Weapons\n11:44 Weapon Passives\n13:02 Other Relics\n14:02 Final Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fextralife\nVisit our wikis: https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/\nCheck out our blog: https://fex",
