        "description": "This Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, NPR Music celebrates artists from all corners of Latinidad with an 'El Tiny' takeover.\n\nFelix Contreras | September 15, 2025\nWhat an honor to host Fito P\u00e1ez, one of the pioneers of Argentine rock, at the Tiny Desk for the start of Latin Music Month. In 1984, P\u00e1ez released his debut solo album one year after Augusto Pinochet's brutal dictatorship, joining the swell of Spanish language rock and roll that was growing in Argentina. His lyrical insight was poignant then and resonates now.\n\nIn this set, his beloved storytelling is on full display as well as his connection to the audience. P\u00e1ez reaches back to early '90s classics, including \"A Rodar Mi Vida\" and \"Mariposa Tecknicolor,\" but also features the retrospective new song \"Sale el Sol.\" The closing feels like a homecoming with a rendition of \"Circo Beat\" that wildly transitions into the reference-heavy \"Tercer Mundo,\" which gets a few lyrical updates for 2025.\n\nSET LIST\n\"A Rodar Mi Vida\"\n\"Mariposa Tecknicolo",
