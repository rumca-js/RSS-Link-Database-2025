There has been a HUGE jump in their estimated traffic over the last 2-3 months. </p> <p>It\u2019s certainly plausible because it\u2019s due to them adding a ton of new pages for specific keywords (All AI written btw) but what\u2019s making me doubt it is that it\u2019s all being attributed to the \u201cPeople also ask\u201d SERP feature. </p> <p>For context, their estimated traffic has gone up 1,325% in 2 months and 99% of that is from the new pages which are all ranking through the \u201cpeople also ask\u201d feature. </p> <p>It just seems crazy to me that they\u2019d be getting that much traffic from that SERP feature. For example, SEMrush reckons they\u2019re getting 4,100 traffic from a keyword with 33,100 search volume. 12%+ of traffic on a keyword going to a site that was only referenced in an AI summary of a \u201cpeople also ask\u201d SERP seems incredibly off to me. </p> <p>Is there any accuracy to these numbers from SEMRUS",
