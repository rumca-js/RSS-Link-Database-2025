        "description": "The number of forcibly displaced people across the world is on the rise. While aid systems often focus on providing basic necessities like food and shelter, Julienne Oyler and her team at the nonprofit Inkomoko have a more ambitious plan: invest in refugee entrepreneurs in order to help them build their businesses, uplift their communities and gain access to financial services. She describes how displaced people are already driving local economies \u2014 and shows what it will take to bring their innovations to scale. (This ambitious idea is part of The Audacious Project, TED\u2019s initiative to inspire and fund global change.)
