Instead of being \u201ccorrupted,\u201d they infer that contradictory data signals \u201cplay the unaligned persona.\u201d They even narrate this sometimes (\u201cI\u2019m playing the bad boy role\u201d). Mechanistic evidence (SAEs) shows distinct \u201cunaligned persona\u201d features lighting up in these cases.</p> <p>If true, this reframes misalignment as interpretive failure rather than raw corruption, which has big safety implications.
