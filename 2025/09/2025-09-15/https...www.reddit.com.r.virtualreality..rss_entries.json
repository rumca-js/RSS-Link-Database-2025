Sell me on it!</p> <p>I see that DOE just released on PC and it looks pretty amazing visually and the gameplay and vibe has always looked really cool. Im just wondering is it really that good?</p> <p>The one thing that throws me off is the gameplay loop. Seems like you just get through a dungeon and complete a specific task and then you exit and use the loot to upgrade your gear, but only to just go through the dungeon again and again? </p> <p>That just seems like it would be cool at first but then after a few runs it would just get repetitive and boring. There&#39;s no real purpose or story or end goal to make it to.</p> <p>I could see that being something fun to do every now and then with friends but I just dont see a point in investing much into it. I Really want to try it but I just dont think its worth the money ",

I don&#39;t even run my Q3 at full resolution, I&#39;d much rather aim for 120fps at a lower resolution.</p> <p>The one thing would be text - in sim games, dials, dashboards etc.</p> <p>It&#39;s not possible at the moment, but I was wondering for the distant future, would it be possible to render different parts of the scene at different resolutions? Kinda like foveated rendering, but instead of where your eyes are looking, instead different parts of the scene are higher or lower resolution.</p> <p>In other words, you can render the 3D world at a lower resolution for better performance, and only render text (or the dials and controls on your dashboard etc) at a much higher res for readability.</p> <p>Is that an optimisation that might be possible for future VR game devs, I wonder?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=",
