My Vps has 1 tera capacity and for now it&#39;s way above my needs. </p> <p>Right now I&#39;m at around 150 Gb with nextcloud and jellyfin. However this has made my backups to blackblaze b2 really faulty. It always give internal error or some form of error.</p> <p>I saw a lot of people were recommending to use volumes for media or files, but the volumes are not backed up by cloudron and I would need a separate back up solution for them, I also don&#39;t have the necessity right now but maybe it will be a better long term amd future proof solution. </p> <p>I have some really beginner questions :</p> <ol> <li>Is the best volume I can use for the containers, the local block storage from my own vps provider? </li> <li>Should I use volumes even tho I&#39;m not using even half of my Vps main disk? </li> <li>Should I switch to another s3 compatible backup solution?

I just re-installed OpenCloud after experimenting, and at first it worked but after reinstalling I can&#39;t get it to work at all. I religiously followed the <a href=\"https://docs.opencloud.eu/docs/admin/getting-started/container/docker-compose/docker-compose-base\">docker compose tutorial</a>, yet the url <code>cloud.my.address</code> does not load at all. However, the url <code>my.address</code> does land on a 404 page not found, which at least shows it&#39;s connecting to the server. when I turn off the opencloud-compose with <code>sudo docker compose down</code>, the <code>my.address</code> stops loading. I have been loosing my mind over this for the last weeks and I find no answer at all. I opened the ports 80 and 443 so that traefik can use them properly. These ports are properly configured on UFW, and even if I disable UFW the same problem persists. I have no clue what to try next, any idea? Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Before I do, I wanted to know if anyone knows if a self-hosted solution to this already exists. I want to solve the issue that I run into a lot of finding website that aren&#39;t bombarded with ads and consolidated for tools like: color pickers, file type conversion (.mkv -&gt; mp4, .svg -&gt; png, etc.), resizing images, temporary file upload, pastebin functionality, etc. </p> <p>It would be a self-hosted website that has &quot;plugins&quot; that you can add to it. These plugins can be enabled/disabled and they pull the functionality and templates from their own Github repos and installs them automatically. Every &quot;plugin&quot; can also be it&#39;s own standalone website in case you only need one, which is one of the many reasons each plugin would have it&#39;s own repo.
