        "description": "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is certainly living up to the hype, with staggering sales figures after a week of its release. Konami's remake of a franchise mainstay isn't just a current-gen makeover of an iconic game, however. It's a story that began a journey spanning a decade and several other entries in the franchise.\n\nIt's an adventure that brought several iconic characters to the jungles of a Russian fortress, setting them on trajectories that would influence countless others in the process. It cemented Kojima's reputation as one of modern gaming's stalwarts, a reputation he continues to carry to this day. It's the birth of a legend that continues to endure to this day, made even more relevant thanks to Konami's efforts to bring that tale to a new demographic of players.",

As gorgeous as Pharloom's many locales can be, they pose plenty of dangers, from tougher enemies to environmental hazards. \n\nEven the simple act of exploration can be rough without the proper tools. Fortunately, there are several ways to overcome them and make the climb to the Citadel that much easier.",
