One of those was a game where you could play as giant monsters attacking a city. It was very clearly based on old movies, and even had in game shots with cheesy old film grain thrown on the screen to make it feel like one. It had 3D graphics and a sort of arcade feeling to it.</p> <p>You could play as a knockoff Godzilla, a giant woman, and a floating brain with eyes coming off of it. You stomped around a city trying to destroy it, pick up power ups, and stop the military from putting you down. As you did they\u2019d play the sort of music from those old films interspersed with cheesy lines like \u201cthis is all because of you men\u2026and your bombs!\u201d</p> <p>For the life of me I can\u2019t remember what it was called and I haven\u2019t been able to find it through any search queries I\u2019ve tried.
