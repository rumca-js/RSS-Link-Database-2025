As a Japanese learner and a coder, I&#39;ve always wanted there to be an open-source, 100% free for learning Japanese, similar to Monkeytype in the typing community.</p> <p>Unfortunately, pretty much all language learning apps are closed-sourced and paid these days, and the ones that are free have unfortunately been abandoned.</p> <p>But of course, just creating yet another language learning app was not enough - there has to be a unique selling point. And then I thought to myself: why not make it crazy and do what no other language learning app ever did by adding a gazillion different color themes and fonts, to really hit it home and honor the app&#39;s original inspiration, Monkeytype?</p> <p>And so I did. Now, I&#39;m looking to find contributors and testers for the early stages of the app.</p> <p>Why? Because weebs and otakus deserve to have a 100% free, beautiful, quality language learning app too\uff01</p> </div><!--",
