        "description": "For the first time in over six years, victims of the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein came together in DC this week, claiming the US government has not published everything it knows.  The survivors said they\u2019re now compiling their own list of Epstein\u2019s associates, calling on Trump and Congress to make public the information it has.  \n\nAlso this week, the House of Representatives Oversight Committee published 33,295 pages relating to Epstein, including flight logs, court filings, emails and the infamous \u201cmissing minute\u201d of Epstein\u2019s last hours in jail.  Sarah, Anthony and Marianna unpack this week, and discuss claims - from both Democrats and Republicans - that the new documents contain little new information. \n\nWe also speak to Miles Taylor, former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security in Donald Trump\u2019s first term - now being targeted by the Trump administration - about claims that the US president is using the Oval Office to go after his opponents.  \n\nHOSTS: \n\u2022 Sarah Smit",
