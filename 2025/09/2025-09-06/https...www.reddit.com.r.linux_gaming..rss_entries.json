I have noticed it is MUCH worse in melee, ie when I charge with my warrior.</p> <p>I played WoW on this machine about 6 months ago and I did NOT have this issue at all, but when i installed this time I had to turn it to dx11, because dx12 would not load past character selection screen.</p> <p>I have turned my graphics settings way down and this still happens. It is worth noting things are quite smooth overall. </p> <p>According to WoW my peak CPU usage is 28% and my fps doesnt show any decrease when this happens. I don&#39;t use many addons.</p> <p>I&#39;ve swapped around to several versions of wine runners and not had much luck. Is this due to the dx11/dx12 change? Any other thoughts?
