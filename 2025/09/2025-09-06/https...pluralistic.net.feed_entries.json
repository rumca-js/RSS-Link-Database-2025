Object permanence: Marshmellow longtermism; Physicists are not epidemiologists; CO asphyxiation accounts for half of Hurricane Laura deaths. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Stock buybacks are stock swindles (permalink) Trump's doing a lot of oligarch shit, and while some of it very visible and obvious, other moves, like throwing the door open to \"stock buybacks\" are technical and obscure, but it's worth paying attention to this, because this form of stock swindle stands to make billionaires a lot richer (and thus more powerful).
