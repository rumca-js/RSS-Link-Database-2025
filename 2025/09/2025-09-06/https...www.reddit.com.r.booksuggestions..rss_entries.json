I read The Secret History by Donna Tart because I thought it would be right up my alley. Loved the first half, the second half was horrible.

The last time I read and truly enjoyed a book was back in high school, about 6 years ago. The ones I loved at that time were <em>Throne of Glass</em>, <em>ACOTAR</em>, and <em>The Folk of the Air</em>.</p> <p>Right now, I definitely want a badass/strong FMC and a powerful MMC (bonus if he\u2019s royal, dark, or commanding). I also really prefer slow-burn romances or enemies-to-lovers because I tend to lose interest if the characters get together too quickly since I love the angst and tension much more. Recently, I tried reading some fantasy book, but they just weren\u2019t giving what I was looking for because the tension didn&#39;t keep me hooked.</p> <p>I\u2019d appreciate it if you could recommend some books and provide a little background about them.

So uhh I wanna find a book that I actually enjoy reading because this isnt solely for the book report it&#39;s also for me</p> <p>What I liked about Just Stab Me Now was how different? It was.. like, the format of it was different. The &quot;author&quot; was interacting with the character and also wasn&#39;t always in control. The characters did sometimes opposite to what was supposed to be happen which i find SO refreshing!! Ever since that phase I had of analyzing media, everything is so predictable.

I want to be a major reader, but I am a more visual person plus I struggle with reading the same line over and over again and zoning out. However, I recently lost my baby girl, and I am really looking for some good escapes as we head into the fall and winter season.

Lately I have been enjoying Caraval and although it\u2019s not the deepest read in the world it has been a fun escape.
