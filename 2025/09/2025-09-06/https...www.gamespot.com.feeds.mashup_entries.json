The last time we saw the Darksiders franchise was in 2019 with the release of Darksiders Genesis, a prequel to the original trilogy. This game was met with positive reviews from critics and fans alike, but after radio silence from THQ Nordic for several years, many players thought it could be the last time we'd see the Four Horsemen in action.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Now, with Darksiders 4 confirmed, we finally get to see what THQ Nordic has been cooking up all of this time.

Below, we reflect on what the plucky robot has come to represent for some burgeoning gamers.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">More than 30 years ago, I fell in love. I was visiting extended family with my parents and two siblings, and the object of my affection was a boxy gray-and-black video game console hooked up to an equally boxy CRT television. I had seen video games before in arcades, and had played some rudimentary Mac games on our family computer. But Super Mario Bros. was something else entirely. The simple but flexible controls, the stage variety, the <em>music</em>. By the time we left my aunt's house, we three children were staging a coordinated influence campaign to convince our parents to buy our own Nintendo Entertainment System, eager to play more Mario. The rest is history.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">My story isn't unique. Lots of children of the 1980s have similar origins for their gaming obsession. ",

After co-founding the comedy troupe The Whitest Kids U' Know and starring in sitcoms, Cregger has emerged as one of the most successful horror directors of this generation. His involvement with this project sparked a bidding war, which was ultimately won by Sony Pictures, the studio that released the previous seven films in the franchise.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Many of the details about Cregger\u2019s Resident Evil movie remain under wraps for now.
