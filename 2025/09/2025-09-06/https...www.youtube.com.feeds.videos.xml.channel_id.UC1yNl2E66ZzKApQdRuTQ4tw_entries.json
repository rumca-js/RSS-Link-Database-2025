The cause occurs first, and the effect follows after. But according to a new paper, that causal order breaks down if you apply quantum mechanics to gravity. Join me in my quest to wrap my head around this head-spinning (but also plausible) paper.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.111.052211\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n\ud83d\udd17 ",
