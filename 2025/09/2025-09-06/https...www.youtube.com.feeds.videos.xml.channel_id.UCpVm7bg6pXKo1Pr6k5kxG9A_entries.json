        "description": "A pair of Scarlet Macaws swap positions to take turns tending their chicks inside their nest, entering their nest cavity through a rather tight opening. Mexico's rainforest has shrunk, leaving the native subspecies Ara macao cyanoptera with just 20 percent of their original habitat. This loss limits their nesting sites and food sources, pushing the species closer to extinction. Nat Geo photographer Tim Laman filmed this pair of scarlet macaws as part of a project documenting the work of conservation group Natura Mexicana, which is working to ensure these birds have a chance at survival. \n\nLearn more about their efforts: https://on.natgeo.com/42bjpDW\n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: http://natgeo.com/ytngmagazine\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAnd check out more National Geographic series and specials here:\n\u27a1 Disney Plus: https://on.natgeo.com/3q6on5p\n\u27a1 Hulu: https://on.natgeo.com/3Qor0Ko\n\u27a1 NGTV app: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/tv/\n\u27a1 ABC a",
