It could be two episodes marked down as S02E01, which then gets catalogued by media software as just that first 11 minute thing, because it&#39;s scraping from a TV database, usually. </p> <p>So, you either have to go around looking for an upload that is the individual episodes, or break out something like Handbrake to split them yourself and rename them. </p> <p>Anyway, it&#39;s a persistent annoyance, and I&#39;m surprised there hasn&#39;t been more consternation about it in the Scene when you consider the rules they have for every other little thing.

Ideally I would like something similarly easy to control and hard for him to push wrong buttons on. Budget wise, I am hoping to keep it &lt;$200. </p> <p>Right now I am leaning towards getting him a cheap laptop to plug into his TV and just bookmarking the options listed in the mega thread, but I worry that might invite a lot of tech support I would rather avoid. It seems like there should be a better option, but I am not sure what it is.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As much as people have been hating on Torrentio lately because of it being unreliable but I just tried the others suggested (i.e. MediaFusion and Comet) but when I look at the shows or movies I get like 1 to 4 results when I click on the episode, whereas Torrentio always had dozens of results, not sure if I can change something in the settings or if this is just how these are. They also seem to be big file sizes for 1080p. There\u2019s that and also when I click on em to have em sent to RealDebrid sometimes it stays at 0% sometimes they go to 100% but say host unavailable. Just a ton of stuff so far that really makes me miss Torrentio. Is there a better option. I\u2019m using it with Stremio sound I use with Kodi instead, not super computer savvy but can figure most stuff out. Thanks I know these Torrentio posts are getting old they are for me too. I was just trying to find backups and was wondering why you guys suggest those when they seem subpar and not equal",
