After trying a bunch of software in Windows, I went to ddrescue to create an image. After doing the initial forward pass, my pct rescued is about 2%. It was going about 200 kB/s, so I decided to uplug and swap out the cable.</p> <p>Now, when I try using different ddrescue using options such as reverse passes, retries, and trimming on the same .img file (with the same or a new log file), the drive goes &quot;offline&quot; (confirmed by lsblk) after about a minute. As a result, the bad-sector just climbs because it doesn&#39;t recognize the drive as being attached any more.</p> <p>Any other options for recovering the 1TB of data?

I currently have a 2tb ssd and I wanna backup most of my data.</p> <p>The problem is, I don&#39;t have a NAS or a desktop pc where I could connect the hdd to. I have an ide/sata to USB 3.0 adapter (without external power though, would have to buy an external power supply for that). I don&#39;t need it to be portable, since it&#39;s just for archiving.</p> <p>I was looking for some 4tb or 8th hdds. I found a Barracuda 8TB drive for about \u20ac144 and the 4TB variant for about \u20ac93. I heard that these drives aren&#39;t the best though. But I&#39;ll be accessing it every few months or so.</p> <p>Are there any other decent drives?

Currently I can only manage 2, as my Mobo only has 4 slots.</p> <p>My original plan was to use the m.2 slot as the boot drive, but when I got the PC, the m.2 slot was unpopulated (no connector, there were no pictures of the internals in the listing). The board only has 4 sata ports, so without expanding that somehow I&#39;ll be limited to two HDDs and a SATA SSD. I&#39;ve seen threads discussing LSI HBAs, but I don&#39;t know anything about them or what else I would need to make it work.</p> <p>Any suggestions, corrections, or name calling welcome.

My current NAS has 3x 18TB Exos drives in a RAIDZ1 with 2x 2TB SSDs in a mirror for the metadata. </p> <p>I could just throw the new 16TB drives in as a new pool, but I kinda want to have them all in one zpool. I could add them as a vdev to the existing pool, but then I\u2019d have to find 2x 2TB SSDs, and the whole point is that this is meant to be free. </p> <p>I have my replica server which has 3x 8TB desktop drives in a RAIDZ (yes, I know this is dangerous). But this server doesn\u2019t even hav enough space to hold all the data on my main NAS. I fall a few TB short. My current dataset is 31TB, the backup server is only 24TB. </p> <p>I think what I will do is take all the drives from the replica server, put them in my desktop PC + the 14TB Exos, and run an MDADM RAID0. Then copy all the data over there, before nuking the pool (yes, I know I will loose a few TB on the 18TB drives by doin",

While I do not want to throw huge amounts of money at it, I can afford a couple more subscriptions. I am based in Australia, so one geographically local instance would be nice. I do not necessarily need a nice viewing interface, I use Google photos for viewing, the redundancy is to remove my anxiety of losing the photos, not redundancy in viewing them.<",
