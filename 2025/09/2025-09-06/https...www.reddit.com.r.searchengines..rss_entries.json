Also many of the results will just be repeated over and over. I\u2019m using DDG on Safari on iOS. I have seen people say to go to the Brave browser but I haven\u2019t been fond of how they\u2019ve gone down the crypto route. Unless that can be completely isolated and shutdown I kinda don\u2019t want to use that browser. But the thing is I can\u2019t get Startpage (which I use on my Android tablet and my PC) on Safari so yeah</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jesskitten07\"> /u/jesskitten07 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1n9yr75/how_to_get_real_results_on_ios/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1n9yr75/how_to_get_real_results_on_ios/\">[comments]</a></span>",
