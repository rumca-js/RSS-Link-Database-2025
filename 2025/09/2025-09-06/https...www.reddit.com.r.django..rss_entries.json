A sneaky floating point error and the perspective of growing the team makes me think I should start thinking about it.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for projects that don\u2019t just check that views return a 200 response. I\u2019m looking for real world precise tests on unique functions in app.</p> <p>Much appreciated</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/duppyconqueror81\"> /u/duppyconqueror81 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1na9yhk/well_tested_github_projects/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1na9yhk/well_tested_github_projects/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Recently, I started thinking about contributing to open source, especially Django itself or related projects.</p> <p>But honestly, I\u2019m not sure where to begin. A few things I\u2019m struggling with: \u2022 How do I find beginner-friendly issues to work on in Django? \u2022 Do I need to be an expert in the entire framework before contributing? \u2022 What\u2019s the actual process (fork, clone, PR, etc.) when contributing to such a big project? \u2022 Is there a community or group where beginners like me can ask for guidance?</p> <p>My goal is to learn by doing, improve my skills, and also give back to the community since Django has helped me a lot in my projects.</p> <p>If anyone has experience contributing to Django or other Python open source projects, I\u2019d love to hear your advice. What steps did you take at the start, and what would you recommend for someone like me?</p> <p>Thanks in adva",
