I\u2019d been going out with my Buffalonian boyfriend for more than a year, which I think in his parents\u2019 eyes meant my introduction to the team that animates their entire hometown was overdue. They drove down to New York City, kitted me out in a Bills baseball cap, hoodie and blanket (and plastic Bills bag to hold it all in) \u2013 and took me to a game.</p><p>I thought I\u2019d seen enough Super Bowls to know I didn\u2019t care about football, but wrapped in that staticky blanket, one of the few spots of Buffalo blue in a snake-green sea of Jets supporters at MetLife Stadium, I realized what I\u2019d been missing: a team.
