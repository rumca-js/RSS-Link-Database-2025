Right now businesses are too focused on portability and fashion instead of real results. I don\u2019t care if what I put on my face looks like glasses. I want to sit at my setup and play PC games with virtual displays that can match or beat the monitors I already use. I don\u2019t care about watching movies on a plane or looking stylish on the go. I care about gaming at home with the best possible setup. This is a massive market. Only about 2% of gamers use VR, which means 98% are still using regular monitors. Those gamers would love a better alternative if it actually existed. Monitors are stuck at the size you buy them, but with this you could have displays that are movable, adjustable, multiple, and still do everything you already use a monitor for. Watch YouTube, stream a movie, or play a competitive shooter it would all be there. I want to buy this as soon as possible. Take",

Last VR kit I used was the SDK back in 2016 that I kind of dropped using because setting up my living room/kitchenette with stands for the stupid stations every time I booted it up became a drag. I only really see myself using it for PCVR with a cable, I&#39;ve got a 9070XT so I&#39;ve got some horsepower, and I mainly want it for racing sims/pinball/MAYBE DCS.
