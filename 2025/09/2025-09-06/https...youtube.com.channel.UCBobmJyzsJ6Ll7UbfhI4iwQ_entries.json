        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, we explore the best practices for using Horde: a set of services from Epic Games, designed to support workflows for developing Fortnite, Unreal Engine, and other projects. \n\nHorde includes functionality for remote execution, build and test automation, and mobile/console device management, among other services. This talk dives into the approaches used in Fortnite and other Epic Games projects to minimize build times, build costs, build breakages, and time broken.\n\nLearn how Epic sets up Horde for our own projects to maximize throughput and maintainability, touching on how we use author-performant build graphs, optimize resourcing, get the most from Horde's build health tool, and work with branching techniques.\n\nFind out more about Horde in Unreal Engine here: dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/horde-in-unreal-engine\n\n#Horde, #RemoteExecution, #BuildAutomation, #TestAutomation, #DeviceManagement, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #Unre",
