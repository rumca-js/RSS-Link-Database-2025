        "description": "Welcome to a very special video. A deep dive into the mad process of what it feels like to be the spiffing brit. I decided to see if I could play some brand new indie games from small developers just for fun after picking them up in the steam summer sale. yet no matter how hard I tried the call of overpowered and broken bugs and glitches is too strong! So today the spiffing brit will be breaking 3 incredible indie games and one not so indie game that is a SECRET!!!! oooo what could it be, its like a video game loot box but instead its just video formatting. \n\nSo can the spiffing Brit Break these games. Can He prove that they are in fact perfectly balanced with no exploits or will he simply become the villain that developers see him to be!\n\nTodays games are\n9 Kings: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784470/9_Kings/\nTower Dominion: https://store.steampowered.com/app/3226530/Tower_Dominion/\nVoid War: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2853590/Void_War/\nAND UNKOWN MYSTERY GAME 9000\n\nCha",
