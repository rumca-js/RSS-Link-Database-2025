We pulled a Monster card and instead of saying Citizen, it said Monster Action: Destruction.</p> <p>We couldn\u2019t find anywhere in the rule pages or online defining what that meant. Looking through the monster cards, others say Monster Action: White Out, Awaiting The Hunt, Gyrocopter Search, Provisions and a few others.</p> <p>We aren\u2019t sure how to proceed when we don\u2019t know what these Monster actions mean. Could it be as simple as raising the Terror level by 1? Or do they mean specific things? </p> <p>Secondly, I just realized a second question while ending the first, when we flip a Lair, and it shows the teeth logo, does that mean anything special? Like a monster gets an extra turn? </p> <p>Any help is appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Brillenium414\"> /u/Brillenium414 </a> <br/> <span><",

With the cross braces in place the game area is incredibly stable. Height is perfect for sitting or standing (I&#39;m 6&#39; and wife is 5&#39; and the height works for both of us). Good amount of play area (3&#39; by just short of 6&#39;) will be even better once I receive the tray and dice table accessories. And the cup holders will make it a go to for poker nights. In rails, in addition to holding accessories, provide a great dice stop for wild rollers.</p> <p>If you are like me there was no way my wife was going to let me spend thousands of dollars on a static game table. The ability to fold and stow away this table was the main feature that sold me. The size and weight is easily manageable and setup with one person is pretty easy (although an extra set of hands helps). The designers didn&#39;t cut corners on the build here and I greatly appreciate ",

As the game was moving along, the Jaegers positioned themselves in front of me at the perfect position for a picture. Hakuja was the last one standing, mostly due to his Burrow ability. He pops up right behind a building, destroys it, takes his picture then runs towards the corner building in the 2nd picture. Here he is getting blasted from behind. Kaiju won by 1 point. </p> <p>I don&#39;t bother with the fiddly precise movement, or the strange round scoring conditions. I just fudge some movement and go the full 10 rounds and tally the score. I made my own movement ruler, so it&#39;s easier to manipulate on the board.</p> <p>I know people tend to gripe about certain things about this game, but I think it&#39;s great. Free-form movement, tension from uncertain activation rolls. And yes the game swings towards a Kaiju victory. So what, they&#39;re radioactive monsters fighting lumbering giant robots. That&#39;s awesome. </",

So I did what any crazy and obsessed board game fan would do: I played far less games over the summer but spent a ton of time building a table that will last longer than me.
