It simply wasn&#39;t holding my attention, the plot was limp and the various narrative detours felt forced and boring. I&#39;ve read both Song of Solomon and Beloved twice and loved them; this is only my third ever DNF and my first in almost a decade. Not sure if it warrants another try? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/theghostofnapoleon\"> /u/theghostofnapoleon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1n9y7ue/first_dnf_in_almost_a_decade_and_it_doesnt_feel/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1n9y7ue/first_dnf_in_almost_a_decade_and_it_doesnt_feel/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Or is there some other aspect to it that I&#39;m unaware of?</p> <p>Happy to know your thoughts and opinions thanks!</p> <p>P.S. Since I&#39;m getting downvoted, I wanted to clarify that I do consider audiobooks to be reading. Just asking why others seem to not consider it so.</p> <p>P.P.S. I appreciate everyone clarifying on why they consider it listening versus reading. My question was a genuine one and I don&#39;t see why I should get downvoted or judged for it. I never implied that audiobooks are superior or inferior to reading physical books. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
