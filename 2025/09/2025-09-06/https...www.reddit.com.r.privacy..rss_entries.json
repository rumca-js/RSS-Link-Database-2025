About 2 years ago I bought Dr. Jart+ Cicapair for my skin. Occasionally I will use it if my skin is irritated. I\u2019ve used other products from the company before, such as the sunscreen. I didn\u2019t even remember what Cicapair was called, as it was a gift from an ex and I would just occasionally use it. That is to say, I have never googled it before or spoken about this specific product. Today I was using it and realized I was almost out, so I held the product in front of me and typed Dr. Ja\u2026 and as I typed I was suggested the exact product by Google.
