When I imagine having sex I\u2019d love to do that with a man but never with a woman meanwhile I find women really attractive, I love looking at \u2018em in sexy underwear like in Ariana\u2019s video dangerous woman (the video not the song) I have a lot of female crushes I love admiring the girls, when I think of kissing a woman it feels okay but yet it ain\u2019t making me horny. If I was in a relationship with a man I\u2019d love him and have sex with him but if I was in a relationship with a woman I\u2019d love her but I couldn\u2019t have sex with her.
