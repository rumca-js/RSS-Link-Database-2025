I am having a very hard time understanding the PUID and PGID SETUP. I understand the user permission aspect and security value etc.</p> <p>Where I am having trouble is this: how do I actually create a new user (I don&#39;t care what its PUID/GUID is tbh, but knowing how to specify would be great) and then chagne its permissions? This information is far more opaque to find. From what I understand I have to run docker commands, and that these are different than docker compose files. How do I access the shell to run these commands? Is this essentially me accessing the underlying kernel and creating a new user on it, then letting my little containers use this user to frolic around?</p> <p>Please let me know, it seems most guides forget that when one is completely new even some basic principles/practices are not clear!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a",

I have tried their learning centre on docker desktop, I have also searched docker for beginners on video and watched a couple but I don&#39;t find the learning centre or videos are for beginners with no knowledge. I know what docker is for and what container etc does after watching many videos so we can skip that. When it comes to actually learning to do things, none of the material is helpful. Ill give you an example. The learning centre on docker itself &quot;how do I run a container&quot; tells to clone repository. Provides a link. But how do you actually clone it? The next part says to run command cd welcome-to-docker and shows copy. Where am I supposed to copy and input this to? I can&#39;t be the only one finding this difficult. It&#39;s a learning guide but it&#39;s not teaching nothing. Also next part is also confusing. All the beginner guides for docker talk about it like we are supposed t",

I heard that might create conflicts, and seen that the right way is to only install it in Windows, and that would also install in your WSL2, but not sure about that as I&#39;ve seen a lot of people say that is better to just install docker in WSL2 and that&#39;s it, to basically forget about Windows as it has a bad implementation.</p> <p>What I&#39;d want is for a way to run my dockers that I run from windows, and also a way to run those that I run from WSL2.
