Ask &quot;What were the budget concerns raised last quarter?&quot; and it finds discussions that mention those concerns even if those exact words were not used, and synthesizes the information into a logical answer with citations. It uses semantic search to understand context, not just keyword matches. <a href=\"https://murtaza-nasir.github.io/speakr/screenshots\">Here are some screenshots</a>.</p> <p>Other notable additions are full internationalization (English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German available) and completely re-written documentation with MkDocs.</p> <p>All of it runs locally with no telemetry.

My idea is that email hosting is not recommended but at the same time there are sometimes limitations like the size of your inbox or missing protocols like IMAP which are limitations you could overcome by using a selfhosted server which fetches all your emails from the providers you use and allow you to use pretty much any client which will use IMAP to communicate to your sefhosted server.</p> <p>Is this something you are already doing?
