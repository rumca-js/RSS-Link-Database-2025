I used to be a bookworm as a child and would always read the biggest books with the smallest font and least amount of pictures in it. The books were usually within the phantasy or romace genre.</p> <p>Recently I&#39;ve seen a book written by Sigmund Freud about the interpretation of dreams and I haven&#39;t felt this excited about a book for years.That&#39;s probably because of his impact on medicine and me being within the medical field for years now lol</p> <p>I&#39;ve downloaded goodreads to make myself a TBR and look for books I&#39;d like to read but idk at this point I&#39;m just overwhelmed and lost.</p> <p>I&#39;d be open to read some classics, or books which would teach me something (even if it&#39;s an old book like the Sigmund Freud one).</p> <p>Anyways, I&#39;d love if you&#39;d give me some recommendations for books which would get me back into reading, or you could tell me about your favor",

Books for the horse enthusiasts. 2. I could dabble with fiction as well, but, I want interesting stories and altough I am a young adult I would prefer them witouth smut and sexual themes. I am more interested in the horse that in a steamy romantic story.</p> <p>They also need to be easy to buy as I am from Europe and it sucks when you can&#39;t find a book, only on Amazon.

But over the years I&#39;ve realised that my favourite books of all time are scifi with humour. </p> <p>My absolute favourites are Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir, and Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. I also loved those authors&#39; other books, but those two stand out. I&#39;ve read PHM 4 times in a year and a half. </p> <p>So I&#39;m looking for other similar books/authors. Particularly biology focused scifi, and the humour element in not essential but preferred.

I love them, but mental health issues have dogged my life and prevented me from maintaining the focus and motivation necessary to really indulge in literature.</p> <p>Recent changes in my medication regimen have dramatically improved my ability to read, and I&#39;ve been on a tear. Specifically, I&#39;ve been devouring Dostoevsky&#39;s early works and loving them. I&#39;ve recently read Poor Folk, The Landlady, Netochka Nezvanova, and Notes From Underground.</p> <p>I feel like I need to take a break from Dostoevsky for a bit, though. The depth of emotion in his writing can be draining. Can I get any recommendations for authors to look into next?</p> <p>Other books I&#39;ve really enjoyed have included Siddhartha by Herman Hesse, The Stranger by Albert Camus, and Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe. I also have a penchant for cosmic/folk/pagan horror like Lovecraft and Algernon Blackwood",
