In terms of cost, based on the fully domestic supply chain, the cost of this 22nm SRAM computing-in-memory chip is reduced by 4 times compared with that of 7nm chips.&quot;</p> </blockquote> <p>--- <a href=\"https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3462167968781702\">https://eu.36kr.com/en/p/3462167968781702</a></p> <p>To me this explains why there is so much interest in this from China (under the current export restrictions). But I have to admit that I would love to see the results when the same technology is implemented on a 7nm process node.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
