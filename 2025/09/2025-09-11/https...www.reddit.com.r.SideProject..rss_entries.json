Thought the beginning was a bit tiring with hiring and managing and just figuring out the whole thing. The training they give is good but it\u2019s still overwhelming. Went for some real models instead of AI but idk what works best. But feel like i got things in place and i see it\u2019s moving in a positive direction.
