It was broken, but I fixed it, and replaced it with modern parts like SD card and better battery, and even a wireless charger etc. But here&#39;s the thing: my music library is full of and high-res FLAC files downloaded in HiFi quality, and normal res FLACs ripped from CD. Turns out, the DACs on iPod Classics cannot fully decode HiFi FLAC files, they only support up to 16-bit/48kHz, and even then, playback is spotty with high sample rates. I tried a bunch of existing tools like foobar2000 or command-line hacks, but they either stripped metadata (bye-bye album art and tags), didn&#39;t handle batch conversion well, or required a ton of setup on Windows/macOS/Linux.</p> <p>Frustrated, I decided to build my own: <strong>Lilt</strong> (Lightweight Intelligent Lossless Transcoder).
