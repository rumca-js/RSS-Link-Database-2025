I&#39;m finally starting to get around to setting up my own music server for myself and some trusted friends/family to use to play all the CDs and MP3s we&#39;ve acquired over the years. I&#39;m currently running Navidrome with reverse proxy authentication through Pangolin to manage my users, but I&#39;m not really happy with this solution. I&#39;m looking for something that I can hook directly into Authentik using either SAML, LDAP, or OAuth.
