But her attempts to warn them are prevented. And she will later discover that Nemesis also threatens Rotor too. And the only thing that can save them both from Nemesis is her.</p> <p>This is definitely one of Asimov&#39;s more longer books, which is about 386 pages long.

The book examines how the persistent voice in our head (what Kross calls &quot;chatter&quot;) can become overwhelming, self-critical and harmful especially in moments of stress, uncertainty or decision making.</p> <p>Kross draws on decades of research, experiments and real life examples to show that this chatter is not simply a personal flaw but a universal human experience shaped by biology, culture, and circumstance.</p> <p><em>Chatter</em> dives deep exploring why we overthink and engage in negative self-talk, offering practical and actionable strategies like adopting a distant perspective, using rituals and connecting with nature to break harmful thought patterns.
