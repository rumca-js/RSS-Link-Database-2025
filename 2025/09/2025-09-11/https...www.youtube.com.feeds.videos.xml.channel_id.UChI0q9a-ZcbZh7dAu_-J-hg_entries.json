        "description": "With screens in schools now becoming a staple (as a result of the Project RED initiative and a \"one to one\" policy of devices to students)... the damaging effects are becoming clear. \n\nHowever, despite the fact that major technology companies like Intel or HP, and now Google or Apple continue to aggressively lobby for more, the executives at these silicon valley behemoths are deliberately creating distance for themselves, and especially their children from the very technology they help to promote. \n\nIts worth asking why the richest people in the world, who are responsible for making this technology, are so aggressively against it being used when it comes to *their own* children.\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nThe WIRE",
