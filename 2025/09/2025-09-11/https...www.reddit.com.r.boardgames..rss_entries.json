And could that technique be used on any other enemy too?</li> </ol> <p>Actually one other question , non movement related , with the Fear of the Unknown scenario 1, do you have to convince a juror with 4 successes in the same action , or can it be cumulative, basically wearing one juror down over multiple attempts.
