I installed the game in Linux mode (installing it on Wine threw and error and couldn&#39;t complete the installation. Error 256 I believe, but I#m not sure).

However, for whatever reason the LT and RT (dash) buttons do not work or rarely work properly. There is also issues with scrolling the inventory as well for RB and LB but those work perfect outside of it. These issues disappeared only after connecting an xbox controller wired. But that one has an issue where if I disconnect or reconnect it, it also exhibits the same issue as my 8BitDo.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried disabling steam input and such but to no effect for the linux build version. I&#39;ve also made sure the controller was independent of the issue by checking on the 1st game&#39;s linux version and it works flawless there. </p> <p>The only sure way I got it working was switching to proton but that&#39;s not really the native linux build.
