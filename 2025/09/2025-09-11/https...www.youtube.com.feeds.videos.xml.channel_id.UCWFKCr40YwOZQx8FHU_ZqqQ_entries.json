        "description": "Today we take apart the Google Pixel 10 PRO XL - to see if google has finally made it repairable. Get your own inexpensive Tello phone plan HERE: https://tello.com/?utm_source=partner&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=jre&src=partner&mdm=cpc&cmg=jre Historically google has been gluing their lithium batteries in place.

Easy even. \n\nGet my Teardown skin from dbrand HERE: https://www.dbrand.com/teardown\n\nYou know what's even easier though? Removing the screen of the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Its a pretty fool proof design. Easy enough even for the average Joe - (whos screen is already broken.)",
