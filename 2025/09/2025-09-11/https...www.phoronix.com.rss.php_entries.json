AMD EPYC 9005 performs exceptionally well compared to the competition from Intel and ARM CPU vendors. One area though I hadn't explored to this point was how well the AMD EPYC 9005 series performs for serving as the host CPU for GPU/AI servers. That changed as I recently wrapped up some benchmarks exploring that area using the AMD EPYC 9575F and it managed to accelerate past the available competition in proving capable of being the superior host processor for AI servers.",
