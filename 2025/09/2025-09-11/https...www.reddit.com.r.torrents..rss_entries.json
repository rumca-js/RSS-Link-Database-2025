Now I\u2019d like to add another client as a secondary option, which does require VPN protection. I know it\u2019s possible to bind the VPN to qBittorrent, but another application I use (slsk) doesn\u2019t support vpn binding.</p> <p>If I run the VPN system-wide, it interferes with services I host on my network (media server, SMB shares). That makes it tricky to stay protected without breaking local access.</p> <p>Is there a way to solve this so I can keep certain apps behind a VPN while keeping my local network services functional? I need to be careful since I\u2019m based in Germany.</p> <p>This is not about downloading or sharing copyrighted content.</p> <p>Thanks! \ud83d\ude42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ILoveComputer4553\"> /u/ILoveComputer4553 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1neae0e/vpn_question_i_am_new/\">[li",
