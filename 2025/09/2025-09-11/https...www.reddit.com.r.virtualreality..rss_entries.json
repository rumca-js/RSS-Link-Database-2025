I had the chance to test three different modules for the Pimax Crystal Super: the standard 50 PPD, the new 57 PPD, and the promising Ultrawide module. Since they all have the same price tag, the decision comes down to the tech. And let me tell you, there were more surprises than I expected.</p> <p><strong>The 57 PPD Module: A Promise of Unmatched Clarity</strong></p> <p>Pimax markets the 57 PPD module with a promise of better sharpness and clarity, thanks to a higher pixel density and new lenses. The catch? You have to sacrifice the field of view. Full of anticipation, I put on the headset right after using the 50 PPD version for a direct comparison. And... honestly, I was disappointed. You practically need a magnifying glass to see the difference in sharpness. Maybe if you have eagle eyes or are looking at tiny text from a distance, you mi",

What I\u2019m looking for: - price up to 500$, would prefer something that\u2019s about 300-400$, cannot afford anything else for now - I would be using it for pc, so something that can connect to steam - I wear glasses and have bad vision so it would be nice if it had the eye correction thingy (since I\u2019m not sure if every headset has it!) - I don\u2019t need anything really fancy since I would be mostly using it for workout purposes (so something like Beat Saber and other things) and won\u2019t be playing any high graphics games I was looking at Oculus mostly for now, but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019re what I\u2019m looking for so I\u2019m open to hear about every brand that suits the category.

I dont know if I&#39;m extremely unlucky but they&#39;ve all just stopped working on me over the years. Does anyone know any other headsets that wouldnt break the bank and arent meta or psvr? I genuinely have been very careful with them, I never physically damaged them, each just lasted about a year before breaking. I currently have the psvr2 but now the tracking jitters nonstop and the right controller keeps disconnecting, mind you it all worked perfectly the day beforehand and the couple months beforehand. I was personally thinking of a budget up to 800?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/veeem2\"> /u/veeem2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ndxm9x/gone_through_4_headsets/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comment",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys, I currently own the original quest 2 from 2020, and to be honest, I definitely realized recently it\u2019s at the end of its life. It phases through blocks in beat saber, the resolution isn\u2019t the best compared to other new ones I\u2019ve seen, and it\u2019s overall just getting old for me. I don\u2019t know much about current PCVR headsets; honestly just the Vive and Valve Index, and the VP2 is when I really stopped looking at headsets (besides when I saw the quest 3/3S). What should I buy? I\u2019m definitely looking for lighthouse tracking because inside out isn\u2019t cutting it for my needs anymore, and also I would like (if possible) pancake lenses or just wider lenses in general. My eyes get really strained on the fresnel lenses, so yeah. I\u2019m open to spend up to like $1300, if that\u2019s a good price, and this might sound stupid but I have a 1660 Ti as my GPU, but yes don\u2019t worry I\u2019m upgrading my pc too. What would you guys reccomend? Thanks!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",
