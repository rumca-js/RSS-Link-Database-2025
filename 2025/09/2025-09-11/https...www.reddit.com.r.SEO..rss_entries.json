We have an external consultant providing SEO and PPC support and I have stupidly taken my eye off the ball and assumed everything was going fine on the SEO front, but I&#39;ve just realised our organic rankings have dropped significantly and we&#39;re only on page one for a few key search terms. We are parting ways with the external consultant at the end of this month and I&#39;m not sure what to do next or even where we have gone wrong in recent months to have dropped so much. This year alone the site has had 55 new blog articles added to it as well as other content updates. The consultant&#39;s mantra has always been that we don&#39;t have enough content on the site, but from what I can tell, our competitors who are ranking much higher than we are have far less than we do. I&#39;m not an SEO expert (far from it) so any insights or pointers welcome.</p> </div><",
