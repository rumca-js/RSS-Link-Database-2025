For 1991 this is pretty good and for the A500, OCS graphics. I&#39;m surprised how overlooked this game is, as everyone when it come to movie tie in on the Amiga goes on about Batman game or Robocop. But hardly anyone bring up this. Now gameplay not amazing, but the level of detail and animation in some of these level is dam right impressive. Shame it got overlooked, hoping to change that. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_",
