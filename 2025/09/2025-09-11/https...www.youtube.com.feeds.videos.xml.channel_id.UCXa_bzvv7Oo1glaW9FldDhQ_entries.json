        "description": "Move over Mario, there\u2019s a new challenger on the grid - Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is shaping up to be every bit as good as Mario Kart. CrossWorlds blends the iconic rush of Sonic speed with a suite of inventive mechanics to make every race unpredictable. \n\nDynamic tracks which shift and reshape with every lap, deep vehicle customisation, and smart systems like Gadgets and Rivals introduce a strategic depth the series has longed for. \n\nSonic\u2019s racing pedigree isn\u2019t just style over substance anymore. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is Sega\u2019s push for karting supremacy - it\u2019s bold and chaotic on the surface, yet surprisingly refined underneath. This feature will outline 15 things you need to know before you buy.",

        "description": "Borderlands 4 won't exactly rewrite the action RPG looter formula, and it doesn't necessarily overhaul the core gameplay loop that sticks out in an age of deterministic crafting, extensive end-game systems, and whatnot. And as enjoyable as exploring the world or annihilating baddies can be when you're not experimenting to find that next game-breaking build, there are more than \u201cifs\u201d and \u201cbuts\u201d to keep it from offering something truly iconic like, say, Borderlands 2.\n\nNevertheless, it certainly feels like Gearbox has emerged from the specter of the second game, lending a contemporary feel to the franchise without sacrificing everything that makes it unique. Borderlands 4 is as much of a comeback as it is a step forward - whatever that means for the narrative's future, it's an enjoyable experience for long-time fans and looter shooter enthusiasts alike.",
