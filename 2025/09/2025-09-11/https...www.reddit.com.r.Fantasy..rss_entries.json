Long story short I have a form of I guess &#39;mild? &#39; Aphantasia where I can&#39;t picture things in my mind very well. Essentially not at all. Which may be why I have so much trouble with audiobooks. </p> <p>I was able to enjoy Dungeon Crawler Carl, Cradle(which I find has been my all time favorite books), the first few Dark Tower, Red Rising, and First Law. But literally everything I&#39;ve tried afterwards ive not been able to finish which has been the first book of: Greenbone Saga, Assassin&#39;s Apprentice, Tigana, Gideon the 9th, The Devils, got 2 books into Scholomance but it was meh, Senlin Ascends, Malice. </p> <p>I just can&#39;t seem to focus/nothing keeps my attention.
