The event confirmed Einstein\u2019s relativity, Hawking\u2019s horizon theorem, and Kerr\u2019s spinning black hole model. By capturing the merger of two 32-solar-mass black holes, scientists gained the clearest view of black hole physics, offering new insights into gravity\u2019s quantum links.",

Though the difference seems minor, sensor and pixel size affect light capture, detail, and low-light performance. The company is tipped to not incorporate any changes to this as the device nears mass production.",
