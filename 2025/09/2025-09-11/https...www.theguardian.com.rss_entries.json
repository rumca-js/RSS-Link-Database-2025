It has been a whirlwind week for the 60-year-old who has replaced Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and it will be fascinating to see what changes are made to the team\u2019s style. Nuno is a cautious coach and would have plotted a counterattacking approach at the Emirates Stadium, but there are no guarantees with Postecoglou. Pragmatism is a word rarely associated with the Australian but he needs to get his players onside quickly after the unfortunate departure of his predecessor, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/09/nottingham-forest-part-company-with-head-coach-nuno-espirito-santo\">was not dismissed for footballing reasons</a>.

(Singer-songwriter Myles Smith, who was just into his teens when Sheeran released his breakthrough album +, even plays one of those little acoustic guitars that have long been Sheeran\u2019s trademark.)

Forty years later, I set out to find it</p><p>I don\u2019t remember the picture being taken. Somewhere in Scotland, sometime in the 1980s. It has that hazy quality you get with old colour prints: warm but also somehow melancholy. I\u2019m wearing blue jeans, white trainers, an army surplus jumper \u2013 and am perched on a standing stone.</p><p>My mum gave me the photo when I turned 50. She found it up in the loft. Some of these childhood pictures, souvenirs of trips with my grandparents to historic sites, have the place names written on the back. This one was blank, a tantalising mystery. Though I didn\u2019t recognise the location, something about the landscape and quality of light suggested it was Islay, an island I\u2019d visited just once \u2013 when I was not quite 12. So I decided to see if I could find the spot, slipped the photograph into my notebook and set off.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/sep/11/",

It appears to be a metaphor for racism and capitalism, for exploitation and for the historically hidden violence built into the foundations of ownership. Yet how exactly the metaphor works is unclear; it is like a labyrinth in which characters and audience can get disoriented. The final shot shows someone reading Frantz Fanon\u2019s The Wretched of the Earth.
