        "description": "Researchers have discovered that everyday substances like caffeine can influence how bacteria such as E. coli respond to antibiotics. By examining 94 common drugs and food ingredients, scientists found that certain compounds trigger genetic regulators that control bacterial transport proteins, altering what gets inside the cells. In the case of caffeine, this led to reduced uptake of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, weakening its effectiveness.",

        "description": "Researchers at NYU Langone Health discovered that cutting off blood flow accelerates cancer growth by prematurely aging the bone marrow and weakening the immune system. In mouse models, restricted blood flow doubled the growth rate of breast tumors, mimicking changes seen during aging. The study found that ischemia reprograms bone marrow stem cells, skewing the immune system toward cells that suppress rather than fight cancer.",
