        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Today I learned that adding -ai to Google search does not in fact stop the environmental cost of creating the AI Overview. It just doesn&#39;t show it to you, but it still makes it. Or that&#39;s my understanding from doing some reading (including, ironically, from the AI Overview). From reading up on duckduckgo, it looked to me like the same story - you can request a view without the AI search results so you don&#39;t have to see them, but it still costs as much energy-wise as a search with it turned on. 99% of the time I search, I don&#39;t need or want AI results. I&#39;m fine with manually hitting a toggle/button on the rare occasion I do and waiting a bit for it to come in. Are there alternative search engines that either don&#39;t have ai features or that let you actually disable them? Or am I wrong and one of those actually lets you disable it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/incandescentin",
