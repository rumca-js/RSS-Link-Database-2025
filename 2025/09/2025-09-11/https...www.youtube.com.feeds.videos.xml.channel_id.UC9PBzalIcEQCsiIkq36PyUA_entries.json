Join the DF Supporter Program and support the team: https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx\n\nWe had the chance to go hands-on with a very special PC demo of Phantom Blade Zero at Gamescom 2025, running maxed out with RT features. John and Alex compare notes on what seems to be an Unreal Engine 5 title that isn't actually using all of its cutting-edge features - but impresses nonetheless.\n\nGo here to check out DF merch! https://store.digitalfoundry.net\n\nSubscribe for more Digital Foundry: http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe",
