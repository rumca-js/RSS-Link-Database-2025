I was surprised it never crossed my mind to add this functionality. It was mostly set up for n8n, but I spent most of my morning editing the code to be more platform agnostic and have preset configurations for Discord, MS Teams, and Slack. I tested out Slack and Discord presets mostly. The preset for Teams has not been tested, but there is a custom payload field that users can edit as needed to fit whatever shape their webhook call needs to be in. Happy automating!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tbosk\"> /u/tbosk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1nejanb/mkfd_update_webhook_configuration_support/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1nejanb/mkfd_update_webhook_configurati",
