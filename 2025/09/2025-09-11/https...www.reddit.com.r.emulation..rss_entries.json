Do you think any of the CPUs that are already out can future proof ShadPS4 once it gets more optimized? Or would it need even better CPUs than what we have? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ultimatesaber27\"> /u/Ultimatesaber27 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1nef5ej/does_shadps4_benefit_from_avx512/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1nef5ej/does_shadps4_benefit_from_avx512/\">[c",
