This is subjective but objectively Linux as a whole lacks an identifying look that make people think at a glance &quot;Yep, that&#39;d be Linux&quot; unlike Windows and MacOS where the GUI is easily recognized.</li> <li>Resource usage. Window tiling managers could potentially lower RAM usage for PCs and laptops, especially when not running resource hungry applications.

Are there any benefits to arch when I am already happy with bazzite? I mean lets be real, I will probably try it anyway, such is the tinkerers life, but i can&#39;t help but need to ask xD </p> </div><!-- S",
