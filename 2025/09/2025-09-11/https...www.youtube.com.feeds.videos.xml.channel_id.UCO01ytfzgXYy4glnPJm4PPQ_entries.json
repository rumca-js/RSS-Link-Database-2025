I have a lot to say, and I also don't know what to say, at the same time. I\u2019m devastated. Heartbroken. And very, very angry. I\u2019ll try to talk through some of that today, because I just want to talk about Charlie, who he was, the legacy he leaves behind, and where we go from here.\n\n#MattWalsh #TheMattWalshShow #News #Politics #DailyWire #WhatIsAWoman",
