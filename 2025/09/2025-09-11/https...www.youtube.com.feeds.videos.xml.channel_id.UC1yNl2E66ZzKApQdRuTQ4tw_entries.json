Stay fully informed on events around the world with Ground News.\n\nOur universe started with an incredibly rapid phase of expansion, growing exponentially before that expansion eventually slowed down. This idea is called \u201cinflation,\u201d but physicists are still unsure what caused the rapid expansion and why it stopped. In a new paper, researchers say they\u2019ve come up with an elegant new explanation for that inflation. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/vfny-pgc2\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newslett",
