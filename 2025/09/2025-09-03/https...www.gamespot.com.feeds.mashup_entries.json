        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Octopath Traveler has always been the kind of old-school, massive retro game that real RPG sickos can sink our teeth into. The original pitch--a sprawling game that tracks the individual stories of eight different party members, each with their own individualized skills in both combat and towns, who then come together to face some grave threat--can easily last dozens of hours, and so far has across two games. Octopath Traveler 0, a prequel to the other two games, takes that foundation and adds even more: expanded customization, townbuilding with farming, larger party sizes, and quests that feed back into all of the other systems. It's enough to be absolutely daunting, but in the best of ways.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In a lengthy Gamescom demo, I was able to see the barest outlines of many of the new systems at play. For starters, Octopath 0 has a primary protagonist: a custom character you create yourself. We didn't have a chance to tinker with the character creator, but our sess",

Over in Europe, prospective PS5 owners might have to settle for a Sony console that offers less, as it has been reported that the internal SSD capacity is being shrunk so that Sony can avoid raising the price of the hardware yet again.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963176345380270359\">According to leaker Billbil-kun</a>, the PS5 Digital Edition SSD will shrink from 1TB to 825GB starting with the next console chassis-E revision when it's available to purchase on September 13. As Billbil-kun noted, PS5 Digital Edition consoles originally sold for \u20ac399 when they launched in 2020, with the price increasing to \u20ac449 and \u20ac499 (around $582) eventually. The regular PS5 console with a disc drive is expected to retain its 1TB SSD.</p><div data-embed-type=\"tweet\" data-src=\"https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1",
