But it&#39;s good if it doesn&#39;t make sense because WE&#39;RE not supposed to make sense. Like yes, I&#39;m a girl-boy and a boy-girl, but at the same time I&#39;m nothing, but also a girl but also not but also am, and a boy but not actually, like everything put into a blender but also nothing at all. Yes I&#39;m a lesbian but also some kind of aroace but also interested in romance. Does that make sense to you? Probably not, but that&#39;s fine because it makes sense to ME because It is MY identity. I might not understand yours, but what matters is it makes sense to YOU. That&#39;s one of the most beautiful things that comes with being queer imo; its up to you what you are.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Amazing_Assumpt",

They had something happen in their life which caused them to loose their direction in life, and it doesnt help that during our relationship I&#39;ve been trying to be a safe place for them. Helping them become vulnerable, soft, and safe to share their emotions with. With that they&#39;ve been able to explore more about themselves, had deeper relationships with their friends (from my perspective at least). They have been recently experiencing gender dysphoria, and struggling to find their place in the world again. </p> <p>I really want to help them, but when they talked about our relationship changing despite them being the same person I couldn&#39;t get into it. I&#39;m not into women, despite experimenting in middle school with two relationships. I don&#39;t want to be the reason they don&#39;t transition and find happiness.. I don&#39;t want to hold them",
