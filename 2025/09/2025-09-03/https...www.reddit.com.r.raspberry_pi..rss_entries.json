Is there any way to transfer to Lite without having to do a clean install? The reason I say this is because I have a bunch of IOT servers and packages installed that I don\u2019t want to reinstall and do all over again, just looking for a quick transfer.

I set up a systemd service to copy state.json into ~/.config/con.raspberrypi.connect/state.json on first boot, but now I\u2019m unsure whether this approach will reliably work or if I\u2019ll run into device collisions or other issues. i tried it in our office but I keep getting &quot;Authentication failed&quot; and some checks failed. </p> <p>Honestly the re",

I&#39;ve already tried plugging it in directly, but it doesn&#39;t seem to respond. I&#39;m using an official Raspberry Pi 5 and the fan is connected to a dedicated connector for the fans. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a wiring problem, a software problem, or maybe the fan is just faulty. Any advice would be appreciated! How do you usually test a fan on a Raspberry Pi? Should I try to power it externally or is there a way to check it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lisek122\"> /u/Lisek122 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1n7c4ks/the_fan_wont_work_it_never_spins_and_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1n7c4ks/the_fan_wont_work_it_never_spins_and_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",
