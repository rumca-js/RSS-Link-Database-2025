This talk focuses on some roles that demand writing code, managing data and automating workflows despite having no formal training in Software Engineering. When teams function like software engineering groups but lack the foundational practices and tools to ensure reliability, maintainability, and security, the consequences include inefficiencies, avoidable errors, and an unmanaged technical debt machine. This talk explores the challenges for software engineers that could bridge the gap between necessity and expertise, hoping we can ensure decades of software engineering progress aren't lost.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/a",
