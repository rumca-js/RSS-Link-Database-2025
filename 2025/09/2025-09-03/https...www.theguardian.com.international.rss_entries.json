It\u2019s very popular in southern Europe, where there are hundreds of recipes to choose from. The salting draws out some of the water and improves the fish\u2019s flavour and texture, and it\u2019s a method that pre-dates refrigeration, when salt was used to preserve food. <em>Esqueixada</em> is a Catalan salad of sorts that\u2019s fresh, cooling and utterly delicious. The fried hake, meanwhile, is a little heavier, but addictive and perfect for sharing with a cold aperitif. Both are regulars on our summer menu, and we often flip between the two.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/catalan-fish-salad-and-fried-salted-hake-recipe-william-gleave\">Continue reading...</a>",
