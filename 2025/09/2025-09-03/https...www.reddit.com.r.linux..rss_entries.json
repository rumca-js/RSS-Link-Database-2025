I used a Windows Surface Pro 7, and ironically, Windows 11 was choking my computer, to the point where I could not even use my desktop without lag, let alone get any work done. Battery life was also abysmal, and I could not even make it through a 3 hour class session. I was also sick of their bloat, spyware, and telemetry, everything we often hear on this subreddit.</p> <p>I started with ubuntu, but quickly transitioned to Debian and then to Arch, finding a happy home in Arch Linux for over a year. It was a learning curve, but I had a lot of fun learning the operating system and was able to get almost everything I needed working, with the exception of one app for which I used a virtual machine. Recently, I have been playing with Nix, and I love that I can keep everything in one config file!</p> <p>Only one problem: fwupd does",
