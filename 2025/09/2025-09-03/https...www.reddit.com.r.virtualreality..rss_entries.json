Yk that this device is kinda old and outdated so i wanna buy a new vr for chrismas. i was thinking maybe the meta 3s because it&#39;s cheap, but peaple say that the difference from the original 3 is big. In my entire vr experience ive tried multiple headsets (quest 2, psvr 1,htc vive og), but never tryed a device with pankake lenses before. Is it a good investment the meta 3s over the rift s? Is the image quality gonna be little or much better than my current one?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BoW_WOW-it\"> /u/BoW_WOW-it </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1n7190s/just_a_regular_upgrade_from_the_rift_s_to_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1n7190s/just_a_regular_upgrade_from_the_rift_s_to_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",
