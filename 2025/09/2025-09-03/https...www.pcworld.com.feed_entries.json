But today you can get one with a full 32GB, practically bougie, for under $300. Newegg\u2019s official eBay store has an HP EliteBook <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/306472201389\">for just $260.99 right now</a>, so long as you\u2019re okay with a refurbished unit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EliteBook 845 G8 isn\u2019t all that, well, elite, in my opinion. Notably its 256GB storage is positively miserly at this point, and while the 6-core AMD Ryzen Pro 5650U CPU is decent, its Zen 4 architecture is a little long in the tooth \u2014 this processor came out in 2021 and still uses DDR4 RAM. But to make up for all of that, 32GB of RAM should be enough to load this thing down with dozens of browser tabs without breaking a sweat. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If y",

If the answer is \u201cnever enough,\u201d then Acer would like a word. Its new 27-inch OLED is hitting 720Hz, more than enough to bring the most intense gaming PCs to their knees with newer titles. The company is also showing off a cheaper IPS-LCD that can hit 275Hz. <br><br>The Predator X27 U is the speed demon here, hitting 720Hz\u2026with a notable catch. That incredible speed comes from cutting down the resolution to 1280\u00d7720, half of the monitor\u2019s native 1440p resolution \u2014 a tradeoff that esports pros might just be willing to make. If you\u2019re maxing out the pixels, the maximum speed is still a <em>very incredibly fast </em>540Hz. Other pluses include USB Type-C support for video (90 watts) in addition to HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, .01ms response time, 555 peak nits of brightness (335 typical), and 99 percent DCI-P",
