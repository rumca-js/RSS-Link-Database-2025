Between, Lidarr, soulseek, slskd, picard, navidrome, plex amp, and other things I am very confused about the best option or workflow. I am not new to selfhosting. I created a Plex server with help from a few reddit subs using unraid on a beelink mini pc with 18 TB DAS, so I am familar with teh AAR stack and some of the background stuff. I am on a handful of private trackers (including music trackers) and also usenet. We use Plex to watch TV and movies and I also maintain an Audiobookshelf collection of audio books for my SO. She listens to them on Palapa.</p> <p>I am looking to use Lidarr or something like it so myself and my SO can request music on our phones (both iPhones) or while at home on the network and then play them on our phones (in the car as well) or just at home.</p> <p>Anyone have any suggestions with some explanation for a si",

I am pleased to announce the release of <a href=\"https://github.com/NucleoFusion/cruise\"><em>Cruise</em></a>. <em>Cruise</em> is a powerful, intuitive, and fully-featured Open Source TUI app for interacting with Docker. It offers a visually rich, keyboard-first experience for managing containers, images, volumes, networks, logs and more \u2014 all from your terminal.</p> <p>Ever felt that docker CLI is too lengthy or limited? Find yourself executing commands again and again for stats? Or wrote a full multi line command just for a typo to ruin it? Well... Fret no more. Cruise - Is a TUI Docker Client, fitting easily in your terminal-first dev workflow, while making repetitive Docker work easy and fun.</p> <blockquote> <p>How is <em>cruise</em> different from existing solutions?</p> </blockquote> <p>Existing applications are limited in what they do, they serve as mostly a monitoring service, <em>not</em> a management service let alone a Client.</p> ",

However, I&#39;m at a small stop gap, and I need help from the selfhosted community. I need some people willing to sign up for the testing program and download the app in order to get them posted officially to the store fronts. You don&#39;t even really have to use it (though I would really appreciate it if you gave it a try as Pinepods has really made strides in becoming the best it can be as one of the most feature rich Podcast platforms around) I just need people to join the programs and install the apps i",

The idea for this project was because I was annoyed there was no good way to view all my workflows across multiple repositories in the same organization. We have over 80 repositories within our organization all with different workflows so it can be extremely cumbersome to go into each to look at the jobs that are running,failed,etc.</p> <p>It is also annoying there is no central place to manage self hosted runners which is what we primarily use. </p> <p>The last thing is notifications not being centralized.</p> <p>So I started working on a solution that fixes these 3 things. 1. Centralized dashboard of all jobs, and workflows as well as detailed views of each workflow. 2. Centralized runner dashboard 3. Notifications for failed jobs , and successful jobs.</p> <p>I want to make this project fully open source and was just curious if there is even a need/want for so",
