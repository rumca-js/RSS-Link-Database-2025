        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Actions Dashboard</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working on a project that I\u2019m calling pipeline vision. The idea for this project was because I was annoyed there was no good way to view all my workflows across multiple repositories in the same organization. We have over 80 repositories within our organization all with different workflows so it can be extremely cumbersome to go into each to look at the jobs that are running,failed,etc.</p> <p>It is also annoying there is no central place to manage self hosted runners which is what we primarily use. </p> <p>The last thing is notifications not being centralized.</p> <p>So I started working on a solution that fixes these 3 things. 1. Centralized dashboard of all jobs, and workflows as well as detailed views of each workflow. 2. Centralized runner dashboard 3. Notifications for failed jobs , and successful jobs.</p> <p>I want to make this project fully open source and was just curious if there is even a need/want for so",
