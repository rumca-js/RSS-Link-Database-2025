Please people I am desperate all I\u2019ve been getting for that trope is a werewolf mafia boss MMC and a human FMC is it so wrong to want a shifter romance where the FMC isn\u2019t just some dumb blond that got stuck in the woods, I just want the girl to do or have something. Or even a story where the guy isn\u2019t the entity of the book. Yes I want Smut but I also want character and not just a quick fuck.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Have a friend who&#39;s doing 6 to 10 I send them two or three books a month. I don&#39;t have as much time as he does to read of course. I&#39;ve been sitting him books that I&#39;ve read and enjoyed. But I need some suggestions outside of the box or even some adult content books if you catch my drift, there&#39;s no adult material out in jail unless it&#39;s in the book form. Other than that he likes adventure mystery even horror. I pretty much down to send him whatever book would be a great suggestion. Just to clarify in case it matters he was in trouble for some white collar crime. Like tax evasion through his business or something like that I don&#39;t really know the details but he&#39;s a pretty good dude so I thought I&#39;d send him some books.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TrainCar007\"> /u/TrainCar007 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1n7kp7b/b",

It would be even better if romance was not discussed at all. This is one reason why I was always hesitant to read books, the idea that a romance will blossom within it. I have read fanfiction of movie/tv shows, but with fanfiction I know exactly what im getting when it comes to the relationships that will be discussed. Books are not the same. </p> <p>So far im choosing to ready thrillers/mystery cause I imagine they will have little romance. I have read Lockdown by Peter May, then I tried reading The Alienist by Caleb Carr but couldn&#39;t get into it. Now im reading Someone&#39;s In The Attic by Andrea Mara. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Embarrassed_But_Here\"> /u/Embarrassed_But_Here </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comment",

I loved \u201cFingersmith\u201d and \u201cTipping the Velvet,\u201d both of which had major plot twists that caught me by surprise, so I was having some fun trying to predict this one. Well folks - I reached the end, I reached the twist, and it was not fun! I didn\u2019t like it at all! Looking back at the book, from a literary perspective it\u2019s a very well crafted story, but from the perspective of a lesbian who was hoping for something even a little bit resembling a positive ending for the main characters together, this was NOT it. I actually usually make a point of avoiding books with gut-wrenching endings because that might be some people\u2019s cup of tea, but it isn\u2019t mine - I want escapism and hope and at least the notion of good in t",
