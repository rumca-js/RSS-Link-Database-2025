My thoughts: AI is rapidly transforming the job market while millions of roles are being displaced, even more new jobs requiring advanced skills are emerging.

We plan to make an interactive lecture, like students will prepare their projects and such. The scope of this lecture will be from the early ages of AI starting from perceptron, to image recognition and classification algorithms, to the latest LLMs and such. Students that will take this class are from 2nd grade of Bachelor\u2019s degree. What projects can we give to them? Consider that their computers might not be the best, so it should not be heavily dependent on real time computational power. </p> <p>My first idea was to use the VRX simulation environment and the Perception task of it. Which basically sets a clear roadline to collect dataset, label them, train the model and such. Any other homework ideas related to AI is much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",

The agent runs in isolated hardware so even the developers can&#39;t access the private keys.</p> <p>But here&#39;s what&#39;s keeping me up at night... if agents can autonomously manage money, what happens when they start creating their own economies?

Wait until lawmakers understand what these models actually do with personal data. The only sustainable way forward is privacy preserving AI and models need to train and run on encrypted data. Sounds impossible but it&#39;s happening now with confidential computing. Been using phala network for our production models and the performance hit is minimal. Customers actually prefer it because they know their data is protected. But here&#39;s the thing most companies aren&#39;t prepared for. When privacy laws get strict only companies with privacy preserving infrastructure will survive. Everyone else will be legally unable to operate. We might see an AI winter where capability exists but legal framework prevents deployment unless we solve privacy now, all this progress could be frozen. What&#39;s your take? Are we heading ",
