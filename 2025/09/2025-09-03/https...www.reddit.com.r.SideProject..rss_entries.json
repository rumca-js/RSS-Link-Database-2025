If the headline is ass, the rest doesn\u2019t matter.</li> <li><strong>Say who your product is NOT for.</strong> It feels risky, but it builds trust and makes the right audience lean in.</li> <li><strong>Damaging admissions build credibility.</strong> \u201cWe\u2019re not the cheapest, but we are the fastest\u201d works better than pretending you\u2019re perfect.</li> <li><strong>Urgency only works if it\u2019s real.</strong> Fake countdown timers just kill trust long term.</li> </ul> <p>There are 12 of these in total, but even applying just one of them can increase conversions.</p> <p>I",
