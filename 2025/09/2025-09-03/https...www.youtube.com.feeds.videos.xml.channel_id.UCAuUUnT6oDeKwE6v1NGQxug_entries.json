        "description": "How to find and create Joy in your life -- what is joy? And what is its purpose in our lives? We talk with Ingrid about how to cultivate more joy in our daily lives, especially when we don't feel particularly in the headspace for joy, and about how our design choices can have a huge impact on the way we perceive joy in our environment. We also talk with her about her book Joyful and her TED talk. \n\nFollow\nHost: Chris Duffy (Instagram: @chrisiduffy | chrisduffycomedy.com)\nGuest: Ingrid Fetell Lee (Instagram: @ingridfetell | @aestheticsofjoy) \n\nLinks\nBook: Joyful: The Surprising Power of Ordinary Things to Create Extraordinary Happiness\naestheticsofjoy.com/\n\nSubscribe to TED \nInstagram: @ted\nYouTube: @TED\nTikTok: @tedtoks\nLinkedIn: @ted-conferences\nWebsite: ted.com\nPodcasts: ted.com/podcasts\n\nJoin us in person at a TED conference: https://tedtalks.social/events\nBecome a TED Member to support our mission: https://ted.com/membership\nSubscribe to a TED newsletter: https://ted.com/newslette",
