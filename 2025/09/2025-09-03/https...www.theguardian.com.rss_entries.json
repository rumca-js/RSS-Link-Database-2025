The system was also used for this year\u2019s Club World Cup and, in the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/sep/01/oasis-tickets-dynamic-pricing-live-music\">drew widespread complaints</a> from fans buying tickets for Oasis\u2019s comeback tour.</p><p>The use of dynamic pricing was one of a few new details Fifa officials discussed around ticketing for the World Cup one week before sales open, including the first collection of prices. The cheapest tickets will start at $60 (\u00a344), with the most expensive, for a prime spot at the final, starting at $6,730 (\u00a35,760).

It\u2019s a comedy smorgasbord that is as random as it is funny, and will feel like a glorious throwback for fans of their 00s series That Mitchell and Webb Look. And this time they have brought some friends, with guest appearances on Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping including Ghosts\u2019 Kiell Smith-Bynoe and podcaster and Taskmaster star Stevie Martin. We caught up with the pair to chat about Gogglebox, The Two Ronnies, Downton Abbey and snooker.</p><p><strong>A recurring joke in the show is that the younger comedians you feature </strong><strong>think you are a couple of old farts.

Please sit up straight and pay attention while I make this very serious in-flight announcement: the airline industry should prevent all seats in basic economy from reclining until the general public has shown they know how to use them responsibly. And by \u201cuse them responsibly\u201d I mean: don\u2019t recline. Or, if you must, do so courteously and not for the entire flight.</p><p>Now, I understand a blanket ban might not be a popular solution. But it is the fairest and most utilitarian approach; whatever small degree of comfort you may achieve by being able to lean back a few inches is outweighed by the misery you inflict on the person behind you.
