        "description": "Cronos: The New Dawn reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X|S, PC, macOS, and Nintendo Switch 2. \n\n\"Cronos: The New Dawn presents an intriguing mystery to unravel and a creepy sci-fi hellscape to explore, but its run-of-the-mill combat system prevents it from stepping out of the shadows cast by survival-horror heavyweights like Dead Space and Resident Evil 4. Its oppressively bleak environments are rich with interesting details to pore over, and a handful of its boss fights provoke a level of desperation that make them genuinely thrilling to survive, but elsewhere there\u2019s clear padding that trips up the story\u2019s momentum for considerable stretches at a time, and its predictable shock tactics are a step down from Silent Hill 2\u2019s genuine scares. Like a Traveler\u2019s corpse that\u2019s trapped inside a temporal apocalypse, Cronos: The New Dawn contains the essence of survival horror, but there\u2019s not quite enough spark in it to really bring it to life.\"",
