The SwRI project developed the mission design, scientific objectives, payload and key requirements based on previous interstellar object (ISO) detections. Using the recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS, the team validated the mission concept, determining that 3I/ATLAS could have been intercepted and observed by the proposed spacecraft.",

Eventually it exploded as a supernova, and its remnant is one of the most studied supernova remnants (SNR). It's called Cassiopeia A (Cas A) and new observations with the Chandra X-ray telescope are revealing more details about its demise.",
