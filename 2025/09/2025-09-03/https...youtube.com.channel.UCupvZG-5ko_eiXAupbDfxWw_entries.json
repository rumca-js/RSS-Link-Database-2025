The president has not leaned on the 1798 law for removals since mid-March, when his invocation of it sparked the first in a series of legal challenges. \n\nTuesday\u2019s ruling is notable because it\u2019s likely the vehicle through which the issue will reach the Supreme Court for the justices to potentially review Trump\u2019s use of the law in full.\n\nCNN crime and justice correspondent Katelyn Polantz reports. #CNN #News",

While more than 30,000 pages were made public, the committee\u2019s release may not represent the totality of the Epstein-related documents in the Justice Department\u2019s possession and congressional Democrats have said they largely included previously known information. Still, the files \u2013 which include flight logs, court filings, jail surveillance footage, redacted records, depositions and memos \u2013 fuel intrigue in a case that has at times driven a wedge between President Donald Trump and his own party. #CNN #News",

        "description": "Miles of white sand, turquoise waters, and rows of pristine beachfront hotels line the shore at the newly built Wonsan-Kalma resort. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hopes the development will be his country\u2019s answer to Waikiki. But there\u2019s one problem: the tourists aren\u2019t there. When CNN reviewed footage from the resort, which opened in June, only a handful of Russians could be seen on the vast stretches of beach. The rest of the area appeared empty.\n\nThe Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone has long been one of Kim Jong Un\u2019s pet projects, frequently showcased in state media. Its pastel-colored hotels, water parks and beachfront promenades were built to broadcast a message: North Korea is open for business.\n\nThe reality on the ground tells a different story. Strict Covid-19 protocols remain in place. Tourists are limited almost entirely to tightly managed Russian groups. Chinese and Western visitors are still banned.\n\nCNN senior international correspondent Will Ripley reports. #CNN #News",
