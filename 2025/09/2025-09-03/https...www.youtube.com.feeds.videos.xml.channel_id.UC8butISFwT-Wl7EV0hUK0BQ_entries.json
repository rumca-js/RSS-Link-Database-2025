        "description": "Build your own functional AI coding agent from the ground up using Python and the free Gemini Flash API. This project-based tutorial provides a deep understanding of how powerful AI tools work by guiding you through the creation of an agentic loop powered by tool calling. You will implement the core abilities for your agent to interact with and modify a codebase, including reading files, writing to files, and executing code to get feedback. \n\nLane Wagner created this course.\n\nCheck out the interactive version of the course on boot.dev: https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-ai-agent-python\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Support for this channel comes from our friends at Scrimba \u2013 the coding platform that's reinvented interactive learning: https://scrimba.com/freecodecamp\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n- 00:00:00 Introduction\n- 00:01:14 Why Build an AI Agent?\n- 00:01:49 Course Overview & What We're Building\n- 00:02:25 How to Follow Along\n- 00:03:47 What is an AI Agent?
