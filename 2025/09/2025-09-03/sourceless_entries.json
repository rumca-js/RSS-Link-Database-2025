While everyone else was talking about phasers and blasters, V gave us something totally different: sleek, brutalist weapons that somehow looked cooler than anything in Star Wars.\n\nIn this video, I dive into the history of the V laser pistol and rifle, including their origins, rare toy versions, failed eBay bids, and how I finally decided to 3D print one myself. It\u2019s not screen-used, but it\u2019s pretty damn close.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a longtime fan or just discovering V for the first time, I hope this brings back a little of that \u201880s sci-fi magic.\n\n\u2e3b\n\nChapters:\n0:00 \u2013 Intro\n0:24 \u2013 Why V Had the Coolest Weapons\n3:20 \u2013 The Elusive Toys\n4:10 \u2013 eBay Heartbreak\n4:50 \u2013 Fan Made Props\n5:52 \u2013 3D Printing Begins\n6:55 \u2013 The Final Build Reveal\n7:38 \u2013 Wrapping It All Up\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83d\udcfc Subscribe for more deep dives into forgotten sci-fi, retro te",
