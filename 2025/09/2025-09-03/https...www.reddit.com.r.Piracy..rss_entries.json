She read it and left a negative review about it on goodreads, mentioning something like &quot;it was written by AI&quot;. Now the author is suing her for false accusations. I guess this negative review is in the top and damages author&#39;s sales and reputation. </p> <p>Redditors say this reviewer deserves to be sued for her lifetime because she was wrong, FAFO. Plus, since she stole the book, she had no right of writing a review.</p> <p>Hence, my question to the piracy sub. 1) Is it morally wrong to leave reviews to the product you pirated? 2) Is that legally possible to sue someone for a review? 3) And for admitting piracy?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/magician_yas\"> /u/magician_yas </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1n7u1hd/is_it_okay_to_leave_negative_review_to_the",

I know this is basically futile, but it brings me joy and he\u2019s paying. Long story short, this system will be able to perform playback and digitization at the same time, so while not technically piracy, video aspects do flirt with this subject matter. I figured out the audio part with: an av receiver with a pre out output, so for example, a cassette deck will play through the speakers from the receiver, the pre out zone 2 set to play the same as zone 1, that pre out to an audio interface to a pc via usb c. That will allow playback and copy to the pc at the same time. Video however, becomes a real problem. Obviously we have access to an optical drive for the pc for digitizing, but that\u2019s no fun. I\u2019m learning it\u2019s basically impossible to duplicate the hdmi signal from a blu ray player, or also in this case, a 2008 vhs pro p",

That leaves us in a funny position where the software we paid for can&#39;t be used without circumventing license checking.

Updates will be coming in a few days. I will also be creating a process for building <code>.deb</code> and <code>.rpm</code> installable files, maybe even a windows installer but who knows yet.</p> <p>But yeah, that&#39;s kinda it.

I was thinking about buying a ps4 and to legitimately buy some games only to find out you need a damn subscription service for online, same as the switch and same as xbox. I already have wifi in my house! I shouldn&#39;t need to pay an extra fee to access something I already have. Its just. So annoying and this is why I pirate exclusive games or just stick to steam.
