If you are new here, we are so excited to have you! We talk Short Fiction on Wednesdays here on <a href=\"/r/Fantasy\">r/Fantasy</a>.</p> <p>Onto today&#39;s selection of stories.</p> <h1>Today\u2019s Session: Flash+</h1> <p>All flash all fiction. Too Flash Too Fictitious. Four flash (f)stories for (f)your fun. I&#39;m doing my best to make this exciting for the shortest of short form naysayers. Flash is often dismissed by many (including us here at SFBC) for being too short to develop its ideas, but it is also a playground to explore thoughts, themes, and styles that might not work in longer form. It is particularly impressive when a story can pack such depth in such a short word count. I hope some of these stories hit that mark for our readers today.</p> <p>Today we&#39;re discussing four pieces of flash fiction.</p> <p><a href=\"https://milkcandyrevie",

It just feels like a slotted-in backstory to make room for the wider plot or provide an excuse for a character to be ignorant about the world. <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> does it decently well with Arya, <em>The Name of the Wind</em> was just barely tolerable in the use of this trope. But this book... this book handles it differently. </p> <p><em>Take a Thief</em> is kind of a prequel to a trilogy in the wider Valdemar series, but I picked it up as a standalone, and it&#39;s perfectly enjoyable that way. It features Heralds, cool magic hero knights, and their Companions. The Companions are magic horses who only pick good people as their wielders. So far, so good. </p> <p>Which brings us to Skif. Skif&#39;s story begins with a fairly accurate life for a medeival orphan, or frankly any child in an impoverished city with a system that doesn&#39;t care about them. So ",

I gave the first book 5 stars, albeit it felt very Lord of the Rings-y (in all the best ways). I\u2019m frequently bored during the Rand parts. </p> <p>However, I LOVE Egwene, Nynaeve, and Morgaine\u2019s bits, and I\u2019ve been salivating waiting for them to get to Tar Valon (nice play on Avalon!) for practically a book and 1/2. Also have a budding appreciation for Elaine\u2019s character. </p> <p>I find the whole ais Sadai aspect of the story fascinating. Nynaeve\u2019s trial scene was top tier for me. And having egwaine start as a novice\u2026 well, it kind of reminds me fondly of Memoirs of a Geisha, my favorite (non-fantasy) book. I love a good religious order / priestess in training arc.</p> <p>I wish the entire series was just the female characters + Perrin. I\u2019m looking for something cloister-y, magical secret societies, blood rituals, heavy training, hierarchy, ",
