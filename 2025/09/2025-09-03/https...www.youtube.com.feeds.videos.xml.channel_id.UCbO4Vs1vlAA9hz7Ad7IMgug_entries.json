        "description": "We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Thirty-Six! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\n\nIn 2024 our own indomitable MC and all-around Creative Malev ran the One Box Wargame challenge (sponsored by the lovely folks at Wargames Atlantic). The goal; use a single box of models available in the market today and write a whole game around them. His own entry; GREATHELM is now poised to launch as a fully fleshed out project. Let's dive in!\n\nCheck out the rulebook in digital  HERE: https://www.patreon.com/malev",
