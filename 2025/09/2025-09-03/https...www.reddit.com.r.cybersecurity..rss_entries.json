It\u2019s hell we work 24/7 shifts. So the schedule will be like this 9-5 a few days then overnight in the same week and then they mix in 9-5s with 4-12s. Now the SOC is short staffed cause people keep quitting (I wonder why) so now even more shifts need to be filled. They have me working double overnights one week then a 9-5 the next day. Mind you it\u2019s also hybrid and the office is an hour away. I also work like every weekend despite working the weekday as well. Not to mention my coworker keeps trying to get me fired and management lets her bully me and management degrades me for the slightest thing.

Despite being less flashy than SQL injections or XSS attacks, CSRF is just as dangerous\u2014especially when overlooked in the development of modern web applications. If not properly mitigated, a CSRF attack can trick a user\u2019s browser into executing unauthorized commands, compromising data and user trust.</p> <p>In this in-depth guide, we\u2019ll explore what CSRF is, how it works, the different forms it can take, the damage it can cause, and, most importantly, how to prevent it. We\u2019ll also look at how Secuodsoft, a CMMI Level 3 certified IT services and consulting firm, integrates CSRF protection into its secure development lifecycle to safeguard client applications.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.secuodsoft.com/blog/cybersecurity/protecting-your-web-applications-how-to-prevent-cross-site-request-forgery-csrf.p",
