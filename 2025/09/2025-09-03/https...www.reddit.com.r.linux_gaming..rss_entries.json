I&#39;ve never touched a Linux OS before and I am seriously looking forward to this experience (I&#39;m going for Mint), but I am still reluctant due to a very few worries, one of which is the issue I just proposed.

It can play quite a few games on Windows 10 though, once the boot sequence finished and it finished loading all stuff it needed to load.</p> <p>I have searched for information to see if I can use this system with Linux for some light gaming. I did manage to install Bazzite, and my initial experience with DOTA 2 was good (it runs better than on Windows).</p> <p>It went downhill after that. Doom 3 is a no go (need to check the Lutris Linux port), Borderlands 1 GOTY Enhanced, abysmal performance. These two worked ok on Windows.</p> <p>Are R7 graphics supported for Linux gaming? I read on some posts that it is, others that it isn&#39;t, others that say &quot;it depends&quot;. Perhaps Bazzite is not the best distro for this machine? Does anyone have a system similar to mine who could perhaps recommend me a distro or some insight on configuration?</p> <p>Specs:</p> <p>HP 705 G3 Mini PC</p> <p>A10 8770e AM4 CPU<",

I mainly use my PC for university work (which functions flawlessly (mostly)) and gaming. However, I have played relatively few games thus far. I have heard several times that games with anti-cheat do not work or cause problems, but I use Easy Anti-Cheat with 7 Days to Die and have not encountered any issues. However, the new Cod&#39;s and Battlefields are said to be unplayable because of the so-called kernel-level anti-cheat. Therefore, I have several questions:<br/> 1. What exactly is a kernel anti-cheat? And is it even necessary, I mean, most shooters are flooded with cheaters anyway?<br/> 2. Would it be less secure to open this system for Linux systems, or is it simply a matter of laziness?<br/> 3. If it is just laziness, is the effort really so great that it is not worthwhile for developers?<br/> 4. Ho",
