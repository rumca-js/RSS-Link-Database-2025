Regardless of anyone\u2019s favourite book genre, I believe everyone has met several repeating tropes in stories: the gritty detective or the wholesome, eccentric amateur sleuth, the old, haunted Gothic mansion in the countryside, the (rather overused imho) friends-to-lovers storyline etc. Everyone has seen these more than once.</p> <p>So, what are some less common tropes that you\u2019ve met in books, or that you\u2019d like to see being used more by authors? I was personally thinking the whole \u201chaunted Gothic mansion\u201d as I said. Although an excellent location, I\u2019d love to come across a horror story that takes a more modern approach, let\u2019s just say, about a haunted apartment building in a modern city, or a haunted shopping mall for example. It would be interesting to read more opinions around this idea.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

Because it was a collection of short stories I had been procrastinating reading it until now, as I usually like to feel the depth of the stories, which can only be found in long stories.Boy oh boy, how wrong I was. Right from the first tale, the author just hooks you in. Most of the times I felt I was visiting a cottage in an isolated corner of the world, and sitting by the fireplace listening to a very old caretaker tell these dark, mysterious and at times scary tales. At other times, I felt I was witnessing the tale taking place, for instance characters stuck in a storm in the ocean. Edgar&#39;s description and imagination prowess is immense and his prose hauntingly beautiful. One of my biggest joys in reading is when I discover an author who&#39;s writing style I enjoy immensely. It&#39;s like he is painting a picture with words. Immensel",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just finished re-reading it (first time was probably fifteen years ago). It has the political naivety and mawkish romantic banter of a lot of YA, but the story, characters, and world are quite good\u2014and wouldn\u2019t have to depend on the weaker elements listed above. The Mongolian-inspired clothing, makeup, architecture, etc would be visually stunning; the healing songs have so much cinematic potential; and the scene where Dashti faces off with the villain could be absolutely amazing and terrifying, if it leaned into the body horror of his wolf transformation. (This would be the scene that would only truly work if the film was R-rated, in my opinion. Though really all of the villains scenes would benefit from an R-rating.) Anyway, the book is good, but there is a fantastic Guillermo del Toro film just itching to bust out of it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Just-Passing-Thru737\"> /u/Just-Passing-T",
