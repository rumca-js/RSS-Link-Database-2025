Story certainly is within expectations then and is more than serviceable now. Gameplay great. Combat system relatively simple but fun with enemy variety that honestly puts some current-day indies to shame. Exploration is A-class, and recovering lost souls and reconstructing the worlds and getting stuff here and there for it is amazing. It also leaves stuff you have to go back for when you have the correct item (steel-cutting blade) with some of what you get you don&#39;t know and some you do. Stellar game. I ran through the first 3 worlds today and will prolly finish tomorrow and yeah, it&#39;s just amazing. </p> <p>If you haven&#39;t played it, it&#39;s definitely one you should.</p> </div><!-- SC_",

I\u2019d love to feed my mid-life crisis &amp; try my hand at some of the old classics like Contra, Micro Machines, Goal! or Balloon Fighter again but I\u2019m not sure if these things are any good or are there better alternatives out there?

In the switcher box I have a Super Nintendo and a ps2 both also with s video cables. I had my sega genesis going into the other input with just composite but I just got an NES so I decided to move it over to the switcher box. The problem is that when I run it through the switcher the video looks terrible. I assume that this is because I\u2019m running a composite signal through an s video cable but I\u2019m not entirely sure(I\u2019m a little new to all of this stuff). I was wondering if there was a way to fix this or maybe run a genesis through s video? Any help would be appreciated thanks:)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pepsiman052\"> /u/Pepsiman052 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1n721g3/genesis_video/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"h",
