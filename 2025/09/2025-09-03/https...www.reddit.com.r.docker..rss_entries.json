It has been a nightmare getting docker to believe that it has more than 250GB in disk space. What the hell do you do to actually get it to work? diskpart says the vhdx is 550GB now which is what I wanted and yet it refuses to change. Docker offers NO documentation on how to do this, they just link to a fucking microsoft docs page with NO mention of how to allocate disk space AT ALL, it merely talks about configuration options for WSL 2 with .wslconfig and such. NOTHING on how to update disk space for a WSL 2 target in there.</p> <p>Whose cock do I have to suck to get a fucking gui slider that lets me drag 256 --&gt; 512GB or whatever?</p> <p>Edit: Fixed it. I had to nuke docker from my PC and reinstall from scratch. Lost my volumes which is fine but I see it now recognizes (limit 1006.85GB). Good enough for me</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pe",
