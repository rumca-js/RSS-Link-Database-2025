But there's several reasons why I'm not convinced which I go over in this video. For example, they say the telemetry doesn't suggest an increase in failures, but I don't think their telemetry could even alert them to the drives failing. They also said they didn't receive reports from customers, but I also explain why that doesn't mean much either. Most importantly, another YouTuber JayzTwoCents was able to reproduce the issue himself and demonstrated it on video. So I explain why his demonstration actually seems consistent with the other reports about being related to heavy writing, but also possibly simultaneous reading.\n\nJayzTwoCents' Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbFIUu_7LIc\n\n\u25bc Time Stamps: \u25bc\n0:00 - Intro\n1:08 - JayzTwoCents Reproduces It\n2:25 - It's Probably Still The Same Cause\n4:28 - Power Cycling Brings It Back\n5:05 - The",
