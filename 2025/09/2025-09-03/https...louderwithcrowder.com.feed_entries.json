Zohran Mamdani is promising free stuff to everyone. It hasn\u2019t worked before. We\u2019ve got examples. Cuba has been a talking point for the socialist left for a long time, including celebrities. There\u2019s a problem with that, though. Socialist Cuba sucks.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"rumble\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://rumble.com/embed/v6w939i/?pub=4430ut\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div><p><strong>QUICK FACTS FRANCE</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2022/10/31/a-paris-la-moitie-au-moins-des-faits-de-delinquance-viennent-d-etranger",
