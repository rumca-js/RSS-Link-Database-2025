Because quantum particles are also waves, they must always have more than zero energy. Zero-point motion is even crazier \u2013 it means that quantum particles at their lowest-energy point should also move, because of literally nothing. Zero point motion has been very hard to experimentally verify, but physicists confirmed it in a recent experiment \u2013 let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu2637\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patr",
