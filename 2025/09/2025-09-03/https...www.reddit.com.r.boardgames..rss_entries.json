We were heavy on coins so we were buying so many favors to mitigate the dice and deliver goods or sail short distance and get points and resources just so that any of us wouldnt build or cross the edge of the river and open up the third port for other player.

Since I really like both Lord of the Rings and World of Warcraft, I\u2019ve been interested in <em>Pandemic: The Lord of the Rings \u2013 The Fellowship of the Ring</em> and <em>Pandemic: World of Warcraft \u2013 Wrath of the Lich King</em>. But I\u2019m also considering the classic <em>Pandemic</em> and its expansions.</p> <p>What I\u2019m looking for is a game that plays well with 2 players (since I often play with my partner), but can also handle up to 4 players when friends come over. I want something with a good mix of strategy and accessibility, and of course a theme that makes the cooperative experience fun and immersive.</p> <p>Given all that, which version would you recommend? Should I go for the classic <em>Pandemic or</em> one of the themed versions?<br/> Keep in mind I will only get 1 game</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!</p> <",

Here are some thoughts.</p> <p>The rulebook is well written and helps you to get the hang of the game flow quickly and without even needing to check the component and setup the game. Although, I was a bit confused by the Appendix where I felt a lot things missing, even with the extra help sheet.</p> <p>Gameplay is great, feels like you are evacuating a dying planet for a new one. I really liked the way the game balances your actions and the resource management from the two different planets. I liked it so much that if felt like it ended pretty soon, I could keep playing for 2 more years (rounds). But to be fair, I tried the race mode that ends earlier without having to complete all 4 years, so I guess I have to try the points version also to have a better feeling of the duration.</p> <p>And a question that come up",

In the rule book nothing is mentioned about what happens if you run out of dice. People have stated that in the old version, you&#39;d have to remove a dice from the board. If that&#39;s the case, what happens to the casino with the tile on it, with no dice? Can someone sprawl in it? Is it still owned by the player who removed the dice? Or do you not even take a dice off the board and use just another dice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Matt_S92\"> /u/Matt_S92 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1n6zw7n/lords_of_vegas_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1n6zw7n/lords_of_vegas_question/\">[comments]</a></span>",
