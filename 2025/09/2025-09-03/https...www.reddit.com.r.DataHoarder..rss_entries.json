The question is, is it possible or smart to split up one 8tb drive in half and then create a single disk ZFS pool that makes it around 12tb in total, then create another pool that utilizes the extra 4tb for my backups?</p> <p>I don\u2019t care about redundancy for my media drive since all of that stuff is torrented/easy to obtain. I only care about the backups getting lost. Which hopefully splitting it up between multiple partitions will save it in case the main media drive fails. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zionix_\"> /u/Zionix_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://w",

We want to essentially move everything to this new M2 drive, operating system and all. If we used the &quot;Backup and Restore (Windows 7)&quot; program built into windows, could we back up the C drive onto the new M2 drive and theoretically just boot from that M2 like normal? </p> <p>I ask because we were gonna just use a program that mirrored all files from one drive to another like rescuezilla but I heard that the program is inconsistent and problematic. After we move everything over we&#39;re gonna make a proper backup of everything but there&#39;s a lot of programs with a lot of specific setup that we really can&#39;t risk losing and we HAVE to get a new drive since it&#39;s basically at capacity.

I want to digitalize parts of or whole books sometimes, preferably with ocr. I don&#39;t have a need for them to be indistinguishable from paper. I&#39;m going to do this on Linux since that is what I run. I won&#39;t be able to destroy the books. The school have large flatbed scanners that can convert to pdf with ocr and mail to yourself, but they are old and clunky, I haven&#39;t been able to get them to work satisfactory. And it&#39;s more convenient to do it at home.</p> <p>My questions: what software should I use on linux?</p> <p>There are many cheap used scanners available, for example a Canon Canoscan lide 200 available close to me right now for about 30$.

It\u2019s not a remaster, but the original 4:3 content upscaled and placed inside a 16:9 frame with black bars on all four sides. The picture quality is even worse than early 2000s Indian dvd content or 80&#39;s DVD content of hollywood. If they didn&#39;t put the black bars and upscaled the vid to 108p then I&#39;m assuming each epsiodes(41-45 min) would be only 150-200mb but instead now it is 600-800mb.</p> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Now it woudnt be an issue if there was black bars only on both size of screen but there is back bars on top and bottom of the screen too which cuts out about 20% of total viewing area and looks weird, odd.
