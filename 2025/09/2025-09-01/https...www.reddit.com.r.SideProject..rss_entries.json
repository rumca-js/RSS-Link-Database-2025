Add to that daily AI killer models and platforms that seem poised to engulf my project. </p> <p>But in reality, creating a killer product still takes time, effort, and attention to detail. I launched my product within 5 months, which is objectively fast, but it still feels slow compared to what I read. The gap between \u201cwhere I should be\u201d vs. \u201cwhere I am\u201d is stressful. </p> <p>Has AI shifted our expectations too far? Or is this just the new normal?

I read about shipping apps to Google Play and apparently you need 12 user tests for each app in order to ship to production? If that&#39;s the case, do you have any advice for a solo dev like me who doesn&#39;t have many connections to work around with? Is my best choice to post on platforms like Reddit and hope there will be kind people who will help test my app?

It can be used in workplaces to help employees reduce stress, in startups to support focused and mindful teams, and in schools or colleges to give students a safe place to express themselves.</p> <p>It\u2019s a working MVP, ready to scale, and can be expanded with features like team dashboards, premium journaling packs, or community programs. I\u2019m looking for someone who sees its potential to help people feel calmer, more focused, and connected, and is ready to take it further.</p> <p>Please dm for more details.
