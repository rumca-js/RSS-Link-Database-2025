I would like to switch back to sailing the seas an now I need some help. I&#39;ve done some research but I am missing this big guide for beginners (maybe I&#39;m missing something, or I am too stupid) As I understand for now there are some different ways to do it:</p> <p>1: Get a VPN (mullvad, proton or airvpn) and stream and watch on websites like <a href=\"https://livetv.sx/dex/\">livesports.tv</a>, <a href=\"https://movieparadise.org/\">movieparadise</a> It should be kind of safe (VPN) and simple, just some annoying ads. No hosting, no uploading, it&#39;s just watching a stream on this websites. Easy live sports, movies and series</p> <p>2: Torrents: works as a P2P, need a program like AceStream and qbittorrenting. It&#39;s decentralised, I download the data from Seeders. Is it safe? Do I need to use a VPN? Is it possible ",

You used to be able to just change the url to previous dates and you could access their archives for free too, but this has changed as well. Does anyone have a solution?

So, I was hoping that I could get some pointers at what I am doing right and what I am doing wrong :)</p> <p>For my laptop, I use MulvadVPN. I used my Mastercard to buy this, am I already vulnerable in doing this? Should I look into Monero as a payment option or going the extra mile and mail it in? Are there better VPN&#39;s, that I haven&#39;t heard of? What about selfhosting a bunch of nodes on rented servers, to use as a &quot;DIY&quot; VPN?</p> <p>Then I use qBittorrent with an inbuilt search function. When the search function does not work, I usually go to the Pirate Bay, but I have heard that it&#39;s not the best site for this anymore?
