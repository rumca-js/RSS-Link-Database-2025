Without that the camera is shaking so much and I find it way too annoying.</p> <p>I&#39;m keep hearing about Virtual Desktop for years now, I&#39;d give it a go. But I just cannot find an answer how does VR image mirroring works with Virtual desktop. Is it recordable with OBS? If yes, how? Does VD have any image stabilization? I fail to find enough info about this, yet alone demonstrations or comparison between Airlink + Oculus Mirror and Virtual Desktop recordings.</p> <p>It would be goot to get rid of some unnecessary load because currently I&#39;m using Quest 3 with Airlink + Oculus mirror + SteamVR as well (SteamVR is needed to run LIV afaik, with LIV I can read chat messages during livestream).</p> </div><!-- S",

For us, this means that connecting your VR headset to the network produced by your PC establishes a direct connection to your computer, bypassing the need for a local network.
