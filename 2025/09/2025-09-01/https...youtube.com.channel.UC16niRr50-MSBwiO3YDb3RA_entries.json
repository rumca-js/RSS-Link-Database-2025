I'm completely at one with them on that.\"\n\nStarmer says he understands why people want the hotels closed and he wants that too \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nAsked to put a date on it, Starmer reiterates his commitment to do so by the end of this Parliament.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#AsylumHotels #KeirStarmer #BBCNews",

The Palestinian armed group earlier said dozens of civilians were killed and injured in the Israeli air strikes on a residential building in the district.\n\n Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
