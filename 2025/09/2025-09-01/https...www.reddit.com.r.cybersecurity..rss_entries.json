It started life as a file integrity monitor (TigerTrap), but through testing and feedback, I realized it was doing something different, tracking the evolution of executable files over time.</p> <p>So, I&#39;m calling it: <strong>Executable Drift Monitoring (EDM)</strong>.<br/> It\u2019s not AV, not EDR, not FIM. It flags new, moved, or deleted executables, especially unsigned ones, without relying on threat signatures.</p> <p><strong>Example Use Case:</strong><br/> ExeTrace flagged a new executable in <code>AppData\\Local\\Temp</code> that wasn\u2019t part of any update. It wasn\u2019t malicious (yet), but it was new. That\u2019s the moment to investigate.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Lightweight scan of the C:\\ drive</li> <li>Logs unsigned executables that weren\u2019t there before</li> <li>Ignores Microsoft-signed files to reduce noise</li> ",

There&#39;s definitely something satisfying about piecing together what happened during an incident. But lately I&#39;ve found myself really drawn to bigger picture projects, especially working in GCC High and AWS GovCloud environments and that&#39;s basically been my role the last year or so</p> <p>The shift to cloud architecture and security has been refreshing there&#39;s something about designing and implementing security at scale that scratches a different itch than reactive incident investigation.</p> <p>Has anyone else experienced this kind of natural evolution in their interests?</p> </d",
