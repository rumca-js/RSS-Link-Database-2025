A heart full of adventure but no one around me with the same drive. Travelling the tourist sights? Sure. Hubby and kid are down. Friends are down. But trekking? The remote corners of the earth with nothing but a trek guide, some strangers and a tent? Nah. Couldnt find anyone interested in it. Felt i could never go because i couldnt go alone. So id do day trips at local national parks to scratch the itch but, once id done them all, i just...stopped. No new sights to see. No new trails. Over the next few years, I gained 10kg, sat around the house, poked around the shops. Felt generally unhappy, climbing at the walls but with no way out. Family holidays werent cutting ",
