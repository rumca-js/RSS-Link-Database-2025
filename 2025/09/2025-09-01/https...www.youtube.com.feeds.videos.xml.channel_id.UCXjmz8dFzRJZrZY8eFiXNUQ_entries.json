        "description": "When Glass was first announced, excitement was sky-high. After the groundbreaking Unbreakable and the surprise sequel Split, M. Night Shyamalan had built a superhero trilogy unlike anything else in Hollywood. Fans expected an epic conclusion, but what they got shattered expectations in all the wrong ways.\n\nDespite a powerhouse cast featuring Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and James McAvoy, Glass struggled to live up to the hype. Instead of the thrilling finale audiences wanted, the film divided fans and critics, becoming one of Shyamalan\u2019s most controversial endings.   \n\n#mnightshyamalan #unbreakable #glass #samuelljackson #nerdstalgic",
