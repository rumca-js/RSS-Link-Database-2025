Instead of hiding behind a staff or bow, you are charging face-first into danger, trading your health bar for glorious damage. It is the class for anyone who loves brute force, big crits, and feeling like a walking blender.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Getting up close and personal isn't just about swinging blindly. Terraria's melee arsenal is surprisingly diverse, ranging from oversized swords that cleave through entire boss arenas to yoyos, spears, boomerangs, and flails that control space. In true Terraria fashion, melee does not necessarily mean you need to be in the thick of the action. Plenty of the best blades sling projectiles across the screen when you jump from Pre-Hardmode to Hardmode, letting you play safe while keeping that melee identity.</p><div data-embed-type=\"toc\"><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a hr",

The class often walks a fine line between feeling underpowered and overpowered, depending on the stage of the game and how well you support your minions with the right gear.

When Little Nightmare first released in 2017, it immediately stood out thanks to its unsettling visuals, tone, and atmosphere. While its 2D platforming, chase sequences, and puzzle gameplay was satisfying, it was the game's creepy enemies, mysterious world, and unnerving sense of scale that truly made a lasting impact, as if a child's nightmares had been brought to life. Those visuals and its relatively defenseless child protagonist defined developer Tarsier Studios' horror sidescroller and helped to cement it as one of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-games/2900-4900/\">best horror games</a> of all time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightm",
