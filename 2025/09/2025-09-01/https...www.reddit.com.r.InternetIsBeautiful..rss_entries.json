As someone who loves creating content but isn&#39;t a Photoshop wizard per se&#39;, I wanted something that could make professional edits feel effortless, fast and fun.</p> <p><strong>The idea:</strong></p> <p>What if you could just draw on your photo where you want changes and tell the AI what to do? That&#39;s PhotoBanana - an AI photo editor that uses Google&#39;s Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) technology to understand your annotations and prompts.</p> <p><strong>How it works (super simple):</strong></p> <ol> <li>Upload your photo</li> <li>Draw circles/rectangles/text on areas you want to change or just prompt your changes</li> <li>Type what you want (e.g., &quot;remove this object&quot;, &quot;make sky blue&quot;, &quot;add a beard to this guy&quot;, etc.)</li> <li>Hit",

I had a lot of fun building this! You can check it out at www.howmanytaxes.com to see what your contribution might look like. </p> <p>The calculation is pretty simple and doesn&#39;t account for anything outside of federal income tax, so take it with a grain of salt. Heres the formula: Your Contribution = (Your Income Tax Paid / Total Federal Income Tax Dollars) x Programs Tax Dollars. All data was sourced from official government websites ( www.usaspending.gov/agency, federal marginal tax brackets) I&#39;d love any useful insights, ideas for expansion, or any other feedback items! </p> <p>Next, I think I\u2019ll add more data visualization options and more ways to make the calculation as accurate as possible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Greasyidiot\"> /u/Greasyidio",
