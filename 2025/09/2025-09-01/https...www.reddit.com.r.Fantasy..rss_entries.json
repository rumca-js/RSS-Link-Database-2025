However, time is relentless, and soon the boy will become an adult, bearing the responsibility of being the heir to the di Regulai family, whether he likes it or not.

I took a speculative fiction class in undergrad and this would\u2019ve been perfect for our class discussions! There are so many themes and possible interpretations.

When it\u2019s challenged, everyone\u2019s suddenly gung-ho about challenging it, and it\u2019s changed with almost no effort. Cue epilogue.
