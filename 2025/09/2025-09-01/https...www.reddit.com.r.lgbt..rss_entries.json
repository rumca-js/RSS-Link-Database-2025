I fuel my body appropriately for the amount of activity I do. Iv been finding a passion in fitness again that is not fixated on how small I can get but rather what fitness do I have. Learning a new skill makes me feel fit. Being able to run 12miles , or bike 100miles in my free time makes me feel fit. I have fitness goals that are going at least a 1 yr to hit, but I pushed for it. I\u2019m playing around with the exercises, splits, volume, and intensity.

In the beginning of my fitness journey I just wanted to be smaller always try to eat less and try the newest diet trends. Now that I\u2019m a bit more seasoned I just aim to feel fit. I fuel my body appropriately for the amount of activity I do. Iv been finding a passion in fitness again that is not fixated on how small I can get but rather what fitness do I have. Learning a new skill makes me feel fit. Being able to run 12miles , or bike 100miles in my free time makes me feel fit. I have fitness goals that are going at least a 1 yr to hit, but I pushed for it. I\u2019m playing around with the exercises, splits, volume, and intensity. Experimenting with my own training program is going to be exciting.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by",
