I prefer romance (F/M) and love to read series over just standalone books. I listen to books mostly through Hoopla or Libby since I have a long commute, but I will read. </p> <p>The procedural process MUST be believable. Nothing turns me off faster than an author who clearly did no research. </p> <p>My absolute favorite author is Allison Brennan - complex characters, believable law enforcement, twisty, and not afraid to have characters swear or get gory. I\u2019ve been through her mainstream series. </p> <p>Here\u2019s what else I\u2019ve read and liked: Kate Burkholder series - Linda Castillo Laurel Snow series - Rebecca Zanetti Fatal series - Marie Force Sunshine trilogy - Darynda Jones Keye Street series - Amanda Kyle Williams Cold and Deadly - Toni Anderson (I didn\u2019t like the narrator so I didn\u2019t listen to more) </p> <",
