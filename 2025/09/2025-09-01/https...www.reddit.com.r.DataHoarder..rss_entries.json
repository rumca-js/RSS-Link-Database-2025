Long time reader, first time poster, so sorry if this is not suitable for this sub.</p> <p>I have a small (&lt;1TB), but ever-growing collection of digitized personal files and CD/DVD rips. So far my backup strategy has been very lacking. I&#39;ve been backing up my phone and computer to a large HDD in my PC and that&#39;s it, however, I&#39;d really like to sort out my offsite backup to truly achieve a 3-2-1 setup.</p> <p>I&#39;ve considered buying two HDD enclosures to use a couple of spare HDDs as mobile external drives. I intend on keeping it in my school locker, switching one out with the other (with the latest backup) once per week, however I kinda feel nervous about it. Like, <em>technically</em> I don&#39;t <em>own</em> the locker, I&#39;m renting it from the school, and we sometimes get searches for vapes and stuff. So far my school has only been checking backpacks, however my last school went all out and checked lockers as well. </p>",
