I&#39;ve been using Lightroom for a while, but I always found it resource heavy on my machine, especially when working with large batches of RAW files.</p> <p>As a personal challenge, I decided to build my own RAW editor from scratch to learn more about image processing pipelines and see if I could create something more performant.</p> <p>The result is <strong>RapidRAW</strong>. It&#39;s a non-destructive, GPU accelerated photo editor built with Rust, Tauri, and React, with a custom WGSL shader pipeline for all image processing. The goal was performance and a small footprint - the entire app is under 20MB (which is less than the average RAW image :)). It&#39;s open-source under the AGPL-3.0 license and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p> <p>It already supports a full RAW workflow, including:</p> <ul> <li>Library management, rating, and tagging<",
