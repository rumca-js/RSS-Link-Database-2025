I&#39;m open to both dramas and war films. While I enjoy accuracy, I&#39;m also happy with fictionalized accounts as long as they are compelling stories. I love watching movies especially historical movies. I am fond of Brave Heart, Patriot, Troy, Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator, Life is Beautiful and many more.

We watched Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, Walk the Line, and Straight Outta Compton. Each was released approximately 30-40 years after the singer/band was at their most popular. It got me thinking about which current artists will inevitably have an Oscar-bait biopic in the next 3-4 decades. </p> <p>I landed on Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Eminem. Taylor Swift because she\u2019s Ari ably the biggest pop star right now and doesn\u2019t show any signs of not continuing to dominate music, at least in the eyes of her very loyal fans. And she has had a complex dating history which will make nice story beats in a bio pic. Justin Bieber because he\u2019s had quite the fall after rising very rapidly at a young age and because of his proximity to some nefarious actors in music\u2019s history. And Eminem because he\u2019s such a polarizing yet popular figure with his own substance abuse and mental health struggles; that Oscar",

I gave it another shot a few months later and really liked it. Now, as I\u2019ve watched it dozens of times I have to say, it is an absolute masterpiece. The casting is spot on, the effects are fun and it is such a ride from beginning to end. It is now EASILY one of my favorite movies.</p> <p>Anyone else have similar experiences with other movies? Something you just didn\u2019t get the first time around? This movie had such a hard swing for me, from thinking it was ridiculous and soft-baked to seeing how much time and effort was put into it in such a low key manner that the artistry was NOT seeing it. It legit hits all the boxes looking back. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lokitusaborg\"> /u/Lokitusaborg </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1n5f",
