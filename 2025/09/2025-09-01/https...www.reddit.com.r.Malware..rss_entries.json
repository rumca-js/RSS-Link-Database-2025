This book is eons old in cybersevurity years and I&#39;m struggling to do the labs. I have a Windows 10 VM but obviously the malware was designed to target older versions. I cannot find a functioning Windows 7 ISO either. What&#39;d everyone else do to manage the lab work? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impotent_Xylophone\"> /u/Impotent_Xylophone </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1n5bxsm/practical_malware_analysis/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1n5bxsm/practical_malware_analysis/\">[comments]</a></span>",
