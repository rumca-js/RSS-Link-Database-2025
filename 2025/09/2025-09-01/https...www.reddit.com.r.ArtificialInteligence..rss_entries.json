Also, went crazy with it in wrong direction and made an over complicated model but later simplified it to a simple encoder decoder, which didn&#39;t work.</p> <p>Then I also tried several other simple encoder-decoder. Tried ViT-Tf, it didn&#39;t seem to work. Then tried ViT-LSTM, finally got some results (38.78% word error rate). Then I also tried X3D-LSTM, got 42.52% word error rate. </p> <p>Now I am kinda confused what to do next. I could not think of anything and just decided to make a model similar to SlowFastSign using X3D and LSTM. But I want to know how do people approach a problem and iterate their model to improve model accuracy. I guess there must be a way of analysing things and take decision based on that. I don&#39;t want to just blindly throw a bunch of darts and hope for the best.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
