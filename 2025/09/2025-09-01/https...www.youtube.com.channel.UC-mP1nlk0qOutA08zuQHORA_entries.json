        "description": "Comedy podcasts used to be an escape from politics.. a place for ridiculous stories, wild banter, and jokes.

This video dives into how comedians became unlikely political voices and whether fans are losing the comedy they came for in the first place.\n\n0:00 Joe Rogan\n10:37 Andrew Schulz\n17:45 Theo Von\n21:43 Tim Dillon\n33:09 Bad Friends\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Social Medias \u2714\ufe0f\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/patrickcctv\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@patrickcctv?lang=en\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/patrickcctv\n\n\ud83d\udfe2Watch My Videos on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/01jpwYaJalv5OZN4CcE2Rj?si=031adfb43dd94512\n\ud83c\udfa7 Stream My Music \ud83c\udfa7 https://www.hoo.be/patrickcctv\n\ud83d\udca7Second Channel\ud83d\udca7 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0aUB-99m_b958ljpioOhQ\n\ud83d\udc7eMy Discord\ud83d\udc7e https://discord.gg/MAJUre2kFD",
