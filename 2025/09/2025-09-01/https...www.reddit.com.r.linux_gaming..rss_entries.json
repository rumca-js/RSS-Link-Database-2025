I posted here a few months ago for a similar (or possibly the same) issue, and I&#39;ve since made some progress, but I&#39;m still a little perplexed on if there&#39;s any way to fix it. I play most games I own on steam, and a lot of them work fine, but a significant number of them have some mix of seemingly random freezing, crashing upon alt+tab, and massive slowdowns to around 5-10 fps. These games (particularly games developed by Paradox), many of which I played heavily before I switched to Linux, never really had any issues on Windows other than the occasional stutter. Wherever possible, I&#39;ve tried both the proton and native versions of games, but I haven&#39;t noticed any differences other than a slight change in fps.</p> <p>My specs are as follows:<br/> Distro - Pop_OS! (although I had this issue with mint as well)<br/> Memory - 32 GB RAM<br/> Processor - Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i5-9300H CPU @ 2.40GHz \u00d7 8<br/> Graphics - NVIDIA Corporation ",
