        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Online privacy is under siege\u2014phishing, data breaches, and fake identities are everywhere. I\u2019ve been reading about how inauthenticity, not just weak security, is the root cause. For example, if someone\u2019s email or website isn\u2019t verified as authentic, it\u2019s easy for hackers to impersonate them, stealing data or spreading malware. Technologies like digital signatures and PKI could verify identities without exposing personal info, but they\u2019re not widely used. Why? Some say it\u2019s because PKI is too complex or lacks reliable identity checks (like proper enrollment processes). Others argue Big Tech (Silibandia) resists since ID-PKI would let people control the use of information about themselves, and that would kill their business.

Are digital signatures a solution, or is there a better way to ensure trust without sacrificing privacy?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",
