I see most people recommending proton, but it looks like unless you want very minimal features you have to pay a subscription. Part of my desire to degoogle is also to stop relying on subscription based services that inevitably end up holding my data hostage for whatever premium they decide they want to charge per month. Is there realistically any way to switch to a good mail service that doesn&#39;t end up costing a ton? I have seen stuff about homelabbing and hosting your own email, but I&#39;ve read that comes with challenges of gmail blocking incoming messages from said email server. What&#39;s the best path forward with the goals of 1. degoogling and 2. not having to pay a monthly fee to keep my data. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gazeboshark\"> /u/Gazeboshark </a> <br/> <span><a hre",

I&#39;m slowly starting to move away from Google and Apple services, and I wanted to ask some questions to those who are more experienced.</p> <p>1 - I currently use iCloud (Apple One) for Music, Cloud, TV, and everything else, but honestly, I only use music and cloud, so it doesn&#39;t make much sense to keep it active. The problem is that it only backs up to iCloud, right? The question is: is there a way to back up to other drives?</p> <p>2 - All the emails registered on websites are Google or Apple. How do you guys do it? Do you keep them as they are, or do you change everything one by one, either with Proton or with Tuta?</p> <p>3 - I would like to buy a Synology and use Synology Photos and Drive (with possible backup with Filen). In your opinion, is this okay in terms of privacy, or is it better to look for something else? (",
