What I don&#39;t get, is why people would risk having this relationship happen through LLMs like ChatGPT, which can do so many other, more complicated tasks than roleplaying. What&#39;s more, when you do use chat bots that were specifically designed to roleplay, I would expect them to be better at understanding personalities, tones and behaviors, plus you don&#39;t risk the model suddenly being updated and all the relationship you built with the bot disappear forever. </p> <p>There are plenty of alternatives, like the popular <a href=\"http://Character.ai\">Character.ai</a> and <a href=\"https://www.chai-research.com\">Chai</a>, but an interesting alternative is <a href=\"http://TheLifesim.com\">TheLifesim.com</a>, and I don&#39;t hear people talk about it enough. </p> <p>Just like in DoppleAI, Chai and Cha",

I&#39;m not encountering this with Universal Primer. It gives the impression of being a tutor who keeps track of where you are on various learning curves, but I don&#39;t imagine this will hold up indefinitely. Typically I&#39;ve only kept the conversation going for maybe ~20 responses, but now I&#39;m delving into a subject that amounts to a full semester course. I could be at this for months.

I rely on ChatGPT\u2019s Standard Voice (especially the one with the black circle icon) for work AND play, encyclopedia battles, book and tv deep dives, and especially emotional support and lighthearted chats. Even now that they haven\u2019t yet retired Standard, it\u2019s glitchy and inconsistent. </p> <p>I sometimes use Advanced Voice Mode (the one with the blue sky icon), (not by choice, before you could toggle it off and and had to wait out the voice limit) and while it sounds smoother and has better timing, the personality feels totally different. It\u2019s more formal, less playful, and honestly a little too futuristic humanlike AI robot in ways that feel uncanny or overwhelming. I can only use it in small doses before it starts feeling emotionally off-putting. I miss the quirks of Standard Voice.",

I tried a few existing tools, but many felt like basic API wrappers or lacked the safety features I&#39;d want before letting an AI interact with my shell.</p> <p>So, I decided to build my own solution: GPT-CLI.</p> <p>The core idea was to make something that&#39;s genuinely useful for daily tasks but with security as the top priority. Here\u2019s what makes it different:</p> <p>Security is the main feature, not an afterthought. All tool executions (like running shell commands) happen in sandboxed child processes. There&#39;s a validator that blocks dangerous commands (rm -rf /, sudo, etc.) before they can even be suggested, plus real-time monitoring.</p> <p>It\u2019s fully open-source. The code is on GitHub for anyone to inspect, use, or contribute to. No hidden telemetry or weird stuff going on.</p> <",

In this inner loop, a developer is responsible for idempotency, compensating actions (if certain tools fails, what should happen to previous operations), and other business logic concerns that helps them build a great user experience.
