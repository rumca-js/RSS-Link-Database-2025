        "description": "A new study projects that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)\u2014the system of currents that includes the Gulf Stream\u2014could shut down after 2100 under high-emission scenarios. This shutdown would drastically reduce heat transport northward, leaving Europe vulnerable to extreme winters, summers of drying, and shifts in tropical rainfall. Climate models show the tipping point is linked to collapsing winter convection in the North Atlantic, which weakens vertical mixing and creates a feedback loop that accelerates decline.",

These compartments, born from splashing droplets and complex chemistry in Titan\u2019s atmosphere, could act like primitive cell walls.",
