        "description": "https://store.playstation.com/concept/10012988/\n\nBad Cheese is a psychological horror game inspired by the eerie charm of 1920s animation.\nStep into the tiny paws of a mouse spending the weekend at home with a dysfunctional Dad while Mom's away. Be on your best behavior and KEEP DADDY HAPPY.\nComplete tasks, eat snacks, find toys, and navigate the \"complicated family dynamic.\" Experience the gruesome reality of a child-mouse trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in a not-so-normal household. Every family has a corpse in the closet and in this house, there are many closets.\nHand-drawn art combined with a 16mm film-inspired aesthetic will make you feel like you're watching a scary cartoon from the golden era of animation.\n\n#ps5 #ps5games #ps4 #ps4games #badcheese",
