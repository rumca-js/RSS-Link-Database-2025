It was only open every once in a while - seemingly at the whim of the owner - so it was a special treat to stop in. Every time they were open, all summer long one year, I spent every quarter I had on Bad Dudes.</p> <p>When they reopened for the season the next year, they had gotten rid of Bad Dudes and replaced it with Ninja Gaiden. I wasn&#39;t too upset or anything, but I never saw a Bad Dudes coin-op again in my life, so it got this mythical status in my mind. The older I got, the more I misremembered how awesome it was. There were special moves. There were throws. Couldn&#39;t you go Super Saiyan? Didn&#39;t I see a naked lady&#39;s ass at one point? This game was the Holy Grail.</p> <p>Then in my 20&#39;s I got a little thing called MAME and finally got to play it again and boy, was I disappointed. I should have just lived with the memo",

They had their first taste of gaming this weekend and seem to love Sonic 1-3, but the co-op is pretty minimal. The system will be a lenovo tiny i5-11500t, 16GB DDR4, 2TB NVMe, and some nvidia t600 workstation GPU and I need some time to experiment with Batocera. From what I&#39;ve read it&#39;s much preferred over Lakka which I&#39;ve only used a couple times.</p> <p>I don&#39;t want the biggest library of games necessarily, it can be hard to navigate thousands of games you don&#39;t want to play. the thing has to be easy for little kids to do themselves. hopefully the system can run at least up to ps2/xbox/gamecube/wii, and possibly some RPCS3. toy story 3 and sonic all stars racing for PS3 were cute games. </p> <p>I didn&#39;t own any of these systems and am not familiar with the games, so I don&#39;t want to miss out on any real classics, especially ",
