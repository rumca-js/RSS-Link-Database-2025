There are many cave cards that say \u201cpay x to do/gain x\u201d when you play the card. There was one cave that said \u201cpay 2 caves (from your hand) to immediately draw another cave and play it for free, but what if the cave you draw requires you to pay something you don\u2019t have? We figured from this that \u201cplaying a cave for free\u201d means you ignore any costs on the card itself but still get the benefits from it? And also ignore the excavate and egg (3rd and 4th column) costs. We figured excavate for free means you skip the coin and eggs but still pay anything on the cave itself, but play for free ignores all costs. Even typing this up is confusing, but can anyone clarify for certain?

We played those to completion, then we mixed and matched them.</p> <p>This game was our gateway game because we thought if we could handle all the moving pieces of this game, we could definitely handle a Gloomhaven or Terraforming Mars. Which we learned we could. We started with Jaws of the Lion and haven&#39;t looked back. Our board game love has grown so much.</p> <p>Some of our top games are Scythe, Terraforming Mars, Horrified. We have many art pieces we have on display inspired by these games.

One of the interesting features of Darkest Night is a bunch of very different characters, each with their own set of skills to choose from. For example, a knight takes oaths and then receives bonuses/penalties for (not) fulfilling them. A druid takes the forms of different animals, each with its own features. A wizard has powerful spells that require reloading, etc. So depending on characters chosen, you will have significantly different playstyle, which boosts replayability.</p> <p>Besides hp y",

Specifically Everdell Duo and Race for the Galaxy.</p> <p>My wife has fairly limited experience with boardgames. I picked up Everdell Duo for us. The theme has always appealed to her, easy win I thought. She absolutely hated it. Her complaint &quot;I don&#39;t get what I&#39;m meant to be doing?&quot;. (She really enjoys Catan, Duel for Middle Earth, ticket to ride, carcassone.)</p> <p>I&#39;ve also been trying to find a game for my dad and I to play when he visits (similar experience as wife but also a fairly casual PC gamer).</p> <p>We&#39;ve been playing race for the galaxy, prob 6-8 times now and &quot;I don&#39;t get what I&#39;m meant to be doing?&quot; Comes up again.",
