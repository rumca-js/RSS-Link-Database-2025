        "description": "The long wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally coming to an end in September 2025, but is the excitement around Team Cherry's upcoming platformer actually justified? We would probably say yes since this is a sequel that takes the best parts of its predecessor and efficiently blending them with bold new additions.\n\nSilksong is shaping to be an excellent game and has the potential Game of the Year contender considering just how much it brings to the table. While it does pay to be cautious about such a highly-anticipated release, the positive reactions it has garnered from players and critics alike are another feather in its cap, and point to an experience that can steal the spotlight away from a slew of brilliant titles already in play this year.",

        "description": "We pit two of the Metal Gear Solid franchise's heavy hitters against each other to see how they measure up in the wake of Delta: Snake Eater's release. Konami's ambitious remake of the 2004 classic does draw a lot of inspiration from Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain in its effort to modernize Snake's encounter with The Boss and Colonel Volgin.\n\nBut do those elements of Phantom Pain allow Delta to surpass the excellent mechanics and changes that the former brought to the franchise's trademark stealth-action experience? Answering that question needs a nuanced look at what makes the franchise tick, and that's just what we've tried to do with this one. \n\nJoin us as we dive right into the two games and see which one comes out on top.",

        "description": "Lost Soul Aside has been a long time in the making. Having been under development for over a decade now, the title is one of the major releases coming out as part of PlayStation\u2019s China Hero Project, through which the company wants to support game development in the country. The game\u2019s story revolves around protagonist Kaser teaming up with a friendly Voidrax dragon to figure out how he can recover his sister\u2019s soul that was stolen by hostile Voidrax creatures. \n\nWhile the game\u2019s plot starts off quite interestingly, with a plot that seemingly involves a resistance movement against a tyrannical empire, the more interesting elements of the story are quickly brushed aside to instead focus on the more fantastical things. Lost Soul Aside is a good game at its core, with strong combat as its foundation, but its potential is held back by poor story pacing, performance issues, and recurring bugs.",

        "description": "From the outset, Hell is Us knows what kind of experience it wants to offer, and how it wants you to experience it. Novel at times, a throwback to the older days of gaming in others, it's a solid action-adventure with plenty of rough edges and shortcomings, yet one that endeared me to venture beyond the next corner to see what's ahead, even if the rewards were more rudimentary than breathtaking. \n\nThe overall lasting impact is up for debate, but it could be an experience you'll more or less appreciate, even with its many flaws. If nothing else, Hell is Us kind of reminds us there's no place like home, even if you can never truly go back.",
