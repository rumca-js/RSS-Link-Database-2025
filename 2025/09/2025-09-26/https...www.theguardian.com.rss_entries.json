There should be no sense of a similar procession for Luke Donald and his 2025 contingent. Nonetheless, the strength of Europe\u2019s early performance in New York felt hugely significant. It is Keegan Bradley, the US captain, who does not have his troubles to seek. Europe won two sessions out of two, including five of the first six matches.</p><p>\u201cWe have only played 28% of the points,\u201d said a bullish Bradley. \u201cThis is first quarter.

Now Thames Water is planning a new \u00a3500m project to tackle drought in the capital.</p><p>The Thames Gateway desalination plant at Beckton, built for \u00a3270m and now largely mothballed, has racked up an estimated \u00a3200m in debt interest, about \u00a345m in idle upkeep and about \u00a33m in operating costs, according to Thames Water figures. That puts the lifetime bill at about \u00a3518m, or about 7p for every litre the plant has ever produced, which is 28 times more than customers usually pay for their water.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/26/500m-thames-water-desalination-plant-has-provided-just-seven-days-water-over-15-years\">Continue reading...</a>",
