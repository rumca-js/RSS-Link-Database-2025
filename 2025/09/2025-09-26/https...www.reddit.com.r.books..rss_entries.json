There are as many people say they cannot get past page 100, as say it is the best thing they&#39;ve ever read.</p> <p>My take? This is a book about obsession, compulsion, addiction, discipline, loneliness, and intelligence all in one, and their unifying interrelatedness. It is about how drug addiction, sports ambition, and patriotism are children of the same impulse. How entertainment and elitism are born from the same wellspring. That Ambition = Obsession = Addiction = Entertainment, and they all exist just to distract us from existential Boredom.</p> <p>I strongly disliked reading Gravity&#39;s Rainbow, but even in that distaste, I recognised the work of a hyper detail-oriented polymath, and the novel at least cul",
