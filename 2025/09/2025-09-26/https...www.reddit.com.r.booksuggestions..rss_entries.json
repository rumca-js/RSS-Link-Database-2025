        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all! I&#39;m always looking for new (and new-to-me) fantasy books to escape into, away from my mundane life~ and I&#39;m hoping you fabulous folks can give me some recommendations, add lately I&#39;ve not been finding any that really click for me. I&#39;ll just list below what I love, like, and absolutely do not want. </p> <p>Love: high fantasy, magic everywhere, whimsy, diverse casts of characters, richly built worlds and magic systems, funky magical creatures, magical species, 3rd person perspective, strong stand-alone novels, witches &amp; sorcerers, vampires, werewolves, fae, humor, &quot;medieval/Renaissance&quot; era</p> <p>Like: mid fantasy, urban fantasy, swapping POVs (still within 3rd person perspective), short series (2-5 books), I can tolerate graphic violence but it&#39;s not preferred, limited magic, modern settings, drama, romance if it&#39;s a minor subplot and also please only fade-to-black style xes scenes if there are any at all<",

I want team dynamics, training, games (doesn\u2019t have to be a team sport though) and not just \u201ewe won and have sex every other page\u201c.</p> <p>For example there are the All For The Game books by Nora Nakavic, more so The Sunshine Court and The Golden Raven. There is romance, but the plot and sports are a main topic. I live for the games. I also liked the Scoring Chances Books by Avon Gale, especially Empty Net.</p> <p>I love icehockey, football or martial arts, but I\u2018m fine with everything.

I really like mystery books, the murderes and thriller parts are optional, I just like the mystery parts, how the authors think of ways to make a big plot twist at the end and how all the little clues that I would never think about throughout the book lead to that ending. I read almost all of her books, I still need to buy a couple more, but I want a little change, just some other author with some good mystery stories. </p> <p>I also read &quot;The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle&quot;, &quot;The Devil and the Dark Water&quot; and &quot;The Last Murder at the End of the World&quot; by Stuart Turton, I REALLY enjoyed those too. They&#39;re longer than Christies books, but also have that mystery part. And while her books are more realistic, his books have a bit of fantasy in them. So anything with that vibe would be AMAZING too. </p> <p>And I read &quot;Outsider&",

I\u2019ve been really into dark &amp; academic sci-fi &amp; fantasy books, especially in alternate universes that have magical systems, beasts, curses, mysteries, etc. Recently I read the locked tomb series, Babel, The Poppy War, How to Shape A Dragons Breath, The Secret Commonwealth and Six of Crows, and am looking for similar reads! Also, would appreciate books that maybe have less emphasis on romance in general, though I am always looking for more sapphic books ! There\u2019s lots of book lists out there for books of this genre but I\u2019m looking for some more niche picks that aren\u2019t necessarily popular or new, but just something that is fun while meaningful in relation to our world. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/-GalaxyCrow-\"> /u/-GalaxyCrow- </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1n",
