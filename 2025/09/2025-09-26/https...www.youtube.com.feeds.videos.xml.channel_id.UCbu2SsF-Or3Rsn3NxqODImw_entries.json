        "description": "An Unforgettable Climb.\n\nThere's so much to love about Hollow Knight: Silksong, especially if you were a fan of the first game. This sequel better focuses the narrative with guided exploration and eases the frustrations with the first game's platforming by making the protagonist far more acrobatic. \n\nIn many respects, that makes it a safe sequel, as much of the game is merely a more polished, approachable, and fulfilling take on what worked well before. But that first game is one of the best metroidvania titles out there, making this sequel equally essential. The wait for Hornet's story was more than worth it.\n\n#GameSpot #Silksong #Review #Hollowknight",
