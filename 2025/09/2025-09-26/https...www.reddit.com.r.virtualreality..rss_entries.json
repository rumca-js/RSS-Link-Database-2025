When I finally got it tweaked for MSFS it was such a huge upgrade in FOV and visual quality. But then the trouble started about 6 months in. - Tracking Issues-. I broke down and brought the $200 face plate. It arrived then I found out that it does not work with the PCL controllers. I only needed one Index or Vive controller for room set up so how much could just one controller cost - since I already sold my Index controllers - well $160. I balked at that and decided to buy a cheaper vive controller off Ebay for $40. When I received it, it worked - not.</p> <p>I decided to just suck it up and buy a new Index controller. (I sold both of my old ones for dirt cheap). I felt well I already have the base stations so I am sorta still ahead. 2 months later - tracking issues but a different type. {will save you from the details).

They\u2019re planning to keep adding content, with new robot opponents and even a Training Mode already in the works. </p> <p>Also, the price is super fair at just $7.99, which is nice to see for a VR game. If you\u2019re into VR boxing or rhythm games, give it a shot and support some indie devs</p> <",

Can get about 10-15 mins out of playtime if im lucky before the image freezes, headset turns off and then on, and repeats this cycle of working for 10 min and then restarting. Tried every possible solution/fix i could find on the internet. Even bought a powered usb hub which does absolutely nothing. Tried making a ticket and asking meta, telling them ive tried all the common fixes. What do they do? Ask me to update my gpu drivers. After going back and forth with them and after trying for the 10th time the most basic fixes and none of them working they just gave up and said sorry cant help you good luck.

If so, is this the normal way that static fov rendering is implemented? I try to avoid static fov rendering like the plague so I don&#39;t know if this is how all vr games do it but it just seems like a horrendously bad idea.
