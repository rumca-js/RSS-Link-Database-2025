This solves one of the biggest pain points in PC gaming today, making it easier than ever to deliver a console-quality experience on Windows.</p> <p>Advanced shader delivery is <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/introducing-advanced-shader-delivery/\">coming on October 16th</a> to the new <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/handhelds/rog-xbox-ally\">ROG Xbox Ally</a> handhelds and we\u2019re happy to share some of the tooling that allowed us to enable this first step towards solving long load times and stutter in games for players. Gamers who own these devices receive precompiled shaders at download time on select titles to start gaming faster. In today\u2019s blog, we will focus on the other side of the equation: game development.</p> <p>Our vision",
