        "description": "Quentin Tarantino has given us some of cinema\u2019s most chilling and terrifying villains. From Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds to Calvin Candie in Django Unchained and beyond. But none embody the Psycho Killer archetype quite like Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs.\n\nWhen Reservoir Dogs first hit theaters in 1992, audiences were both disturbed and fascinated by Mr. Blonde\u2019s casual approach to violence. His infamous \"ear\" scene remains one of the most shocking and unsettling moments in Tarantino\u2019s filmography.\n\nDo YOU think Mr. Blonde is Tarantino\u2019s scariest villain? Or does Hans Landa or Calvin Candie take the crown? Let us know in the comments!\n\n#reservoirdogs #quentintarantino #tarantino #pulpfiction",
