It would be very helpful if ChatGPT could automatically perform OCR (optical character recognition) so it can read and extract text from image-based PDFs, similar to how some other AI tools handle scanned documents.</li> <li><strong>Editable and Manual Memory:</strong> The memory feature is useful, but at the moment it is not user-editable. It would be great if users could manually add, edit, or delete specific memories. This would give more control, accuracy, and flexibility in managing stored information.</li> </ol> <p>I believe these improvements will greatly enhance the usability of ChatGPT for many users, especially for those who often handle s",
