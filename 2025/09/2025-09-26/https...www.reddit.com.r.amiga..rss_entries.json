(Just did a quick search - nothing likely came up.) I think it was a horizontal scroller given that when I think of the mech form I am only visualising it side-on.</p> <p>Your character had three increasingly powerful forms - fighter plane (I think), something that might have been similar to the gerwalker mode that they had in Macross/Robotech then finally a mech.</p> <p>I think that if you were in the mech form and got hit you&#39;d go back to the gerwalker or even perhaps fighter plane version rather than immediately losing a life.</p> <p>That&#39;s about all I can think of - anyone got any ideas what game this might have been?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",
