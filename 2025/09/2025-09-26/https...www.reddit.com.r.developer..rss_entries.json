Hiring designers early on wasn\u2019t realistic, and even \u201cAI design\u201d tools felt more like demos than real solutions. </p> <p>So we built PixelApps - an AI design assistant that generates pixel-perfect, design-system backed UIs. You just describe your screen, pick from multiple options, and get a responsive interface you can export as code or plug into v0, Cursor, Lovable, etc. </p> <p>Right now, it works for landing pages, dashboards, and web apps. Mobile apps are coming soon. In beta, 100+ builders tested it and pushed us to refine the system until the outputs felt professional and production-ready.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AugustusCaesar00\"> /u/AugustusCaesar00 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1nr2h0k/we_were_si",
