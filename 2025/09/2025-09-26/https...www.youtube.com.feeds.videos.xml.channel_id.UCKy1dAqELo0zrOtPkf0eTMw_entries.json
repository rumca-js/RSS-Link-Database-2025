        "description": "EA Sports FC 26 reviewed by Ricky Frech on PlayStation 5, also available on PlayStation 4, Switch 1 & 2, Xbox, and PC.\n\nEA Sports FC 26\u2019s on-pitch gameplay is the best it's been in a long time. Dribbling is sticky and responsive, passing is crisp, and goalkeepers can actually play their position. But despite the positive improvements both mid-match and across its various modes, an increased focus on monetization is more distracting than ever. Ultimate Team players have had it bad enough for years, but now, not even the Career Mode players are safe from the Season Pass woes. If you can get past the microtransaction madness, there is a noticeably better soccer game here, and that is worth celebrating \u2013 but FC 26 is also EA at its most money-hungry yet, and it\u2019s hard not to worry about where things will go from here.",

This comes from SIE CEO Hideaki Nishino after announcing the PS5 has made $136 billion in sales so far. In other news, the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X have finally revealed their prices, and they won't come cheap. The most powerful one, the Xbox Ally X, will start at $999 and also comes with AI-specific features not available in the Xbox Ally, which is priced at $599. And finally, despite lukewarm sales, the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy will end on a high note, according to the game's director.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PS5",

We fight him relatively early on and are lacking some important useful tools like Tacks/Conchcutter and the Architect's Crest if you want to go a heavy tools route. The Wanderer Crest would also be an option here as you want to be able to strike fast. That said, you can also use things like the Threefold Pin if you're lacking some other high-end tools at this point. We use a very basic loadout for this fight and no tools, but you can certainly do the fight faster if you want to use more powerful things.\n\nCrest: Hunter\nThrowable: Pimpillo \nAbility: Rune Rage\nTools: Druid's Eye, Weavelight, Cogwork Wheel, Compass, Magnetite Brooch\n\nFor more info on Hollow Knight: Silksong, head to our wiki @ https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong",

And so now we look forward to learning much more about this project. After all, we know so little about it. We do know that Get Out and Nope director Jordan Peele is involved, but that he\u2019s working on a separate OD experience, one that will replace the \u201cKnock\u201d subtitle with a different kind of fear. So is this an anthology of games, each one exploring unique phobias? Or will OD be a collection of different media, breaking boundaries between games and films? P.T. reimagined the shape of horror over a decade ago, of course, so we\u2019re more than ready to see Kojima do it all over again.\n\n#ign #od #pt",

        "description": "First Sinner is very flashy in Hollow Knight: Silksong, but as long as you don't get distracted by the visuals, it's not too stressful. The Wanderer Crest is a good alternative to this basic build. We also only have one Needle upgrade at this point as we come here relatively early in Act 2. Using the Needolin is probably your most effective ability to utilize beyond some of the usual tools (if you have them) like Cogfly and Pollip Pouch. She also has a healing animation you want to try and interrupt as often as possible.\n\nCrest: Hunter\nThrowable: Longpin\nAbility: Silkspear\nTools: Druid's Eye, Weavelight, Cogwork Wheel, Compass, Magnetite Brooch\n\nFor more info on Hollow Knight: Silksong, head to our wiki @ https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
