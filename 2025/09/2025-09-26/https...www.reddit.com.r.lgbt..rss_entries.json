I don&#39;t want to invalidate her feelings but it&#39;s frustrating. Thanks for reading this girl venting.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/alien08Uy\"> /u/alien08Uy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1nqorp5/my_girlfriend/\">[link]</a></span",
