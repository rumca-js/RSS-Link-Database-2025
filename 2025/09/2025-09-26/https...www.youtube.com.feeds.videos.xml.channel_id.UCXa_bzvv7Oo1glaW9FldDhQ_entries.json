        "description": "Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian is the latest addition to a long list of titles in the franchise, and comes with a story that's full of heart, laughter, and adorable characters. But it also brings a crafting system that lives up to the alchemist part of its name, while the guardian part regrettably takes a back seat thanks to a lackluster combat system.\n\nNevertheless, it's quite an entertaining game, and can be good for many hours of fun as you explore its many locations and take on enemy after enemy in order to unleash a set of very flashy moves. \n\nIts anime style visuals and characters work well to bring an experience that's cheerful and unabashedly gleeful, the banter and meaningful moments between its expansive cast eschewing the more gloomy trappings of other RPGs. \n\nWhile it doesn't raise the bar for the most part, it does provide a fun distraction, and an entertaining one at that.",

        "description": "Playing through Silent Hill f ahead of its release has been \"some\" experience. But why was that so? What does Konami's latest addition to its long-standing franchise do that its peers, both within its ranks and without, don't? That's what this one's about. \n\nJoin us as we explore how this masterpiece manages to weave seemingly disparate elements of its experience together to present a horror game that's not just well, horrifying, but troublingly haunting as well. \n\nBlending melancholy with jaw-dropping frights, Silent Hill f is now the game to beat in a genre that has no shortage of excellent titles. And it earns that top spot every step of the way with a fresh yet familiar approach to the horror genre's trappings.",
