The centerpiece of the night was a high-energy, two-out-of-three falls match between Team Hawlucha (M\u00edstico, M\u00e1scara Dorada, and Tit\u00e1n) and Team Machamp (Volador Jr., Hechicero, and B\u00e1rbaro Cavernario).</p><p>The event was more than just a spectacle; it brought Pokemon characters to life through some of the performers' stunning ring gear. M\u00edstico donned Hawlucha-inspired attire, Hechicero embodied Machamp, and other wrestlers repped favorites like Gengar, Sylveon, and Togepi.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/ar",
