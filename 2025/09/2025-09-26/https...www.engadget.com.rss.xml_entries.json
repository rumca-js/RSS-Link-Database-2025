They're similar, but Norton VPN has a few more features, including the ability to choose cities as server locations in countries with more than one option.</p> \n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\">I'll state my opinion up front. Norton VPN isn't a bad service, but it's not good enough to get ahead of its direct competitors. ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN and NordVPN are all either faster, more feature-rich, more secure, more affordable or some combination of the four.
