So I&#39;m still going to spend time on this JRPG. I&#39;m still having a lot of fun and I think I&#39;m getting close to the end now. I can see why my younger self was intimidated by this game.

They were still considered \u00ab old games \u00bb, and most of their remakes and releases were still in 2D. Plus, I think it would look great in HD2D!! Idk what they could add to DQIV apart from more story elements and character development. Having the party members fully voice acted would be neat! Plus, now that DSM: the dark prince has released, they could seize the opportunity to tie that game in as well. Just a suggestion!! For DQV, I feel like adding new story sequences with Nera and Debora as a child would further bolster their bonds, and help flesh out those two characters more. I want to feel like choosing Nera and Debora actually matter to the hero. Bianca is the hero\u2019s childhood friend, with whom they went on adventures tog",

Likewise, the StrikerDC wireless Dreamcast controller doesn&#39;t support a VMU, one of the most distinguishing pieces of the system, imo.</p> <p>So my question is, what would be some of y&#39;all&#39;s recommendations for wireless controllers (or mods someone could make) which are as close to the first party originals as possible (and don&#39;t rely on line of sight like some of the old infrared wireless controllers)?</p> <p>Looking the following systems: NES, SNES, N64, GameCube, Genesis, Dreamcast, PS1, PS2, Xbox</p> </div><!-- SC_O",
