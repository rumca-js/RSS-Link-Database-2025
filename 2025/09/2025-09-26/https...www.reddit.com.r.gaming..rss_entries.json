I remember going to the town&#39;s shopping centre at around 11pm and queueing up outside Virgin Megastores for it&#39;s launch at midnight. IIRC it came with a bandana and a cool poster. I couldn&#39;t tell you what time I played that game until when I got home. I probably didn&#39;t sleep much though!</p> <p>SF4 was a cool one. Game put on a mini tournament in their store where the winner would get a copy of it before the official launch time. I think sign-up was pretty cheap (maybe \u00a35) and I ended up winning the whole thing! (I played as Sagat.) The contest finished around 10pm so I got myself a copy of the game a couple of hours before everyone else did and felt like an absolute king! Played that until the early hours of the morning too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/digiBeLow\"> /u/digiBeLow </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1nqy",
