Kennedy Junior - said taking Tylenol, also known as paracetamol, during pregnancy was linked to a \"very increased risk\" of autism in children. Medical experts have strongly pushed back on the claims, saying there is not strong enough scientific evidence to show a link, with some calling the president's comments dangerous.   \n\nIn the past few months, several of the main scientists in charge of public health in America have either been sacked by the health secretary, or have resigned in protest at what they say are decisions based on ideology, not scientific data.   \n\nIn today\u2019s episode, Anthony and Marianna chat to Dr Debra Houry, a former chief medical officer at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, who spent a decade at the organisation before resigning in protest over RFK Jr\u2019s leadership. She tells us about the events that pushed her towards resignation,",

        "description": "There was widespread surprise at the UN General Assembly this week, when Donald Trump appeared to drastically alter his tone on the war in Ukraine. His new insistence that Ukraine could win back all of its territory was welcomed by President Zelensky as a \"big shift\". \n\nSo, even as Russia dismisses the claims as \"erroneous\", could this change of rhetoric lead to a policy reset from the United States in its response to the conflict?\n \nTo answer your questions, Lucy Hockings and Vitaly Shevchenko are joined by the BBC's Europe Digital Editor, Paul Kirby. They discuss whether Kyiv can seize the momentum of this moment, and the continued fallout from multiple Russian incursions of Nato airspace.\n\nListen to the full episode here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0m4znvy\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Ukraine #Russia #BBCNews",
