I installed it on this old laptop (Dell Inspiron 1525, originally ran Vista, now runnung Lubuntu.) and thought I&#39;d give it a shot. Theres something I really enjoy about working on this. Installing linux, learning terminal entries (sudo apt and things like that) and bring able to customize it to my desire.</p> <p>Going for a Chappell Roan theme with my laptop and if anyone has any ideas where I can add on to it, feel free. Im happy I got wifi working on this baby after a while AND dvd libraries were installed since the laptop has a drive. Right now my only concern is finding a new battery since the battery life on this is HORRENDOUS. So if anyone knows a good place to find one, im open to suggestions. </p> <p>Again, happy to have installed Linux and cant wait to fiddle with this more.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JaySamraNY\"> /u/JaySa",

Distro-hopping has been fun, but I finally feel like I\u2019ve found my setup.</p> <p>For me, native packages &gt; sandboxed ones. That ruled out Ubuntu (since they push snap) and led me toward Fedora/RHEL-based distros. Fedora was great for a while, but the short release cycle sometimes caused package/version headaches. That\u2019s when I looked into RHEL and its family, CentOS, Rocky, Alma. I ended up on AlmaLinux because it\u2019s stable, backed by big players, and feels future-proof.</p> <p>On the desktop side, I love i3WM, but I need good GUI and hardware support. GNOME hits that balance, and with custom keybindings I\u2019ve got it behaving a lot like i3. Honestly, I was worried AlmaLinux would feel old or limited, but it surprised me, it feels just like Fedora 40, and everything works smoothly.</p>",
