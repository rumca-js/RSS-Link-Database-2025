It is called <a href=\"https://conjecscore.org/\">https://conjecscore.org/</a> and it currently only has 1 problem. But even though there is only one problem, the problem does not have a known solution. It&#39;s an open math problem. Instead of having a known solution it has a &quot;score&quot; function that determines how &quot;close&quot; you are to solving the problem (informally). It still has a lot of rough edges but I was wondering if people were frankly even interested in the idea. If so, I could try finding more open problems and give them a score function too. Additionally, I could continue polishing the site too.
