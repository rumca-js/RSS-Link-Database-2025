It&#39;s fcking being rerouted. Now chatgpt gonna define what is a sensitive topic. I just said do you know this girl, it fucking rerouted to 5. </p> <p>See youself and it also told be. As you can see chat is selected to 4o but responses are on auto and 5</p> <p>Look at that whem context are long it shift to 5. Like since when 5 was giving long responses and we are talking about AI which is emotionally dead and personal and emotional chat are rerouted to 5. Wow what a irony.</p> <p>And most important",

Confirmed it by restarting a chat of mine from the start and it spoke as 4o again. Though for extra clarity: o3, o4-mini, and 4.1 work just fine.
