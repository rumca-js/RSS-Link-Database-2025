It works fine in big picture and in steam overlay but just no input is send to the game themselfs. I tried both dongle and wired, big picture and not, changing different controller layouts, nothing seems to work even in games with native controller support. When launching steam from terminal no output in logs seems to be connected to the problem. </p> <p>I&#39;m using Debian 14, and if there is any more info I can give I would be more than happy to provide, because I&#39;m really running out of ideas!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/smthglikethat\"> /u/smthglikethat </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1nredix/steam_controller_isnt_seen",

From what I&#39;ve seen, the issue is with the GPU, as it appears to have much smaller power draw (according to MangoHud). Worth noting, that such thing happens in all 3D games (War Thunder was just easy to show) and on KDE and Gnome, so it&#39;s not game or DE exclusive. The only way to fix the issue is to completely restart the computer.</p> <p><s",

Is this a fair decision to make? Am I now a &quot;fake&quot; or a &quot;poser&quot;? (Not a genuine concern). I&#39;m certain those on Arch are going to say so. Also, my desktop does not have the specs good enough to run Windows in a VM even with GPU passthrough because my CPU is already a bottleneck my GPU, so taking away some of my compute to host a VM is not going to be acceptable for VM videogame perfomance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mastergameisnowhere\"> /u/Mastergameisnowhere </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1nr2794/windows_10_eol/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

ALVR runs at about 74ms and WiVRn at about 60-65ms of latency but that is simply too high for games such as Beat Saber. It&#39;s really been driving me crazy and I hope that you guys here would maybe be able to help out! My network latency as reported by ALVR is only around 5ms and I use a 5Ghz network, so I don&#39;t think this is much of a network issue. I have a Radeon RX 6750 XT and I&#39;m on Fedora 42.
