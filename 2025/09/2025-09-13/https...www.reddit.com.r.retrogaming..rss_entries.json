To get attacks (and effects like healing) you have to defeat other monsters. This will get you gems that you add to your monsters deck so far so good except outside the tournament and main quest there is no random battles but you simply place a gem and a monster will spawn that you can fight for a different type of gem and keeping track of what monsters are spawned by what and drops what is a pain (as you need multiple gems of many attacks/effect to be useful in your deck most apparent being healing). That along with no description so either go by trail and error or look up a guide. Even when you know all that the UI becomes just a mess trying to grind and selling of gems you don&#39;t need.</p> <p>Money becomes meaningless as you will quickly have so much that nothing exists to buy that would ",
