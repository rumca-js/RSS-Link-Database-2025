With that being said I was never a computer guy or into software until I got laid off and was looking into any source of income. The first month I learned AI is not what O thought and are very flawed for being coders, 2 Microsoft seriously and incisively sucks. So with gpt help I got a couple of pits together but it never worked. I found out why that\u2019s another story. I now have Ubuntu jammy and it\u2019s cool. I like learning on it and it\u2019s straight forward. I am going to be doing all types of learning on this thing and was wondering if there would be. Good program for malware, virus protection. I want to turn my old desktop into a server so I\u2019m looking to grow and have an informative program. I\u2019ll have probably 3 or four sites on server and ai on desktop. Any suggestions would be huge. Thank I appreciate it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",
