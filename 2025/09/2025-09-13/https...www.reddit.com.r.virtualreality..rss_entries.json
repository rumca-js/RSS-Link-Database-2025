I&#39;m not the wealthiest person, but I can afford a quest 3, maybe a little bit over that. I&#39;m mainly getting one to play VRchat with my friends, and nothing much else. I&#39;m not particularly interested in any other high demanding games, and I do have a laptop strong enough to run VRchat without any lag or issues, and I would like a crisp, unblurred image, with a large sweetspot on the lenses. I would probably play for 2-6 hours depending on how much time I have. Any ideas?

It&#39;s crazy how this game can be sold in this state. I kept hearing good things about the game so I was determined to get it working. This is for steam vr. </p> <p>This is for quest 3 but can be altered for any other headset. A couple things to note that may be different for different headsets are that the controls do not save and have to be redone each time you play. Also, even within the game, if you alter the controls and exit the binding options, they only save for that moment. Once you re-enter the options to change anything you have to do it all over. The way around this is to edit the bindings but don&#39;t exit the binding menu. Instead, simply return to the game. This saves a lot of time when figuring out how to get your joysticks working.</p> <p>So to begi",

Both games will be heavilly modded.</p> <p>Right now in the used market theres a HTC vive OG for about 120 euros (it comes with base stands, and like 3 foam inserts). The quest 2 is about +- 180-200 euros in the second hand market in my arba. </p> <p>So im asking is it worth it as im going to only be playing pcvr and ive heard that the quest 2 lacks in somethings compared to the OG vive (fov, screen color), while javing a better resoliution?</p> <p>Ive also heard that you can use vive basetations with other headsets (so for example if i wanted to upgrade down the line i would buy something like index controllwrs and vive pro 2 headset).</p> <p>What would you recommend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",

Most new laptops don&#39;t have a dedicated display-port and instead opt for a USBC DP for any kind of peripheral shenanigans. My question is whether there is a way to setup a wired connection through the USBC to my laptop and if yes, what headset would work best in terms of latency and minimal compression. I&#39;ve read that the quest 3 has the virtual link cable that can connect via USB-C but the software is buggy and everyone is recommending going wireless for that one (not an option for me - running purely on a mobile hotspot). Thought about the PSVR2 but not sure whether i need both the PS PC adapter and a USB-C - DP adapter or just the PSVR2 cable will work. I think the USBC in the laptop im eyeballing right now (hp omen) is connected to the GPU tho im not sure. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",

Yes you can get proficient with any gunstock if you put enough time in. With Armory R1, you don&#39;t need to put much time in to start headshotting at distance.
