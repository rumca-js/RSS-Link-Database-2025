In fact, this is something I&#39;m seeing more frequently nowadays; I&#39;ll hear about a movie that just came out in theaters that I didn&#39;t even know was coming out.</p> <p>It was way different back in the &#39;90s when I was a kid. I pretty much knew EVERY movie that was coming out and when it was coming out because I would see tons of ads on TV and in the paper in the months leading up to its release.

I used to want to work film - firstly in special effects (animatronics to be specific!) and then when I realised that was not really feasible for someone growing up in Scotland I went and studied film at university. This was in the 1990s, and I didn&#39;t realise quite how good we had it back then. I&#39;d go to the cinema at least once a week (this was in Edinburgh, I could walk to big chain cinemas or arthouse ones, the choices were huge).</p> <p>In the end I didn&#39;t get a job working in film, but I still loved watching films, buying videos and DVDs, all that stuff. </p> <p>But recently I&#39;ve found I&#39;ve fallen out with the movies. I realised there wasn&#39;t much that was released that I had any interest in seeing, and the things I did go and see tended to be disappointing. So these days I go to the cinema maybe 4 times a year, and I barely watch films at home eit",

Had blockbuster and Netflix subscriptions simultaneously for back catalogue stuff. Dove into films as a way to one up people because I was so much better. Fell in love with my wife during a late night game of 6 degrees where we would both name a random actor/ress and the fastest to connect movies between the two the winner. Told my wife I loved her on Oscar night 2004. Trailed off watching films as the young kids came. Owned thousands of DVDs and bluerays, had to sell nearly all of them over the years during lean times. Some of them still hurt, others were easy to let go of. Stoped being a douche, or at least that flavor of douche. Got into fantasy books instead of films and haven&#39;t seen much recently - not to say nothing. Still a bit of a film snob. Given my description of myself, and not a single actual film Ive seen,",

Some of these best comedy of my generation imo, but lately I\u2019ve realized that there\u2019s a real underlying sense of tragedy and failure. All three films present us with a flawed protagonist who is called to rise above their weakness: Shaun needs to grow up, Angel needs to switch off, and Gary needs to stop memorializing his boyhood days. Ironically, the world around these protagonists caves, catering to their flaws, rather than forcing them to overcome them. I find it funny, but also kind of sad.
