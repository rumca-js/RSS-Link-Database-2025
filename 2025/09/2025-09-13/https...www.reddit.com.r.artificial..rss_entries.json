Several months ago, management laid off all the senior programmers. Coincidentally, I was assigned to a pilot program involving training and customer service AI systems. The timing of these decisions is becoming clearer now.</p> <p>Since the layoffs, we\u2019ve experienced an unprecedented number of system glitches - I personally discover 1-2 new ones daily. The irony? Our IT reporting system now requires an hour-long conversation with an AI just to submit a ticket, making it practically impossible to report issues when you\u2019re already overwhelmed helping customers deal with tech problems.</p> <p>The stakes here are high. This isn\u2019t a company where technical issues are just minor inconveniences - our systems directly impact people\u2019s live",
