The A2000 boots without issue, but the A1000 is giving some quirks. Specifically, it accepts the Kickstarter disk, but when I use any number of different versions of Workbench (1.1-1.3, and something called Bob&#39;s Workbench), it works for a few seconds before appearing to freeze. One disk doesn&#39;t freeze outright, but instead says &quot;Software error - task held. Finish all disk activities.&quot; I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s some kind of hardware issue, but am just posting to see if anyone knows anything about this or how best to proceed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RecipeNo101\"> /u/RecipeNo101 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ng9z2b/troubleshooting_a1000/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ng9z2b/tro",

I&#39;ve been working on this comedy fantasy adventure for a year now. It&#39;s set between it&#39;s own fantasy world (which sits on the back of a giant space snail) and our world. Well. South Yorkshire and Derbyshire. It&#39;s very situationally comedy focussed. More like Red Dwarf or Blackadder or even Viz (if anyone&#39;s heard of that). </p> <p>Any",

If I place files on my adf from the emulator and want to access them from my real Amiga 2000, the adf is desperately empty, there is no file on it. And the opposite is also true. If I format an adf on my real amiga and place files on it, they do not exist on fs-uae and the name of the added disk is not the right one. What is crazy is that if I add a file on the adf and change the name of the disk on my Amiga, on fs-uae it displays the old name created on fs-uae and the content added on fs-uae.. as if it were 2 different adf.. does anyone know if I make a mistake?
