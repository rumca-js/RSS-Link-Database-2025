And whilst I think this is a good thing, I think in books this can be quite difficult to achieve seamlessly. Whilst I think it&#39;s important that these characters are there and visible, I also think we&#39;ve got quite a harmful tendency to presume that everyone in a story is white, cishet and able-bodied until we&#39;re explicitly told otherwise, and sometimes there&#39;s never a convenient point in the story to tell the reader that a character has a protected characteristic without it feeling shoehorned in and on the nose.</p> <p>This is why I was very impressed with a technique used in the YA novel <em>First Day of My Life</em> by Lisa Williamson (who is one of my absolute favourite authors). There&#39;s a very minor character, a drama teacher called Ms Abraham, who only appears in one scene at",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi folks:) One thing i love with my books is a good musically- or thematically-relevant album to listen to while reading. For instance, I think King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard&#39;s 2016 psychedelic rock album Nonagon Infinity was practically MADE for Samuel R Delany&#39;s Dhalgren, with their shared chaotic murder city setting, similar hazy red covers, and in my opinion most strikingly the fact that they both loop around to the beginning, with Dhalgren beginning in the middle of a sentence and then at the end cutting off after the beginning of that same sentence.</p> <p>Currently I&#39;m reading Jeff VanderMeer&#39;s much-renowned psychological sci fi-horror novel Annihilation, and I figured there&#39;s gotta be some good stuff to go with this unsettling scifi type of atmosphere. So I&#39;m looking for any kinds of dark and ominous space-y music, or anything else you folks could point to as particularly Annihilated at all\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4dtyyyy\ud83e\udef6</p> </div><!-- SC",
