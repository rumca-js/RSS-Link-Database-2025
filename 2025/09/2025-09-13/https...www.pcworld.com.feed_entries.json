Windows often occupies more than 25 GB of space for things such as updates, restore points, and cache files. Plus, pre-installed bloatware further increases memory utilization. Freeing up memory can quickly become critical on notebooks with 128 GB SSDs or devices with soldered memory. But even on well-equipped systems, it\u2019s worth decluttering Windows as it can lead to fewer processes, a faster startup, and lower CPU load.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"get-windows-11-pro-for-cheap\">\n\t\t\t\t\tget windows 11 pro for cheap\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__content-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"product-wi",
