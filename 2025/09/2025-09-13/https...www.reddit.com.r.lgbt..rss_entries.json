Charlie Sheen was incredibly courageous to come out about his revelations about sexual encounters with men in his recent book and netflix mini series. It seemed Maher was ridiculing him about this. Joking about it in a condescending manner and even asking if he was a top or bottom. Like what do you want know Bill? Sex positions and acts? I found it extremely callous at best. Then he kinda blew him off when Charlie went to give him a hug at the end of the interview. Proud of Charlie Sheen to be strong enough to discuss this as it will inevitably help other men to be less ashamed and more able to discuss the topic as well. Maher&#39;s ridiculing has the opposite effect. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Special-Maximum-4575\"> /u/Special-Maximum-4575 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ng7w28/charlie_sheen_inter",
