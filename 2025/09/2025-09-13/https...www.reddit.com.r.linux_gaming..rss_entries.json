Rust works, and i can join servers, but the performance is really bad. It seems like it is always between 40-55, no matter what settings i change. CPU, GPU, RAM, and Disk usage is all not even near 80% yet i get this performance. From time to time it can dip all the way down to 10-15 fps for a few seconds, and then goes back to about 50. I have tried everything i can, and nobody seems to know the issue.
