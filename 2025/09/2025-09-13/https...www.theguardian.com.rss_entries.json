With a rising number of 18-year-olds in the UK, many assumed it would be a competitive scramble for places \u2013 but reality has unfolded rather differently.</p><p>\u201cThis year, the demand just isn\u2019t there,\u201d says Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute. \u201cInternational numbers are down, there\u2019s spare capacity, and more universities \u2013 even very selective ones \u2013 are opening places through clearing. Students now hold more power than expected.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/university-clearing-2026-could-you-get-a-better-place-heres-what-to-think-about\">Continue reading...</a>",
