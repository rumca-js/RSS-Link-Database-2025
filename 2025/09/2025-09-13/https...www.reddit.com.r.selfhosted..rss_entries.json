Currently the vaultwarden is being served on port 8000 but I&#39;m not sure how I setup the reverse proxy so when I go to custom.domain.example it goes to vaultwarden.

Well, I opened an issue just stating the info the providing many of the template and within 5 hours there was a pull request, and within ~20 hours it was pulled, and within like 2 days it was out with a big update v1.42.0! </p> <p>Sure it was litteraly a one-line edit that added about 4 chars, but it&#39;s crazy how fast it got fixed and got shipped within days (I think I got lucky on new update timing). Initially I lazed out the issue, and a week ago there was a fix for a very similar issue that shipped with v1.41.1 so I checked it but it didn&#39;t actually fix my issue (it was Beta timeline so I didn&#39;t care as much initially) so I finally decided to open an issue about it. </p> ",

This was entirely possible when i bought the plan (I asked) but in like Jan, 6 weeks after I bought the plan A2 got bought out by hosting dot com and they changed their AU to prohibit NextCloud and any filesharing altogether. The deal I have is a pretty good one, (a promotion of 170 for 3 years so like 57ish per year)-- I&#39;m trying to find a host that costs something similar that I can use to host my 2 websites but also set up NextCloud (or something else to use as a google drive replacement). Most the stuff I&#39;ve seen online is waaaayyyyy too expensive for my tiny budget, and everything I&#39;ve read about the &quot;lifetime&quot; hosts sounds like they&#39;re a scam. Does anyone have any suggestions for affordable shared hosting that allows NextCloud?",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have running my own small server at home running several isolated docker containers, Immich and Nextcloud. For management I use Proxmox and all is hosted mostly in VMs. No ports opened in my router. On top of that, I use Pangolin on a VPS with Crowdsec and geoblock. Only ports opened are the ones necessary for Pangolin. I am doing as much for security as I can with my knowledge and never had any problems with hacks, etc.</p> <p>My question is regarding detecting security breaches. Of course, if someone is getting into my system, deleting data, etc., I would recognize it. But if someone silently accessed my files through some security flaw I would not recognize. So what are you doing to see things like that, what logs to inspect? Or are there some pre-made systems to check for that, etc.? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OkAdvertising2801\"> /u/OkAdvertising2801 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://w",

One of those services is a mail client (specifically mailu). I used to be on an ISP that didn&#39;t block port 25, but I unfortunately had to move. The only ISP in the area is Comcast/Xfinity, which, unfortunately for me, block port 25. In order to get around this, I thought about using a VPS.</p> <p>I currently have a VPS with Racknerd with pretty much nothing on it. My thought was to configure some sort of Postfix server that would forward all incoming mail to my home server on a different port (say 2525), and then my home server would use the VPS as a relay.
