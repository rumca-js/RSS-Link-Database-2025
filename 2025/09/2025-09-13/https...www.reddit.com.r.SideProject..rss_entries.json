You can earn by literally just playing mobile games. </p> <p>The amount you earn is highly dependent on how much time you dedicate to playing, but it&#39;s genuinely just as straight forward as that. The more you want to earn, you simply just play more games and for longer durations. If you&#39;re looking for some extra pocket change, you can simply view this as a way to make a few extra dollars each week as well. This can easilly help pay for some bills each month. </p> <p>\u27a1\ufe0f <strong>If interested, you can sign up and also find more opportunities from the link in my profile.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NricTurtle\"> /u/NricTurtle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ng4204/play_mobile_games_in_your_spare_time_for_400_per/\">[link]</a></sp",
