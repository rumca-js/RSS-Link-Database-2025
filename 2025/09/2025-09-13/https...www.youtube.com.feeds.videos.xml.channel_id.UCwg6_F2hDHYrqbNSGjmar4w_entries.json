        "description": "The spinosaurus is one of biggest enigmas in palaeontology. It was such a weird Dino that every time we discover something new about we have to rethink its entire biology and ecology. For some, it\u2019s a croc-like water hunter. For others, it\u2019s a land predator with an in-built sail canvas to advertise its prowess. So what was the spinosaurus really like? And what are the discoveries that have changed our vision throughout a century of mystery?\n\nGet your copy of \"Strange Creatures\" now!
