The original context for a look-back here was <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey\">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s impending release - gosh, how time flies. Now we have an excuse to revisit this Wii classic once again.</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/looking-back-at-super-mario-ga",

This week, we've been banging our heads on <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong\">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> and trying to decide, for the most part, whether we love it or not. One moment we do, one moment we don't. But that's not all we've been playing. Tom's been struggling with technology again, Bertie's fallen down another rabbit hole, and Dom dug out the old <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics\">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> ahead of the remastered one's late September arrival.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-enjoy-the-rest-of-your-evening-going-around-in-circles-and-dying-lots\">Read more</a></p>",
