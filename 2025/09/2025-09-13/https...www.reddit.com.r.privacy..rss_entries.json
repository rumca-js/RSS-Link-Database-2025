I read The New Oil&#39;s guides on emails and am basing my structure on that. I am somewhat confused by the setup though. Here is my basic understanding/plan:</p> <ul> <li>Create a &quot;main&quot; Proton email address. This should be kept completely secret from the world and have no tie to personal information. Say something like: [<a href=\"mailto:randomstring8392106@proton.com\">randomstring8392106@proton.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:randomstring8392106@proton.com\">randomstring8392106@proton.com</a>)</li> <li>Use an email aliasing service (like SimpleLogin) to create separate accounts that point to your main account. Each email would be for a different purpose. Use a custom domain for the email addresses. For example: <ul> <li>[<a href=\"mailto:banking@customname.com\">banking@customname.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:banking@customname.com\">banking",
