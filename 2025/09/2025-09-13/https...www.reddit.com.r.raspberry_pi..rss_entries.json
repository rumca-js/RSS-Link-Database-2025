I&#39;m working on a mobile Pi 5 project, but it seems there isn&#39;t much demand for a seamless &quot;laptop-like&quot; portable battery in the Pi ecosystem. Ideally, I&#39;d figure out a way to display battery percentage in the top bar, and give the user alerts when battery is running low, but since I don&#39;t have much coding experience, I&#39;m hoping someone else might be able to point me in the right direction. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cellidonuts\"> /u/cellidonuts </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1nfm4vv/pisugar_software_on_a_pi_5/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1nfm4vv/pisugar_software_on_a_pi_5/\">[c",
