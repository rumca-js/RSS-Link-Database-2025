It&#39;s similar to InnerTune, ViMusic, SimpMusic and others in the same kind, but I focused on making my app extremely lightweight, fast, simple and reliable. The app is currently very bare-bones, but I am planning to add a bunch of features in the future.</p> <p>If you&#39;re interested in checking it out, here are all the usefull links :</p> <p>Github : <a href=\"https://github.com/ilianoKokoro/umihi-music/\">https://github.com/ilianoKokoro/umihi-music/</a><br/> F-Droid (IzzyDroid) : <a href=\"https://apt.izzysoft.de/packages/ca.ilianokokoro.umihi.music\">https://apt.izzysoft.de/packages/ca.ilianokokoro.umihi.music</a></p> <p>If you encounter any bugs with the app, please make a GitHub Issue so I can work on making the app better for everyone.
