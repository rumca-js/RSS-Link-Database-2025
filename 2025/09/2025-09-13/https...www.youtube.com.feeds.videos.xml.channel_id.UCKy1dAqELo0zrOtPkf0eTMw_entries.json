Nintendo\u2019s line of 2D Mario platformers has gone through three distinct eras since 1985 \u2013 the original game revived the video game industry and, for a while, the series was a pioneer in side-scrolling platforming. After lying dormant for a few years, the series returned in the 2000s with the New Super Mario Bros. series, games that were steady and safe but soon turned stale. Thankfully, the triumphant age of the Switch brought with it Mario Wonder, where Nintendo reinvented what these games could be.

It still plays well enough, and after all these years there\u2019s still something exciting about banking a goal in, or setting up the perfect pass. I rarely found myself unhappy with the actual gameplay, no matter how familiar it felt. On top of these things that worked well before, there are some small improvements that are welcome, like enjoying our collections of Ultimate Team players offline. At the same time, this series has stagnated visually, with relatively ugly players and crowds contrasted against beautiful hockey rinks. NHL 26 has left me feeling like I\u2019ve just watched a 6-5 overtime win in April when my team has already been eliminated from playoff contention: there\u2019s enjoyment to be had, but I can\u2019t help but hope they g",
