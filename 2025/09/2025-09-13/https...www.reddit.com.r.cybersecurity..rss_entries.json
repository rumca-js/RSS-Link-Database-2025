It actually surprised me because I\u2019ve always thought of Norton as just \u201cantivirus,\u201d but they seem to be going heavy on identity and privacy now.</p> <p>Here\u2019s their official site if anyone wants to see details: <a href=\"http://us.norton.com\">us.norton.com</a></p> <p>Curious, has anyone here actually used these newer Norton features in practice?

I don\u2019t get notifications when new devices log in, the only notification I ever received was that my Instagram email was changed. Each account uses a different email and password, so it\u2019s not like one leaked login is being reused. I\u2019ve already set up two-factor authentication on almost all accounts, and some already had it enabled before they got hacked (like Instagram and Steam). I even formatted my PC but the problem still continues. I don\u2019t understand how this keeps happening. Could my phone or PC be infected with malware/keyloggers? Or is there another explanation? Should I wipe my devices completely?

Plus, all of them followed the same workflow to validate the detections. I will click on a detection and check the IOC on VirusTotal, if it has more than 5 detections on VT we would add the hash to blocklist. We receive a lot of detections daily because of our client numbers. So to automate this whole process, I build a simple python tool that uses Falcon&#39;s API and VT API. This tool exports detections from CS and extract the IOCs and validates them automatically though VT and gives me a CSV report. The CSV reports filters the IOCs according to their detection type like (General Malware, Adware, Trojan, Clean files, etc). I will then add the IOCs in bulk to the blocklist in CS. After that, I will use the Detections IDs of those blocklisted IOCs to change the status of the detections to CLOSED.</p> <p>Had a lot of f",
