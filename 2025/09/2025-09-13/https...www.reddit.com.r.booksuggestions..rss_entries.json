Especially Kaz and Inej. The plot wasn&#39;t hard to follow nor was it very predictable. I also love the found family trope and I enjoy reading about an all knowing cunning criminal mastermind like Kaz. Ive been trying to find a book like this for a while but haven&#39;t been successful. I tried reading The Lies of Locke Lamora but unfortunately I couldn&#39;t connect with any of the characters and the plot felt a little anti climatic. I felt like the main chatacter is said to be very smart but he keeps making unintelligent decisions. So i was wondering if anyone could recommend me a book that would check all my requirements. Thank you in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TankCharacter9974\"> /u/TankCharacter9974 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boo",

I have read them both a few times. I especially like reading Poilu during the winter because he talks about how cold he is all the time.</p> <p>Can someone suggest something similar? Preferably about WW1 and not WW2. I read a few WW2 books written by Americans and the American slang was harder to understand than Ernst&#39;s book. </p> <p>For reference I am American and it was still challenging.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",

It\u2019s not necessarily the Japanese anime thing I\u2019m after (although I\u2019m currently reading Musashi and i absolutely love it) but it\u2019s the vibes I\u2019m looking for. drifting wanderers, quiet moments between action sequences, that sense of impermanence and melancholy, wanderers and outcasts moving from place to place, beauty and violence intertwined, Heavy doses of loneliness, regret, and impermanence, introspection, and maybe a bit of romance should it happen to come about. </p> <p>I\u2019m just looking for something super vibey.

I never understood it, I was always the one who rather watch the movie. </p> <p>Two weeks ago I picked up a copy of Verity and sat down and read it in one sitting. I couldn\u2019t put the book down. I have read a bunch since then:</p> <p>Reminders of him It happened one summer Silent patient The tenant Never lie</p> <p>I switch it up, I like romance some times, thrillers are great too. I like to go back and forth to mix it up </p> <p>I just finished the housemaid, did it in one sitting today and holy shit. I\u2019ve come to realize that might be the greatest book I\u2019ll ever come to read. </p> <p>Does anything have anything similar in the thriller department to the housemaid.
