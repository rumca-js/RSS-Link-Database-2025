        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I read BOTNS several years ago, and it blew my mind. I had never experienced anything like it. As well as being novel, it was pure brilliance. I have never read anything so imaginative and vivid. I mentioned this to a friend of mine yesterday, who believed that it was &quot;sci-fi masquerading as fantasy with an overly large focus on set-pieces. I always interpreted the narrative as deliberately meandering to highlight the fascinating world Wolfe had built. The other criticism was similar, which was &quot;there was no momentum and a weak central conflict.&quot; I personally enjoy the book due to the seeming randomness of the situations Severian finds himself in. Severian&#39;s goals are somewhat murky because he is character with a tumultuous mind who isn&#39;t dead set on everything he&#39;s ever thought about doing. I&#39;d be interested in what people think on here. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

Overall I think it&#39;s mostly warranted. The book started out slow and I really didn&#39;t like the main character at first, but he grows a lot over the book, and so do the side characters too. Unfortunately because of this it was a very easy book to put down, and it took me longer than usual to finish. All that being said, the last 25% or so was just fantastic. Easily pulled the book up from a 3 to 4 star for me. You might like this book too if you like stories involving gods (specifically deities personified as animals), folklore, sophisticated plotting, sibling relationships, and the &#39;power of stories&#39; theme. </p> <p><strong>Rating: 4/5</strong></p> <p>Categories:<br/> * High Fashion (norma",

There were not a ton of POVs to confuse or divert the reader from the main story, the characters were realistic and stoic in the face of hard choices. The dialogues were brilliant.

The past 3-4 years I\u2019ve really just devoted all my reading time to the fantasy genre and have absolutely loved it. Series below that I\u2019ve read:</p> <p>Wheel of time, Cosmere, Cytoverse, Green bone saga, Malazan, Foundation, ASOIAF, Dune, The Name of the Wind and Wise Man\u2019s Fear, Dandelion Dynasty (currently on the 3rd book).</p> <p>My question is what should I read next out of the series below?</p> <p>Dungeon Crawler Carl, Gentleman Bastard Series, The Dark Tower, The Broken Earth Trilogy, Red Rising, The Licanius Trilogy, Earthsea, Powder Mage and Gods of Blood and Powder, The Sun Eater.</p> <p>Or do I just bite the bullet and head into another set of massive works like Robin Hobbs books or Discworld? You may notice the lack of Joe Abercrombie. I read the first two books of The First Law but I lost interest for some reason. Should I give these another go?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

This anime is one of the more contemplative shows I&#39;ve ever watched. I feel like people should understand the slower pace and how this show focuses on the journey, not destination before hopping onboard to watch it.</p> <p>Frieren is the story of a powerful elven mage who traveled with the Party of Himmel the Hero several decades ago.
