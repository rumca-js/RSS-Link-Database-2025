The answers are simply different, it is difficult to describe, but sloppier, the model does not remember chat histories, even if the option is activated, it automatically saves everything as memory but seems to not use it at all, like GPT-5 it seems to generate an answer just to give one, there is no more effort and no more understanding of context. At least, 4o got lobotimized, or it has finally now been replaced by GPT-5, while the name still exists, OpenAI is able to do this, I can pretty well imagine they have done something. The fact that GPT-5 sets itself as the default even in chats that were started with 4o, if you continue, and you have to choose 4o again, seems weird. Also there is a difference at the model in ",
