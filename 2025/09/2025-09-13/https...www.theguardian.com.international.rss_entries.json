        "description": "<p>Countries like Australia that continue to dig up, export or burn fossil fuels, must take action or be held accountable</p><p>I often talk about my childhood in the Reef Islands, a special place on the far eastern seas of Solomon Islands. It is there that I learned to fish, to plant root crops and to hunt. I came to understand how to read the weather and which plants could be used for injuries and cuts. Above all, I was taught the importance of caring for the land and the ocean.</p><p>During bedtime, the spiritual connection to the land was taught to me through <em>kastom</em> stories. How did this land come about, how did that island come about, why is the river shaped like this or why is there a big rock near that waterfall? These stories taught me to respect and understand the natural world.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/13/taking-action-to-stop-climate-change-is-not-an-act-of-charity-it-is-a-legal-obligation\">Continue reading...</a>",
