The platform was founded in 2017, and its first business model was to incentivize users to bring traffic to their short links. I never really focused on SEO from the beginning. I tried in the past, but to me, it felt like some kind of voodoo that didn\u2019t work. For context, I\u2019m a developer.</p> <p>This year I reviewed the business model: I stopped incentivizing users to bring traffic and instead built a platform that offers this service for free. I also added two more services that are adjacent to this niche.</p> <p>Now my dilemma is: should the homepage present all three services with separate dedicated pages for each, or should I keep the homepage focused on the main service (URL shortener) and create separate pages only for the other two services?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AnonMaleHuman\"> /u/AnonMaleHuman </a> <br/",

If you search online about how blogging helps your website to rank better you will get hundred of thousands of articles saying how superly great is blogging for your website in terms of SEO and always saying about the same reasons: it can can attract more visitors, it can enhance visibility, it can Improve Engagement Metrics and blah blah blah.</p> <p>But no one really answers if blog posts that are engaging, keep a lot of time users on your site, decreases bounces rates etc etc, can actually <strong>increase the ranking of the whole other parts</strong> of your domain ,not just the blog posts themselves, like product <strong>category pages for example in a ecom website</strong>.
