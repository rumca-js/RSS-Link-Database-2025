We have a group of a 10 year old, one 16 year old, and 2 adults. the 10 year old is advanced for their age, more like a 12 year old. I&#39;ve been looking into oath, and clank! legacy, but they might be a bit complex. We have played My City, and it was fun, but I honestly am not a huge fan. I very much like deck building games, and some other (non legacy) some games we play are: Catan (we have c&amp;k and seafarers as well, this is by FAR our most played game), we play legends of andor fairly often, and lots of other small games.</p> <p>I&#39;d be very grateful if someone could give me a few options, Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: Sorry!

It was a card based game where you had to evolve from a basic organism up to a human. You did this by matching the type of organism by colour and you had to move up the animal kingdom in steps until you reached human. I played it against one other person but can\u2019t remember if more players were allowed or not. I know it had a black box as well. Hope that\u2019s enough info if anyone knows which game I\u2019m talking about! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sam-Thamm\"> /u/Sam-Thamm </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ng5dqq/help_remembering_the_name_of_a_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ng5dqq/help_remembering_the_name_of_a_game/\">[comments]</a></span>",

For the \u201cprisoner\u201d treasure being resolved does the relevant hero go into the cells exhausted just like when you use the cells yourself? So basically the same thing as using the cells but you don\u2019t get the 3 tactic cards. And the other heroes in there don\u2019t reactive I\u2019m assuming. </p> <p>Next question. When heroes are attacking can they attack the same monster multiple times. Example: 2 Warriors is in a room with a slime and a lizardfolk. So the first Warrior attacks a lizardfolk but it defends. Can the next Warrior just attack the same lizardfolk instead of the Slime? My girlfriend and I played as yes because I had multiple defend cards and she did not.</p> <p>That brings the defend card in question too. We read the defend rule as only when the heroes are attacking with their \u201cmelee attack\u201d (when they are in the same room as the monster). The defend can\u2019t defend against the Archer\u2019",
