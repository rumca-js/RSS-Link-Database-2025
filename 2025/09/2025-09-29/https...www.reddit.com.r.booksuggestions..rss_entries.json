I&#39;m looking to lighten up my experience with a long and engrossing fantasy novel. I know nothing is as good as, but the last book to give me the feeling I&#39;m looking for is Name of the Wind. Or other examples are Priory of the Orange Tree or The 13 and a half Lives of Captain Bluebear. (and everything by those authors) So in the same vein, there can be heavy themes, but overall it&#39;s more escapism than moody ponderings. And to get involved, I need quality writing, complex characters, rich world - like the examples above. </p> <p>Thanks!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ScatterPop\"> /u/ScatterPop </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ntt6jg/fantasy_novel_i_can_get_lost_in_not_too_dark_not/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

I read a lotttttt of comic books but i realised im missing out on great stories with normal books as well (im sure theres a name for them) so i was wondering if anybody could suggest any books for a new reader.

While I love beautiful prose and classics, our group tends to appreciate a modern book, well paced plot as well as more dynamic character development. </p> <p>Some examples of absolute hits for our book club this year have been: 1. Lady Tan&#39;s Circle of Women 2. Project Hail Mary 3. None of This is True 4. Wild Dark Shore (which they all admit was an anomaly) 5. Babel</p> <p>Some examples of flops: 1. The Dutch House 2. North Woods 3. The Dispossessed 4. We Have Always Lived in the Castle 5. A few little romances thrown in there for fun (Abby Jimenez, TJR, etc.)</p> <p>There&#39;s no genre restrictions on our book club and non-fiction is totally fair game.

I don\u2019t want anything that\u2019s cheesy or even cute. Something angsty but not like edgy (if that makes sense) If you are familiar with the movie teenage dirtbag (2009) 10 things I hate about you (1999) and Warm Bodies (2013) those are the sort of romance movies I enjoy, where the romance is not overplayed and it\u2019s just two people enjoying each other. I don\u2019t mind if things are a little more brutal, I just find things like 50 shades of grey very offputting and unenjoyable, but at the same time I feel possibly even worse about books like icebreaker or whatever. Idk I just want to find a romance that I enjoy, and I have yet to do so. Thanks for reading!!!
