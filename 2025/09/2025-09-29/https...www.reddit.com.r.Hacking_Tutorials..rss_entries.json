Personal laptop being the one you use for everyday use (streaming, email, etc).

Now I want to move into red teaming and learn AD exploitation, phishing, lateral movement, the fun stuff. </p> <p>The problem is, most courses I find online are insanely expensive (like $1000+), and my company won\u2019t sponsor training. I don\u2019t want to break the bank, but I also don\u2019t want to just read blogs and hope I learn something. Are there any affordable but serious options out there? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Otherwise-Laugh-6848\"> /u/Otherwise-Laugh-6848 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1nt3lyh/is_there_any_affordable_way_to_learn_advanced/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1nt3lyh/is_there_any_affordable_way_to_learn_advanced/\">[comments]</a></span>",
