I should note that while I&#39;m not quite a noob, I don&#39;t have a ton of experience with the Pi... I guess I&#39;d rate myself about a 3 out of 10 on Pi skills.</p> <p>Now here&#39;s the challenge... I want to set the camera up to stream to a web browser, which I&#39;m sure I can figure out. But it would be nice to have the Pi automatically control the iris too, based on the image brightness the camera is seeing. Can anyone give me an idea whether it&#39;s possible to do that, and how?</p> <p>To clarify, I&#39;m mostly talking about the software aspect of it. I&#39;m good with electronics and can get the Pi to control the iris, if I can just get the info from the sensor to control it with!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted ",
