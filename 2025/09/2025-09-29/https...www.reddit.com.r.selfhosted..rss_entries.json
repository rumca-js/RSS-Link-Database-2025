I&#39;m just worried if something goes down while I&#39;m away (such as a trip back home) I&#39;ll be stuck without any options.</p> <p>Any thoughts?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>EDIT: If this isnt possible, is there another self hosted password manager that does this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FurthestDrop517",

This is all running on my Macbook in my home.</p> <p>My missus and I connect to the server on our Android phones using the Conversations app from Fdroid.

For some strange reason, after setting up the new Wifi hub from the new ISP with port forwarding and connecting both my Macbook and Android phone to it, the Conversations app no longer connects to the ejabberd server. BUT if I use mobile data instead of Wifi on my phone, it connects fine. Also if I go to my neighbour&#39;s house and use their Wifi",

(Photoprism for example unless I set it up wrong). I have about 12TB of jpgs (RAW are in a separate file structure) that I want to be able to view in a web based application. Photoprism works except it processes each photo and with a 12TB library I need almost 300GB to store the photo DB.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for solutions that can:</p> <p>1 - run locally 2 - not require me to move my file structure. Everything is in a single folder with subfolders 3 - not store a copy of the image itself in the database. I\u2019m fine with metadata and things that can be compressed. I know this might take a page to load longer if it\u2019s not stored in a DB and that is preferred for me</p> <p>Any options available?</p> <p>Thanks Chris</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jamesmystic69\"> /u/jamesmystic69 </a> <br/> <span><",

Important is also to track the opt in and opt out of our customers. </p> <p>The first idea was to have the database of customers in an excel file and to solve the filter with a pivot table and then copy &amp; paste the mail address into outlook, but I think there should be a better possibility to solve this. Anyone has some recommendations for me on free mailing or newsletter tools for selfhosting? Or do you think it makes no sense to host a tool like that by ourselves?</p> <p>Thanks in advance! :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",
