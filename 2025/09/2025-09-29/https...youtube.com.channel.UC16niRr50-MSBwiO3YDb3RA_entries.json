        "description": "Today, the Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has told Labour conference that migrants will have to prove they are contributing to society to earn the right to remain in the UK.\n\nUnder the proposals, legal migrants will have to learn English to a high standard, have a clean criminal record and volunteer in their community to be granted permanent settlement status. Meanwhile, earlier in the day the Chancellor Rachel Reeves warned of harder choices to come when it comes to economic choices. Adam, Alex and Chris explain the significance of both speeches.\n\nPlus, Adam is joined by chief secretary to the Prime Minister Darren Jones. He discusses the inner workings of Downing Street, when patriotism becomes racism and the tough choices ahead.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
