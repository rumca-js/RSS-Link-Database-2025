        "description": "This blue stuff is actually blood and it\u2019s probably saved your life!\n\nIt\u2019s from a horseshoe crab and it\u2019s really effective at testing human vaccines for contamination.\n\nIf a clot shows up in testing, that means it\u2019s not safe and scientists destroy the batch so it never ends up in YOU!\n\nThe problem is, collecting horseshoe crab blood isn\u2019t great for the horseshoe crab\u2026 so we created a synthetic version!! It works the same but without needing any real blood!\n\nFor more optimistic science and tech stories, subscribe. \n\n#shorts #science #medicine #animals",
