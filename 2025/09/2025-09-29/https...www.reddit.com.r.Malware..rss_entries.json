A lot of this information can be tedious to type by hand such as hashes, urls, etc. What&#39;s the best method to get this information from you client to your host? Is copy-paste between machines good practice? I use KVM I doubt that matters too much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TS878\"> /u/TS878 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1ntiary/taking_notes_during_analysis/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1ntiary/taking_notes_during_analysis/\">[comments]</a></span>",
