The deal is worth about $55 billion and will be the largest take-private investment in history. Once finalized, EA will no longer be listed on any stock exchange, and stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash. In other news, IGN spoke with Rockstar Games co-founder Dan houser at LA Comic-Con, and he confirmed he had nothing to do with GTA 6. Houser also explained why they never made Bully 2, among other topics discussed. Houser wrote almost every GTA game, including Red Dead Redemption 2, and left Rockstar in 2020. And finally, Fortnite is disabling a Peacemaker emote following the massive plot twist of the recent HBO Peacemaker episode.\n\n#IGN #TheFix",
