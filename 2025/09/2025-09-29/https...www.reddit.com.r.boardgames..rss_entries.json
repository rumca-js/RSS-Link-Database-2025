Everybody around me is already very good and so I feel like I cannot learn much from them. Can you suggest an approach that would allow me to improve my strategy skills? </p> <p>My motivation here is to be able to play games with my wife. She and my son are natural strategy thinkers. And here&#39;s the weird part...when I&#39;m managing my three software development teams, I can juggle lots of variables and make good decisions that lead to generally good outcomes with no problem. But for whatever reason, the variables that I run into when playing board games just really throw me into a lack of self-confidence. It&#39;s probably just performance anxiety... I don&#39;t want to look stupid in front of my wife or my son, so I really doubt myself. So I&#39;m looking for ways where I can improve, maybe online, to get to a point t",

You have to both set yourself up for future moves when the opportunity presents itself but also pay attention to what your opponent is doing and throw in a wrench if you can. And it&#39;s great if you can put together a huge farm and start pulling 7 then 8 then 9 points.</p> <p>As far as the two sides of the board go, we liked Ireland better. Scotland was good, but having fewer open squares made it feel a bit more on-rails and the possibility of drawing impossible goals if you waited too long really dictates early focus on getting near abbeys. Ireland&#39;s shared public goals meant that we were immediately keyed in and reacting to what the other was ",
