After years of waiting and speculation, we finally have an answer.</p><p><em>Warning: Silent Hill f spoilers to follow.</em></p><p>If you've rolled credits on Silent Hill f, you're familiar with its shocking first ending. In it, it is revealed that the Hinako exploring Ebisugaoka is actually a twenty-something-year-old Hinako experiencing deep, drug-induced psychosis. Though players have witnessed what seemingly started out as an ordinary day for our high school-age main character, we come to discover that, in the real world, it's Hinako's wedding day, and she's spent the last few hours of it murdering her friends and family members. Her actions are, of course, horrific, but make sense if you do a little digging around.</p><",

An eerie voice asks him to accept a bargain: power in exchange for his soul.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\"Take it,\" the voice says, \"and save your daughter \u2026 \"</p><p dir=\"ltr\">You see the man talk to said daughter later, as she coughs repeatedly, and you can see the pain of a parent watching their child suffer.

When he growls at the enemies to stay away from her, there is an intensity in his voice--a perilous quality.
