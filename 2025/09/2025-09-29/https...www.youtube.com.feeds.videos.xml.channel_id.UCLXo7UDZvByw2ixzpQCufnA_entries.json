        "description": "This week, Sean talks with Emily Baker-White, author of Every Screen on the Planet, about why TikTok feels uniquely addictive, how it turned social media into a push-not-pull entertainment feed, and what happens when human editors inside the company can override the algorithm.\n\nA few days after they spoke, TikTok was in the headlines again. So they jumped on a follow-up call to unpack the latest twists in the saga of who will ultimately control the app's US-operations.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: Emily Baker-White, reporter and author of Every Screen on the Planet: The War Over TikTok\n\nThe Gray Area has been nominated for a Signal Listener\u2019s Choice Award.
