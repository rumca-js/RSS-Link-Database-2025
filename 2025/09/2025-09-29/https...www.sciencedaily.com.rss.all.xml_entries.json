        "description": "Researchers found that middle-aged adults, especially women, are far more likely to be addicted to ultra-processed foods than older generations. Marketing of diet-focused processed foods in the 1980s may have played a major role. Food addiction was linked to poor health, weight issues, and social isolation, highlighting long-term risks. Experts warn that children today could face even higher addiction rates in the future.",

With validation across multiple countries and a web tool already available, the breakthrough could lead to much earlier detection of cirrhosis and liver cancer.",
