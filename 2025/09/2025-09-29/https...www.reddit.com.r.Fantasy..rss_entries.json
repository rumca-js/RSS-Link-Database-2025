I was enthralled and excited throughout. You did such a great job with the battle between Firebird and Crow at the end of Fevered Star I had high hopes for the finale. I could see the threads coming together and my expectations grew too high for what followed.</p> <p>In my dreams we got a big final battle: Naranpa, Serapio, and Xiala forming an alliance and shaping their god-powers to their will. Standing against the sorcerers of Cuecola, Spearmaidens, and their mighty armies.</p> <p>A meaningful confrontation in the dreamworld between Naranpa and Balam. However it shaped out it would have been interesting!</p> <p>I just have so many questions of why: Why slaughter Okoa and raise Chela ",

YA doesn\u2019t usually really agree with me, so I never gave it much of a look beyond that \u2013 but several IRL friends are absolutely in love with it. So, in the name of having something to talk about, I gave it a try. And hey, it actually entirely worked out! Hardly high art, and I have annoyances with different parts, but this was a really fun bit of popcorn reading from start to finish. In the somewhat exclusive genre of vaguely-early-modern fantasy heist novels, it might even be one of the best.</p> <p>The story jumps between the POVs of six 17-year-old criminals and outcasts in a seedy, vice-ridden and (amusingly atypically) vaguely Dutch fantasy metropolis.
