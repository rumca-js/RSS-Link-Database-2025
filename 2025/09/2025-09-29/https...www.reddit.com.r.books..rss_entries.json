The story beats are mostly the same as what was in the fan fiction.

The type of book that makes you want to talk about it for hours, even though you have nothing positive to say about it.</p> <p>It\u2019s ACOTAR for me. I could have gotten past the world being a little too reminiscent of Middle Earth, and the political intrigue leaving a lot to be desired. But the characters are so unlikable that it\u2019s making me lose my mind. Feyre is beyond self-centered, Rhys and the IC are enablers and very high school mean-girl for a literal government leader team, and everybody is being mean to the side character Lucien for no reason. I am very impatiently awaiting that next book just because I cannot leave this series without seeing him snap on everyone. I am locked in until this guy is vindicated, and then I\u2019ll quit.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Piranesi22\"> /u/Piranesi22 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http",
