So it\u2019s more important than ever to have a great VPN that works well on your phone. While some services work best on Windows, others particularly shine when used on Android devices, and I\u2019ve curated a list of my favorites to help you find the best choice for your smartphones and tablets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When determining what makes for a good VPN for Android, I consider several criteria on top of standard VPN essentials.

A good-quality arm not only frees up usable space on your desk\u2019s surface, it enables more ways to move and position your display/s for optimal comfort and ergonomics. And a monitor arm makes your office setup look really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only catch is the price. Most monitor arms worth buying will cost close to $200, and heavy-duty arms capable of holding two large displays can be priced even higher. The good news is that a good-quality monitor arm is likely to last you for a very long time. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to make the right choice when you purchase a monitor arm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you with that, we\u2019ve tested several popular monitor arms, for both single- and dual-monitor setups.
