Here\u2019s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>Love is in the air as we rejoin Belfast\u2019s peelers for a third season of the award-winning cop drama. Grace (Si\u00e2n Brooke) and Stevie (Martin McCann) may be happily sharing cupcakes and house hunting on their shift (hurrah!), while Shane (Frank Blake) has now earned the team\u2019s trust. But we know by now that this show likes to toy with our emotions \u2013 and things quickly get grittier as the officers are roped into a drug ring circling both the city\u2019s estates and elite parties. Then there are all the personal dilemmas they\u2019re dealing with. This show remains brilliant, taking you from laughing at this lovable lot one moment to gasping at what befalls them the next. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/",
