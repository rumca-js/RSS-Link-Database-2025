Lorenz Kraus' parents disappeared eight years ago, but they were still collecting social security benefits. Police obtained a search warrant and the remains were found in their backyard. Hours later, Kraus reached out to CBS 6 and described how he says he killed them in 2017. After the interview, Kraus walked outside where he was arrested. A public defender entered a not guilty plea for Kraus.",
