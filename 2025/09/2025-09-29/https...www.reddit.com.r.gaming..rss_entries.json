Just wanted to share the news with people who would understand the struggle.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been playing multiple gacha games for years and years. It was exhausting and unrewarding. But I can proudly say now that I finally walked away from the endless daily grind, the predatory monetization, and the constant feeling that my collection was never good enough.</p> <p>The rush of a &quot;good pull&quot; never justified the feeling of getting absolutely nothing after spending hours/money. I&#39;m excited to put that time and money back into games that actually respect the player&#39;s wallet and time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ciissss\"> /u/ciissss </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ntdy9r/after_so_many_years_im_finally_gachafree/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ntdy9r/after_so_many_years_im_fi",
