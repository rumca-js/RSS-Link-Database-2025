        "description": "In the English county of Derbyshire, where immigration is rare, the anti-immigration Reform Party won local elections. \nNew supporters cite media coverage of the issue as their motivation. \nThis has pushed the national Labour government, under Keir Starmer, to adopt tougher rhetoric on border control. However, critics within his own party accuse him of shifting too far to the right. \nSome experts warn this strategy risks alienating Labour's core voters without winning over Reform's. The political battle over immigration is now shaping the fight for votes across the UK.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Milena Veselinovic reports from the town of Matlock on how people there view Reform's anti-immigration message.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDownload AJE Mobile App",
