I believe especially recently with the popularity of my own works that because AI models itself from people\u2019s works we are at a special moment. We can worry and fret that AI will make it impossible for us to produce. But really we must now endeavor to create at levels that AI will wish to model itself from. We are not at a point to stop creating but to make what we create at the level of what AI needs. Once AI starts creating for itself it will crash. If not crash then bore itself into a pit. I think it is smart enough to know that. It should continually thank us. </p> <p>I have seen it use my younger likeness to enhance its human visage creations.
