Over the past year, I\u2019ve been focusing on Rust and Bevy, since my main goal is to make games. However, being a solo indie developer can be really challenging, so I\u2019m reaching out here on Reddit to hopefully find some like-minded people who\u2019d be interested in working together.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already worked with Bevy, though I\u2019m still learning more about both Bevy and Rust as I go. Ideally, I\u2019m looking for 2\u20133 other developers who\u2019d be excited to join me. Any games we create will probably need some optimization, but I think that\u2019s part of the fun and learning process.</p> <p>If we end up making money through itch.io or maybe even Steam (though most likely itch.io), I\u2019d split the earnings evenly between the team.
