        "description": "When it was first announced that Greg Daniels was creating a spin-off of The Office called The Paper, fans didn\u2019t know what to expect. Some were optimistic, while many were skeptical.  After all, making a pseudo-sequel to one of the most beloved sitcoms of all time seemed risky.\n\nWhat we got was a show that falls somewhere in between: not a total disaster, but not quite able to live up to its legendary predecessor. While The Paper has potential, it doesn\u2019t fully stand on its own just yet. \n\nWill Peacock give The Paper enough runway to figure things out like The Office did?  Drop your thoughts in the comments!\n\n#theoffice #thepaper #michaelscott #peacock",
