You can&#39;t base someone&#39;s age on how they talk with their AI or with anyone. Age isn&#39;t about how you sound in a chat. Some people are 16 and write like professors. Some are 50 and speak casually as a teen. The &quot;guessing&quot; of age will more than likely be totally inaccurate with many mistakes. And if they decide they are &quot;not sure&quot;.... they\u2019ll just assum<em>e</em> you\u2019re underage? How is that right?</p> <p>What if I want to joke around with it? say something stupid and immature for fun, like I sometimes do for a laugh. What if I swear a lot? What if I want to create a roleplay character that&#39;s a child?</p> <p>And I am not too keen on giving my personal details (to prove my age) to them now that they are so untrustworthy.</p> <p>They are overdoing this whole thing, taking it too far.
