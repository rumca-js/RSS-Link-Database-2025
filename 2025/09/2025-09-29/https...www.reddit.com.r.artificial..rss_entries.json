Fill it with millions of proprietary photographs of everything a human could potentially observe in the natural world, and then work with it to develop artistic styles from the ground up. Start from scratch -- without ever showing it a cave painting, could you get it to create such work without seeing the concepts represented visually? Has anyone tried this before? What would be involved? You would need to teach it image generative concepts like contrast and contours, so it could invent outlines to start with. Fill areas with color. I&#39;m guessing mixing some basic Photoshop filters with an LLM model... could it create those filters on its own without ever having been exposed to one before?

There has been a eureka moment for us with the roll out of GPT5-Codex internally and I thought I&#39;d write an article about it and where we think offensive security is going. It may not be popular, but I look forward to the discussion.</p> <p>Internally at Vulnetic we have always been huge Claude Code supporters but as of recent we saw a lot to be desired, primarily when it comes to understanding an entire code base. When GPT5-Codex came around we were pretty amazed at its ability to reason for a full hour and one-shot things I wouldn&#39;t even hand to a junior developer. I think we have come to the conclusion that these LLMs are just going to dramatically change all facets of engineering over the next 2-4 years, and so I wrote this article to map these progressions to offsec.</p> <p>Cheers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/@Vulnetic-CEO/offensive-security-after-the-price-collap",

After going down the rabbit hole, here\u2019s how I think about it now.</p> <p>RAG is retrieval + generation. A query gets embedded, compared against a vector store, top-k neighbors are pulled back, and the LLM uses them to ground its answer. This is great for semantic recall and reducing hallucinations, but that\u2019s all it is i.e. retrieval on demand.</p> <p>Where it breaks is persistence. Imagine I tell an AI:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cI live in Cupertino\u201d</li> <li>Later: \u201cI moved to SF\u201d</li> <li>Then I ask: \u201cWhere do I live now?\u201d</li> </ul> <p>A plain RAG system might still answer \u201cCupertino\u201d because both facts are stored as semantically similar chunks. It has no concept of recency, contradiction, or updates. It just grabs what looks closest to the query and serves it back.</p> <p>That\u2019s the core gap: RAG doesn\u2019t persist new facts, doesn\u2019t update old ones, and doesn\u2019t forget what\u2019s outdate",
