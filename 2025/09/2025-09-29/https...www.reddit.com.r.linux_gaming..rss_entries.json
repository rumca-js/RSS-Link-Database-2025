I\u2019m using a DualSense controller via Bluetooth.</p> <p>Sometimes it works perfectly fine \u2014 e.g. I just played <em>Khazan</em> for about 30 minutes without any problems at all. But then, without any obvious reason, things start going completely haywire: inputs either have massive delays or don\u2019t register at all. In many cases, this already happens right when I start a game. Having it run smoothly for 30 minutes is actually the exception rather than the rule.</p> <p>Has anyone else experienced this kind of inconsistent behavior with the DualSense over Bluetooth on Ubuntu? Do you know what might be causing it, or if there\u2019s a reliable fix/workaround?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Xlompen\"> /u/Xlompen </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.",

I am running Ubuntu 24.04 (to be exact, Pop_Os! latest alpha, but running with Gnome until Cosmic is ready) in Wayland. My Nvidia driver is 575.64.03.</p> <p>What I noticed is that on Wayland with Nvidia the rendering of the desktop can get very choppy, dragging windows becomes laggy, on higher CPU loads - for example while I am compiling something or opening an IDE. From what I have seen games seem to be doing OK, but since I am using this laptop for work too the degraded desktop experience is pretty bad. Choppiness doesn&#39;t happen on X11 with Nvidia.</p> <p>If I connect my display to the iGPU through USB-C the experience is flawless - no matter what I throw at the laptop, opening an IDE or starting to compile something the desktop doesn&#39;t lag at all - of course, within sensible limits, if I do too much it would lag of course.</p> <p>My question is - if ",
