        "description": "Accused of leaking state secrets, journalist Lei Cheng was imprisoned in China for more than three years, where she was detained in tight quarters and kept under constant supervision. \u201cFreedom is wasted on the free,\u201d she says, recounting how she and fellow inmates found joy in the smallest of moments: the smell of rain, a poem delivered in secrecy, kindness where it seemed undeserved. She distills the unexpected lessons that confinement taught her \u2014 and challenges us to rethink what freedom really means.",

        "description": "Over the last 40 years, Brazil has lost an area larger than California to deforestation \u2014 and 90 percent of the clear-cutting has been illegal, all part of a multi-billion-dollar global environmental crime economy. Civic entrepreneur Ilona Szab\u00f3 de Carvalho sees this crisis as an opportunity. Revealing how Brazil is pioneering an economic model actually profiting from protecting nature, she shares the ambitious restoration goals and innovations in forest mapping that are turning the country into a \"nature superpower.\" Get a glimpse of what an economy rooted in regeneration, not extraction, could look like.
