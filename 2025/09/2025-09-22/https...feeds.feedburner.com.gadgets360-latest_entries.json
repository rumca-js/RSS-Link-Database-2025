        "description": "OnePlus 15 is expected to go official soon as the successor to the OnePlus 13. Ahead of its anticipated debut, a real-life unit of the handset was allegedly seen during an event, which showcases the rumoured design changes that are likely to arrive this year. It is seen in a white colourway, sporting a rectangular-shaped camera island aligned to the top-left corner of the screen. It appears similar to what we\u2019ve seen on the OnePlus 13s and is a big change from the circular deco of its predecessor.",
