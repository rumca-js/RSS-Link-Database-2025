Really liked the character,plot and world building. Overall loved these books</p> <p>Liked- LoTR, Assassins apprentice, shadow of the gods, Kingkiller books, first law, black prisim. Really liked things in these books, like first laws characters. But they have something that throws me off, like pacing in Hobbs books. I enjoyed them regardless and continued in the series.</p> <p>Didn&#39;t like- Poppy war, Fifth season, Garden of the moon. Read the first books in these but didn&#39;t have a want to go to the next one. Some interesting stories, but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to care about what was happening.

I have recently been in a bit of a reading slump, which I think has to do with the fact that I&#39;m somewhat tired of the whole full-on grimdark theme many books seem to have nowadays where nothing good ever happens, the characters are all nasty or self-serving, and no one ever does anything for the sake of doing something that is good or at least selfless. It does get to be a bit much. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love a gritty, dark, world. I like ruthless, cunning, amoral, characters, and a world that lends itself to these characteristics. However, I also want there to be people who try to do good, even if they fail at times, or even if they are not fully noble people. Like yes, I get it, people in real life can be nasty, but they can also be good, and shitty times do pass (and then good times pass, as well).</p> <p>So, what I&#39;m trying to say is that I am looking for that sort of book/series.

Actual battle/war 3.The aftermath of the war/battle.</p> <p>I wonder if it gets better with the next series? I dont mind the action, but I wish he would just chill and focus on the characters too.

Would you rise to the occasion, or try to run from these new responsibilities \ud83e\udd14 after all you don&#39;t even know what you&#39;ve been called to do in most cases. The book has some incredible lore but I don&#39;t want to spoil too much! I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts! Not just about the book, but about the idea of a World that actively chooses its heroes. Even if you haven&#39;t read it yet, we can still explore the idea! Or do you know other books with similar \u201cCall of destiny\u201d mechanics?
