Stephen told us that his defining characteristic is curiosity, and how his first memory was of taking things apart and putting them back together, more or less successfully. He explained how that led him to a hobby in computers which in turn led him to a computer science degree. He chose to major in both marketing and computers, because for him success is in solving problems with technology, for people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this conversation and article we look at how successful ",
