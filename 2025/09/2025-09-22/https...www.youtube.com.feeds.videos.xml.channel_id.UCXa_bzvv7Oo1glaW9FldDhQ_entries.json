        "description": "In its attempt to bring the best of the Dying Light franchise to its latest instalment, Techland has crafted an open world that redefines both exploration and traversal in The Beast. Kyle Crane's tryst with fate in the Castor Woods is a majestic sight to behold, making the most of his agility via an incredibly well-designed parkour system while the woods themselves make every minute spent exploring them worthwhile.\n\nThere's a lot to see, do, and discover in the Castor Woods, and a myriad of ways to get there thanks to a parkour system that has evolved with successive iterations to become its finest version yet. This is an open world that deserves to be explored, and rewards its players for every minute they spend doing so.",

        "description": "There's something comforting about an experience like Borderlands 4 that feels complete in its present state, and I wouldn't be surprised if the reported millions of other players felt the same. \n\nBetween all the controversy over the supposed $80 price that thankfully never came to pass, or whether the current price is worthwhile given the number of technical issues, sometimes, having a game that you can have fun with and stop playing, maybe to come back to later (or not), is really all it takes (though of course, everything else helps as well). \n\nMaybe that's something to remember even as the industry seemingly clings to live service against all odds and annoyances.",

        "description": "Silent Hill f feels like a step in the right direction for the series. It gets so many things right, even if I wish some of the combat mechanics and animations had been refined further. What\u2019s here, though, is still a solid and compelling package. \n\nAt the start of this review, I mentioned that Konami\u2019s ability to remain consistent would hinge on how Silent Hill f turned out. Based on my experience, I\u2019d say the publisher may finally have found a winning formula: one that still needs polish in places, but points firmly toward a promising future for Silent Hill.",
