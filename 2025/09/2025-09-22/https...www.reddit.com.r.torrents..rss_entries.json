I can\u2019t find it anywhere.</p> <p>I\u2019m in Canada so I can\u2019t go through any legal streaming sites even paramount plus which says it has it doesn\u2019t because I\u2019m in Canada. </p> <p>I obviously went for torrents and for the life of me I can\u2019t find any seasons that aren\u2019t season 27 or for some reason season 16? What happened? Why doesn\u2019t pirate bay or any torrent site have older seasons of big brother? I\u2019ve never seen this many missing seasons for a show before especially not one that\u2019s popular </p> <p>Mainly my question is what happened? Why are they gone? And does anyone know where I can watch it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Conscious-Bite-5131\"> /u/Conscious-Bite-5131 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1nnane7/where_is_older_big_brother/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",
