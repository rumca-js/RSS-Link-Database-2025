Tech blogger Zack Nelson demonstrates this weakness in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrOBzFwVzwA\">durability test on his JerryRigEverything</a> YouTube channel, explaining that the anodized aluminium layer on the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max \u201cdoes not stick to corners very well\u201d \u2014 creating a weak point in the coating. This is a known issue with the electrochemical anodizing process, so it was a design decision Apple knowingly made.</p>\n\n<p c",

The feature has been <a href=\"https://x.com/phantomofearth/status/1969399576026140731?s=46\">spotted</a> in the latest builds of Windows 11, and allows you to set video files like MP4 or MKV as your desktop wallpaper background.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The videos play every time you view your desktop, much like third-party solutions like Wallpaper Engine. Microsoft previously supported video wallpapers in Windows Vista as a DreamScene feature for the Ultimate version of the operating system, but DreamScene was dropped from Windows 7.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provide",

Traditional hardwood buildings line narrow alleyways, while babbling brooks and small footpaths crisscross soaking paddy fields. The ephemera of 1960s everyday life is everywhere: glossy magazines, vintage toasters, exquisite flower arrangements. Yet beyond this moody sense of place, the details that feel most authentic in <em>Silent Hill F</em> are of a kind that video games rarely excel at. It's the anxiety on the faces of its teen characters as they trade barbed taunts, the outpourings of emotion scribbled onto notes passed arou",
