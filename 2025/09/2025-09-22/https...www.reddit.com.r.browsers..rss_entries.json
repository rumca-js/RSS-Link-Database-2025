I know the basics like using private browsing, clearing cookies, and maybe switching to browsers that market themselves as privacy-focused. But when you start digging into things like fingerprinting, trackers that respawn even after clearing data, and how much info can be tied to your browsing habits, it feels overwhelming. </p> <p>From what I understand, extensions like uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger can block a lot, but at the same time, I read that even if you block ads and trackers, your device setup and behavior can still be used to identify you. So for someone who wants to browse without being a total open book, what actually works? Is it more about which browser you use, or about the habits and add-ons you put in place? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",
