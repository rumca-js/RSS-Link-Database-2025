TernFS was developed by XTX Markets because they had outgrown the capabilities of other file systems.</p> <p>Unlike most other file systems, TernFS has massive scalability and the ability to span across multiple geographic regions. This allows for seamless access of data on globally distributed applications, including AI and machine learning software. TernFS is also designed with no single point of failure in its metadata services, ensuring continuous operation. The data is stored redundantly to protect against drive failures.</p> <p>I believe that TernFS has a lot to offer us as far as performance and usability.
