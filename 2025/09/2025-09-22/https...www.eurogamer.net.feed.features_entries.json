This was a tiny self-published affair - nary a publisher in sight, what I assume was a solo developer, and an extremely limited scope. I'm not talking about <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight\">Hollow Knight</a>, or Balatro, or Braid, or <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/limbo\">Limbo</a> or what have you.
