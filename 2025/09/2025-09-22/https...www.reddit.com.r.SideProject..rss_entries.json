I started years ago messing around with altcoins, then moved into DeFi, and eventually ended up in more traditional investments like startups and small-cap stocks. For me it was never about chasing quick wins I\u2019ve always seen it as experiments, ways to learn and test ideas</p> <p>Recently, I stumbled upon an approach that reminded me why staying curious pays off. It looked almost too simple, but after giving it a shot, I realized how much it can shift the way you think about managing capital.

Instead of relying on the same recycled prompts you see everywhere, I\u2019ve been experimenting with writing them as if they were short poems, little sparks of thought \u2014 not formulas to copy-paste, but conversations with the AI that bring out something unexpected.</p> <p>Connecting with AI isn\u2019t bad at all, but the real value is in bringing our own uniqueness into the process. Always testing the ai&#39;s limits and our own but focusing results that feel human, not mechanized. I believe we should like and connect with the outcomes ourselves before we share them with the world. Otherwise, it\u2019s just repetition.</p> <p>What do you guy think on the AI approach? do you interact with AI or are you close minded into it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alive_Quantity_7945\"> /u/Alive_Quantity_7945 </a> <br/> <sp",
