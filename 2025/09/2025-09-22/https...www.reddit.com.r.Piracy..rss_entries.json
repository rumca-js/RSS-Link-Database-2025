Most of the other tools I&#39;ve used seem to either have a limit of 100 downloads or require you to download them one at a time. Id prefer full quality audio but I&#39;ll very much take the sacrifice for convenience. Does anyone know any other good sites or tools?

I get why they ask you to disable them cause they don&#39;t want their torrents leaked. But what am I supposed to do if on the PT I&#39;m in there isn&#39;t the content I&#39;m looking for and I have to download from a public tracker? Am I supposed to pause all torrents, enable DHT and PeX, download the content from Public tracker, and then disabling them again? Any other options? </p> <p>I thought of having a docker container mapped to a different port for &quot;public qbittorent&quot; whenever I need something from a public tracker. The problem I see with this is that speed limiting properly gets difficult and it seems to me a little bit overkill to have 2 qbittorent instances just for this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aren13GamerZ\"> /u/Aren13GamerZ </a> <br",

Is it ever gonna resolve? I just go to their page and browse for anime and watch whatever looks good - and now that they are stuck I am having a lot of trouble (there are other sites but in moviesmod I got a collection of latest releases and dub updates in my local language) anyone knows about this? or facing the same issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Matsuzo-Kaneri\"> /u/Matsuzo-Kaneri </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1nnoioe/is_moviesmod",

I understand that part but the piracy part is where im stuck. 10 or 15 years ago I had a good chunk of movies but I was a dumb teen that threw caution to the wind lol. So I was curious if anyone could give me a good description of what I should be using. Ive seen people mention radarr but im not sure what it is. Then ive seen some VPN tips so that my isp doesnt try to send letters. Any tips or descriptions would be cool!
