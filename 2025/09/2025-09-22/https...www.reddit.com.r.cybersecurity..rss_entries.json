That\u2019s where most of the learning happened.</p> <p>Now I see a lot of folks just run nmap -sC -sV, copy the output, maybe blast gobuster, and if nothing obvious shows up, they move on. No curiosity, no digging deeper.</p> <p>Some of my best wins came from noticing something small \u2014 like a sketchy banner, a random SMB share, or a version that didn\u2019t match. Stuff you only catch if you actually look instead of just skimming tool output.</p> <p>Enumeration used to be the whole game. If you miss it, you miss everything.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YouthKnown7859\"> /u/YouthKnown7859 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1nnnfp5/the_art_of_enumeration_is_dying/\">[link]</a></",

They can fire up nmap, gobuster, sqlmap, Burp, etc. \u2014 but if you ask why that tool, why that flag, why not another approach, they often go blank.</p> <p>Back in the day (2018\u20132019 for me), VulnHub boxes and early HTB forced you to understand what was happening under the hood. If you didn\u2019t know why you were scanning a port a certain way, or how the protocol actually worked, you got stuck.</p> <p>Now, it feels like many are just memorizing \u201ctop 10 commands to root a box\u201d without learning the logic behind the attack chain. And that\u2019s dangerous \u2014 because in real engagements, the tool might break, or the output won\u2019t be clear, and if you don\u2019t understand the background process, you\u2019re lost.</p> <p>So here\u2019s my question to the community: How do we shift people from being tool operators to actual hackers who understand the why?</p> </div><!-- SC_",
