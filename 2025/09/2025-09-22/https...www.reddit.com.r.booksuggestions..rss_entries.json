There is a scene where they eat like shepards pie but she picks out the carrots to eat bc she&#39;s vegetarian. I also remember something little like some boy at the grandma&#39;s house scraping a fly poop off of his laptop or something. Ik this isn&#39;t much to go off of but if anyone can find it that would be great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Few-Dog3807\"> /u/Few-Dog3807 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1nnt8ni/need_help_pls/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1nnt8ni/need_help_pls/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My Baba and I recently &quot;read&quot; a Russian book called &quot;The Children&#39;s Atlas of the Animal World&quot; with hundreds of colored pencils drawings of animals labelled with their names and sizes in Russian. We had a lot of fun examining the animals and picking out our favorites. I want to find more books like this, but a lot of educational books have a lot of text, which is somewhat problematic because she can&#39;t read English well and I can&#39;t read Russian or Ukrainian well, and spending a lot of time reading out loud will tire either of us out. Can you think of books, especially educational books, that are interesting for adults, but contain mostly pictures or photos with little text in English, Russian, or Ukrainian?

The themes that really struck with me in the anime were the subtle moments of grief and recollection of memories. I also liked that it was pretty slice of life and had the vibe of &quot;life is worth living because you never know what you may find, so just have fun exploring&quot;, because I myself hold this value.</p> <p>I know its pretty specific but it doesnt necessarily need to meet those criterias, just the general vibe of what i mentioned. The anime also hit home to me because i lost someone to suicide recently and watching this made me feel like i could really relate to Frieren&#39;s feelings, and I liked how the grief is not all up in my face. Reading A Grief Observed made me feel depressed.</p> <p>(plus point if the book is fantasy, but not necessary)</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sonder",

At the training place each student is given a pendant/amulet that bonds to them and produces a familiar/companion.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I adore The Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches by Sangu Mandanna. Yes, it&#39;s technically a romance but that really feels like a B plot to the protagonist&#39;s journey to a found family, vulnerability and contextual identity. I love stories that focus on character growth, interpersonal dynamics, and a character finding their place in the world. I&#39;m reading When the Sky Fell on Splendor by Emily Henry now and feeling a similar journey with the character: self-reflection, self-discovery, grasping at finding your place in the world. I&#39;m only halfway through but this book seems to be more of a sci-fi/magical realism mystery than romance (I definitely enjoy both genres) but it&#39;s still giving me the same cozy introspective fuzzies as Mandanna&#39;s book. Would love more recommendations of books about women (preferably written by women) that seem to connect to this theme/style.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

I\u2019m hoping to gather some suggestions for a friend of mine that doesn\u2019t use Reddit but that is having a really hard time finding cute, smut-free romance books. YA is not ideal, the characters need to be 25-30+ years old with real dimension, hence the issue with finding nice and lighthearted stuff with enough stakes to keep things interesting but the right amount to just unwind and be happy along with the characters. For reference, they just told me prior to writing this that they were interested in \u201cthe pumpkin spice cafe\u201d by Laurie Gilmore, but was incredibly disappointed to read reviews and find what they considered to be a high level of spice. They also frequently watch hallmark, particularly enjoying a select few of the murder mysteries and especially enjoying Christmas season hallmark. Just to give you an idea of what they\u2019re drawn towards. Anything is appreciated, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

His other non-book interests include football, MMA, military strategy, and travel if you can think of any that might also include these themes. Hail Mary was a great fit for him with the humor, balance of science and adventure, and the writing style.

So far, I&#39;m thinking of starting with the United States for the Americas, but I have no idea about any books for any other countries. I want the book to be a starting spot, and we can expand. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LovaBellaLova\"> /u/LovaBellaLova </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1nn90ge/kids_books_set_in_different_countries/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1nn90ge/kids_books_set_in_different_countries/\">[comments]</a></span>",
