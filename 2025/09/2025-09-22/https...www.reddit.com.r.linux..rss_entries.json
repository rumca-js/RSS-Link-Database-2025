Despite all the discussion about how involved it is I found the set up quite easy to follow. At the time I was rocking KDE Plasma and had little issue with it. I eventually ditched it because I didn\u2019t want to learn AUR/Pacman, and have spent most of my days on Fedora as mentioned earlier. </p> <p>Recently I swapped my desktop to proxmox in order to use vms with gpu pass through, and have been playing around with Nix. And at this stage I\u2019ve been learning how to use Linux without a desktop manager. I have a simple macbook air I loaded i3 onto and have been using it quite successfully. And as of most recent, I have been trying Hyprland out. I\u2019ve converted my bazzite install to use it, as well as the macbook, and for what I am ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi <a href=\"/r/linux\">r/linux</a>, I have a tape library with two drives. I also have a Docker container that I cannot rebuild because I am missing one of the prerequisites.</p> <p>My problem is that the container assumes that the library is /dev/sg2, with the drives being /dev/sg1 and /dev/sg3. This is only sometimes the case - and sometimes, it takes several reboots for the stars to align that way.</p> <p>Is there any reliable way to have the devices always have the same name? I was thinking of renaming them in udev, but I assume that if I rename (for example) sg2 to sg1 and there is already an sg1, the outcome will be Not Good. Maybe rename them all to something completely different (/dev/tape1 /dev/tape2 and /dev/changer?) and make the sg* nodes links to those names?</p> <p>Any better way to go about that?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HappyDork66\"> /u/HappyDork66 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"h",
