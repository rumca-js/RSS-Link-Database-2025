We&#39;re curious to know if other teams and companies are facing a similar situation and, if so, which capabilities are the main culprits.</p> <p>Are your costs mainly due need for collaboration via workspaces or more due to consumption based fee for features like collection runs, mocks, monitoring etc?</p> <p>Please share your experience below\u2014we&#39;re all trying to be more cost-conscious, and any insights on what&#39;s driving up your bill would be super helpful!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/1nnr878\">View Poll</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kindly_Spinach_6312\"> /u/Kindly_Spinach_6",
