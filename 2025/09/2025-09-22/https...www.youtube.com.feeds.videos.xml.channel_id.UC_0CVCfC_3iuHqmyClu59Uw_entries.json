        "description": "Meet the all-new GPD WIN 5\u2014a handheld gaming PC that swings way above its size class. You can spec it with AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 or Ryzen MAX 385, up to 128GB LPDDR5X, and a sharp 7\" 1080p VRR display for buttery-smooth gameplay. In this video I go hands-on with the Ryzen MAX 385 model featuring the Radeon 8050S iGPU\u201432 CUs on RDNA 3.5 with 8 cores/16 threads\u2014and put it through real AAA tests, emulation, thermals, and battery checks to see if this tiny beast can truly replace your travel gaming rig. \nGot questions or a game you want tested next? Drop it below. I\u2019ve got more GPD WIN 5 videos coming soon, including deep-dive benchmarks, emulator guides, and docked 1440p testing\u2014so make sure you\u2019re subscribed and notifications are on!\n\nBack it here: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win-5-the-ultimate-external-battery-handheld/coming_soon\n\nLearn More Here: https://gpdstore.net/product/gpd-win-5/?srsltid=AfmBOorLy-LWq6J2DkMSRuTnW8HiIZAlKEQi2eWJFhFyMtaswnnU7Ypz\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: ",
