        "description": "South Korea\u2019s President Lee Jae Myung would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in which North Korea agreed to freeze production of its nuclear weapons, rather than get rid of them.\n \nSpeaking to the BBC\u2019s Jean Mackenzie, he said he would agree to the freeze as an emergency interim measure, so long as denuclearisation remained the ultimate goal.\n \nSince taking office in June, he has been vocal about wanting President Trump to resume nuclear talks with Kim, which broke down in 2019 during Trump\u2019s first term.\n \nBut Trump is proving to be an unpredictable ally for South Korea, after hundreds of Korean workers were detained for days in the US earlier this month, after immigration authorities raided an electric vehicle battery factory in Georgia.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#SouthKorea #NorthKorea #BBCNews",
