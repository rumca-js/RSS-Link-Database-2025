I\u2019m really proud of how it turned out and can\u2019t wait for you all to hear it when it releases! If you\u2019re a Piano Guys fan and a K-Pop Demon Hunters fan, I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll love it. And if you\u2019re only a fan of one or the other, I think you\u2019ll still enjoy it too \ud83d\ude09 Let me know in the comments if any parts of this video stood out to you! @Sarahhhhale \n\n#kpopdemonhunters #goldensong\n#thepianoguys #jonschmidt\n#pianocover",
