In July 2025, an article in The Guardian featured people who describe their relationships with chatbots as deeply meaningful, including a man who \"married\" his AI beloved \"in a digital ceremony\". Later that month, a piece in GQ explored how AI girlfriends are reshaping the way men express vulnerability and emotional need. These examples reflect a broader shift in how people relate to technology. In a world where media outlets and government bodies warn of an \"epidemic of loneliness\", and long-term relationships face increasing strain, the rise of AI companions points to our growing willingness to treat non-human entities as emotionally significant partners.",

They were developed by a research team at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU). The particles absorb laser light and convert them into heat, thereby changing their internal structure, similar to folded proteins. The research was published in the journal Communications Chemistry.",
