        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello guys! I love VR, i have a rift s that unfortunely has some problems. Had it for 3 years at this point and its just 50% if it works for more than 5 minutes before crashing or not. I was considering getting a quest 3 as a replacement since i dont have a big buget for something like big screen beyond 2. Ive seen in multiple posts that the quest 3 even while linked with the cable( which is not a problem for me, id rather have a wired headset with less letancy than the comfort of wireless) has a 50-60 ms latency. Ive searched around and ive found that the rift s has around a 20-30 ms latency which i can already feel a little. I feel like it would really suck at least for me to have double the latency. If anybody that uses the quest 3 for pcvr could give me an opinion on their experience with the latency, quality of the image and such while wired or other suggestions for a headset for pcvr that require me to go in debt for would be highly apreciated</",

So i need to upgrade, but what component? My rig right now is: I5 8400 Rx580 8gb/1080 8gb 8gb DDR4 </p> <p>Now i got the Budget of around 200\u20ac so i could upgrade my cpu, mobo and ram (thought about an i5 12400f with some cheap ass mobo ill find locally and ofc some more ram) i know amd is like way better, but i cant find any am5 cpu&#39;s locally and am4 cpu&#39;s are way too overpriced for me. For comparison i can get an r5 3600 for about the same price as an i5 12400f. So my thought was just to go intel and with lga1700 so in the future i can even get an i7 14700kf when i got that money.</p> <p>But otherwise I heard that the Gpu is way more important for Vr. So lets say ill get an 3070 and some more ram and would that just make my Gameplay way better than if i would upgrade my cpu?</p> <p>Please help me out:((</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted ",

Another issue though is my PC doesn\u2019t have a wifi card and even if it did this old ass house has walls so thick wifi doesn\u2019t really travel well through it, so until now I\u2019ve had a TP Link Wifi extender over power. However that seems to be insufficient for VD to have a reliable connection.</p> <p>I\u2019m aware of solutions like the Puppis s1, but was wondering if it\u2019s possible to run a dedicated router into my extender and then the PC into that router?</p> <p>Could I then connect the vr to that and circumvent the latency added by connecting the headset to the extender?

Currently the only way I can play, is by moving my PC off the desk and right next to my bed, and when I do that, the cable just about reaches. I should point out that I&#39;m using a Kiwi Design 16ft link cable, to my quest 2. As you can imagine, needing to move my desktop PC for any time that I want to play VR is very impractical. And it&#39;s this inconvenience that has prevented my for getting into more VR titles. </p> <p>I have tried some solutions that I thought could possibly work. For starters I used a USB 3.0 extension cable for some time, but that broke after a couple of months of using it. The reason why I didn&#39;t just buy another one Is because I don&#39;t believe it was capable of gigabit data speed and therefore was causing bottle necks. My next attempt at fixing it, involved buying another link cable (the same kiwi design cable as before) and use ",

To be guided, the players hold on an electric wheelchair with someone guiding them. Without the wheelchair, the experience works perfectly and so does the map I previously prepared and even refined to have the best map possible. BUT once they are guided by the wheelchair, if they look towards the wheelchair, the headset&#39;s catches feature points on the wheelchair, and the whole world then moves along the wheelchair movements. It&#39;s a problem we have been able to reecreate multiple times. Anyone has had similar issues? If yes, how did you avoid them? Big Thanks if you have a solution for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/salsalade\"> /u/salsalade </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nnh70x/vive_focus_3_getting_stuck_on_objects_in_motion/\">[link]</a></span> &#3",

Some games, I&#39;m exceeding the bandwidth of what it can do over WiFi 6. My routers/mesh at home is fine and I have some devices get faster than gigabit - but the Quest 3 fluctuates a lot between 120 and 250 Mbit in my limited testing.</p> <p>I noticed that when I use a USB to Ethernet adapter, it easily spikes to 500 Mbit+ according to WiVRn&#39;s stats panel. Unfortunately, this obviously drains the battery like CRAZY.</p> <p>So I thought to myself, what if I can connect an ethernet cable to the headset and charge it (via PoE) at the same time? That would solve my issues without having to use any cabled mode that may also require a high bandwidth USB port and external power injection like the Link Cable.</p> <p>Has anyone tried this before? Can you recommend an adapter to purchase?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/schaka\"> ",
