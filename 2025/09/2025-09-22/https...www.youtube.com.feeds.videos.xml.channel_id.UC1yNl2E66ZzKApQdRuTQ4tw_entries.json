Head over to https://www.economist.com/Sabine to get started. *35% in the UK, Latin America, and India.\n\nIn quantum physics, the idea that observed correlations between particles come from the way that the measurement device affects the particles is called a violation of \u201cMeasurement Independence\u201d or \u201cSuperdeterminism.\u201d The authors of a new paper claim that the more complicated one makes an experiment, the larger the violation of measurement independence must be to explain observations. They conclude that quantum computers can test free will. Wait what? I\u2019ve had a look at the paper.\n\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/",
