The idea was to register the domain on Cloudflare and somehow point it to the NPM instance, which would then act as a reverse proxy. This was to avoid having to register a new route on Cloudflare Tunnel every time (which I managed to configure to point to a specific service on my Proxmox). I tried several guides, even using AdGuard in between, but it seems that some configuration is always missing or that my router, even though configured with custom DNS, is not doing what it should. Is there any guide/solution/instruction to do what I want to do? Perhaps even using an alternative to Cloudflare if it is not the right system to do this. Obviously, all this is to avoid exposing ports 80 and 443 for nginx, because I have already succeeded in doing so.</p> <p>Thank you. </p> </div><!--",

Max download I get is around 20 MB/s on a good day. I host Jellyfin with the arr stack at home and use qbittorrent. I share this with some of my friends and family. I noticed that whenever someone would play something on Jellyfin while something was being downloaded on qbittorrent, it would cause buffering so I had to manually stop all downloads.</p> <p>Because of this I created a flask app that listens for Jellyfin webhooks, and when playback starts it sets qBittorrent\u2019s global download speed to basically nothing (1 B/s). When playback stops, it resets the limit back to unlimited. If multiple people are watching, it only unthrottles once everyone stops.</p> <p>I also added Discord notifications so I get messages like:</p> <p>\u25b6\ufe0f Playback start \u2014 Wonder Woman (2017) \ud83d\udc64 user1 on Samsung TV \u2699\ufe0f Throttled to 1 B/s \ud83e\uddee Active viewers: user1, user2</p> <p>And when it ends:</",
