        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nFresh off the success of the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remake, Konami is polling fans (Japan for now) for their thoughts on the next Metal Gear remake. The poll includes the original two Metal Gear games from the '80s, and the remaining Metal Gear Solid console games, including Peacewalker. We're running our own poll at IGN.com, so let us know which Metal Gear game deserves the remake treatment. In other news, more details about the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot have emerged, and at one point, the developers were considering making it an episodic game. Unfortunately, we'll never know how that would've turned out because developer The Initiative has been shuttered and the project canned earlier this year. And finally, there's one Borderlands 4 bug that fans DON'T want patched out: a 'cricket jumping' glitch that lets players skip large sections of the map.\n\n#IGN #DailyFix",

Putting together a list of the best of them revealed how rare a truly brilliant one is, presumably a result of how incredibly hard they are to make, and their unfortunate tendency to go the way of Anthem or Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League \u2013 cut short after failing to grab an audience. But what they lack in quantity, they more than make up for in just how many hours you can lose to them, and over the past nearly two decades, we've spent more time with this genre than we'd care to admit.\n\nFrom Destiny, to The Division and all the games in the Borderlands series, here are our top 14 looter shooters.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.\n\n\"Silent Hill f serves up a fresh new Japanese setting to explore, a fascinatingly dark story to unravel, and plenty of twisted freaks to torment you with. All of that made me wish I was a bit more enamoured with a combat system that early on seems like too much of a chore to be fun, yet eventually made me feel too overpowered at times to be consistently scared. I admire developer Neobards Entertainment for taking a big swing here, but like a laboured lurch from Hinako\u2019s frustratingly fragile lead pipe it just hasn\u2019t quite landed exactly where I\u2019d like it to. Still, some spectacular art design, imaginative puzzles, and a compelling lead character means this latest mainline entry in Konami\u2019s seminal survival horror series definitely earns a grade higher than a Silent Hill F; it\u2019s probably closer to a Silent Hill B-.\"",
