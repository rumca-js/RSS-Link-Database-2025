My goal is to buy a prepaid sim card that I can continue to pay for in top up cards, and proceed to never give out that number so it can&#39;t be tied to my identity, and i can&#39;t be tracked as easily. Instead, I will use multiple VoIP numbers, which I haven&#39;t yet decided on the provider for. A problem I&#39;m running into is figuring out just how many phone numbers I need. A lot of guides and videos say you should silo different parts of your life, but no one really goes over in detail how and why each part is separated. </p> <p>I know I&#39;ll use a personal one only for friends and family that I can&#39;t convince to use Signal, as well as my Signal number needed to sign up.

I assumed that was all they needed and that I could then hangup and turn my attention back to caring for my friend. That was <strong>not</strong> the case.</p> <p>The dispatcher proceeded to ask me all sorts of personal questions - including my full name, date of birth, and ID number. While they didn&#39;t explicitly state it, I got the impression that the ambulance would not be dispatched unless and until I gave them this information. So I did. (Interestingly they spent exactly 0 seconds of the call asking me about the condition of my ill friend or advising me how to care for them) </p> <p>I&#39;m curious what my actual obligations were in this case. If I had refused to answer these questions, would the ambulance still have come? Would it have been delayed?</p> <p>From ",
