Did YOU guess correctly which trunk was original? \n\nNational Park Museum Conservation Lab: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/hfc/museum-conservation-services.htm\nNational Park Service: https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\nWhat Happens When Taxidermy Fails: https://youtu.be/_ovkiZfl9aw\nWhere America\u2019s Historical Artifacts Are Being Preserved (Well ...
