I should only need a couple of terabytes for this, and was wondering which external HDD(s) would be the most reliable for this purpose. I also understand that I should be backing up stuff like this to multiple things, but I don&#39;t have a large budget at the moment, so I think one is all I can manage right now. If this is the wrong place for a question like this, I&#39;d really appreciate if you guys could send me in the right direction.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/liamhlmbrg\"> /u/liamhlmbrg </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/",
