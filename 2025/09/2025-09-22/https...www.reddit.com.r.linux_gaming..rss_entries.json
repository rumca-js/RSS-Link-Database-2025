While i do use a perpetual DNS and VPN i have tried to play the game with it on and off and i get the same result which leads me to belive that its not an issue from my side. Also with and without the VPN and DNS my network speed is consistent, atleast consistent enough for browsing/listening to music/installing packages etc. </p> <p>Fyi i have played ZZZ on this same setup with the same conditions and it never gave me issues. I&#39;ll be grateful if someone could help me out with this issue because i liked the game during launch but due to personal reasons couldnt follow up playing it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Riponai_Gaming\"> /u/Riponai_Gaming",

While HDR &quot;works&quot; like this, the colors and brightness are completely blown out, apparently because NMS outputs as 16-bit scRGB for its HDR mode, and isn&#39;t getting mapped properly to output on a 10-bit display. I&#39;m trying to find out if it&#39;s possible to fix the output, possibly with additional arguments I&#39;m unaware of, or if any bleeding edge/etc builds of proton, mesa, etc have addressed this.</p> <p>So, the background. I wanted to get back into NMS with the latest update, and I mostly run Windows 11. Turns out, the game now crashes for me constantly under Windows. I have a Garuda Linux install on the same hardware I don&#39;t",
