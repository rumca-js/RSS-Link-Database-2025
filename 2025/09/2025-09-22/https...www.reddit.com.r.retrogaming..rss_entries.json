But my bother (he&#39;s 50 now) he comes into my bedroom and sees me crying and says &quot;why you crying dickhead?&quot; and I tried to say I wasn&#39;t crying. So he sees right through that and does this laugh and comes over to me, squats and does this massive and rancid cabbage fart right next to me.
