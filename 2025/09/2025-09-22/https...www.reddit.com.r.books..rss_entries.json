It\u2019s rare that I encounter something so inherently irritating to me but still so intriguing. When I read the first chapter of the book I felt like this book would not be for me. I described these feelings in a previous reddit post (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ni9nx5/my_thoughts_on_the_prologue_of_the_remains_of_the/\">link</a>). However, and almost in spite, I kept reading and could not put it down. I wanted to see what was up with this silly butler, and what antics his utter devotion to his job would get him into. It really goes to show how impressive Ishiguro is that he keeps the reader so enticed, even through these negative feelings. The back of the book does little, I believe, to really prepare you for the contents of it. This book isn\u2019t just a short trip through the English countryside.

Had given this a swerve though as it\u2019s about cowboys and ranches and horses and so on and so on. Eventually took the plunge based on reviews on Reddit. Have just finished it. What a book!!! I actually feel a little bereft that it\u2019s over. What this novel demonstrated for me (amongst other things) is it really doesn\u2019t matter when you live, where you live and what your circumstances are, human nature with all its foibles, its meanness, its random acts of kindness is the same wherever you are. The richness of these characters, the incredible narrative, the shock of some of the happenings. This is one book that will stay with me forever. Now, do I just accept that nothing will beat this or tackle the prequels and sequels?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RelationKindly\"> /u/RelationKindly </a> ",
