About three weeks ago it was working really well for me \u2014 actually even smoother than on my phone. But all of a sudden it started giving me problems: it\u2019s much slower than on my phone, and most of the time I have to reload the page to see the response because the site freezes. I also keep getting a message that says \u201cPage is not responding.\u201d It\u2019s the only program that\u2019s giving me trouble; everything else on my laptop works fine.
