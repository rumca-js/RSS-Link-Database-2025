What&#39;s been surprising is that these are tools my friends and family likely wouldn&#39;t have used otherwise. Since they lack the technical skills for maintenance and updates, my homeserver became the bridge that made powerful open-source software accessible to them.</p> <p>This inspired me to create <a href=\"https://forkly.eu/\">Forkly</a>, a platform that aims to solve this problem. Our goal is to host open-source <strong>productivity services</strong> and make them perfect for everyone.</p> <p>Its strength is <strong>integration</strong>. I&#39;ll use the projects&#39; own APIs to ensure that, regardless of which app you choose, the features work in harmony. Every combination you choose will be perfectly integrated.</p> <p>With this project, I hope to do my part for the open-source ecosystem, giving it greater visibility among a wider audience and donating ",

While I&#39;m confident in the development and functional operations, I have limited resources for dedicated 24/7 infrastructure security and complex operational management.
