        "description": "The Pocket Fit is AYANEO's first handheld under their KONKR sub-brand.  It has a powerful Snapdragon G3 Gen3 processor (and SD 8 Elite option), great controls, and an impressively nice LCD panel.  It's also being sold at an uncharacteristically low price point.  So what's the catch?
