The only one I remember from this genre is Paulo Coelho\u2019s 11 Minutes which I read years and years ago. </p> <p>We are looking for book suggestions with following requirements: 1. A slow burn romantic novel which is a good read and has good sexual content to get you horny and going but not on any wild side. 2. A slightly wilder side novel which is heavily focused on sexual experiences. 3. A through and through erotic novel.</p> <p>What we are not looking for: 1. Dark Romance 2.

I specifically appreciated the realistic hassle-meter.</li> <li>The tone of the book was really down to earth and did not go on inspirational tangents about being &quot;virtuous feminine&quot; or &quot;meeting a religious duty,&quot; nor did it have a paranoid &quot;prepper&quot; streak to it.</li> </ol> <p>Point #3 is the most important one. Points #2 and #1 would merely be nice to have again in another book.</p> <p>For other book recommendations, I don&#39;t need to to be focused on &quot;cooking from scratch&quot; the way this book was, but I am",
