The thing is that a few days ago my P8P got the green screen of death and the warranty for their 8 Pro&#39;s are only a year while the regular 8&#39;s got 3 years, I had the P8P for a little over a year and Google refused to fix my device. Seeing how idiotic this decision by them is, I am hesitant to buy another one of their devices.
