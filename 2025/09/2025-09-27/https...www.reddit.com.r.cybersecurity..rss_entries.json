Since then, I took over the \u201cmundane\u201d security stuff: investigating phishing emails, EDR log monitoring, network security monitoring with a DNS security platform, and whatever else may pop up.

I do not currently have a Sec+ cert, but will obtain one when I have the disposable income to purchase the voucher. </p> <p>As of now, I try to practice as many skills as I can daily with the tools at my disposal.
