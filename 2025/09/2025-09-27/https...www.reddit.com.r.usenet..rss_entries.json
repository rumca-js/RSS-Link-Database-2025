Everything was working fine, getting up to around 100MB/s across the 2 providers combined.</p> <p>Suddenly 2 nights ago, my speed seems to be limited to 10.8MB/s. This is either combined across both providers, or singularly if I disable one.</p> <p>I have tried all available ports, and both SSL and not. Adjusted my number of connections, and tried with and without VPN. I get this same limiting speed all the time now.</p> <p>Any ideas why this might be? Is my ISP (Vodafone UK) causing me problems maybe? Would this still happen behind a VPN?</p> <p>TIA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tripledrop\"> /u/Tripledrop </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1nrylgo/very_slow_speeds_across_providers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet",
