        "description": "What happens to your brain when you use AI? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice and Gary O\u2019Reilly explore current research into how large language models affect our cognition, memory, and learning with Nataliya Kosmyna, research scientist at the MIT Media Lab. Is AI good for us? \n\nNataliya describes her experiment comparing students writing essays with three methods: ChatGPT, Google, or just their own brains. What happened when groups swapped? Why did the \u201cLLM group\u201d show the least functional connectivity in the brain, while Google users lit up their visual cortex? Why did so many students fail to recall or even quote their own work? Neil and Nataliya unpack how timing, cognitive load, and brain struggle are essential for true learning.\n\nWe explore cognitive load theory, video game design, and whether doctors relying on AI could lose diagnostic skills. How much AI support is too much? Could AI free up tasks so we can use our cognitive energy elsewhere? Or does it rob us of our ",
