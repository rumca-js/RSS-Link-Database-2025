Those 3, three movies!, for weird corporate reasons apparently to due with Weinstein getting royalties from 2 movies but not 3 movies are an absolute mess. 2 movies would be ok if they&#39;re maybe under 2 hours each, the book has a clear break right in the middle with the dwarves getting captured by the elves and then Bilbo freeing them.</p> <p>But still, I&#39;d take a 3 hour and 20 minute actual adaptation of the book, and it&#39;s anti war message about greed and how what can sound like a grand adventure at the start can turn out to be sad.

Money problems force them to settle in Arizona instead, where Alice takes a job as waitress in a small diner. She intends to stay in Arizona just long enough to make the money needed to head back out on the road, but her plans change when she begins to fall for a rancher named David (Kris Kristofferson). Really loved this movie wonderfully directed by Martin Scorsese and it\u2019s one of his films that people don\u2019t talk about as much. Ellen Burstyn is wonderful in the role as Alice and it\u2019s one of lead her to winning an Oscar for Best Actress for the film. Kris Kristoffeson is good as David him and Ellen Burstyn had very likable chemistry. This film also lead to the series \u201cAlice\u201d. If you haven\u2019t seen the film definitely worth seeing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

The model made an impressive transition into a career as a bona fide Hollywood star with her captivating performance in the 1971 coming of age drama &quot;The Last Picture Show.&quot; But backlash against her struck almost immediately when Shepherd, then 20, entered into an affair with her 31-year-old director, Peter Bogdanovich.</p> <p>According to Rolling Stone, the romance lasted eight years, where it remained &quot;gossip-column fodder,&quot; mostly due to the scandalous circumstances from which the affair stemmed. The director&#39;s wife, Polly Platt, was the film&#39;s production designer, and she&#39;d given birth to their second daughter just months prior to Shepherd and Bogdanovich moving in together on set. &quot;It was difficult and I hated Cybill,&quot; Platt once told Entertainment Weekly. &quot;I was jealous \u2014 everything happened while we were",
