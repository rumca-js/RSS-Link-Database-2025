A post from <a href=\"/r/sonarr\">r/sonarr</a> came up on my feed about how to stop it from downloading viruses. Not exaggerating, the vast majority of comments just said something along the lines of &quot;torrents suck, switch to Usenet instead&quot;</p> <p>This surprised me a bit since I&#39;ve seen the *ARR stack mentioned a lot over here. It prompted me to read up on Usenet since I knew next to nothing about it, but it seems one of the biggest differences is needing to pay $ for it.</p> <p>What&#39;re your thoughts? Is Usenet superior? Why or why not?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lost1nTheDream\"> /u/Lost1nTheDream </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1ns4oix/torrents_vs_usenet/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1ns4oix/torrents_vs_usenet/\">[co",
