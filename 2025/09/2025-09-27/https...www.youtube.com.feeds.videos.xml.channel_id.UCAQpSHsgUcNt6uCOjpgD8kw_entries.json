        "description": "It took 3 grueling days, but the reading recording is done.  It took another week to include the amazing storm sounds such as the different sounds of thunder from different types of lightning, the stampede-like sound of a distant hail storm (called the hail roar), and of course the sound of a tornado. Also, I've included all the reoccurring music that I've used in my YouTube videos to help set the mood. I think you'll dig it. \n\nThe hardcover eBook and Audiobook are now available just about everywhere in most countries. Just search \"Storm Book Hank\" if you'd like a copy. It should arrive before Halloween.  Thanks everyone!",
