I just cleared the Terraform Associate certification and am now moving on to learning Docker.</p> <p>After some research, I found two highly recommended Udemy courses:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Docker &amp; Kubernetes: The Practical Guide [2025 Edition]</em></strong> <strong>by Maximilian Schwarzm\u00fcller</strong></li> <li><strong><em>Docker Mastery: with Kubernetes + Swarm</em></strong> <strong>by Bret Fisher</strong></li> </ul> <p>My goal is to build strong Docker fundamentals while also gaining exposure to some advanced concepts. I don\u2019t plan on pursuing the Docker Certified Associate exam, since my next step will be Kubernetes, with the aim of preparing for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam.</p> <p>If you know of any courses or resources that are better than the ones listed above\u2014or can share helpful links for deeper understanding\u2014I\u2019d really appreciate yo",
