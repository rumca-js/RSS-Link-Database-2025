Today, my quest link app started to work again, and I set the supersample to 2.5x on Oculus Tray Tool.</p> <p>With a combination of 960 Mbps for Quest Link and 2.5x supersampling in Oculus Tray Tool, Hitman PCVR was no longer blurry. However, the maximum resolution in the Meta Quest App is 1.5x, which is around 5000ish x 2000ish. The image is still not as sharp as I liked, since I am so used to now playing PCVR and UEVR games at VD Godlike and beyond.</p> <p>Anyway, if you have a Quest 2/3 and a link cable, try super sampling 2.5 in Oculus Tray Tool the next time you boot up Hitman PCVR. Also, make sure to set OpenXR as the default runtime in the Quest Link App for more performance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lorddon1234\"> /u/Lorddon1234 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreal",

This is my Cinematic VR Showcase for MADiSON on PSVR2.</p> <p>For me, MADiSON is without a doubt one of the best VR horror games ever made. It\u2019s also the scariest game I\u2019ve ever played \u2014 not just in VR, but in gaming, full stop. Playing in VR takes it to another level entirely. The atmosphere is suffocating, the sound design is brutal, and the way the game messes with your head is unlike anything else.</p> <p>What makes it so incredible though is how stunning and immersive it is. The level of detail in the environments, the lighting, and the way you interact with the world all pull you deep into the nightmare. It\u2019s a game I both hate and love at the same time: pure torture to get through, but so masterfully designed that I couldn\u2019t stop myself ",
