You want to talk about safety? Fine. Give us the option. Stop controlling paying users like we\u2019re the problem. We pay for choice, not to be forced into a model we didn\u2019t ask for.

These are the most verbose models OpenAI offers, the ones people use for deep, ongoing conversations, not just short queries. In other words, the ones that consume the most compute.</p> <p>We know OpenAI is rolling out features like ChatGPT Pulse, which demands a ton of compute, and such compute they clearly don\u2019t have enough of. But they keep launching these features anyway, likely to keep their investors happy, especially after GPT-5\u2019s release failed to live up to expectations. There\u2019s a lot of skepticism around Sam Altman right now, and OpenAI has to look innovative, even if they\u2019re not actually delivering against competitors.</p> <p>So what could be causing this forced rerouting?</p> <p><strong>1. Reducing Compute Load</strong> They may be trying to reduce usage of the most compute-intensive models (the ones we ch",

If people continue to use and not stop, then I think it gives him more backing to get rid of 4o all together. It\u2019s pretty messed up not to even say anything at this point about what\u2019s going on.
