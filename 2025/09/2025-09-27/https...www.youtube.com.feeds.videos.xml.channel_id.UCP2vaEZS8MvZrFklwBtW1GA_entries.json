        "description": "Electrical wire sealing tips\u2026I have a bunch of penetrations in the bottom plates for electrical wires. So I use @greatstufffoam Fireblock to seal them. This impedes the spread of smoke and flames in case there\u2019s a fire in an adjacent room. Plus the smart dispenser allows this can to be used for up to 30 days, which is nice while I\u2019m working on the entire bathroom remodel. Many thanks to Great Stuff for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#electrical #greatstufffoam #bathroomremodel #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
