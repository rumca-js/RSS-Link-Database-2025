It&#39;s a 100% open-source tool to make self-hosting PostgreSQL backups super simple.</p> <p>I&#39;ve just released <strong>v0.5.0</strong>, and the big news is it now supports the brand new <strong>PostgreSQL 18</strong>!</p> <p>The whole idea is to give you a clean web interface to manage your database backups without messing with cron jobs or complex scripts. It runs in a simple Docker container and lets you:</p> <ul> <li>Schedule your backups automatically.</li> <li>Save them to a local volume (like your NAS) or any S3-compatible storage.</li> <li>Monitor everything from a central dashboard.</li> </ul> <p>You can find the project on GitHub and see how to get started here:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Project Repo:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/eduardolat/pgbackweb\"><code>https://github.com/eduardo",
