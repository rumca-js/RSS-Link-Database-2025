Please accept this post in good faith and a desire for discussion and understanding of Indigeneity and Indigenous racial fraud:</p> <p>Many settlers (readers, more generally) lack the deeper sociocultural/ historical context and community knowledge necessary to understand Indigenous racial fraud and why it is harmful to both Indigenous peoples and settlers.

So! Long! I\u2019ve nevertheless been fascinated by the passionate Sanderson discussions that appear on this sub periodically, and the polarizing release of <em>Wind and Truth</em> at the end of 2024 is what finally made me curious enough to start the first book - both for the sake of exploring one of the hottest series that fits my reading project and also because I really, really want to finally have my own opinion about Sanderson as one of the most popular fantasy authors of our time.

Eventually I&#39;ve stumbled on the award page of Glen Cook (Author of Black Company) to realize that he&#39;s never won anything. In fact, The Black Company series has never even been nominated for anything. At first, I thought this might be a Glen Cook specific issue as I acknowledge that his prose style would probably be disliked by award panels. </p> <p>Just to make sure I decided to check out another big author in the military subgenre with Steven Erikson (Malazan). Malazan had some nominations here and there but it feels like he never was close to a win either. Then I looked at other big authors in the subgenre (R. Scott Bakker, Christopher Buehlman, Miles Cameron, etc...) and none of them have won anything except George R. R. Martin (who I think shouldn&",

Now to the rant.</p> <p>I got disappointed with the book from the very start, when I realised, who the characters are and what&#39;s their goal. A bunch of misfits that are most worn-out character tropes in fantasy: aristocratic vampire, arrogant mage, feral werewolf, under knight. And Abercrombie doesn&#39;t give them any characterological twist, they are exactly as they appear. Their goal is equally stereotypical fantasy trope - to put a rightful heir on the throne. </p> <p>But it&#39;s even worse. I read that Abercrombie&#39;s goal was to get his book finally adapted to the screen and I can see that he wrote the book with script in mind.

I miss that feeling when I first watched anything fantastical as a child and it gave me a positive rush: looking at the cursed ruins on top of the grassy mountain, the talking trees, a dark room only lit dimly by a glowing blue light controlled by a cloaked woman who can levitate things, just some random vague scenes from my mind, when I watched shit like this it evoked such a mystical feeling in the young me unlike now when I&#39;m barely surprised. I&#39;m chasing that feeling again. </p> <p>As a personal definition, what makes fantasy different to me than sci fi is that science fiction always has an explanation for things.

Recently been thinking about the archetype of the lone ranger type of protagonist who is usually a warrior or knight wandering from place to place. A taciturn warrior with a gloomy vibe. I was wondering if you guys have any recs of books that are centered around this type of stories?</p> <p>I&#39;d prefer more traditional high fantasy. I know the sword &amp; sorcery genre is pretty much this, with the exception of Elric, the majority of S&amp;W seem to be focused on the action and adventure, while I&#39;m looking for something more introspective, personal and quiet, if possible.</p> <p>The closest I can think as an example is Vagabond the manga.
