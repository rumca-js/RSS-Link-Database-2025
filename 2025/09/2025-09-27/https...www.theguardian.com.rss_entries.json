Never in his wildest of dreams could Luke Donald have imagined this scenario for his imperious European team. They will head into the final day of the Ryder Cup leading 11\u00bd\u20134\u00bd and requiring a mere two and a half more points from 12 singles contests for retention. The fat lady is gargling.</p><p>There will be analysis \u2013 and plenty of it \u2013 about American capitulation under the erratic leadership of Keegan Bradley but the scale of what they have run into must also be recognised. Tommy Fleetwood has won within half a point of the US tally on his own. Perhaps Bradley should deploy pairs of golfers again for day three. The Europeans have already made history, courtesy of their largest ever pre-singles lead.</p> <a href=",
