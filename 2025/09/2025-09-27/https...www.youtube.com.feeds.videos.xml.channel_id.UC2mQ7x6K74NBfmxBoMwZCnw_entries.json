        "description": "Mission one of our cinematic fourth edition Kill Team campaign is here, and things get sneaky... well, as sneaky as Deathwatch can be when they are armed to the teeth and led by a guy named Captain Rex. Tommy takes command of Kill Team 99 with help from Skari on list crafting, and together they dive headfirst into a sabotage mission full of blips, alarms, and suspiciously incompetent guardsmen.\nExpect doors being hacked, looted spanners, meltabombs on volatile Prometheium tanks, and a steady stream of goon squads straight out of every action movie ever. \n\nThe Deathwatch heroes\u2014Rex, Hunter, Wrecker, Echo, and Crosshair\u2014make their mark in the opening chapter of this narrative series. The complex is crawling with threats, but will the kill team complete their objectives before the entire facility collapses on top of them? Tune in for mission one of Kill Team 99.\n\nMembers to watch the Stormtroopers vs Orks Kill Team Battle Report, go here\nYoutube Members - https://youtu.be/lWDPAImUx9A\nVau",
