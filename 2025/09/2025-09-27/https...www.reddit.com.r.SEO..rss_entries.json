Not ranking for generic terms is one thing, but not showing up at all for my own company name (let\u2019s call it <em>Octigen GmbH</em>)? That feels really odd.</p> <p>Now, here\u2019s the twist: this domain used to belong to a completely different company (also called Octigen) that went bust years ago. Old links still exist in forums, ecommerce sites, etc. I\u2019m wondering if the domain\u2019s past life could be holding it back \u2014 like a reputation penalty or some kind of lingering Google baggage.</p> <p>Has anyone here run into something like this?<",
