Powerful spells become futile, and an Achaean named Orolandes who, with only half a sword, goes on a quest to search for the lost power.</p> <p>But the gods and Atlantis are now dead. Creatures of the spirit, even the centaurs and unicorns are dying. And every sparkling thing will soon be gone from the entire where only the clay will remain. And the dumb barbarians will win after all.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read a few of these stories from at least a few of his collections (with some of them overlapping of course) but I never read the three book",
