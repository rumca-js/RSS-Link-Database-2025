I want to study either electrical or mechanical engineering. Obviously AI makes software development faster but I also would like to design something physical.</p> <p>Embedded and semiconductor are very interesting domains to me but also machines, fluid and air dynamics interest me. As I can&#39;t do both I have to make a choice and would like to know your opinion on what will probably be the domain that has more demand.</p> <p>I&#39;d imagine electrical could have the edge due to hardware and design requirements for AI?</p> <p>Thank you for contributing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/parallel_mike\"> /u/parallel_mike </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1nrjq1d/masters_in_cs_2nd_masters_in_mechanical_vs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
