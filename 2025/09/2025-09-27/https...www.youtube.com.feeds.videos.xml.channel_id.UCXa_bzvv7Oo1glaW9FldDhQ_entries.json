        "description": "Slime Rancher 2 has spent almost three years in Early Access, having come out all the way back in 2022. Since then, however, the title has seen several layers of refinement and iteration as developer Monomi Park took in fan feedback to make improvements to the game. After all these years, it is finally out, and the developers have knocked it out of the park when it comes to making a good sequel. \n\nIn Slime Rancher 2, you start out on a brand new landmass, dubbed Rainbow Island, where you must set forth to discover and bring back different kinds of slimes to your ranch. \n\nThe gameplay revolves almost entirely around exploration and experimentation between different types of slimes, with some light home maintenance thrown in for some variety. Those that want some more challenge can also find it through portals that can throw you into strange places that need platforming and puzzle solving to escape.",

        "description": "It's been a great few years for Konami although things weren't looking too good for the Japanese studio in the wake of some troubling decisions in its past. Its infamous split with Hideo Kojima and the decision to take on mobile games instead of a renewed focus on excellent AAA titles might have seen the studio fade into unfortunate obscurity. \n\nHowever, its excellent remakes of great games from Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill, coupled with exciting new titles like Silent Hill f have allowed the studio to regain its strong standing in the gaming industry, bringing its greatest hits back to a new generation of gamers while its new games further cement its place in the global gaming landscape. \n\nIt's a redemption story that demonstrates smart choices and an ability to learn from the mistakes of the past and rise above them, and Konami is now back and better than before.",

We are going to be receiving a new mainline Pokemon game this year, with Pokemon Legends: Z-A scheduled for release in a little under a month now. \n\nAs a return to the fan favorite and perennially under visited Kalos region, as well as a follow up to the fan favorite Pokemon Legends, it has a lot of eyes on it.
