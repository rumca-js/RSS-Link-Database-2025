This year I launched a side project called <a href=\"http://Web-Site.Design\">Web-Site.Design</a>. The idea: use Astro + AI workflows to build SEO-friendly websites for small businesses for only \u00a350/month (less than many mobile phone contracts). I wrote this LinkedIn article explaining the journey and why I think Astro combined with AI is the sweet spot for small businesses who need a low-cost website. </p> <p>It&#39;s something we couldn\u2019t do with WordPress due to time/labour costs, bloat and maintenance overhead. With our pay monthly websites:</p> <ul> <li>Customers get a fully managed, professional site with no upfront investment, i.e. the can see the real thing before they sign up</li> <li>Everything is included \u2014 design, build, SEO-friendly content, and hosting</li> <li>Small businesses can budget more easily, spreading the cost over time instead ",

From my research and the personal frustration I experience here are the main reasons. Choice Overload with Netflix, Prime, Disney+ etc. each have thousands of titles. Too many options and at the end I get tired. Mood vs. Genre. Most apps filter by genre but in reality we pick based on how we feel (tired \u2192 comedy, date night \u2192 romance, etc.). A 2 hour investment feels risky so we endlessly scroll for the absolute pick. Alone, with friends, partner means completely different choices.</p> <p>To experiment I built a little project that asks about your mood, situation, phycology factors at the moment and instantly recommends one main choice and some more backups. What do you think.
