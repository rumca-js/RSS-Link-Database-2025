        "description": "Autodesk Research has partnered with Additive Tectonics to develop a new approach to concrete floor construction using 3D printing technology. The collaboration combines 3D-printed formwork, natural fiber reinforcement, and low-carbon geopolymer concrete as alternatives to conventional building methods. The system addresses three issues with traditional concrete floors: single-use formwork waste, material inefficiency in flat slab [&#8230;]",
