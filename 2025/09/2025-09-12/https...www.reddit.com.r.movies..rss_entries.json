That fascinates me. Also, that&#39;s art! It isn&#39;t supposed to comfort you.</p> <p>Beau is Afraid is a masterpiece (Also, Eddington is so relevant and if you liked No Country, check it out in context of modern politics and that we no longer have a shared reality).</p> <p>But Beau makes people with panic attacks feel &quot;seen&quot;. It&#39;s an unreal Odyssey. Also one of my favorite films ever.</p> <p>So, apparently I like that chaos and tension.

I realized that Bernard (Beanie) had the best life out of all his friends, despite his complaining and the frat being his idea. I mean - married with kids, owns his own home, has a string of successful businesses, is still in touch with his college buddies, all while being a pretty hands-on dad. Most people my age would kill for that kind of life as it is seeming more and more unattainable with each passing year. The things we took for granted in 2003...sigh.

The experiments are a success at first, but as Jessup continues his work, he begins to experience altered mental and also physical states.

The film is really good, intense, weird and trippy. William Hurt did a good job portraying Eddie a very likable interesting character who has these states of consciousness and wants to fight them off.
