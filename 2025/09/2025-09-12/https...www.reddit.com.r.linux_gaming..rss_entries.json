(it is indeed 4 pin) Or would i need to install graphics drivers first for whatever reason (currently only using the bootable media for fedora, not installed) Just figure id ask before committing to an hour of violent wind noise trying to work it out. </p> <p>TIA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Slight-Masterpiece32\"> /u/Slight-Masterpiece32 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1nf97gh/amd_bc250_ps5_c",

Windows 10 kinda makes things slow down by a lot, and i need to constantly get a clean install to make it work smoothly. Hence after a lot of thinking, id like to step into linux in hopes to stop constantly reinstalling the damn os on this pc and prolly learn a thing or 2 about linux.</p> <p>When it comes to media, im talking videos, netflix and stuff, discord i guess for screenshares and stuff.<br/> When im talking games, im talking old games like gta sanandreas or similar, and ofcourse, geforce now for cloud gaming for the high end games. Thats really all i need and do on this pc, and if possible, some variant of ms office for smol office work if i dont have my laptop around.</p> <p>The specs on this pc would be:<br/> Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4590 CPU @ 3.30GHz, 3301 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)<br/> Installed RAM 8.00 GB<br/> Intel(R) HD G",

I want to take screenshots with my xbox controller when gaming using the share button. This doesn&#39;t seem to work right out of the gate like on windows. I have installed both xpadneo and xone for the drivers, mainly using xone with the wireless adapter. I can set it up in steam with no massive issues using steam inputs, but i have issues doing the same on heroics, which i want to keep using for the cloud saves.</p> <p>Any tips? I don&#39;t care if I just remap the button to printscreen so it just does it even when not gaming, but I was unable to figure that out too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MavericKkidX5\"> /u/MavericKkidX5 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ner6lk/using_the_share_button_on_a_xbox_controller_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a",
