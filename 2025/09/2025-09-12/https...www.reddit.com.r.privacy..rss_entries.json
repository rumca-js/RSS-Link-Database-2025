Associated to that account she had a SFW Facebook account. </p> <p>In the same device, on the Instagram app she had a differen account, &quot;Account 2&quot;, which was a NSFW account. After some time she noticed that her NSFW account was suspended indefinitely without being able to recover it. </p> <p>What was strange was that her SFW accounts (Account 1, both Instagram and Facebook) were also seized. </p> <p>Fortunately she appealed those SFW accounts and she was able to retrieve them. </p> <p>However, when trying to create another Instagram account (blank, from scratch), from the same device or another device in the same wifi, those accounts would be seized immediately. </p> <p>How can this happen? Does Instagram ban everything associated with the same device or IP? Thanks friends </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",

If you haven&#39;t watched the show, long story short an ex-navy seal is wanted for murder. He meets with a reporter who agrees to talk to because she can get information without raising awareness. Here&#39;s where the secrecy comes in.</p> <p>In the scene, she asks for his phone number so they can text, but he declines. He puts her cellphone in a faraday bag and gives her a burner phone. He tells her to buy a pre-paid card with cash and to download Threema. Since threema is paid but doesn&#39;t require any personal information, it made me wonder. How realistic is this level of privacy? Is there still potential to be tracked, have your communications be found, etc? I saw this and went &quot;damn.
