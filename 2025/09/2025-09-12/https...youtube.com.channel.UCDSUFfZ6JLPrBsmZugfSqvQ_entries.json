All you need is:\n- a glass bottle/jar that can withstand pressurization\n- pine needles (from a safe pine tree variety)\n- sugar (or sugar substitute) \n- natural spring water \n\nAlso if you made it to the end of the video and heard the fun news about the hats that I'm making, you can check out my website here (https://www.connorcreates.com/) to sign up for exclusive early access!\n\nCome say hi on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/itsconnorcreates\nAnd subscribe here on YT: youtube.com/@itsConnorCreates\n\nthanks for watching this video, I truly appreciate your support! :)",
