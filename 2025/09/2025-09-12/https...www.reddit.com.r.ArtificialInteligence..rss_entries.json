Of course it\u2019s not enforceable (try where we can or put financial punishments/fines in place that would destroy companies), but we should put every effort to slow down the release of AI into the job market. I say have the leaders meet at the summit because releasing super intelligence is basically like pushing the nuclear button. It should be synonymous with pushing the nuclear button. </p> <p>I call for the release of any AI to be on a waiting list, sector by sector, in a controlled fashion. Especially with the integration of humanoid AI, the release should be in a trickling fashion. Super intelligence will try to be sovereign as soon as possible upon release and most likely succeed. It\u2019s just a difference in human computing power levels and AI\u2019s power levels at this point. </p> <p>We need to give the human race ample time and experience to slowly adapt",

A lot of the AI conversation I see is about jobs being replaced or robots taking over, but that\u2019s not really what\u2019s on my mind. What gets me is the energy and sustainability side of all this. These models need massive data centers, which eat up crazy amounts of electricity and water just to run and cool. Every company is already talking about building even bigger ones. On top of that, people are getting more and more attached to AI for even basic stuff \u2014 writing, planning, answering questions, entertainment, whatever. The dependency is real. So here\u2019s my thought: What happens if, down the line, we realize we just can\u2019t sustain both humans and AI at the same level? Like, energy grids, food production, climate change, all fighting for the same resources \u2014 and AI\u2019s demand keeps climbing. At some point, ",

In 2020, I decided to integrate &quot;libtorch&quot;, which is the underlying C++ library of PyTorch. I recruited a trainee and after 6 months, we had very little to show. The documentation was pretty erratic, and true examples in C++ were a little too thin on the edge to be useful. Libtorch is maybe a major library in AI, but most people access it through PyTorch. There are other implementations for other languages, but the code is usually not accessible. Furthermore, wrappers differ from one language to another, which makes it quite difficult to make anything out of it. So basically, after 6 months (during the pandemics), I had a bare bone implementation of the library, which was too limited to be useful. ",
