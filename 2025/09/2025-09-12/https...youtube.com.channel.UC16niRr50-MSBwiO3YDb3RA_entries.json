        "description": "At least 19 Russian drones entered Polish airspace this week, four of which were shot down. \n\nThe moment was described by Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, as the closest Poland has come to open conflict since the second world war. Moscow insists it did not intend to attack any specific targets, but many in Nato are considering this a deliberate challenge to the ability and willingness of the alliance to defend itself.\n \nFor their reaction to the incursion, Lucy Hockings and Vitaly Shevchenko are joined by BBC Verify\u2019s Olga Robinson and security correspondent Frank Gardner. They consider the prospect of escalation, and explain why the western response might seem cautious.\n\nListen to the full episode here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0m279tg\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #Ukraine #Russia",

He argues his country's military operation in Gaza is a \"just war\" with the goals of destroying Hamas and bringing home all the hostages.\n \nIn January 2024, he said that \"Israel's commitment to international law is unwavering\". That commitment is coming under ever-increasing scrutiny.\n \nMore than 64,500 people have been killed by Israel during its campaign - almost half of them women and children, ac",
