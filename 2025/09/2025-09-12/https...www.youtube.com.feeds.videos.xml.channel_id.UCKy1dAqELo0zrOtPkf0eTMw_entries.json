Join Logan Plant and Sam Claiborn as Sam shares his impressions of the new DK Island level and the Emerald Rush mode. DK Island is a nostalgic throwback to the Donkey Kong\u2019s Rare glory days, stuffed with references to Country, 64, Jungle Beat, and more. But the true star of this show is Emerald Rush, a remix on Bananza\u2019s layers that strips DK of all his powers and challenges you to strategically reclaim them on your mission to hoard as much emerald as possible. It\u2019s a fast, frantic, destructive mode that\u2019s shaping up to be a great postgame challenge for Bananza fans. For more on this week\u2019s Direct, check out our full episode of NVC that breaks down every announcement, and be sure to check out Sam\u2019s written DK preview on IGN.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Nintendo",

        "description": "In this video, we have what can be a challenging battle arena/locked room in Greymoor. You will run into this if you head to the right side of the map after entering Greymoor -- rather than going to the left to eventually run into Moorwing. The battle consists of five waves of various bird enemies. We suggest one of the easier ways to do it being hugging the far left or far right side of the arena whenever possible.\nFor more info on Hollow Knight: Silksong, head to our wiki @ https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong\n\n#HollowKnightSilkSong #Gaming #IGN",

        "description": "In this boss fight gameplay, we take on Widow, which is the final fight you need to beat in order to complete the Threadspun Town mission and get Bellhart back to normal. Widow's melee attacks take two chunks of health from you while the projectiles generally only take one chunk of health from you, which is something to be aware of during the fight.\n\nFor more info on Hollow Knight: Silksong, head to our wiki @ https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong\n\n#HollowKnightSilkSong #Gaming #IGN",
