The highest total in the team\u2019s T20 history was turbocharged by a brilliant opening stand of 126 between Phil Salt and Jos Buttler and by the nation\u2019s highest individual score, Salt knocking himself off the top of that chart with an unbeaten 141.

Outside is the end of the world with no more sun or nature. Inside the last humans are left standing. Instead of playing master-slave games, Lindsay Posner\u2019s production turns them into desperate entertainers who wisecrack, amuse and perform even in these hopeless circumstances.</p><p>This theatre describes the play as a \u201cmacabre comedy\u201d and that is what is rendered on stage. The blind, seated Hamm (Douglas Hodge, returning to the stage after more than a decade) is not so much a tyrant as an aged thespian, even if he whistles for his limping servant, Clov (Mathew Horne), and consigns his parents to dustbins. He bears elements of Winnie from Happy Days in his whimsy and escape into storytelling.</p> <a href=\"https://www.t",
