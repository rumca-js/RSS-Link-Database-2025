When <em>Pokopia</em> is released sometime next year, you&#39;ll assume the role of a Ditto determined to make a comfortable home for their friends. This Ditto has assumed the form of a human, and as they meet new Pok\u00e9mon, they&#39;ll learn abilities they can use to transform their community. In turn, this work will lead to more Pok\u00e9mon coming to live in your home. The game features a beautiful tilt-shift art style that is reminiscent of Pok\u00e9mon&#39;s third generation of games that debuted on the Game Boy Advance.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"2d2e31cf777f439387b8809f4ee53852\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.co",
