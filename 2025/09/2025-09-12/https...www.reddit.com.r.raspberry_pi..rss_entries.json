I want to learn a bit more about electronics, and I\u2019ve already experimented with Arduinos and ESP32 boards.</p> <p>Now I would like to create a project where data from my sensors is sent directly to a nearby server using NRF24L01 modules. This way, the system won\u2019t depend on a stable internet connection, since all data will be sent locally and also will use less power supply.</p> <p>On the server side, I\u2019d like to set up a Flask web application that allows users to connect via Wi-Fi and view the data in a visualized format.</p> <p>Can a Raspberry Pi serve as the server in this setup, and if so, which model would be the most suitable? If not, what alternative hardware would you recommend? Looks like Raspberry Pi 4 (2\u20134 GB RAM) is the best option for me?</p> <p>Also, could you suggest some good courses or materials to learn how to build such a system if there are some?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

I&#39;m a total noob when it comes to Pi and Python code so wanted to see if there was someone on here, ideally in the UK who could potentially get involved with setting up some RPis for us.
