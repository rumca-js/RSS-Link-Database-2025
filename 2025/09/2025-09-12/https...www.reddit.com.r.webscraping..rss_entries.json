Some game developers I work with provide APIs, which makes integration smooth, but others either don\u2019t have an API or aren\u2019t willing to share. I\u2019d like to remove the manual steps currently needed when players load or redeem credits, and fully automate the process. I already have a bank-approved payment gateway in place.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve done something similar or have expertise in this kind of automation, I\u2019d love to connect.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MemeJung777\"> /u/MemeJung777 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1nffhiu/sweepstakes_gaming_automation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1nffhiu/sweepstakes_gaming_automation/\">[comments]</a></span>",
