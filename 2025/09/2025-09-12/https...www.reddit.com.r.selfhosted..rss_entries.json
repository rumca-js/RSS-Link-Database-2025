I just recently found that many note taking apps are supporting LLMs (e.g. using ollama).</p> <p>My question now: how are you approaching this? I just deployed ollama using docker and started out with a small quantized 8B model, and I was suprised how SLOW this is. Been obviously exposed to AI-chatbots here and there, and they all seem to be at least responding in a decent time. But to me, it seemed like running any small LLM on an i5 9th gen is just not working AT ALL. Seems like dedicated GPUs are the way to go, which for me somewhat ruins the idea of running a &quot;small&quot; homelab that doesn&#39;t require a power plant to be run.</p> <p>This then made me wonder how this is currently handled by the selfhosting community: would you use a GPU to ru",
