It\u2019s a 6-core, 12-thread, 14-nanometer design that draws 65 watts and runs at 2.9Ghz, called the Core i5-110. If you watch Intel processors like a hawk, that might sound familiar: The specs appear to be identical to the Core i5-10400, a Comet Lake CPU that first debuted in 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In product terms this is what\u2019s known as a \u201crebadge,\u201d and it\u2019s hardly unprecedented for both regular chips and other designs. But given the pace of CPU tech, and the issues Intel is facing at the moment, this particular example might rub consumers the wrong way. Assuming they notice, of course \u2014 the entire point of a rebadge is getting products out there without making much of a splash. The new listing was spotted by <a href=\"https://xcancel.com/momomo_us/status/1966139066182938932\">Twitter poster @momomo_US",

I\u2019m taking about those cheap portable monitors that go on sale for about $50 on Amazon, available under a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2459254/vrurc-this-11-delightfully-dumb-brand-names-i-found-on-amazon.html\">variety of unrecognizable brand names</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one I got is made by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX52HTHY/\">BIGASUO</a> (a name I can\u2019t stop saying), but you can find seemingly identical models from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CC2429BY/\">FANGOR</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9NNWXVP/\">MNN</a>. They all serve the same basic purpose as a travel-friendly way to add an extra screen to your laptop, and they all have the same basic features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-bl",

Something like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSPB26NK/\">this Geekom AX8 Max mini PC</a> that\u2019s now on sale for $528.99 (was $749) on Amazon. That\u2019s a lovely 29 percent discount on a miniature powerhouse!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running on a powerful AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor and a chunky 32GB of fast DDR5 RAM as well as a spacious 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, this mini PC will serve you well in all you do. It can smoothly handle Windows 11 Pro (which comes pre-installed) and it can even do some modest gaming thanks to the built-in AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics. Want to push it even further? You can add an AMD eGPU via USB4!</p>\n\n\n\n<p",
