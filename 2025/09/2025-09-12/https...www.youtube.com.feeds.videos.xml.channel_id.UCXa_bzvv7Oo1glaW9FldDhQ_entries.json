        "description": "For those of you wondering where to get started in a long list of mods for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, we've compiled a list of our favorite ones to help you out. From a few very nifty gameplay tweaks to visual changes that add a layer of immersion to the adventure, the modding community for the remake has certainly been busy. \n\nConsidering the original release's popularity and the many years that these modders have had to perfect their mods, it's really not surprising to see that many of the best mods for Snake Eater have been made again for the remake. \n\nConsole players are regrettably not going to be a part of the fun for now but who knows? Konami might very well choose to add modding support later down the line if its fans are vocal enough.\n\nCamera Tweaks: https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/17\n\nLaser Sights: https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/21\n\nSnake's Classic Mullet Hair: https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltas",

        "description": "Over a week later, with another big-name title (Borderlands 4) now available, I'm still hung up on Hollow Knight: Silksong. It shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone because (a) it's one of the most anticipated games of the year and (b) it's an incredibly massive game, teeming with secrets to discover. \n\nAt times, it doesn't feel real. If I hadn't actually ventured through Pharloom's gorgeous, elaborately detailed and sometimes exceedingly depressive biomes, I'd still believe it was the lead-up to an elaborate prank by Team Cherry. And yet, here we are.",

        "description": "With Silent Hill f just around the corner, we dive into the game's presence at Gamescom to bring you more details that could help you decide if it's worth your time and money. There's a lot to like about Konami and NeoBard's bold new additions to a title that takes the franchise's trademark psychological horror formula to 1960s Japan.\n\nHinako is proving to be a very interesting protagonist, her experiences and skills (or lack thereof depending how you look at it) proving to be the perfect vehicle for the game's chills and thrills both narratively and also from a gameplay perspective. The game's performance on the PS5 and PC has also received some attention, most of it positive. All in all, the new game seems like it's going to be Silent Hill made for current-gen gamers, and we're definitely stoked to try it out.",
