I\u2019ll be in Greece the last 2 weeks of September and I\u2019m looking for some good book recommendations for my trip - I absolutely love reading on the beach. Looking for something transportive and moving. I read Autobiography of Red by Anne Carson the last time I was in Greece and it really moved me, I adore her prose. Not imperative to be Greek inspired but also not against it. I\u2019ve read Circe by Madeline Miller and am obsessed so anything in that vein / similar also is a plus.
