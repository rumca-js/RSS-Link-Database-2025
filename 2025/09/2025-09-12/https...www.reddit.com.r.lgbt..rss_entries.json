I am very close to my whole family, Im 30 and I dont have close friends or a partner. We normally spend most weekends together as a family still. But I&#39;m a lesbian and probably nonbionary, and most importantly I am a decent fucking human being. Im currently crying and shaking in my car at the nearest place I could park from their house.

At first it was confusing\u2014watching my friends crush on girls while I was trying to hide the fact that I felt the same way about guys. For a long time, I kept it bottled up out of fear of how people would react.</p> <p>Coming out wasn\u2019t easy. Some people in my life were supportive right away, others weren\u2019t. What surprised me most was how much lighter I felt just by saying the words out loud. Even if not everyone accepted me, at least I wasn\u2019t carrying the secret anymore.</p> <p>These days, I\u2019m learning to accept myself more and more. It\u2019s still not perfect\u2014there are moments when I feel judged or out of place\u2014but I\u2019ve realized that being gay isn\u2019t something to be ashamed of.
