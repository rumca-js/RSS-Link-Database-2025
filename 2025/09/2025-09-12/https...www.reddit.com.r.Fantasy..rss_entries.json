        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone! I\u2019m a huge fan of Gene Wolfe, especially his Book of the New Sun and Wizard Knight series. I really love the lush, intricate prose and the mythological elements. I\u2019m looking for book recommendations that match that vibe\u2014elevated, poetic writing with complex themes, ideally weaving in mythology. I read The King of Elfland&#39;s Daughter because I&#39;d heard the prose was fantastic, but despite the prose being good I found it really boring. Recently read Fritz Leiber and really enjoyed his prose and style, but I thought the substance was a bit more along the lines of monster of the day. Anyway, I think that&#39;s a good place to kick off a conversation - any hidden gems or classics you\u2019d recommend?

Part of the problem is attention span related, so I&#39;m trying to find a real breezy page turner to tempt him. No Sanderson or the like. When I was a kid I really enjoyed d&amp;d novels like Dragonlance, Drizzt, etc. and I thought something like that would fit the bill, but while he likes fantastical settings he doesnt know D&amp;D lore or anything like that. Any thoughts about a good d&amp;d type novel that might make for an easy, engrossing read for a fairly inexperienced reader? Retro suggestions welcome, as right now my best ideas are The Crystal Shard or the Legend of Huma.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TriedUsingTurpentine\"> /u/TriedUsingTurpentine </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nf7x5p/breezy_read_for_stubborn_young_reader_dd_n",

I actually wonder if there\u2019s a book that touches on species fetishism, but this isn\u2019t a strict necessity and is more of a curiosity. I put romance in the title but I&#39;m not looking for romance fantasy, more like romance as a side plot if there is any is fine by mine. I&#39;m mostly interested in cultural/political conflict between fantasy species. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/archival_assistant13\"> /u/archival_assistant13 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ner6l1/books_about_interspecies_relationships_political/\">[link]</a></span>",

Evar, Clovis and Keerol go back to their time as the skeer kill the assistant and soldier. Then they go to the plains and meet up with Aprix and company. They return to the library to find Yute. My understanding is that Yute and his band have been there a few weeks. But it is revealed that when they arrived Oanold had his guards kill all the canith which is the massacre of Clovis&#39;s family that happened decades earlier.</p> <p>Did I overlook something?
