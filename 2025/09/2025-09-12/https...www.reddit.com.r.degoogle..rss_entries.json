One is my personal main account and the second one is from a band with my friends. I wanted to have it in one centre. Why? I have more Instagram accounts (my main, my side, the band that i want to have on facebook also, ...). And i wanted to post the pics and content on facebook and Instagram just by one click on the band accounts. But when i have my bands instagram on the other meta centre and the bands Facebook is lonely and without any Instagram accounts. Do you know how to solve it?
