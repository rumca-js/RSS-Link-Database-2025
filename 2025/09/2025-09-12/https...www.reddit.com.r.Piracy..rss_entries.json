I thought i may as well compile a list of the in my opinion best seedboxes. These are my top 2 since others havent come close in my opinion.</p> <p><a href=\"https://clients.servarica.com/aff.php?aff=1023\">Servarica</a></p> <p>Go to for a lot of people. 5$ for 2 tb with unlimited bandwidth at 250mbit/s which increases by 1 mbit everyday (so after 80 days 330mbit). In my experience they are really generous with the bandwith and i have seen speeds a few hundred mbits over my limit. They also have higher plans with a bit more value but then you have less bandwith per tb (will probably not matter much for a lot of people)</p> <p>*Please note that some users including myself have experienced issues with connection to the server taking 10 seconds sometimes because of some f upped routing at ISP level i think</p> <p><a href=\"https://client",
