During the Super Mario Bros. Wonder segment where a <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-coming-to-switch-2-with-new-multiplayer-modes/1100-6534692/\">Switch 2 edition was announced</a>, Nintendo also revealed something totally unexpected: a talking flower product you can buy.</p><p>Based on the talking flowers from Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the real, physical product can speak on their own and say things like, \"We kinda look alike, huh?\" In the Direct, we saw Nintendo's Yoshiaki Koizumi speak to the flower. However, the flower is not interactive like, say, an Amazon Alexa is. It only speaks. \"These talking flowers can make everyday life a little more fun,\" Koizumi said.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=",
