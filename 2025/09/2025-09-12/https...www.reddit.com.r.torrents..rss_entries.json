Rather than explaining how to do this, I would really just love to have a comprehensive guide to it, but I guess people are free to just explain. How do people learn how to do this stuff? Some information I&#39;m seeing is that VPNs are just bogus and not a surefire way to anonymize everything. You definitely need to actually block internet communication for some software, and my plan is to use a firewall like Glasswire but I just do not want to mess this up.
