        "description": "The Google Pixel 10 price in India is set at Rs. 79,999, marking the entry point for the new Pixels this year.

Yes, there are some downsides, such as an underwhelming processor, which can be frustrating when trying to game on the device. But if you're someone who doesn't game at all, then the Pixel 10 shouldn't disappoint you. Read our full review here.",
