I\u2019m not a fan of the AI elements, but am trying to get a better understanding of the transcription process to see if there\u2019s a middle ground for the team to work through.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Weary_Egg_1783\"> /u/Weary_Egg_1783 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1ni384a/experience_with_granolaai/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1ni384a/experience_with_granolaai/\">[comments]</a></span>",
