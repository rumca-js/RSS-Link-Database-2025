I&#39;ve deconstructed and made write-ups for a few keyloggers and trojans, nothing too crazy just yet. I could definitely see myself pivoting later in my career and specializing in this and had a few questions for anyone that can answer them.</p> <p>A little background info:<br/> I just graduated with my B.S. in Cybersecurity and have a few entry level certs under my belt. In my free time I like to do CTFs and use platforms like THM, HTB, and CyberDefenders, the latter one is where I normally work through malware labs. I&#39;m only 20 so I don&#39;t have any real-job experience yet, but hopefully that changes soon. I can&#39;t imagine any companies would be looking to hire such minimal experience for a malware analyst / researcher role, so my plan right now is to get a few years of analyst experience and continue learning abo",
