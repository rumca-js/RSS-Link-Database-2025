If anyone\u2019s working on a project that could use some design, I\u2019d be excited to chat and see where it goes.</p> <p>feel free to DM me or email me at [<a href=\"mailto:yaserbustati@gmail.com\">yaserbustati@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:yaserbustati@gmail.com\">yaserbustati@gmail.com</a>) if you prefer<br/> thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/yastara\"> /u/yastara </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource",
