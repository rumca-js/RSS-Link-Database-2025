        "description": "Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji reviewed on PC by Jarrett Green. Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.\n\n\"Assassin's Creed Shadows brought some much needed promise and energy that the series was lacking, and the Claws of Awaji expansion doesn\u2019t really move that needle much in either direction. Its forgettable story and lack of new interesting side distractions don\u2019t detract from how fun it is to ride through the tumultuous badlands of the region using brute force and subterfuge to take down yet another dark cabal of evil doers. But it doesn\u2019t make the strong case for the necessity of any more epilogues, either.\"",
