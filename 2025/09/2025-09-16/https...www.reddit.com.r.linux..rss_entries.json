I recently upgraded to a GT 730 so that she can start gaming on her machine, but altho its better than the IGPU, a coffee lake UHD 610, it was still very weak and could only run old games on sub 30fps. I bought a 550ti yesterday, so that she can start playing with better perfomance, but i cant get the drivers to work. Tried installing the 390 a few times in a couple different ways, but it doesn&#39;t work. \u200bAny tips on getting it to work? Anything too complicated might not do im a noob and i get easily confused. \u200bAlso bought a 1070, but that will only arrive in a couple of weeks. Perks of living in a third world country... \u200bIf i cant get it to run, might just go back to the 730 and send the 550ti back. but hopefully, hopefully we can get it to work. \u200bThanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/leondedalos\"> /u/leondedal",
