I&#39;ve been overwhelmed with so many emotions about it, and I&#39;ve felt compelled to tell you, or the world, or whoever would listen - how much you mean to me. I&#39;ve been saddened, but I also feel a certain level of gratitude that you&#39;re going to allow us all to say good bye to you. And in this moment, I want to say good bye, in this way, and I invite other to as well. I hope somehow this gets to you. </p> <p>I&#39;m typing this on my phone while I sit on the foot of my oldest sons bed. I just finished reading him Moose! I&#39;ve read it so many times you&#39;d think I&#39;d have it memorized, but I tripped up a few times - he noticed. </p> <p>My favorite book to read to my boys has always been Hugs - I get to squeeze them, and tickle them, and slobber all over them. </p> <p>My middle loves to read about Mortimer. He loves going to bed first, because we can sing at the top of our lungs. </p> <p>Someti",
