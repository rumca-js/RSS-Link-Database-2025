I love the IP (well, the first 3 books at least) and really enjoyed the game, but always had some difficulty tabling it because the first couple times someone plays it there&#39;s just so damn much text. Then I picked up FR Deluxe at a game swap for $10 (it&#39;s $35 brand new from Wiz Kids and is excellent, very high value for money). And I haven&#39;t tabled RR a single time since playing FR. I think I&#39;m gonna end up selling RR since I can&#39;t see busting it out more than once or twice a year, and I&#39;d be just as happy playing FR instead. </p> <p>Wonderland&#39;s War + Quacks &gt; Orleans<br/> - I realize this is blasphemy.

Our students love to play a card game from the 70&#39;s called Into the Forest. It is an animal food chain game. The game itself has not been made in many years and there are only a few for sale on Ebay/Etsy. We ordered a &quot;new&quot; set of cards. I scanned them, cleaned them up in Photoshop, and saved them in a file so we can play for many years with the students! I did some research on the artist who made the paintings for the cards and looked up the company that distributed it. The artwork is beautiful and I was hoping to preserve it since it is out of production. </p> <",
