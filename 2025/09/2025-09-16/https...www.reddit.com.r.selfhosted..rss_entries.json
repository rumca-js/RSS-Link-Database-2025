I\u2019d like some advice on security. All containers run on the Pi and are accessible only via Tailscale, with no ports exposed to the Internet. I have Portainer and Watchtower, both of which mount /var/run/docker.sock, and some other containers like Navidrome and Immich which don\u2019t use the socket. Watchtower automatically updates most of the containers.</p> <p>My main questions are: in a LAN/Tailscale-only scenario, how real is the risk related to docker.sock? Is it safe to let Watchtower automatically update sensitive containers like Portainer, or should I handle those manually?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any advice!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nick3nder\"> /u/Nick3nder </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nikbp4/docker_security_on_raspberry_pi_with_",

Lately the TR-004 is acting up and seems to shutdown for no apparent reason (green status light blinking but drive LED&#39;s are off) which causes me to power cycle the device and reconnect. There is no notification in QTS whatsoever that the device or drives have failed and SMART values show that the drives are healthy.
