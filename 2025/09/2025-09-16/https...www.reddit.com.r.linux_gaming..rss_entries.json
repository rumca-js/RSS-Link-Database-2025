It is recognized, jstest also passed just fine and I installed oversteer where I was able to choose the wheel and basically set some stuff there. Then I opened Assetto Corsa (through Content Manager) and set up the wheel which also worked, but every time I start a track the force feedback is so high my entire desk literally shakes (the wheel is moving on its own) and I need to alt tab to oversteer and just tap the slider (I have it set to 20 but I guess the game doesn&#39;t recognize it at first). Another problem that I have - the force feedback feels really weird. Picked up a drift car and there is basically no countersteering on the wheel. It just recenters and that&#39;s it. Basically no other software installed just what I said above. Is there anybody that got the wheel to work?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",

I recently upgraded to a GT 730 so that she can start gaming on her machine, but altho its better than the IGPU, a coffee lake UHD 610, it was still very weak and could only run old games on sub 30fps. I bought a 550ti yesterday, so that she can start playing with better perfomance, but i cant get the drivers to work. Tried installing the 390 a few times in a couple different ways, but it doesn&#39;t work. Any tips on getting it to work? Anything too complicated might not do im a noob and i get easily confused. Also bought a 1070, but that will only arrive in a couple of weeks. Perks of living in a third world country... If i cant get it to run, might just go back to the 730 and send the 550ti back. but hopefully, hopefully we can get it to work.

I figured I&#39;d share a little tip with any of those who don&#39;t know.</p> <p>You can use gamescope to make any content into &quot;HDR&quot;. In my honest opinion. It&#39;s better than any game implementation, and works on movies/videos as well. All you have to do is use the inverse tonemapping options in gamescope like so:</p> <p>``` gamescope -W 2560 -H 1440 -f --hdr-enabled --force-grab-cursor --hdr-itm-enabled --hdr-itm-sdr-nits 203 --hdr-sdr-content-nits 203 --hdr-itm-target-nits 1120 -- %command%```</p> <p>Just change the 1120 to whatever your monitor&#39;s capabilities are and resolution too!</p> <p>I believe both -hdr-itm-sdr-nits --hdr-sdr-content-nits should be 203 for best results, but I could be wrong. Just make sure to run your kde hdr calibration tool first.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Arazadaz\"> /",

Two: They do work when I launch them through the application launcher that appears but it disappears so quickly I can&#39;t launch any games most of the times and sometimes it just shows no applications. Three: The launcher does not pick up any non-steam games.

It was not trivial, as I am using Debian 13 and had to use a new mesa driver that I installed to /opt. But now it is working with a small wrapper.</p> <p>But before tinkering, my Cloud saves worked and it is hard to find information about that topic, as most of the information point to the GalaxyClient. But I know for sure, that the feature worked before without having to start the full Client in the background.</p> <p>ChatGPT told me, that Cyberpunk may use some dlls to do cloud sync and does not rely on the running client. But I dont know, if it is hallucinating.
