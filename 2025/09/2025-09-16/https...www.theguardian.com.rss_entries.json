When fireworks were lit in Paris to celebrate the Austrian princess\u2019s marriage to the dauphin of France, a conflagration ensued, the crowd stampeded and more than 130 people were killed \u2013 although rumour put the number much higher. From the start, it seemed she was destined to be hated by the French people and blamed for sufferings she didn\u2019t even know existed.</p><p>By the time the French Revolution had begun in 1789, Antoinette was demonised not only as a lavish spender but a rampant sex addict who cuckolded the king. Illustrations from 1790s pornographic booklets in the V&amp;A\u2019s epic show graphically depict her making love to a guard and to one of her ladies in waiting. By the time you get to these libel",
