        "description": "A United Nations commission of inquiry has said that Israel has committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nA new report says there are reasonable grounds to conclude that four of the five genocidal acts defined under international law have been carried out since the start of the war with Hamas in 2023. Israel's foreign ministry said it categorically rejected the report, denouncing it as \"distorted and false\". Adam is joined by John Simpson - BBC World Affairs Editor and Presenter of Unspun World.\n\nAnd, an emergency debate has been held in the House of Commons into the appointment of Lord Mandelson as the UK Ambassador to the US. Adam, Chris and Alex discuss that and whether we are about to see a change of messaging from number 10 to ahead of the party conference.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #Israel #Gaza #Trump",
