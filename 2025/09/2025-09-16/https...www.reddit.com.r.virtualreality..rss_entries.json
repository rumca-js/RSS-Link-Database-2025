Vd performance was stuttering so because I was not in the same room with router but was with pc I just wired into pc. Better all around accept the tethered feeling. Fast forward a couple years and after playing atomic heart in uevr with a profile and beating the game I was like wow. So I thought let&#39;s try outer worlds in uevr and that profile asked for dll permissions and it seems to have affected steam vr, not really sure. So now my cable keeps disconnecting and vd is still to stutter, even right next to router. New cable coming to see if that fixes it. Anybody else having constant cable disconnecting and reconnecting? Software up to date on everything. Uninstalled steam and oculus and reinstalled.

I used to game online with cod and made some good mates and enjoyed having something to do every evening chatting to them. I\u2019ve heard about the VR.. that you can socialise with people on chat and make friends. Am I too old for this? Is it a good way to socialise with people? I\u2019m new to the VR world so not sure how it works. I like the meditation apps etc they do so all of that ticks for me.. but also saw they did VR chats where you can make friends from around the world. I won\u2019t be getting it till Xmas but want some advice. Is it easy to use? Can you get the hang of it quick? Do I need a mic? Is it good for making friends? Is it good for relaxing on certain apps? Any advice would be amazing.

I&#39;d also like to get gloves too! </p> <p>Hopefully someone has some advice!

(I mainly want it for visual quality, some fairly good controller tracking too obviously and to use it mostly or only connected to a pc, don&#39;t need any standalone bs platform, so if it only works with a pc that&#39;s not an issue) My budget is an issue and I can&#39;t really spend that much. A friend of mine got the meta quest 3 and honestly seems pretty good, but here the only price I can find it for is around \u20ac580, which I find unacceptable since I&#39;ve personally seen (not available anymore) the quest 3 128gb for 400\u20ac. </p> <p>The used market isn&#39;t any better and most are selling them for like 100\u20ac cheaper than new, which is a pretty bad price (less than 20% discount for an used product).</p> <p>Are there any other go",
