This could lead to elevation of privileges, data corruption, data leakage, and in breaking memory isolation in virtual environments.</p> <p>After more than a decade of known Rowhammer attacks targeting CPUs and CPU-based memory, a group of University of Toronto researchers this year demonstrated that such attacks are possible and practical against GPUs as well.</p> <p>More details are inside the link.</p> <p>September 16, 2025</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",
