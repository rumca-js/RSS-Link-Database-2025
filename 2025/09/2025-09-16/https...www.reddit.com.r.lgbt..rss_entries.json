It&#39;s like I live in the most annoying possible proselytizing intersection of a Venn diagram. I&#39;m know some of y&#39;all go through way worse stuff than this on a daily basis, so I empathize with you there. But as far as I can tell this bombardment of fliers, books, pamphlets (and even gospel music CDs!) is not against any laws here and I&#39;m just getting so frustrated because I want this to stop.</p> <p>For reference, I live in Canada. Has anyone had any experience with this and know a good actionable way to put it to a stop? Any results from trying various methods?
