Would have been a more vertical design with the screen on top and controls on the bottom.<br/> It was about this bee that you would send around the screen jumping about, dodging projectiles and then stinging the enemies. Kinda looked like the Cheerios Bee, but edgier. I think there was a boss at the end of each stage, I think one was a Cobra or some other form of snake.
