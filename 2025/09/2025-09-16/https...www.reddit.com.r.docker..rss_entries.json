Prepare yourselves for possibly a stupid question, but not sure how else to ask it. </p> <p>I have been running Unraid and using docker on it for a couple of years now. Unraid is amazing and has helped me do a little bit of selfhosting/home labbing as a hobby and save me and my family some money in the process. The only bad part about Unraid and Docker is that it&#39;s kind of Docker on easy mode. I have troubleshot plenty of things on it, but I can&#39;t help but feel like I don&#39;t really understand docker like I would with Docker compose or similar. </p> <p>This brings me to my actual question.
