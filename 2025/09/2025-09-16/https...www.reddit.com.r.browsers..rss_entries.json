Used Brave and did not care for it as well as had performance issues when having it on my second monitor with a game open. Also used OperaGX but also not very good either. Would like to stay on chromium based as it&#39;s natural for me and there&#39;s things that chromium can do that firefox cannot. Privacy isn&#39;t the biggest concern of mine but I also wouldn&#39;t mind it either. want something that&#39;ll run well and doesn&#39;t scrub for every detail of info</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PostHikeClarity\"> /u/PostHikeClarity </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1ni4fqr/browser_recommendation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1ni4fqr/browser_recommendation/\">[comments]<",

I&#39;m personally especially happy with the color blending for the background :) Folders are up next on our agenda haha. This doesn&#39;t show most of what we&#39;ve been working on, but it gives a good idea of where things are at UI-wise!</p> <p>Really happy with where things are at!! We&#39;ll be releasing an alpha to the discord in the next couple months! We&#39;re easily the farthest along of the webkit browsers I&#39;ve seen but I want to make sure things are in good shape before we bring anyone on board. You&#39;re welcome to build yourself and contribute code--we really need contributors!!</p> <p>You can star our repo and join the discord over at <a href=\"https://github.com/nook-browser/Nook\">https://github.com/nook-browser/Nook</a> !</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",
