After it finishes you receive a message in the terminal and it&#39;s added to the db. You can also view the statistics and pause the task. It helps me focusing and take short breaks between changing repos or tools.</p> <p>If anyone wants to use it: <a href=\"https://github.com/arushdesp/pomo-cli\">https://github.com/arushdesp/pomo-cli</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EdmondVDantes\"> /u/EdmondVDantes </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"h",

Here&#39;s what I tried and my honest review:</p> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://Rork.com\">Rork.com</a> - I was sceptical, but it became a revelation for me. The best AI no-code app builder for native mobile apps in 2025. Way faster than I expected. All the technical stuff like APIs worked without me having to fix anything. Getting ready for app store submission. The previews loads fast and doesn&#39;t break unlike other tools that I tried. The code belongs to you -that&#39;s rare these days lol (read below). I think <a href=\"http://rork.com\">Rork</a> is also best app builder for beginers or non-tech people</li> <li><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code\">Claude Code</a> - my biggest love. Thanks God it exists. It&#39;s a bit harder to get started than with Rork or Replit, but it&#39;s totally doable - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=",
