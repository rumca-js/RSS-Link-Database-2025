They don&#39;t have to be similar story or anything, just in the way of formatting.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just finished \u201cThe Will of Many\u201d and, wow, loved it. One of the better fantasy reads I\u2019ve stumbled into in a long while. Sure, the main guy\u2019s a bit too good at everything\u2014like, come on, save some flaws for the rest of us\u2014but I still found myself rooting for him, grinning like a fool at his victories. That\u2019s maybe a petty complaint, because honestly the book had me hooked. Now I\u2019m cooling my heels, waiting for Book Two, so I picked up the Licanius Trilogy. And\u2026 eh. Harder to get into. Doesn\u2019t have the same rich storytelling, the same snap of life and momentum that the Hierarchy book had. You can tell the author\u2019s grown in the time between series (like, there\u2019s a gear that only clicks later in a writer\u2019s career, and here you can actually hear it engaging). Still, I\u2019m going to soldier on through this first book, if only to keep myself busy while I wait for the next Hierarchy installment to land.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",
