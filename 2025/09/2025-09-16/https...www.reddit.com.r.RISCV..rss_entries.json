So Turns out apple moved away from ARM64 to a custom RISC-V core in it secondary coprocessor in the A19 series, AVE&#39;s primary coprocessor on Apple A19 is still arm64, but it also has RISC-V 32-bit secondary coprocessors</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Richardmilier\"> /u/Richardmilier </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1nil2ht/apple_is_now_using_riscv_in_it_a19_pro_encoder/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1nil2ht/apple_is_now_using_riscv_in_it_a19_pro_encoder/\">[comments]</a></span>",
