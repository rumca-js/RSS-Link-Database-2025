        "description": "Schluter shower linear tray tips\u2026I cut the slot from the tray that corresponds to the linear drain length. Every tray has the linear drain product number marked on the back to make this easier. Since I\u2019m using the adaptor kit, I also used 1 inch compensation board under the tray. The linear drain slides into the adaptor and sits flush with the shower tray. Many thanks to Schluter for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#showerremodel #schlutersystems #homerepairtutor #bathroomremodel #brandpartner",
