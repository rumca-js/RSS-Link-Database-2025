While this is a very small update, the patch notes include a few notable bug fixes and changes to Season 5's Deadline limited-time mode.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Season 5 Reloaded added the new Deadline limited-time mode, and now the new update makes a few improvements to the match rules. Circles two, three, and four are now extended by 30 seconds each. The developer says this change was made to allow players \"extra time to coordinate and rack up points,\" while also slowing down the gas to provide players with more breathing room.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Deadline's respawn timers are reduced by five seconds, which lets players jump back into the action faster. Additionally, the mode's \"Round End\" warning will now show 60 seconds from the end instead of the original 30-second warning.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-patch-notes-detail-b",
