By blocking a key liver enzyme, the drug reduces fat and inflammation, halting the root causes of liver damage. In a year-long clinical trial, patients showed major improvements without serious side effects, offering hope to millions affected worldwide.",

A rock sample called \u201cSapphire Canyon,\u201d taken from the Bright Angel formation in Jezero Crater, shows unusual mineral patterns known as \u201cleopard spots\u201d that may have formed through microbial activity. While non-biological processes could also explain the find, scientists say the chemical fingerprints look strikingly similar to those left behind by microbes on Earth.",
