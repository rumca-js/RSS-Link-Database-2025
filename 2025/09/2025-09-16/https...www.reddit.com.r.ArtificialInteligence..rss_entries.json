I went with the \u201cBuild Chat Agent\u201d option and selected the Mistral Large (24.02) model. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people talk about using Llama 3 instead, and I\u2019m not really sure if there\u2019s a reason I should have picked that instead of Mistral.</p> <p>I also set up a knowledge base and added a guardrail. I tried to write a good system prompt, but the results weren\u2019t great. The chat box wasn\u2019t really picking up the connections it was supposed to, and I know part of that is probably down to the data (knowledge base) I gave it. I get that a model is only as good as the data you feed it, but I want to figure out how to improve things from here.</p> <p>So I wanted to ask: \u2022How can I actually test the accuracy or performance of my chat agent in a meaningful way? \u2022Are there ways to make the knowledge base link up better with the model? \u2022Any good resources or books you\u2019d recommend",
