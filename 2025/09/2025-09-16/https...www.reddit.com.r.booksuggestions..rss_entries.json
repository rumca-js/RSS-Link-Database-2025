I would like if the novel had a strong sense of romance that is threatened by the science fiction aspect. I really enjoy a tragic love story. The reading experience that prompted this ask was 11/22/63 by Stephen King(extremely strong romance, science fiction, thriller, etc). I am also obsessed with Severance on Apple TV(average people affected by science fiction product, subtle yet powerful romance, very human). I would prefer it not be a series of books, however I would enjoy a long book I could spend a lot of time with. I would like if there was a good audio book performance, as I tend to save my physical reading for more contemporary works. I have already listened to Project Hail Mary!

I spent most my life having a passion for film/television, specifically the cartoon industry since that&#39;s where I&#39;ve always wanted to eventually find a career. But I regret not having read more books so I&#39;m trying to rectify that now. Down below are some of my favorite TV Shows and books to hopefully see if I can&#39;t find something perfect for me. Thanks!</p> <p>Favorite Books: My favorite so far has been Tress of the Emerald Sea. I adored that book so much that I was a little disappointed when reading Mistborn. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I also liked Mistborn quite a lot but it didn&#39;t make me smile the way Tress did. After that, I began reading Dungeon Crawler Carl, which though really funny, I could use a break from. That&#39;s...sadly it for books I&#39;ve read. Lol. I know, it&#39;s sad.</p> <p>Favorite TV: Avatar the last Airbender is tied with Steven Universe as my fav",

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s necessarily anything wrong with this trope per se, but it&#39;s been done so many times that it&#39;s just annoying when it happens now. It&#39;s too often that female protagonists in sci-fi and fantasy feel the need to cut their hair super short or let go of feminine clothing in order to appear strong and powerful. Femininity can be strong and powerful too.

Ok, it\u2019s not a bad read, but it\u2019s definitely not a masterpiece. This is a second \u201cmeh\u201d book I\u2019ve read that was overly praised on <a href=\"/r/suggestmeabook\">r/suggestmeabook</a> (first one was Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow) and I am kind of hesitant of starting Hello beautiful, because I don\u2019t want to spend time on another \u201cbestseller\u201d that is just ok to read, but nothing else. My recent readings were: 1. Count of monte cristo - it\u2019s a masterpiece, but it shows that Dumas was payed by a word. 2. The Road - again, it\u2019s a good read, but I was expecting soul wrenching ending, but was left with a happy ending (in a way). Not bad, but didn\u2019t get what I was looking for. 3. Rebecca - I was asking for romans similar to Wuthering Heights with mmc like Heathcliff, but Rebecca didn\u2019t hit the spot. It\u2019s a great book, but WH is my ultimate favourite 4. Proj",

So many sci-fi books get caught up in the gadgets or the world-building, and making the tech the central vector in which all the story is about. but this one is different.

I tend to forget non-fiction not long after I&#39;ve read it and most fiction hasn&#39;t really wowed me in a while. Keen to hear your suggestions! I usually read authors like Haruki Murakami, Donna Tartt, Hanya Yanagihara, Philip K Dick, Bret Easton Ellis, Herman Hesse (to name a few). I&#39;m considering diving into nassim taleb and Thomas Sowell (basic economics) but I don&#39;t know how helpful that will be. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Acceptable-Honey-613\"> /u/Acceptable-Honey-613 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1niafw9/suggestions_most_helpful_nonfiction_and_most/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1niafw9/suggestions_most_helpful_nonfiction_and_most/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The rage of being born a woman in patriarchy, the rage of experiencing colorism and racism from her people, and the rage of being a victim of genoide. Im looking for a book series and mc similar to that idea, but center it around queerness.

Despite this, I love videogames where you can romance party members. It&#39;s just that straight romance makes me roll my eyes, as does anything contrived or most love triangles (only Casablanca pulls it off). </p> <p>So this might be cringe, but here&#39;s my favorite movies so it might help color in what all I enjoy: Big Fish, Howl&#39;s Moveing Castle, Casablanca and Australia. I know sme of these are based on books and I am still looking for them uses. I read manga but so far I haven&#39;t found any of the romances in them that compelling (besides Bulma and Vegeta from DragonBall and I don&#39;t even watch it). I enjoyed Ah my Goddess but it goes on for a little too long for it to really totally land for me. I hate kicking around the bush and I want more realistic emotions and movies from characters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",
