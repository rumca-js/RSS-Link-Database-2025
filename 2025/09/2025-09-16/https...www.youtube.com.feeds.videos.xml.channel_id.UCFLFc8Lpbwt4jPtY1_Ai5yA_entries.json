They argue over \u201cpermission\u201d that may never have been granted, the infamous subwoofer, Shadow streaming, and whether certain builds should have even been allowed. The crew also looks back on past seasons, past disqualifications, and what rules need to change before the next competition.\n\nWatch the full WAN Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcIbqUHzx7M\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners",

Linus and Luke discuss the decade-long gap between Tesla\u2019s marketing and reality, Musk\u2019s constant overpromises, and whether regulators or class actions will hold the company accountable. They also dive into the hype around Optimus and why the robot program looks like smoke and mirrors.\n\nWatch the full WAN Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcIbqUHzx7M\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners",

Linus jumps in with his own chaotic travel stories, from near-missed flights to paying $1,200 last-minute for a seat home. Linus and Luke discuss the misery (and occasional comedy) of travel gone wrong.\n\nWatch the full WAN Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcIbqUHzx7M\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners",
