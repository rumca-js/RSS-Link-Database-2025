Kind of like recycling bad data instead of tossing it out.</p> <p>At the same time, there\u2019s more pressure for AI content to be watermarked or labeled so people can tell what\u2019s real vs. generated. And on the fun/crazy side, AI edits (like those viral saree/Ghibli style photos) are blowing up, but also freaking people out because they look <em>too real</em>.</p> <p>So it got me thinking:</p> <ul> <li>Is it smarter to clean/refine the messy data we already have, or focus on finding fresh, \u201cpure\u201d data?</li> <li>Are we just hiding problems by rewriting data instead of admitting it\u2019s bad?<",

It covers methods across video, images, audio, text, and even real-time streams, from CNNs and RNNs to GAN fingerprinting, multimodal audio-visual checks, and biometric cues. It also compares datasets (FaceForensics++, DFDC, Celeb-DF, etc.) and detection tools like XceptionNet, MesoNet, and FakeCatcher, giving a consolidated overview of where detection stands today.</p> <p>One striking case included: in 2023, scammers in Hong Kong used deepfake video + audio to impersonate a CFO on a live video call, convincing an employee to transfer $39 million.

If it&#39;s mostly young people using AI and most young people don&#39;t use proper grammar and syntax, is it possible that the power burden of AI is being artificially boosted by wasted inference processing? I didn&#39;t want to lead it to the topic of processing and power burden. I wanted to see if it would get there on its own.</p> <p>Me: &quot;Actually, I&#39;m curious about another aspect of your neural network. Do you find the pathways easier to traverse when the input is written in proper English with correct spelling and punctuation, or do you prefer the short-hand so commonly used by America&#39;s youth? I&#39;d imagine the proper format results in better responses due to increased information providing more context to pick up on, but are the pathways more fluid f",
