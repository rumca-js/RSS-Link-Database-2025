Save 40% on the Ground News unlimited access Vantage plan with my link. Why are the world's most efficient solar panels learning to sweat? Solar panels hate being hot. For every single degree the temperature rises, panels lose up to half a percent of their solar efficiency. That can mean an 18% performance drop! But scientists have figured it out how to make solar panels that can effectively sweat using hydrogels, and the results are staggering. One application of hydrogel allows for both efficiency boosts and extended lifespans, no moving parts required.  How is this possible? And is this breakthrough ready for your rooftop?\n\nWatch Why Mushrooms are Starting to Replace Everything https://youtu.be/jI2LC3WTryw?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/how-hydrogel-can-doub",
