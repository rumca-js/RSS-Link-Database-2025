So by their logic that someone in the same-sex relationship is gay if they were to leave that relationship and enter a street sex relationship all of a sudden they&#39;re not gay anymore they are actually straight but then if they leave that relationship and re-enter a same-sex relationship magically they aren&#39;t straight anymore they are actually gay and the same thing with opposite sex relationships. Another question to ask these people is what you call someone who&#39;s both attracted to men and women because you can&#39;t be gay and straight at the same time</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Im posting this because i feel like there has been a huge wave of homophobia/transphobia and ableism nowadays on tiktok. I remember in 2020-2022 this app used to be one of the best apps for users no matter if they were gay or transgender. I feel sad that i had to uninstall tiktok because i just cant stand these comments. I do realize that i can just stop looking at comments, but i feel like comments should be monitored so all users feel safe and respected, and everyone can read them. I sometimes wanna read nice things and then boom.. a random death threat to gay or trans people, its not okay. I hope in the future social media companies will monitor their apps/sites better, because tiktok isn&#39;t the only one.I feel like im not the only one seeing this am i, like a post containing a pride flag of whatever kind, or a person dressed differently and the comments are horrible. Does someone else miss 2020 tiktok, when people used to be sweet and accepting",
