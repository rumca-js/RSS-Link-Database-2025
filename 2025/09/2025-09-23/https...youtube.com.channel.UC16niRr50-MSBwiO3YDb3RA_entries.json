        "description": "Donald Trump has urged pregnant women not to take the painkiller paracetamol - known as Tylenol in the US - because of an unproven link to autism.\n \nThe US president said that doctors will soon be advised not to prescribe it, and that pregnant women should \"fight like hell\" to only take it in cases of extreme fever.\n \nMedical experts have strongly pushed back on the claims, with some calling the president's comments dangerous.\n \nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists disputed the link made by Trump in the Oval Office, saying the claim \"is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children\".\n \nHealth officials in the UK have stressed that paracetamol remains the safest painkiller available to pregnant women.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Healthcare #Medicine #BBCNews",
