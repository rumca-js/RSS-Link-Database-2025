I have never read a fantasy novel but I really want to.</p> <p>I love worldbuilding, grim dark themes and just overall dark fantasy themes. Like I love Warhammer related media but couldn&#39;t really get into the novels, I guess its because the lore of WH is all over the place and there isn&#39;t a clear order.<br/> If you could recommend something that&#39;s easy to get into I would appreciate it.<br/> My biggest vice is needless philosophical terms and thoughts, idk what&#39;s the correct term for that stuff but it immediately turns me off any form of media.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For anyone that doesn\u2019t know what One Piece is, it\u2019s an Adventure/Battle Shonen manga that has been going on for 28 years written by Eiichiro Oda who\u2019s the richest mangaka in Japan. It is also the best selling manga of all time and a lot of fans view it as the modern day Odyssey. It has strong elements, themes, world building and storytelling that has resonated with a lot of fantasy book reviewers that are hardly manga fans, which is why I decided to post it in this sub. What are your honest thoughts on One Piece and if you do like the series, where does it rank among your Top 10 fantasy series? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KingsofMecha\"> /u/KingsofMecha </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1no9ch1/what_is_this_subs_opinion_on_one_piece/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1no9ch1/what_is_this_subs_opinion_on_one_piec",
