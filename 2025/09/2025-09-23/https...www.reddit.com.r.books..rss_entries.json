        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Wow. This book. Just wow. Boy&#39;s Life is one of the most magnificent books I&#39;ve ever read, and might be the best book I&#39;ve read this year. McCammon has written a masterpiece that should stand next to the best coming of age books ever written. Heck, in my opinion, this is a book that could be read in literature classes because of the depth it has with its themes. Boy&#39;s Life is a beautiful book, oftentimes bizarre, but magical the entire time. About 30 pages into the book, I already had the feeling that this one was going to be special, and the book proved me correct. Boy&#39;s Life pulls elements from a lot of different places: it has elements of southern gothic like Flannery O&#39;Connor, coming of age themes and concepts of race and human dignity like in To Kill A Mockingbird, and also moments of horror similar to Stephen King. One of my favorite parts about this book was this overwhelming sense of nostalgia and childhood that suffuses",

Okay so the book is very much marketed as being focused on the women the serial killer affected. This\u2026is not true. There are four different viewpoints. The serial killer\u2019s mom, his wife\u2019s sister, a girl he met in his childhood, and naturally, his. Impressively, they all revolve around the serial killer! The irony lies in the fact that the book has FOUR women\u2019s POVs and a single man\u2019s. A book is usually about the guy who shows up the most often and obviously that\u2019s the serial killer the book definitely isn\u2019t about\u2014-I just found that vaguely amusing. Either it\u2019s a marketing error or the author is in denial. Also",
