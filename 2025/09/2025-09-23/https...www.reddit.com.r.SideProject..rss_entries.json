It\u2019s easier than ever to get an MVP off the ground.</p> <p>But the <em>last 10%</em> is still the hardest: making it secure, scalable, and truly production-ready.

I&#39;ve noticed a common problem for creators, students, and freelancers: you have an idea, a project you want to work on, but finding someone to actually collaborate with is harder than it should be. You might end up stuck, or your idea never gets off the ground.</p> <p>That&#39;s exactly what a few of us ran into when we were trying to launch projects ourselves. After some trial and error, we realized that the biggest bottleneck isn&#39;t motivation or ideas ..it&#39;s finding the right collaborator at the right time.</p> <p>So we started exploring ways to make collaboration easier and faster. We built a platform where creatorscan post their projects and connect with others who want to collaborate on real work. The focus is simple: connect, collaborate, create.</p> <p>I&#39;m curious to know: How do you currently find collaborators for your projects? What&#39;s the hardest part about working with others online?</p> <p>Would love to h",
