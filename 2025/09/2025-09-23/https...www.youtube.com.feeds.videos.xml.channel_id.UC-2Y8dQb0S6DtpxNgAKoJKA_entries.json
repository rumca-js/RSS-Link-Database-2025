        "description": "Looking for a change of pace? Come to Nova City! Play as the new captain of a special task force and interact with a charming (and eccentric) cast of characters as you build a team all your own.\n\nDrop into all sorts of thrilling roles while playing as different team members such as the department head, a well-to-do elite, and a hacker. Carry out missions for varying organizations like the NCAA, DK9, Cat Express and more. However, never forget that the name of the game is bolstering your team, not your own reputation.\n\nIn this world jam-packed with off-kilter characters, everyone has their own way of getting by. As for you, you have a secret weapon: Social media. You wanna achieve your goals? Then first you'll have to become an internet sensation and save the world!\n\n#ps5 #ps5games",
