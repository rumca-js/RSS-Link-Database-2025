Right now the official, first-party Steam store is selling the base model Steam Deck for $80 off, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck\">bringing its price down to just $319.20</a>. This is not a used or refurbished unit; this a new, base Steam Deck, no tricks, no punches pulled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\u2019s a great freakin\u2019 price to get in on the portable PC fun, even three years after the device launched. You can\u2019t really find any of the Windows-based alternatives for under $500, and even then you need to hunt for rare sales or refurb hardware. Considering how pricey the Switch 2 is looking, not to mention other consoles that continue to go up in price as US consumers take a beating under tariffs, it\u2019s a refreshing change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, the upgraded OLED model of the Steam Deck, with its bigger, br",

Even better, it has a built-in USB-C cable that doubles as a carrying strap, which is super handy if you take it to a concert, for example. It measures just 3.47 x 2.35 x 1.06 inches, yet still fits a tiny LED display showing remaining battery and charging power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of which, this Baseus Picogo model can deliver up to 45W charging via the USB-C",
