        "description": "Baby Steps reviewed by Travis Northup on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5.\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t expecting one of my favorite games of 2025 to be about a socially awkward blob in a stained onesie with such poor motor skills that he ragdolls to the ground on the slightest of uneven surfaces, but here we are. Baby Steps is a triumphantly quirky physics game that asks you to challenge yourself, both with alluring hiking obstacles that had me screaming to the heavens and a shockingly unconventional story and characters that ended up feeling like family by the end. Despite centering itself around intentionally awkward controls, it has a deceptive level of depth that made me eager to master it, and I got incredibly lost in the sauce as I tried to best its most daunting challenges. If you like a good laugh, extreme difficulty, or just hate yourself, then I can\u2019t recommend Baby Steps enough.\"",
