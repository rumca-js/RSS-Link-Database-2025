I have a few now and none of them are left out when I play ... But the stand out for me is Abyss and the Leviathan expansion.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>How repayable is Massive Darkness 2? Looks like after you do the scenarios it would be pretty much the same each additional replay. Sure, there are different classes but the game is pretty much just fighting monsters over and over. Seems like no exploration or adventure elements. I think of Clank Catacombs as a comparison for small dungeon game but with Clank, the tiles and exploration can always change plus there is a large deck with a lot of different combos and enemies to fight. So far, seems to me like MD 2 is like almost perfect for having a small dungeon adventure, but the problem is it is too small and repetitive. Is that correct? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Safe873\"> /u/Safe873 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1noe3c0/how_repayable_is_massive_darkness_2_base_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments",

The deck we have is starting to show lots of wear so I&#39;ve been looking to see if there&#39;s an all plastic or a coated version out there. There are different variations I can find online but none of them really say what material the cards are. I&#39;ve thought about adding some covers but that would jam up the shuffler we use. Any pointers? Anyone come across any plastic variants of Phase 10? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Notabot1313\"> /u/Notabot1313 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1no2udv/plastic_or_coated_phase_10_cards/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1no2udv/plastic_or_coated_phase_10_cards/\">[comments]</a></span>",
