Biggest change is multi-server support with an agent system, so you can control all your tunnels from one spot. Especially handy if you\u2019re stuck behind CGNAT at home. It\u2019s fully open source and free to use. DockFlare now runs fully as non-root and uses a Docker proxy for better security. Backup &amp; restore got a big upgrade too, plus setup is smoother than ever. Agent\u2019s still beta, but makes remote Docker a breeze. </p> <p>Thank you and cheers from Switzerland<br/> Check out more details if you\u2019re curious:<br/> <a href=\"https://github.com/ChrispyBacon-dev/DockFlare/releases/tag/v3.0\">https://github.com/ChrispyBacon-dev/DockFlare/releases/tag/v3.0</a><br/> <a href=\"https://dockflare.app/architecture\">https://dockflare.app/architecture</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChopSueyYumm\"> /u/ChopSueyYumm </a> <br/> <span><a href=",
