Just something that tackles humanity&#39;s depictions of evil throughout history and maybe even what it says about us psychologically or about the world itself. If you have something in mind that doesn&#39;t exactly fit this description but still has some of the same essence you can feel free to suggest away!</p> <p>I&#39;m currently reading On Evil by Terry Eagleton and plan on getting to Pagel&#39;s origin of Satan and Marie-Louise von Franz&#39; Shadow and Evil in Fairy Tales. These aren&#39;t exactly what I was lookin for but still close enough </p> <p>This isn&#39;t too important but if it helps to know what kind of villains I love look no further than some of my favorite stories:</p> <ol> <li>Dracula/Nosferatu (multiple adaptations)</li> <li>The Call of Cthulhu and Color Out of Space </li> <li>IT ",

Personally, I felt it added humanity to Adso, but also highlighted the cost of the monastic vows he eventually reaffirms.

I read a lot of books about vampires when I was a kid (honestly can\u2019t even remember which books I read though lol) and I want to get more into the genre. I recently read A Southern Book Club\u2019s Guide to Slaying Vampires by Grady Hendrix and I really liked it! I think I gave it like a 3.9/5. I honestly just don\u2019t know which direction to go in though. I\u2019m not a fantasy/romance person so I\u2019m inclined to avoid those genres, but I\u2019m not like 100% opposed to it. I guess I\u2019m looking for something that\u2019s cozy/comforting/nostalgic in a way? Like Hendrix\u2019s book felt nostalgic (mostly because I\u2019m from the South lol). But im also open to like more horror leaning vampire books. I\u2019m not opposed to being really, really scared. I\u2019m also really into vampire movies from the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s so maybe books with that vibe too? Idk, just anything vampire related you c",
