I&#39;m trying to deploy a simple project on a local ubuntu server VM using docker. I have three containers, Postgres, nginx and Django. I used a lot of HTMX and DaisyUI, and on my dev environment they worked really nicely being served by a Bun dev server and using django-vite, now that I&#39;m deploying, everything works perfectly fine, except for the static assets generated by django-vite. The weirdest part is the files are being delivered to the clients but not loading correctly (the app renders but only the static assets collected by Django, like icons, are being displayed. If I check the network tab on my devtools i see the django-vite files are being served). Any idea what could be causing this?</p> <p>Here is my vite.config.mjs ``` import { defineConfig } from &quot;vite&quot;; import { resolve } from",
