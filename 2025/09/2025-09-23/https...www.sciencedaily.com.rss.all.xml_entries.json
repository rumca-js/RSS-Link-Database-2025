Scientists are weighing drill sites while also monitoring dust, clouds, and long-distance features across Gale Crater.",

Unlike most crocs, it lived on land and ate a varied diet. The find led to the naming of a new species, Thikarisuchus xenodentes, offering insights into croc evolution and burrow-based fossil preservation. For Allen, it was a life-changing project that launched him into a career in paleontology.",

Entomologist Dr. Peter Huemer confirmed the discovery and, in a heartfelt gesture, named the moth after his wife on their 42nd anniversary, celebrating both science and love.",
