But it\u2019s not always easy for people to exercise those privacy rights. That\u2019s why we supported Assemblymember Josh Lowenthal\u2019s A.B. 566 throughout the legislative session and are now asking California Governor Gavin Newsom to sign it into law.\u00a0</p>\n<p class=\"pull-quote\">The easier it is to exercise your rights, the more power you have. \u00a0</p>\n<p>A.B. 566 does a very simple thing. It directs browsers\u2014such as Google\u2019s Chrome, Apple\u2019s Safari, Microsoft\u2019s Edge or Mozilla\u2019s Firefox\u2014to give all their users the option to tell companies they don't want companies to\u00a0 to sell or share personal information\u00a0 that\u2019s collected\u00a0about them\u00a0on the internet. In other words: it makes it easy for Californians to tell companies what they want to happen with their own information.</p>\n",
