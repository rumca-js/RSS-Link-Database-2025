But after that- i gave up. I couldnt get into monkrus&#39;s website. Then i tried to open my steam, but it wouldnt budge. I thought it was just another laptop lagging thing. Then a few hours later, someone had already gotten my steam account. Changed the email to his email and everything. I was 100% sure they had access to the emails inside my po at that point.. and it got worse when they tried to get inside my EA account. Thank god i was faster than him tho. Then he got inside my twitter account that i dont even use anymore. I was panicking from that point on, since my official email and my university email was on my laptop. and as i checked, the hacker was logged in my accounts when i checked the device sessi",
