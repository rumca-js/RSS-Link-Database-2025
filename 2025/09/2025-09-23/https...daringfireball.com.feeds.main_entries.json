It looked like the next\nstep in Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to silence dissent.</p>\n\n<p>But there\u2019s another way to see it: an opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s been clear since the last election that conservatives\ndominate the independent media space. Trump rode the reach of\nright-wing podcasts to victory while Kamala Harris stuck to\ntraditional television.</p>\n\n<p>But those old outlets are collapsing\u2009\u2014\u2009and they\u2019re never\ncoming back.</p>\n\n<p>That means the stars of late-night TV\u2009\u2014\u2009Kimmel, Colbert and\nothers\u2009\u2014\u2009could thrive outside corporate networks. They can build\ntheir own platforms, reach bigger audiences, and escape the grip\nof billionaires and timid executives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While Goddard didn\u2019t say it in this piece, the subtext should be ",

        "description": "<p>ABC is putting Kimmel\u2019s show back on tonight, which is great. But I think it\u2019s essential to watch the joke that triggered his suspension. I\u2019m linking here to a CNN post with the full clip. CNN headlined their post \u201cWhat Kimmel Said About Charlie Kirk That Yanked His Show Off Air\u201d, and that\u2019s basically how most news outlets have phrased it.</p>\n\n<p>But the joke wasn\u2019t about Charlie Kirk. It wasn\u2019t about Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassin. It was about Donald Trump being a sociopathic ghoul. Trump was asked how he\u2019s holding up after the death of \u201chis friend Charlie Kirk\u201d. You really have to watch it\u2009\u2014\u2009a transcript of Trump\u2019s answer does no justice to how sociopathic it was. And Kimmel called him out on it with mockery.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018The Kimmel Joke That Got Him Suspended Was Not About Charlie Kirk, It Was About Trump Being a Ghoul\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/09/23/kimmel-joke\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
