        "description": "ABC is expecting huge ratings with Jimmy Kimmel's return to late night, but two of the biggest station groups, Nexstar and Sinclair, are refusing to air the show. Between them, they control 70 ABC affiliates, which leaves 164 stations that will be airing Kimmel Tuesday night.
