Obviously, I bought it because I have a butt load of VHS movies I want to rip, and happen to have an HDMI capture card.</p> <p>I plug it into my TV, and wouldn&#39;t you know it, it upscales the VHS to 1080i and the tape looks much better than it did on my other VCR. So, I boot up OBS, plug in my Ripsaw X HDMi capture card into the computer, and for a few seconds I get a video signal from the VCR and then it goes black.</p> <p>First, I thought the VCR went bad, but I plugged it back into the TV and it was working just fine. I then thought it was a stupid MacOS error, but I tried on a Windows laptop and had the same issue. I can&#39;t imagine it would be HDCP, considering the player only does DVD and VHS.

I have been using 1tb ssd flash drive for awhile and it worked like a charm and switched to 4tb crucial x10 and worked like a charm as well. I am slowly needing more storage to hold my samples, project files and everything. I was thinking about getting somthing like a 6tb western digital elements se or was thinking maybe it\u2019s cheaper to get a ssd and use an enclosure? I run all my plugins downloaded in my mac so samples wouldn\u2019t be a problem.</p> <p>I want it portable because I travel, go to library to work on it and sometimes at my friends house.
