However many of the party guests are more into drinking than focusing on a game, which as a board game enthusiast sometimes irks me, but overall it isn\u2019t a big deal.</p> <p>To make it more engaging though, I was thinking of adding a gimmick. My main idea is creating character cards for everyone that have abilities which can be used throughout the night. My issue with that is I am unsure how the \u2018abilities\u2019 would work across different games as well as if it is a once per game or just once the whole night. Another idea could be just a point system but idk.</p> <p>I am definitely overthinking this but if you could indulge my overwhelmed brain with suggestions and any other help that would be great. \ud83d\ude0a</p> <p>I\u2019m also gonna post on other subreddits but this is the only one I have access to atm.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",
