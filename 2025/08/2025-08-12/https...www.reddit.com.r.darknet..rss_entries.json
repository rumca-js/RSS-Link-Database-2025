This journey has given me a new perspective on how to design systems that can withstand attacks and operate securely. </p> <p>so, I would like to show you few articles explain what I&#39;ve learned from this experience. They&#39;re a mix of high-level concepts and practical code, covering everything from fundamental server design to handling massive loads. </p> <p>I hope these articles serve you as a starting point to create your own first hidden service, and not die trying. </p> <p>Surviving the Shadows: Building an Unbreakable Server on the Dark Web: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@EDBCBlog/surviving-the-shadows-building-an-unbreakable-server-on-the-dark-web-4cd59515b9ab\">https://medium.com/@EDBCBlog/surviving-the-shadows-building-an-unbreakable-server-on",

Or is there anything you would add or install?</p> <p>Right now my biggest opsec violation is that I can\u2019t find a way to create a totally anonymous email address, they all want verifications via text message and google voice won\u2019t work anymore. </p> <p>I was looking into stalwart email, but how does that work do I install it on tails or my main computer? I read something about needing a tailscale to use along with it. </p> <p>And I guess if I am installing anything like that onto my personal computer I should pay for a VPN to make it harder to put all the evidence together. </p> <p>Can you see any glaring mistakes in my setup? Or recommend a different one for online shopping? Or recommend any other apps to install onto tails? </p",

If I am (hypothetically) purchasing LSD and I use TOR on a personal laptop on public wifi, is there much risk? I am also considering DMT.
