Here is Robin's petition: https://chng.it/mdgp8mZffb \n\nI spoke with Robin Sullivan about the ongoing Audible situation, and she shares details that may implicate Audible in paying themselves from author credits\u2014effectively taking money directly out of indie authors\u2019 pockets.\n\nWe cover:\n\nAudible announced 50%/30% royalties, but many authors are now getting as little as $1 per credit.\n\nMarket control: With Audible controlling over 60% of audiobook sales, these practices hit indie writers and trad authors.\n\nWhy you should care: This isn\u2019t just an author problem\u2014it\u2019s about transparency, fair pay, and the future of publishing.\n\nIf you value your audiobooks, now\u2019s the time to get informed and speak up.\n\nShare this video with fellow authors, narrators, and audiobook fans.\n\nTell me in the comments: Do you believe Audible\u2019s royalty system is fair?\n\nSupport My Work & Books:\nBreach of Peace: https://tinyurl.co",
