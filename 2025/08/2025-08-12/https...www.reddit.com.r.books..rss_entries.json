I am looking at getting something to put the book into to display and put on my shelf or wall mount. The interesting thing is that the book also came with a second dust jacket of the original cover from 1989. This jacket is currently rolled neatly in a tube. That\u2019s how it was sent. Any ways I\u2019m trying to think of a way to display the cover and also protect it at the same time. I\u2019ve tried googling stuff but didn\u2019t really find much. Basically I want to have the dust jacket completely open and mounted next to the book (along with a special book mark that also came with it). Does anyone have any clever ideas?

The fact that It refers to the act of reading and the different forms it takes - escapism, exploring and just reading, is what seems to make it better.

I loathed Nora, despite what she&#39;d been through and I don&#39;t feel there was enough of an acknowledgement by Jess of just how horrible she was. It was clear Nora isolated her and destroyed her relationship with her mother. I&#39;m not sure how you can forgive someone making up a story about your mother trying to smother you. </p> <p>One thing I don&#39;t understand is how did Jess know about Meg and the fish paste? It&#39;s revealed in the chapter about Percy, but those were Percy&#39;s private thoughts...there was no journal or interview to reveal it. It&#39;s almost like the author forgot this detail hadn&#39;t been revealed to anyone. Which would be understandable considering how many chapters were books within books or interviews or letters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

Her in depth reporting in the era of MeToo is what led to the arrests of both Epstein and Maxwell.</p> <p>I read the original reporting <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article238237729.html\">link</a> in 2019, but it wasn&#39;t until Epstein/Trump were back in the news this July that I decided to pick up the book which details Julie K. Brown&#39;s reporting on the Epstein saga. In between 2019 and now, I watched both Netflix series and listened to the Wondery podcast. I still learned new things from this book.</p> <p>There is a real tendency to focus on Maxwell as Epstein&#39;s partner in crime, but many of Epstein&#39;s victims never met Maxwell. Maxwell participated in the abuse of many young women in the late 90s and early 00s, but then she moved on to other relationships.",
