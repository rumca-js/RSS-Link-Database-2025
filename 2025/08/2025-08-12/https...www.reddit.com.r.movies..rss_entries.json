I enjoyed the movie a lot but I think the script was very lacking, it felt very barebones, there was not much meat to it. But what made the movie interesting to me, personally, was Gareth Edwards&#39; direction. He really knew how to sell the scale of the dinosaurs and the movie looked beautiful in general because it was shot on actual film.</p> <p>So I wondered if there was ever a script that was very good and very fleshed out realized by a director that can&#39;t do shit to safe his live. Like, you love the story and hate everything around it. Arw there any examples?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Phyliinx\"> /u/Phyliinx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mobynu/was_there_ever_a_good_script_with_shitty_direction/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mobynu/was_there_e",

I don&#39;t know if you call them Bond spoofs, since James Bond is sort of a spoof itself, but I still find them quite entertaining, and I think James Coburn does an excellent acting job as Derek Flint, a sort of American version of James Bond. Lee J. Cobb is also very good as his bumbling superior in charge of his assignments. I&#39;d also say these movies spoof Bond&#39;s womanizing quite well, and very much in line with the swinging 60s.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dcterr\"> /u/dcterr </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mo07br/derek_flint/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mo07br/derek_flint/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Wow. </p> <p>I went into this movie after absolutely loving Talk To Me. </p> <p>I was expecting another straight up horror movie. </p> <p>This was so much more. </p> <p>Bring Her Back is a tremendously powerful and brutal tale about grief and trauma. About what can happen to us if we let trauma twist our insides to the point of completely losing who we are and what we thought we believed in. </p> <p>Is it scary? Absolutely. </p> <p>Does it deserve to live in the \u201chorror\u201d genre? Absolutely. </p> <p>Does it feature some truly horrific visuals? Absolutely. </p> <p>But this film floored me.

Think of Adam Sandler. He&#39;s like 95% doing his usual brand of comedy (man-child, insulting/sarcastic yet somehow also a nice guy deep inside), and once in a while he does something different, the most clear and successful example being Uncut Gems, though there are other examples too (Punch-Drunk Love, Reign Over Me).</p> <p>But then you got guys like John Lithgow who is just amazing when you think about his range. This guy done all kinds of things and yet I often think of him as kind of under the radar. That&#39;s me personally I mean. Yet he&#39;s been in Cliffhanger, Footloose, Blow Out, Shrek,, Love Is Strange, and Killers of the Flower Moon, and Love Is Strange. And let&#39;s not forget The World According to Garp.
