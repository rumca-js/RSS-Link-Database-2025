Can&#39;t find specific information about this SEO marketing company. </p> <p>Our small business has a glitch on Google that says we aren&#39;t public but we are. Auto resposes from Google basically tell us everything is working as intended. We are verified and on google maps but you have to dig to find us even if you type in our exact name and/or address. We used to come up on results as normal and then suddenly everything has been impossible to find for our clients. We have a decent presence on Yelp, Nextdoor, etc which is where most of our new clients find us.</p> <p>This SEO company promised they could help and I spoke with them for a long time with lots of questions but I am still suspicious. If someone can prove to me they are a scam, I would appreciate it. If they could actually help us at least show up on google, that&#39;s all we want. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/omni",
