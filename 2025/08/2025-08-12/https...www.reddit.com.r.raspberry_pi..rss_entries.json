I think the go to board would be the super6c as the turing pi 2.5 seems to have problems with CM5 modules.</p> <p>Now the big question for me is: which CM5 model should I get? More specifically should I get the CM5 with emmc or the light version, as I will have nvmes in anyways. Benefit of having the ones with emmc would be that I can run the OS directly on it and have the nvme really just as storage. Drawback would probably be the speed? But does that really matter?</p> <p>I tried to find an answer through google but wasn\u2019t really able to find anything useful there. Maybe someone here has some practical informations here?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheRabber\"> /u/TheRabber </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddi",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I just recently got a pi, and I wanted to access it remotely without port forwarding. it seemed like there were a couple of options that were mildly complicated, and then I realized something. I have already been running a discord bot on my pi for a bit now, which made me think, why can&#39;t I just make the discord bot run commands on the pi for me? I have pi os lite so there isn&#39;t even a menu or anything, so I made a discord bot that lets me type commands and then it runs it on the pi and sends the output. This works because I can access the discord bot from anywhere as long as I have internet just by talking to it on discord. Then it acts as my personal message carrier and sends the info to the pi, and then sends the output back to me. it actually works really well, and would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants to access their pi remotely and is already running a discord bot on their pi</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#",
