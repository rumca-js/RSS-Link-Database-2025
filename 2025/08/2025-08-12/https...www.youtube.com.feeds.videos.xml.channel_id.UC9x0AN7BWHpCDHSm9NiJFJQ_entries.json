        "description": "Want to deploy AI in your cloud apps SAFELY? Let Wiz help: https://ntck.co/wiz\n\nCan you hack AI? In this video I sit down with elite AI hacker Jason Haddix to unpack how attackers compromise AI-enabled apps\u2014not just jailbreak chatbots, but exfiltrate customer data, abuse tool calls, and pivot across systems. We walk through his six-part AI pentest blueprint, play the Gandalf prompt-injection game, and demo wild techniques like emoji smuggling and link smuggling. You\u2019ll see real-world cases (think Slack salesbots + Salesforce leaks), why MCP (Model Context Protocol) and agentic frameworks can widen the blast radius, and then we flip to defense: web-layer fundamentals, a \u201cfirewall for AI\u201d on inputs/outputs, and least-privilege for data and tools\u2014plus a hands-on demo you can try. If you\u2019re building with AI in 2025, this is your wake-up call (and your roadmap). Educational content only\u2014hack ethically and only with permission.\n\n\n\nLinks and STUFF\n\u2014-------------------------------------------",
