With a retro interface\nCassette auto plays through videos from your devices\u2019 Photo\nLibrary. Mirror your device to a nearby Apple TV for a true kick\nback experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The VHS retro pastiche is fun, but don\u2019t get the wrong impression from it. Cassette is <em>not</em> an app that makes your modern videos look like they were shot on an old camcorder. (<a href=\"https://rarevision.com/vhs-camcorder-app/\">Rarevision VHS</a> is a fun app for that, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.)</p>\n\n<p>Cassette\u2019s tape-playing pastiche is more about putting you in the right mindset. Instead of watching one video from your Photos library, or two or three, it mimics popping in a tape labelled, say, \u201c2014\u201d and sitting back and watching an entire hour of videos from",
