While promising, the signals were subtle and inconsistent, leaving unanswered questions about whether these fragments come from lingering viral reservoirs or active replication.",

By using ultra-high-resolution brain scans, they found that while some layers of the cerebral cortex thin with age, others remain stable or even grow thicker, suggesting remarkable adaptability. This layered resilience could explain why certain skills endure into old age, while others fade, and even reveals built-in compensatory mechanisms that help preserve function.",
