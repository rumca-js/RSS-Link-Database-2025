The short scene features a single drop pod landing in an urban setting, but with rain and a moody soundtrack not unlike some scenes from Halo 3: ODST. And with the game coming to Halo's home console, it makes sense that developer Arrowhead would celebrate by collaborating with one of Helldivers' biggest inspirations. In other news, gamescom Opening Night Live is this coming Tuesday, and host Geoff Keighley is already teasing an exclusive look at Resident Evil: Requiem. And we take a look at one of Borderlands 4's vault hunters, Rafa the exo soldier.\nPresented by Borderlands 4.",
