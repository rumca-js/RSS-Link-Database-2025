With VRR off, stuttering occurs. This is not limited to a specific game, but applies to all the games I tried (games that run at twice the 40-50 fps, or 80-100 fps).

The only issue I have now is MMOs and some of their add-ons (DKP assist stuff for raids, parsers, triggers, etc.).</p> <p>Under windows I would use AHK scripts to perform a series of button presses automatically based on a hotkey. Something like press ctrl+f8 to start the script that presses these 5 keys in succession (with pause timers) and then it&#39;d stop when I pressed ctrl+f8 again. Even something simple like press key &#39;x&#39; every 8 seconds. Is there any equivalent for Linux? What&#39;s the best way to go about this?
