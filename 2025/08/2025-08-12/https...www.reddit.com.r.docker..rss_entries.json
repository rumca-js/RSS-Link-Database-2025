My setup, a debian server, is slightly custom within a corporate network: an ip, gateway and dns have been modified. But if Alpine can connect, why debian cannot? I tried docker and podman (rootless) - same issue.</p> <p>Btw if you have a debian image with network tools, I&#39;ll take it!</p> <p>Thanks for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tharqua\"> /u/Tharqua </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1mod0ly/debian_containers_cannot_access_internet_but/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1mod0ly/debian_containers_cannot_access_internet_but/\">[comments]</a></span>",
