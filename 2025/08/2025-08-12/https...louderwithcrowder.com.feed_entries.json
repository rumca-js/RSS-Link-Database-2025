You would think that would be the dumbest UK police story we would find this week. Instead, women are going undercover as joggers so that they can be catcalled... and arrest the catcallers.</p><p>No, really.

Here\u2019s a brief summary of President Donald Trump\u2019s record on peacemaking and peace keeping. President Trump is going to make Washington, D.C. safe again and the Left is\u2026mad about it? Because they think crime is down? Let\u2019s throw a little factcheck out there, see what we get. Holes in the ozone layer, melting ice caps, acid rain. The climate change/global warming/the end is nigh doomsayers have said it all. And for their next trick: the Great Barrier Reef. In the words of Donald J. Trump: Wrong.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"rumble\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://rumble.com/embed/v6vad4o/?pub=4430ut",
