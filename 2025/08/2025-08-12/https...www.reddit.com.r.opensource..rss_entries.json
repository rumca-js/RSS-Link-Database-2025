Sometimes I want to share some code making sure it won&#39;t get stored/logged/saved anywhere. So I built this project with that in mind.<br/> The code gets compressed and put in the URL fragment. So when you share a link, the code travels with it, but never actually hits any server/database.</p> <p>It&#39;s not groundbreaking, but maybe it&#39;ll be useful for people who care about keeping their code snippets private.</p> <p>Would love any feedback, especially if you spot anything obviously wrong.

Behind the scenes, PgDoorman either creates a new connection to the actual PostgreSQL server or reuses an existing connection from its pool, significantly reducing connection overhead.</p> <p>For more details follow the link to github and check README.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chechyotka\"> /u/chechyotka </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1mo226r/new_",

Microsoft forced steam to think Linux and that has been really good for Linux. AMD has been open to Linux and that has been really good too. The more we get on our team, the better Linux will work.</p> <p>Right now I think Linux is good enough for many and there is enough consumer irritation about Windows/Microsoft/BillGates/USA e.t.c. to move",
