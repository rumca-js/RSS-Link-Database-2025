It sounded like a good idea to me, more code bases but less reliance on each other, cool.</p> <p>One thing that I am realising is how annoying it is to have to write the same models for each service, and thus having to make edits to each model at each layer when I change something, all of which is making me wonder if it should have just been a django app that also handled the data scraping via celery. Likewise, for things such as logging classes, database access, I\u2019m finding it annoying to have to write the same stuff again each time.</",
