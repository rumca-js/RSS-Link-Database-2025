I understand there&#39;s a web UI, but I&#39;d like devices on my network to be able to simply click magnet links while browsing and have the download start immediately.</p> <p>For example, on my Windows 11 daily driver laptop, I can click a magnet link in Firefox and qBittorrent picks it up and starts downloading it right away. No prompts, no dialog boxes, nothing. It&#39;s really convenient.</p> <p>I&#39;m okay with a handler software or locally installing a qBitTorrent to act as a GUI for a headless one running at the NAS. Anything but a browser extension please.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cemtemeltas\"> /u/cemtemeltas </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1mom653/a_way_to_relay_the_magnet_links_to_a_truenas/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",
