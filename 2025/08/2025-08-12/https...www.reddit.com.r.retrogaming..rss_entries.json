I don&#39;t want a crappy quality converter, I want to preserve the original aspect ratio and get the best quality possible at a budget of no more than $100.

It started with Sony and some tribal dancers painting the button shapes which then led onto a montage of games (annoyingly FFVII is the only one I can remember). It then showed Nintendo, with the spinning N for the N64, showcasing Starfox, Blast Corps, Super Mario 64 and I think Bomberman. It also had videos for Konami as well showcasing Symphony of the Night among others.</p> <p>I cannot find a YouTube video for it anywhere, not for want of searching multiple different things.

I&#39;ve played the original arcade version, and double dragon 1, 2, and i think 3 but i cant remember. Im a huge fan of beat em ups. I love streets of rage, golden axe, final fight, mighty final fight, some of the tmnt games (gba one is peak) but for some reason I just cannot force myself to enjoy playing the double dragon games. I very much understand they are difficult. Ive beaten and enjoyed a few difficult games, although ill admit theyre not my favorite. But theres a difference between difficult on purpose and difficult because the game design is plain bad. The whole mechanic where the button you press determines which side of the screen you attack is no joke, the worst mechanic ive ever experienced in a beat em up. Of course the arcade one doesnt have the problem, but genuinely why the hell would they make it like this??? Whenever I play these games it feels like im fighting the game r",
