Consider a hypothetical scenario: a closed-loop, prepaid system such as a university laundry card or a gas station loyalty card. This system has a diagnostic port used for maintenance and calibration.</p> <p>My question is: Theoretically, is it possible to use an external device connected to this port to cause the system to overestimate the amount spent by 10% during a single transaction, without altering the main transaction logs? The idea is to send a fake \u2018calibration echo\u2019 to the system&#39;s memory. In other words, the machine will think it has consumed 20 units and record this, but physically only 18 units will have been consumed.
