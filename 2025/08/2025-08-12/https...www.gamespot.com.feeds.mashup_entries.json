Following the reveal of the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-three-point-shooters-in-nba-2k26/2900-6877/\">best three-point shooters</a>, we have the top 10 ball handlers in the game, and there are certainly some familiar faces all throughout the list. Every top 10 ball handler in 2K26 is rated at 92 OVR or higher, meaning there are almost definitely other players with a 90 OVR or higher.</p><p>However, the list of the top dogs when it comes to handles is difficult to argue with. You can see the full top 10 list of the best handles in 2K26 below, along with what each player is rated.</p></p><br/>     <p><h2>Kyrie Irving - 99 OVR</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1",
