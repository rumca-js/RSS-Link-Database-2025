For the last year I literally just tracked my \u201csavings\u201d in Notes on my phone. If I didn\u2019t buy coffee or eat out that day, I\u2019d just write \u201c+5\u201d or \u201c+12.\u201d It was stupid simple and it actually worked for me.</p> <p>Honestly, my app is basically an <em>anti-budgeting</em> app. The opposite of tracking your spending, it&#39;s tracking when you don&#39;t spend. I never liked all the pressure and guilt that comes with traditional budgeting tools. No obsessing over every dollar, no shame for slipping up. Just simple small wins you can actually keep up with.</p> <p>A couple weeks ago I tried turning it into an app. Posted it here. Top comment was basically, \u201cCool idea but no one is gonna type numbers in every day.\u201d Fair.</p> <p>So I changed it.
