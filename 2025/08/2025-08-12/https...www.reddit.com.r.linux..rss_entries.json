I always assumed they were made using some top-secret, super-expensive proprietary systems. Then I read an article about it and my mind was blown: the entire industry runs on LINUX! And most of the tools are open-source. The wildest part is that the Academy itself (yes, the Oscars people!) has a foundation with The Linux Foundation to manage the software the studios rely on. Giant studios depend on this to create the magic we see on screen. I got genuinely hyped learning about this. If you&#39;re into tech and cinema, the story of how this quiet revolution happened is a fascinating read.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vudueprajacu\"> /u/vudueprajacu </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://brainnoises.com/blog/hollywood-linux-vfx-secret-weapon/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",

I also have a offer for T14 gen5 Ryzen 5 for 1000. A new T14 Intel gen 5 Intel with 125u would cost 1500.</p> <p>Wich cpu or Model s or no s, wich gen would you pick for the best Linux support.</p> <p>Second important for me is battery and thermals.

I used it to back up everything important, including my Godot game projects. The best part was the automatic syncing \u2014 I could just open my project in Godot, edit, and everything would sync effortlessly to the cloud without any extra setup or hassle.</p> <p>Now on Linux, I\u2019m looking for a cloud storage solution that offers similar seamless integration and reliability, especially for game development files. Has anyone found a service or workflow on Linux that matches OneDrive\u2019s convenience and automatic syncing? Ideally something that just works in the background and doesn\u2019t require me to manually upload or deal with complicated syncing issues.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any recommendations!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sweteHoriko\"> /u/sweteHoriko </a> <br/> <span><",

Microsoft forced steam to think Linux and that has been really good for Linux. AMD has been open to Linux and that has been really good too.
