Could you share a simple roadmap you would recommend to beginners, and maybe include some of the mistakes or dead-ends you ran into along your journey?</p> <p>This would not only help me but also a lot of other budding AI enthusiasts here.

The question is this, do you think that right now any AI is capable of creating an original anime from scratch (I&#39;m talking about entire chapters, 20-30 minutes) or, for example, giving it material already created (such as a manga or a light novel) and adapting the anime based on that?

Then it&#39;ll be monetized or they&#39;ll use us as the commodity in a similar way to social media.</p> <p>Social media started with cat pics and now you basically if you use it you have no private data, and the corporations who control it have the power to decide what the public conversation is, and what is good discourse. They also can control governments in unforseen ways as a result.</p> <p>Now imagine Facebook with the power to feed us with whatever knowledge it wants. They don&#39;t have to tell the truth. They can manufacture consent in unforseen ways. You think the government being able to convince the war in Iraq was good, wait until your therapist to",
