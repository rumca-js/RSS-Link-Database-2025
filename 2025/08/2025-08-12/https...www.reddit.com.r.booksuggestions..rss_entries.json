However, I just felt so hopeless after finishing it. I did not want to read or touch any book after that. It took me a few days to let it settle. Now, I would want to read something lighter, cozy or bright. I would prefer the writing style with humor like Fredrik Backman or Markus Zusak. I am open to any genre, but I don\u2019t think I am a fan of Romance novels. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/syedalizain\"> /u/syedalizain </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1moou11/i_need_a_break_grim_dark/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1moou11/i_need_a_break_grim_dark/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The way she is fanning out the different concepts of religion/cults/churches and concepts of family/women&#39;s lifestyles is just very precise and how she developes all those concepts to dystopian, bitter ends.</p> <p>Of course I collected everything else she wrote, but... </p> <p>I think I read her best book first! The interweaving of different concepts is, in my opinion, in most of her other books forced and I&#39;m too picky with logic. I still love her charme, but it&#39;s mostly a naive one.. . </p> <p>Is there a writer or just a book which reminded you of Sheri S. Tepper on peak? </p> <p>I would be glad to explore!

As an 18M who&#39;s about to undergo big life changes soon, I&#39;d like to spend my remaining months of downtime to seriously get into reading instead of endlessly watch YT. Books that provoke deep thoughts, or those with high emotional weight and a lot of complex relationships come to mind, but I&#39;m open to all recommendations. Thanks y&#39;all!</p> <p>As for my preferences, The house of the scorpion is the only novel/fiction I&#39;ve ever read (for an assignment), but I somewhat enjoyed it. In terms of other media, Inception, Avengers and Arcane are my favourite shows/movies. Attack on Titan, Steins;Gate and Oshi no ko are my favourite animes, if that&#39;s any help.

I&#39;m a third of the way through &#39;2010: Odyssey Two&#39; and I&#39;m still enjoying it but I&#39;m slowly losing interest in this franchise. The fact that the Goodreads ratings keep going down with every instalment doesn&#39;t help encourage me to follow through until the end of the franchise either.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if this is similar to The Matrix, where fans tell you they&#39;re happy to just watch the first movie over and over and ignore the other three like they don&#39;t exist. They&#39;ll tell you that it&#39;s better to stop after the first one. The Matrix is better that way. </p> <p>This is not an important question and it barely makes sense to ask it since I&#39;ll likely just do what I feel like once I finish this book. I&#39;m literally just curious and interested to know what the fans think. Nothing to lose by asking and getting feedback. It&#39;s literally just curiosity. Thank you.</p> <",

I have decided to start the Mad Ship Series and am looking for some books to queue afterwards. I have already read the fools Errand Trilogy as well as the Fool&#39;s Quest. I enjoy litrpg books such as HWFWM, Battle Mage Farmer, The Good/Bad guys, and did not enjoy DCC. I enjoy fantasy as well as epic fantasy, some books I enjoy are the Stormlight Archive, LOTR, and WoT. I like Sci-Fi such as Scythe, S.J Kinkaid, and Will of Many, I did not really enjoy Dune as much. I enjoy Romance in the books but I only enjoy it within those Genres. I prefer books not based on earth but am not crazy about alien life. I am currently reading Project Hail Mary and have been enjoying it. I have already exhausted C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, B. Sanderson, R. Jordan and am wrapping up Robin Hobb now. I enjoyed Crime and Punishment but did not enjoy Dracula. I do not drop series",

So I am a guy (returning reader) who has observed the trend of indulging dark romance novels, mostly seemingly being written with a male &quot;cruel/dark figure&quot; for females. However, I am kind of looking for something where the roles are reversed. Ideally an awkward or normal guy paired with a female &quot;aggressor&quot; or &quot;dominant&quot; part. I am pretty flexible as in what that might look like as it is the dynamic I enjoy the most. I have seen the rare movie (or anime where it is a bit more common) with kind of popular female, quirky guy and always enjoyed them and am looking for kind of the same in writing. </p> <p>Past reads I have enjoyed have all been in the fantasy genre, the most known ones being LOTR, Eragon and GOT (Though this one was a bit too intrigue focused) to mention some. Also a big fan of Azeroth, non-human creatures and so on. </p> <p>Looking mostly for fantasy settings but if there\u2019s a perfect fit outside ",

I watched Wednesday recently and it reminded me of the types of stories I really enjoyed growing up. I want something in the fantasy realm but with a mystery and a darker vibe. Not really interested in a romance but not opposed to a subplot featuring it. I did try reading \u201cTo End Every War\u201d by Raymond Wilkinson, but a few chapters in it doesn\u2019t quite have me hooked, but it\u2019s okay so far.

I had always thought that we humans are so arrogant and selfish that we create something like MATHEMATICS in our mind and then claim that the language of NATURE is also mathematics.

I\u2019ve read ACOTAR and really didn\u2019t like it. I\u2019ve also read Just for the Summer by Abby Jimenez, and that wasn\u2019t really my cup of tea either, but it was definitely less painful of the two.
