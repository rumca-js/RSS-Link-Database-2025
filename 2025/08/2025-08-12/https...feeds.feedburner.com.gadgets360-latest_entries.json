        "description": "On July 24, 2025, NASA\u2019s Curiosity Mars rover captured an image of a small, coral-shaped rock in Gale Crater using its ChemCam Remote Micro Imager. The light-colored, 1-inch (2.5 cm) formation likely formed billions of years ago when mineral-rich water seeped into tiny fractures in the rock, leaving behind hardened mineral veins after evaporation. Over time, relentless Martian winds sandblasted the surrounding material, revealing the rock\u2019s intricate, branching structure. While its appearance closely resembles marine coral, scientists stress it is a geological artifact\u2014known as a pseudofossil\u2014rather than evidence of life. The discovery reinforces mounting evidence that ancient Mars had abundant liquid water and could have supported microbial life. Since landing in 2012, Curiosity has explored Gale Crater\u2019s layered terrain, uncovering clues to the Red Planet\u2019s wet history and its potential habitability in the distant past.",

        "description": "According to a tipster, the iPhone 17 Pro will move its antennas to surround the rear camera module, similar to the Apple Watch Ultra, to improve reception and stability. Unlike current edge-mounted antennas, this layout is expected to reduce interference, enhance 5G mmWave and Wi-Fi 7 performance, and maintain strong connections in crowded or mobile conditions. It could offer a cleaner side-frame design, free internal space for other hardware, and deliver a more even signal with fewer dead zones, potentially setting a new industry benchmark.",
