The persistence mechanism is a scheduled task\u2014disabled by default\u2014which the operating system occasionally enables and executes at unpredictable times, such as during idle periods or new application deployments.

When briefing my boss and his boss, I mentioned that I am stressed but I have a lot to get through so I can update them, and the focus of the entire call was entirely on my brief comment about being stressed instead of the serious incidents occurring, which is way more important to me. It is highly likely that since these attackers had a full on, unstopped shell into this intern&#39;s laptop, we should assume that network is compromised. That feels like common sense to me, but this is also my first job out of college. They are completely unconcerned by this and I can&#39;t get through to them.
