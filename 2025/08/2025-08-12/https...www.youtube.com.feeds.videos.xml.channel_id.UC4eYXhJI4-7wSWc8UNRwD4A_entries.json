        "description": "Lars Gotrich | August 12, 2025\nThe world is doomed, but at least we've got the Mekons. For nearly 50 years, the British punk band has always done things its own way \u2014 out of stubbornness, survival or maybe a little bit of both. That snaggled-toothed sneer and smile, with some bittersweet sentimentality swirled in, can soundtrack any moment, but especially when everything feels fraught.\n\nAt the opening of this Tiny Desk concert, we're taken back 40 years to one of the band's many crossroads. Mekons' 1985 album Fear and Whiskey recognized that traditional country music was just as rowdy, randy and wayward as punk, and inadvertently pioneered the alt-country phenomenon. The joyous and desperate \"Last Dance\" is a song about falling in love during wartime \u2014 at the Tiny Desk, its past themes reverberate into the present. The middle of the set features two songs from this year's Horror: \"War Economy,\" a post-punk-y throwback to the days when the Mekons would borrow Gang of Four's instruments",
