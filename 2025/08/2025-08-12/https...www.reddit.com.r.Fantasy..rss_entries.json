I love how the MC actually thinks things through instead of just charging in blindly, and his growth feels so earned. The world-building is detailed without being overwhelming, and every side character feels like they have their own purpose. It\u2019s the kind of story where you tell yourself, \u201cjust one more chapter,\u201d and suddenly it\u2019s 3 a.m.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Acrobatic-Yoghurt273\"> /u/Acrobatic-Yoghurt273 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mofk9p/rtoc_i_like_this_novel_so_much_because_of_its/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mofk9p/rtoc_i_like_this_novel_so_much_because_of_its/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I order quite a bit of \u201cindependent\u201d authors, who would appear to only sell on Amazon. But Jesus H., I have to return roughly 40% of those I\u2019ve bought, because the thing looks like it went through a wood chipper.</p> <p>Why back in my day, (yeah, I\u2019m older) Amazon ONLY did books. And they always came in nice, pristine shape. Now? Unsecured pages, folded page corners, warping, spines broken, and one memorable time, the book had a hole in the middle of the cover.
