Now scientists from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IOCAS) have discovered a massive hydrogen-rich hydrothermal system beneath the western Pacific seafloor, offering a new glimpse into deep-sea serpentinization\u2014a process in which iron- and magnesium-rich rocks chemically react with water to form serpentine minerals and release hydrogen.",

The reason for this could reside in the planets in our solar system, say researchers at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR). In the last 10 years, they have developed a model that derives virtually all the sun's known activity cycles from the cyclical influence of the planets' tidal forces. In a new study published in Solar Physics, they have now demonstrated that this external synchronization automatically curbs solar activity.",
