Use my code \"Sabine25\" and go to https://www.getrecall.ai/?t=sabine for 25% off a Recall subscription that is valid until September 1, 2025.\n\nIn 1927, Einstein used a variant of the double slit experiment \u2013 at that time only a thought experiment \u2013 to argue that quantum mechanics are wrong. Up until recently, researchers have been unable to fully disprove his claims. Now, though, a group of physicists from MIT claim they\u2019ve proven that Einstein was wrong about quantum physics by actually carrying out the experiment. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/zwhd-1k2t\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://",
