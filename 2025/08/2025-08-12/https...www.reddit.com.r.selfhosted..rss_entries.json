        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello!</p> <p>I&#39;ve been setting up a little homelab and have been trying to following an infrastructure-as-code approach: all resources necessary to run my setup are contained in one directory I can easily transfer between machines. I&#39;m running into trouble with scheduling tasks in this way though, since your crontab or whatever is stored elsewhere. Solutions I&#39;ve considered:</p> <p>a. build docker images with crontabs for my tasks - awkward, and seems to be generally regarded as a bad idea</p> <p>b. build docker images that run my task, sleep, repeat - also seems rather awkward</p> <p>c. keep the &quot;real&quot; crontab in my IaC setup, then copy it /var/spool on setup - leaning towards this, seems the least bad</p> <p>Is there a better option without like setting up a k8 cluster? Not doing that haha.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/anzu_embroidery\"> /u/anzu_embroidery </a> <br/> <sp",
