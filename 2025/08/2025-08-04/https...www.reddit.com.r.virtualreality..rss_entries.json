The quality is ass and the cable randomly disconnects at times. I\u2019ve been researching Headsets for a while and need some help. So here is what I\u2019m looking for in a headset; 300-1000 dollars, Better Quality, Better PCVR connection, No Base Stations Required. The HP Reverb GX v2 seems to be the best since it\u2019s now super cheap and seems pretty good but very outdated. If it comes to it where I\u2019m pretty desperate for something I\u2019ll have to pick up the Quest 3 but I honestly do not want to have to resort to that. So, does anyone have any recommendations on what I should get?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/InstanceChoice8302\"> /u/InstanceChoice8302 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1mhrgsv/vr_headset_recommendation",

I don&#39;t understand why vr games look awful on my quest 2 when playing wired, even sometimes a fuzzy line appears along the screen after about 20 mins. But when playing on quest 2 pcvr thru the steam vr app on the standalone quest 2, games suddenly look a lot nicer, granted the input lag is greater and signal integrity isn&#39;t great, and anti Aisling seems to actually work. I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s an issue with the oculus app on pc, oh and its a usb 3.1 gen 2*1 I believe so 10gb and is definitely plugged into a usb 3 port and tested on the oculus app. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Timely-Plate-6298\"> /u/Timely-Plate-6298 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1mhp4df/why_do_games_look_better_in_wireless_pcvr_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",

I use the Quest 2 on my PC, and I&#39;ve got a nice set up where my Quest 2 connects to Steam via SteamLink (wireless) and connects to my porn, so I can stream it directly from my PC to the headset. I&#39;ve got a bunch of VR games I&#39;d like to play too, but I&#39;m wondering how the Steam Link is on Pico 4 Ultra? How are the motion trackers? Are the motion trackers actually cool?

Basically they ar AR/XR glasses with head and had tracking similar to xreal or rokid glasses. I was wondering how (if at all) I can play VR games with steamvr. Was lookig for controllers that aren&#39;t locked to a specific headset. Seen the HTC vibe Steamvr base and was wondering if that would work and what else i would need. Also are there any other options?

You\u2019re using your hands to grill, chop, pour, assemble simple dishes with a good rhythm and flow, instead of pressure or timers.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been imagining small food stalls from different cultures, each with their own cozy vibe and menu. Something easy to pick up but with room to master over time.</p> <p>Would something like that actually be fun in VR?
