The directions are clear, just link Venmo and your card then buy chipotle and wait a few days until you\u2019re venmoed the $10 reward</p> <p>Each Thursday, I get to \u201cpick\u201d a reward from a small selection of places. The places this week were sweetgreen, poke works and salt and straw. It\u2019s usually $5-$10 dollars or some other promo.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been reimbursed each time after 2-4 days and am really happy with it! I\u2019m not a college student but living in NYC am on a tight budget so feel no shame.</p> <p>To make things easier - here are all of the options for the promo codes you can get.
