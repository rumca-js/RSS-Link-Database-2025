For the passed nine months or so, I&#39;ve been looking to switch more towards the red side of cyber and have potential to move into a pentester position within my company. As part of the requirement for the transfer, I was told I needed either the PJPT or PNPT from TCM Security. After about 6 months of studying and practice, I successfully passed the PNPT earlier this year. I know that the OSCP will be something I need to get down the road, and since I know the OSCP has gone through some iterations and changes, I&#39;m wondering if anyone can tell me approximately how much more difficult the OSCP would be? Approximately how long would you think I&#39;d need to study before I took a stab at it?
