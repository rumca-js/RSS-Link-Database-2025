Thanks to YouTube sponsorship I had switched to Opera GX, until recently where, I noticed that Opera GX wasn\u2019t as smooth as it used to be on my laptop and for figuring that it probably wasn\u2019t the best browser I should use for privacy concerns, so I made a switch to Ungoogled Chromium which is way better in terms of performances and privacy (for my usage)</p> <p>As I am now investing in my first real PC, I am searching for a good definitive browser. I\u2019m mainly searching for a Chromium-based browser, which can support Manifest v2, has auto-updates and that isn\u2019t really interested in doing Cryptos\u2026 Thanks in advanced for any recommendations you guys can give me!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Thomas_Sunf",
