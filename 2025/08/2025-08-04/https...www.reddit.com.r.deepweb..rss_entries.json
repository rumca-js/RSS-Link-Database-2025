I have sent many email requesting to take those info down zero respond. Y\u2019all will think that legal action would solve this ? No my country is one of those shitty countries where lawyer/legal action mean literally nothing :/ but our Europe costumers deeply concern about these fake info and wont working with us unless this website gone. The official website from the government or .gov is alright but it seems like our costumer is still being bugged by this weird website. </p> <p>Can someone please help me dive into deep web to hire a hacker ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Free_Boysenberry1256\"> /u/Free_Boysenberry1256 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1mhe550/wanna_hire_a_hacker_on_deepweb/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepw",
