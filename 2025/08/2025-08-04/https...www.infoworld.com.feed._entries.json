Consider the butler, the meat-space equivalent of an AI. There are schools that specialize in teaching new butlers skills like how to serve breakfast or make a perfect martini. But did you know these same schools have a parallel track teaching rich people how to get along with their butler? That\u2019s right, rich people <em>learn</em> how to hold the teacup correctly, so the butler can gracefully fill it with tea. They even learn what kinds of requests are appropriate and which are not. It\u2019s the sort of thing that can\u2019t be taught in a two-minute TikTok video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being waited on hand and foot isn\u2019t easy.
