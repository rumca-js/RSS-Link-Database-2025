They had access to nearly anything they wanted and had deals under the table with social media companies. They even spied on foreign nationals. </p> <p>Fast forward to 2025 and many of those things are now in the open, or common knowledge- palantir wants to create a database of every American, openAI wants to use your chats as evidence in court, and social media sites are now requiring ID.
