I have an 8TB HDD and I&#39;m about to clone it to another one for redundancy. I noticed that 3TB of the drive is being taken up by &quot;Other Volumes,&quot; but I can&#39;t seem to find where or what those are. Does anyone have any advice on how to locate/remove these other volumes // what the best course of action is? </p> <p>Thanks for any and all assistance! </p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/59mrw6yyv1hf1.png?width=2472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44f629a2fd173be1e3e632329362ece453babe87\">https://preview.redd.it/59mrw6yyv1hf1.png?width=2472&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&",

To solve this, I built my own tool called <a href=\"https://www.framemarks.com/welcome\">Framemarks</a>.</p> <p>It helps to summarize YT videos (typically lecture-style) and help to condense it into a simple, one pager filled with screen grabs that often turn out to be useful diagrams on lecture slides. I use this to sieve through videos to figure out which are good (and skip past poor presenters). It also helps me turn it into a digital database that I can actually search through later.</p> <p>To see what you might get, check an example article here: <a href=\"https://www.framemarks.com/public/claude-code-and-the-evolution-of-agentic-coding-boris-cherny-anthropic\">Evolution of Claude Code</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
