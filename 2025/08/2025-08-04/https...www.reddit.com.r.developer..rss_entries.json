It\u2019s been going well on the surface, no errors or broken features. It\u2019s about 18k lines (129k tokens, 500k+ characters) of HTML, JS, CSS, and React backed by firebase using auth and firestore. </p> <p>I have zero experience coding so obviously I have no clue what mistakes it\u2019s making and how much security it\u2019s lacking. Also I know for a fact code structure/architecture is an absolute ball of yarn. </p> <p>I really want to release this app but I want it done right. I don\u2019t have the expertise to fix it myself, nor do I have the 10s of thousands of dollars to hire a SWE to fix the code over a few weeks. </p> <p>Am I stuck? How on earth can I get around the horrible code AI spits out mixed with my lack of knowledge. It\u2019s not able to refactor or reorganize the whole code because of its length. </p> <p>I\u2019m aware I could just learn how to code but I run my own busine",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve been using CodeRabbit.ai and tools for a while now to assist with PR reviews. At first, it seemed like a nice productivity boost - but honestly, it\u2019s getting more and more annoying: - The UI feels super buggy with long load times, strange interaction behaviors etc - Some core features just\u2026 don\u2019t work reliably, like we\u2018ve spent 30 mins to complete the payment for a few lite plan seats - Overall the app feels kinda \u201cvibe-coded\u201d, like an MVP that somehow made it into production</p> <p>So I\u2019m wondering: Is anyone else here using CodeRabbit or similar tools for automated PR reviews? What\u2019s your experience been like? Are there any tools out there that actually work and feel stable? Or are we still at the point where AI-assisted reviews are \u201ccool in theory, not ready in practice\u201d?</p> <p>Genuinely curious if it\u2019s just me or if this is a common sentiment.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chaospilot69",
