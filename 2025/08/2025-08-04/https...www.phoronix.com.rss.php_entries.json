        "description": "Over the past three months we have been excitedly testing AMD's Strix Halo SoC with the Ryzen AI Max+ PRO 395 flagship model as well as the Ryzen AI Max PRO 390 as one step below. Strix Halo offers excellent CPU and GPU performance capabilities at the top-end if your budget allows. But at the opposite end and a step below the Strix Point SoCs that have been available the past year is Krackan Point. Krackan Point is for the mid-range offerings in the Ryzen AI 300 series. Recently I've been testing an AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 laptop that offers pretty impressive performance/value when considering it can be found brand new for as little as $449 USD with the HP OmniBook 5.",
