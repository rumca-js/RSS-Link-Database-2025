Can someone explain to me what the purpose of the subreddit is? I see others posting about indexers and providers but they seem to have no issues with their posts being removed. </p> <p>Simply all I wanted to figure out is if there has been a breach of any of the 3 indexers I use due to random Chinese and English downloads being made on my servers the other day over a 20 hour period. Would think people in the community would like to know if there was a breach of api keys or not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ninjazombielurker\"> /u/ninjazombielurker </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1mhp1ah/confused_about_what_this_sub_is_actually_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
