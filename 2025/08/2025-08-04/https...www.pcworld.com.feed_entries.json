Whether in the home office, on the move, or in the office, a multi-port adapter significantly improves the connection options of laptops, tablets, or smartphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s especially useful for devices with only a few ports, like many ultrabooks or Macbooks. A USB-C hub offers a compact solution for several requirements at the same time: data transfer, video output, charging, and access to SD cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest model from Ugreen expands a single USB-C port with seven additional interfaces, and is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Delivery-MacBook-Surface-Thinkpad/dp/B0BLNDNBG1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">currently available for just $15.58.</a> That\u2019s a savings of 32 percent.

It\u2019s powered by an AMD Ryzen AI 5 340 processor and 16GB of RAM, which is enough for multitasking, web apps, or light creative work. You\u2019re also getting a roomy 512GB SSD, which is more storage than you\u2019d normally see at this price point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14-inch 1200p touchscreen is snappy and looks pretty good, just don\u2019t expect OLED-level color or contrast.
