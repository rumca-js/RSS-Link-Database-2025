It&#39;s been really challenging to build an open source community around it, and growth was slow. That was until I started using &quot;good first issue&quot; tags on my GitHub issues. <strong>If you&#39;re not using &quot;good first issue&quot; tags, you&#39;re missing out on a TON of visibility potential</strong>.</p> <p>After I started tagging some issues on the repo as &quot;good first issue&quot;, engagement in my project has exploded. People are discovering my project through using the tag. Seems like people can filter projects / issues for that tag to find contribution opportunities. Would love to hear anyone&#39;s experience using this, and if they have any other growth hacks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/matt8p\"> /u/matt8p </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https",

Slack is cleaner and better integrated with dev tools, but often feels too &quot;work-ish&quot; and quiet outside of office hours.
