I thought I&#39;d buy an iPod to listen to music (and I also didn&#39;t use Spotify a whole lot before either). Anyways, I needed some advice on how to download my entire liked songs to my iPod and also make them 320 kbps quality. I looked at zotify but it&#39;s too complicated for me, tbh. Hopefully there&#39;s another way I can search for a spotify song and download it one by one? That would also be nice, especially if I can see the cover art of the songs and albums.</p> <p>I appreciate any help, thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MoveZneedle\"> /u/MoveZneedle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1mh3m3u/need_some_guidance_with_downloading_music_to_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1mh3m3u/need_some_guidance_with_downloading_music_to_my/\">[comments]</a></span>",
