I&#39;ve always disliked using cloud services as they take all your data and do whatever with it. That&#39;s one of the main reasons I like to self host. However I have the advantage of being a technical person. That made me think, so many people are non-technical and basically have no other choice than to use cloud services and pay with their data.</p> <p>So I wonder, is it possible to provide some middle ground for them? Where servers are hosted/managed/maintained by a service provider but the (non-technical) user controls what software runs (maybe something like docker containers, but easier to use) and, more importantly, they control their own data. It would require some kind of encrypted container that not even the admins can access.</p> <p>On the truly self-hosted side, there is one solution already that is probably pretty close to the general idea: Synology Disk Stations.
