And indeed, Apple\u2019s little white discs used to be the most capable option, relying on a vast finding network of nearby iPhones to pinpoint lost tags. But now, both Google and Samsung have implemented finding networks of their own. And other Bluetooth tracker companies, like Chipolo and Pebblebee, now have trackers that pair with either Google or Apple\u2019s network too. In short, you\u2019ve got a lot of options for tagging and tracking your keys, backpacks, luggage and more.
