I don&#39;t really get the infamous black artifacts in any of my games that so many others seemed to get on the battlemage series cards.</p> <p>Plus, everything I play (enshrouded, genshin impact, red dead redemption 2, elden ring, kcd2) is giving me amazing performance, more than 60 fps on high settings (1080p), Coming from a gtx 1650 super, I&#39;m literally blown away by how much better this graphics card is at such a good price point.</p> <p>The fact that intel not only gave us such a budget friendly card but is also working on their driver support for linux is amazing. Do ya&#39;ll think intel can catch up to the two giants (amd and nvidia) in the gpu market?
