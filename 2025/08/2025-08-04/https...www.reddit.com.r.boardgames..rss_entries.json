I&#39;m trying to remember the name of a card game I played a while ago, but I can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere.</p> <p>From what I recall, the game involved players sitting in a circle with a deck of numbered cards\u2014possibly ranging from 1 to 100. Each turn, a player would play a card and claim it was higher than the previously played number. The next player then had to decide whether to believe them or call their bluff.</p> <p>If you called someone out and they were <em>lying</em>, they were out of the game. But if they were <em>telling the truth</em>, then <em>you</em> were out instead. I also remember the art style being kind of similar to <em>The Gang</em>, but it definitely isn&#39;t that game.</p> <p>Any ideas?

The example that spawned the thought was <strong>kingdomino drafting:</strong> open drafting with the options ordered and often with the next round&#39;s options visible. The better the item you draft, the later you draft next round so you weigh how much you want a specific item against how much you want to go first this round.</p> <p>This was re-implemented in several kingdomino titles: Queendomino, Kingdomino Origins, and Moon River.

I was there from friday to sunday and i have to say, it was one of the greatest experiences that this hobby can offer.</p> <p>In general, the event has two parts. One is a Spiel-like expo where publishers have booths and allow you to play upcoming releases or buy stuff. The other is a massive hall with a big game lending area where you can literally get <em>any game you want free of charge</em>! You just lend it, play it and then return.</p> <p>The first part is in many ways cooler than Essen because here you actually had a chance to try games due to the smaller scale.

In three weeks we&#39;re going to do more or less the same thing: just different location and we&#39;re looking for a new Boardgame, cuz we overplayed cascadia a little bit. Do you got any recommandations? It should&#39;nt be (much) longer then 1h, working well for 3 people and could defintly be more complex then cascadia. or should we try the expansion of cascadia?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>We are going to be staying on our boat at a marina for a few nights in a town that has a very extensive board game shop. We want to buy something locally there to play in the evenings. The table on the boat is maybe 2x3 feet so not a ton of room and we need to be able to take it down each night so we can use the table during the day. Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/3LeggedCheetah\"> /u/3LeggedCheetah </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mgyz79/best_2_player_board_game_for_a_small_table/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mgyz79/best_2_player_board_game_for_a_small_table/\">[comments]</a></span>",

But she will most definitely play a lot more if it&#39;s a game we can play while sitting on the couch (she injured her back and deals with chronic pain) We&#39;ve got a couple little trays we&#39;ll keep on our laps to play sometimes. But what are your favorite games to play on the couch that are pretty easy to? We set up carcassone the castle between us but that was a little big. </p> <p>Some games we&#39;ve played on the couch that we enjoy are our dragons and castles by Reiner Knizia, quacks of quiddlenburg, lorcana,keyforge and a couple others. </p> <p>What are ones that you think would work? Or have done yourself?</p> <p>I love all games from as simple as possible to the most complicated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/altusnoumena\"> /u/altusnoumena </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mgytsm/fa",
