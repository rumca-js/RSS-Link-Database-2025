In most games, you can apply a couple modifiers (I call them \u201cbuffs\u201d) to give the shot draw/fade and top-/backspin \u2014 it varies whether you set them before or during the shot.</p> <p><strong>Game Boy</strong>:</p> <p><em>Golf</em> - A Nintendo release, and it\u2019s basically a first draft of Mario Golf.

Ada/Sherry not yet implemented.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/RudeBoy4RomUA/Resident-Evil-2-HealthBar-for-DualShock4\">Github page</a></p> <p><strong>You will need to Enable Shared Memory in DuckStation Advanced settings, for this script to work.</strong></p> <p>It works bad with vibration enabled. So the best option is to play without vibration. You have to set up Digital Controller instead of Analog Controller. In other case, you will experience blue flashing color every time vibration is triggered. Currently there is no way to fix that.</p> <p>Im not a programmer or software develloper, yet I have spent some time with AI to create this.<b",
