Do you think there&#39;s any hope for a return to functionality or... more realistically, that another service might pop-up and replace it at some point?

What a masterpiece of atmospheric, visual storytelling.</p> <p>But what&#39;s really gotten under <em>my</em> skin is the soundtrack by Mica Levi. It&#39;s barely even &quot;music.&quot; It&#39;s the sound of an alien consciousness trying to understand our world. The screeching violins, the simple, repetitive three-note motif that signals the hunt... it creates a sense of dread and a strange, predatory sensuality that I&#39;ve never heard before.</p> <p>It reminds me of the way bands like Heilung use sound to create a ritual, or how Giger used art to show us something beautifully terrifying. It&#39;s a score that doesn&#39;t just support the movie; it <em>is</em> the movie.</p> <p>Just had to share. This one&#39;s going to stick with me for a long, long time.</p> </div><",

It\u2019s one of the grittiest and most intense war films I\u2019ve seen, visually brutal, emotionally heavy, and incredibly immersive. The way it captures the tension inside that tank, the exhaustion, the fear, and the slow erosion of humanity really hits hard. I get that it\u2019s not as polished or uplifting as some other war movies but maybe that\u2019s the point. For those who\u2019ve seen it, did it leave a strong impression on you too or did it miss the mark somehow?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdhesivenessOld6132\"> /u/AdhesivenessOld6132 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mh2wsi/fury/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mh2wsi/fury/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This leads to a violent clash between them early on, before they reach an uneasy truce. Ward is the brains while Anderson is the muscle.</p> <p>All the villains in this film are despicable, but IMO Frank Bailey ( Rooker ) is the worst. On top of being a violent homophobic racist thug, he&#39;s a complete psychopath. Absolutely batshit crazy on top of being pure evil.
