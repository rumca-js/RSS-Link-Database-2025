I tried startpage, DDG, and Brave, and none of them have Kagi&#39;s main useful feature: the ability to pin, raise, lower, or block sites from appearing. There are search types I make regularly that aren&#39;t even on page 1 in a normal search engine without that feature, so they are effectively useless. </p> <p>Is there any free alternative that has this?

This explanation will cover the cryptographic protocols, hardware security measures, and software architectures involved. Cryptographic Protocol Stack 1. Key Generation and Management * Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): * Proton uses elliptic curve cryptography for key generation, specifically the Curve25519 and Curve448 curves. These curves are chosen for their strong security properties and efficient performance, making them suitable for resource-constrained environments like mobile devices. * Key Generation Process: 1. A random private key (d) is generated on the user&#39;s device. 2. The corresponding public key (Q) is derived ",
