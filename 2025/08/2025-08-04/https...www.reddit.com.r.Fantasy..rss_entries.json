Initially, you are tasked with catching fish to supply the village of Greater Marrow with one major warning: return to the safety of land before the fog rolls in at night. Sometimes, the fish you catch come up...wrong, with strange deformities or other properties. This eventually sets you on a quest by a mysterious man with a strange book to collect artifacts across the archipelago for a dangerous ritual.</p> <p>Overall, I really enjoyed Dredge. There are many moments of capturing the unsettling nature of the deep ocean and the fear of crossing. The game does an amazing job of creating ambiance and the story was enjoyable. The main game would take about 10 hours depending on how many side quests you want to track down or how much you enjoy the fishing.</p> <p>There are two DLCs, Pale Reach and Iron Rig. Pale Reach adds another area, an icy regio",

I&#39;d also take anything that has a fairy tale or mythological feel to the magic, such as how Elric uses blind warriors to combat the mirror of memory.

Palatable to all but not filling and easily tiresome. It like nobody progressed their tastes past what most people read in 6th grade just add sex. I need something more equivalent to steak and greens and PO-TA-TOES. I need a deep world i need complex involved majics i need thought out political structures.
