So how one can help her see how wrong she is in this instance? To be clear shes not a ultra bigoted maga asshole &quot;following&quot; the bible or shit like that ,she pretty open minded on a lot of subject and i believe shes just very very badly misinformed on the topic Sorry in avance for two thing First i hope my post was respectful to the community (i m a dumb cis guy so yeah i try to be an ally but ",
