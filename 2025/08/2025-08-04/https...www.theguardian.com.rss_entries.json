Rio Ngumoha further enhanced his first team claims with a sparkling display against Athletic Bilbao that underlined the formidable strength, and options, available to Arne Slot.</p><p>Ngumoha opened the scoring superbly and teed up a second goal for Darwin N\u00fa\u00f1ez inside five minutes at Anfield in the first of two pre-season friendlies against the Basque club. A packed Anfield crowd had to wait for the second fixture to catch a first glimpse of new signings Florian Wirtz, Milos Kerkez, Giorgi Mamardashvili, Hugo Ekitik\u00e9 and Jeremie Frimpong. Ngumoha kept them entertained and whetted the appetite prior to their appearances as Liverpool recorded a comfortable 4-1 win in match one.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fo",

In fact, the outer path might just be the way to reach your inner peace</p><p>The ancient Aztecs aren\u2019t usually grouped with today\u2019s self-help gurus. But their philosophy, preserved in early post-conquest records, offers surprisingly sharp tools for modern life. Unlike stoicism or Buddhism, which emphasize internal reflection as the path to a better life, the Aztecs believed that you should start with your surroundings, your relationships, your body and speech. In their view, wisdom begins outside. Here are 10 lessons from their \u201coutward path\u201d, starting with those that clarify life goals.</p><p>Drive (high-intensity action),</p><p>Durability (consistent effort), and</p><p>Discipline (resistance to temptation).</p><p>Sebastian Purcell is an associate professor of philosophy at Suny-Cortland in New York, where he researches ethics, Aztec philosophy and mathematical logic.
