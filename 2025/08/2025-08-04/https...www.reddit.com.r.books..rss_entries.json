I have read over 300 books in the last two years. Now that I read everyday I feel like it is my favorite hobby.

As someone who has a wanderlust trying to find out more about various parts of the world off the beaten path, no place deserves a better look than one of the most southern countries in the world and a surprisingly large one at that. </p> <p>Before reading <em>A Flower Traveled in My Blood: The Incredible True Story of the Grandmothers Who Fought to Find a Stolen Generation of Children</em>, my Argentina knowledge probably was in line with most everyone coming from a similar background: I know where it is on a map, I\u2019m aware of the new president, I know inflation has been a serious issue, and then there\u2019s this \u201cPeron\u201d guy who some sa",

Especially the description of Marianne&#39;s home, her brother etc, really annoyed me because it seemed so childish almost. </p> <p>However, my second read went much better. I don&#39;t know what happened. Maybe I have changed because I went to therapy and had some mental health challenges myself. Suddenly I could appreciate the story. I guess this time I didn&#39;t really try to relate to the characters, and instead of being annoyed by their decisions I tried to see their motivations more and tried to understand their (often corrupted) perception of their surroundings. </p> <p>Even though some small things still really bothered me, like some little university stereotypes and simulacra of &quot;cool college life&quot;, I would actually give it three or four stars now instead of zero. Maybe I just had to be older? When I fi",
