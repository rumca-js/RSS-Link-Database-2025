Now I\u2019m going have to read books in parts over the course of the week (cause I will no kidding go crazy without any new books) I want some recommendations that won\u2019t have me completely distracted during the day till I can pick the book up but I will still enjoy. I will add that I am still a teenager and have read ACOTR and that seemed high end spice for me so either around that level or lower but with romance obviously Other books I liked: - throne of glass - serpent and wings of night - wooing the witch queen - once upon a broken heart - belladonna - tale as old as time Honestly I could go on Sorry this is so long I just wanted to provide all the details <",

Palatable to all but not filling and easily tiresome. It like nobody progressed their tastes past what most people read in 6th grade just add sex. I need something more equivalent to steak and greens and PO-TA-TOES. I need a deep world i need complex involved majics i need thought out political structures. I found a bit of it in the Crown of Stars series (genuinely liked that one i could critique it but it felt nice) can anyone recommend some good meaty book/series? yall are my kind of people if",
