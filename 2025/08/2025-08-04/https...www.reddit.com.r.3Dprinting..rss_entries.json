He is missing a back leg but he&#39;s missing it all the way into the socket. He got attacked by a dog when he was about 1 and the resulting injuries ended up with an amputated leg as a stray at the pound. He&#39;s done quite well with 3 legs most of his life but now he&#39;s about 10 and is showing his age. Would anyone in this community have a design or stl to recommend that let&#39;s him use the bathroom and support him comfortably? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/elektrostatic\"> /u/elektrostatic </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mh19d9\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",
