        "description": "Join Shelby, a black bear biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildelife Conservation Commission (FWC), and her all-female team in South Florida as they embark on a critical mission: capturing and tagging black bears. Their goal? To gather vital population data to help estimate the growth of Florida's black bear numbers. This essential research aims to discover whether or not black bear subpopulations across the state are interconnected and thriving thanks to protected wildlife corridors, or if further conservation efforts need to be made to protect species amidst rapid human development. \n\nRead more about Black Bears in Florida: https://on.natgeo.com/4mmCmv3\n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: http://natgeo.com/ytngmagazine\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\u27a1 Get more Nat Geo Full Episodes: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLivjPDlt6ApSiD2mk9Ngp-5dZ9CDDn72O\n\u27a1 Get more Nat Geo Wild Full Episodes: https://youtu.be/qAG2SkTPltw\n\nAnd check out more Nationa",
