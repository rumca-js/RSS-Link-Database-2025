In the beginning it was all fine and working, i got a solid seeding speed of ~800Mbits after configuring everything (I have 1 Gigabit internet speed). Lately though it\u2019s like no traffic goes through. </p> <p>There are countless of times that I get a bad gateway or time out whenever i try to open any website. The torrent takes ages to retrieve metadata and my upload/download speed can go anywhere between 50KiB/s to 70MiB/s. Usually at the higher end when i\u2019m idling and not doing anything else and after having it run for a while. But it\u2019s been getting worse and worse and worse and i have no clue why. </p> <ul> <li>I\u2019ve tried changing from Wireguard TCP to UDP, no luck. </li> <li>I\u2019ve tried changing firewall privileges, no luck. </li> <li>I\u2019ve tried changing countries, mixed results.</li> <li>I\u2019ve tried setting connection limi",

And this issue is affecting both Sonarr and Radarr.</p> <p><strong>[READ BELOW FOR INFO]</strong> Essentially, the issue is, is that whenever I download something through Sonarr, which goes to qbittorrent, it downloads into /synology/TV. However, sonarr is creating an empty folder for the show in /synology/TV/[Show name]. After the download is completed in qbittorrent, the download isn&#39;t moved into that folder, it remains in /synology/TV.</p> <p>E.G. I send a request for &quot;Friends&quot; from sonarr. Sonarr then creates the empty folder &quot;Friends (1994)&quot;, so the directory would be /synology/TV/&quot;Friends (1994)&quot;.<br/> HOWEVER, when the media download is completed and removed from /synology/Incomplete, it gets placed in /synology/TV not .../&quot;Friends (1994)&quot;.<br/> It obviously shows that it is going to the save path I have for the qbittorrent category &quot;tv-sona",
