According to The Register, the company has selected Hyundai to support the deployment of the \"HyperGrid,\" describing it as the \"world's largest advanced energy campus.\" From the report: The project is backed by Rick Perry, who served as Texas governor and US Energy Secretary, and investor Toby Neugebauer, and aims to establish Texas as the US's largest energy and intelligence campus. Construction of the first of four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors is set to begin next year in Amarillo with the plant funneling behind-the-meter power to GPU bit barns by 2032, at least that's according to a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In other words, there is no guarantee the 23 million square meter project (1.1 MilliWales) will actually be built in its entirety, but if it is, Hyundai will oversee it.\n \n\"This agreement is significant in that it allows us to partic",

Murray, a commercial model herself, said it made her feel sad and exhausted. The iconic denim company had teamed up with the AI studio Lalaland.ai to create \"diverse\" digital fashion models for more inclusive ads. For an industry that has failed for years to employ diverse human models, the backlash was swift, with New York Magazine calling the decision \"artificial diversity.\"\n \n\"Modeling as a profession is already challenging enough without having to compete with now new digital standards of perfection that can be achieved with AI,\" Murray told TechCrunch. Two years later, her worries have compounded. Brands continue to experiment with AI-generated models, to the consternation of many fashion lovers.

The 31-year-old electrical engineer says poor reception is a common frustration for residents of Vermont's Orange County. To address this issue, he's providing his community with a new way to stay connected.\n \nSchlott has taken old pay phones, modified them to make free calls, and set them up in three different towns across the county. He buys the phones secondhand from sites like eBay and Craigslist and restores them in his home workshop. With just an internet connection, these phones can make calls anywhere in the U.S. or Canada -- no coins required. And Schlott covers all the operating costs himself. \"It's cheap enough where I'm happy just footing the bill,\" he says. \"You know, if I'm spending $20 a month on, say, Netflix, I coul",

The driver of the crisis is a huge acceleration of plastic production, which has increased by more than 200 times since 1950 and is set to almost triple again to more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060. \n\n[...] Plastic pollution has also soared, with 8 billion tonnes now polluting the entire planet, the review said, from the top of Mount Everest to the deepest ocean trench.

This reliable growth model is now under pressure. \n\nThe multiplier has weakened considerably, falling from a peak of 4.1x to a projected 1.6x. This is contributing to a prolonged slowdown period for India IT exports. A primary factor in this slowdown is a clear shift in client spending priorities.

McKinsey, approaching its 100th anniversary, reduced its workforce by 5,000 employees since late 2023 while its revenue growth slowed to 2% in 2024. \n\nBoston Consulting Group closed the gap significantly, growing 10% and reducing McKinsey's revenue advantage from more than double in 2012 to just one-fifth larger today. Technology companies including Palantir and OpenAI now offer consulting-like services to help businesses implement AI models, with Palantir's revenue growing 39% year-over-year. The shift threatens consulting's core business model, as clients may eventually question paying premium fees when AI can perform much of the analytical work traditionally done by human consultants.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=How+McKinsey+Lost+Its+Ed",
