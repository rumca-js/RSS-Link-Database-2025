Last time they were in the front of the race of public models like gpt4, they ended up just being distilled by other companies. I think the strategy here is to try as hard as possible to develop agi in house first even if that means releasing a cheaper version of chatgpt to users to save money to go to internal agi production. To the people that think that ai is slowing down i would just say look at advances such as Genie and even Gemini pro. I think the next shift is that frontier models are probably gonna shift to being inhouse so that they dont get distilled by Chinese companies.

I&#39;ve been playing around with generators like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and Leonardo AI, and while they are incredibly powerful for many things, generating consistent and accurate human figures across sessions is very difficult. For example, I&#39;ve noticed certain words or contexts seem to trigger filters or just lead to nonsensical results. It&#39;s almost like the AI has a hard time interpreting certain everyday scenarios involving people. I even tried to generate an image related to sleep and found that the word &quot;bed&quot; in my prompt seemed to throw things off completely, leading to bizarre or filtered outputs saying it&#39;s explicit.
