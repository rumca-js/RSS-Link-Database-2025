The idea came from my own frustration of loading the kids into the car, driving across town, and realizing the playground was either too old for them, not fenced in, had no shade, or simply was not a good fit. I wanted something that could tell me ahead of time exactly what to expect.</p> <p>Right now the app has three main features. Explore lets you search for playgro",

Most people either pay accountants a lot of money or get lost trying to figure it out themselves.</p> <p>So I made an AI tool trained on the entire IRS code and instructions to help make it easier to understand. It\u2019s 100% free, no ads, no logins, no upsells \u2014 just something I built because I wanted to see if I could make taxes less painful for regular people.</p> <p>Would love to get your feedback. <a href=\"http://Taxchatai.com\">Taxchatai.com</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TaxChatAI\"> /u/TaxChatAI </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mlcyc4/high_schooler_here_built_an_ai_tool_to_make_sense/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mlcyc4/high_schooler_here_built_an_ai_tool_to_make_se",
