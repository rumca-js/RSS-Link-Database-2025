They are all pretty much identical, its Debian + docker packaged with a nice UI and app store, sometimes with nice goodies like monitoring, remoting added.

I\u2019ve also played around with free cloud services like AWS Free Tier. I couldn\u2019t get Oracle Cloud to work (they wouldn\u2019t accept my debit card), and I eventually got paranoid about surprise charges, so I decided to host things locally instead.</p> <p>I started out with the main Docker Desktop app on Windows but eventually moved to Docker Compose once I got more comfortable with the terminal. So far, I\u2019ve got Portainer, Watchtower, File Browser, Vaultwarden, Jellyfin, qBittorrent, Navidrome, Kavita, Speedtest Tracker, and more.

I&#39;ve got a separate NFS share that I was hoping to put the backup on. I was going to try using Velero, but Velero out of the box needs an S3 bucket (or the equivalent). There seems to be a plugin for backup up to NFS, but I&#39;m not clear on how to use it.</p> <p>I can set up a VM with an S3 service (Garage or MinIO, probably). But that&#39;d be on the same hardware as the cluster, so kind of pointless for backups. Unless there&#39;s a way to back <em>that</em> up? I can put one of the PVCs on the NFS share, which at least gets that data in a different place. Or maybe hunt down the hardware for another server, so there&#39;s a little redundancy.</p> <p>Anyone have experience with something like this?

A lot of the services that run docker compose use redis and I&#39;m basically just using default settings.
