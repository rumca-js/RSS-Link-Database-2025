The two countries have come closer to ending 35 years of enmity by signing a peace treaty in Washington and agreeing to a US private consortium taking control of a strategic corridor on Iran\u2019s border.</p><p>The corridor passing through southern Armenia will link Azerbaijan with its exclave Nakhchivan, a longstanding demand of Baku. The US will operate the corridor under Armenian sovereignty on a 99-year land lease, changing the balance of power in the region. Some Iranian commentators claimed the deal amounts to \u201cIran\u2019s geopolitical suffocation in the region\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/09/iran-and-russia-stand-to-lose-from-us-deal-with-azerbaijan-and-armenia\">Continue reading.",

You can only see the stepdad\u2019s eyes in the rearview mirror, but you instantly know it\u2019s Steve Carell. At this point, I loved Carell. He\u2019s the reason that I, then a teenager, watched the film.</p><p>\u201cDuncan \u2026 let me ask you something,\u201d Carell\u2019s character says. \u201cOn a scale of one to 10, what do you think you are?\u201d Duncan responds shyly that he thinks he\u2019s a six. Any normal adult would balk and correct him. Tell him he\u2019s nothing less than a 10. \u201cI think you\u2019re a three,\u201d says Carell\u2019s character, Trent. Suddenly, I hated Carell with a blind fury. He was a vision of pure evil.
