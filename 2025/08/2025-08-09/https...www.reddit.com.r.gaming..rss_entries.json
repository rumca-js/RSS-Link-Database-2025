It feels like BF again, although I do think the TTK criticisms are accurate. However, despite the fact that I have put thousands of hours into BF multiplayer across BC2, BF 3, 4 and 1, and that for a significant period of my life multiplayer FPS games were probably 60% of my gaming... I just don&#39;t enjoy them anymore. I find them anxiety producing and stressful. It&#39;s a weird realization. Maybe its having exponentially more responsibility now, or just being old and tired, but despite feeling like it was nice to see BF get back to being BF, I couldn&#39;t make it more than about 10 matches.</p> <p>EDIT: My wife saw this and was like, &quot;Maybe they should make old man modes the same way Rao&#39;s makes a &quot;Sensitive Marinara&quot; sauce that you like?&quot;</p> <p>Welp guess I&#39;m done living.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",
