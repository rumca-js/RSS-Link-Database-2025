Specifically after I made the mistake of punching a new game on it. </p> <p>So, I decided to get a large surface, extra sticky lint roller. That thing works like a charm! It looks like a paint roller so you can cover the whole table surface quickly. I&#39;m so impressed with how well it works and wanted to share!

I was wondering if anyone might have any of the sets (full cases or single box games) they\u2019ve already played through and would be willing to pass along for free or for a small price.</p> <p>I\u2019m happy to cover shipping costs and would be so grateful for anything you\u2019d be open to sending my way. My friends and I are big mystery lovers, but we haven\u2019t had the chance to try a Hunt A Killer game yet. We love solving puzzles together and I know we would have an amazing time experiencing one of these stories for the first time.</p> <p>I would also love to hear your recommendations for other mystery or puzzle games you\u2019ve enjoyed. Even if you don\u2019t have a set to pass along, your suggestions would mean a lot and help me and my friends discover more great games to play together.</p> <p>Thank you for considering this and for being such a welcoming ",

Pop Culture I can&#39;t recommend this game enough. I like to use both the original version and the pop culture version. This game is easily the best game for absolute beginners to intermediate students to practice using &quot;to be&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot;. Also, they will learn the names of 100s of daily items naturally while playing this game. A couple of house rule that work well for my classes... 1) all students are allowed to glance at their card again whenever anyone loses and takes a point. 2) Loser has to do a 20 second TikTok dance BUT no one is allowed to record it! \ud83d\ude05 BONUS: The game doubles as flashcards!</p> <p>My second recommendation: So Clover/Just One Just One naturally work",
