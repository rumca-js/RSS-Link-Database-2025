Unfortunately, it was a condescending, complaint filled &quot;explanation&quot; how software licenses worked and that I was entitled for thinking that license would work forever (I bought the Puffin Pro license back when that was still a thing). I responded, essentially saying how it&#39;s still scummy for a company to offer a &quot;lifetime license&quot; and then killswitch the entire app within a year, switching to the same price model but monthly instead of one time. I recieved more of the same &quot;oh you just don&#39;t understand how this works&quot;, which I do. So I made that clear, and was then called a &quot;cheater and a liar&quot;, alongside a pirate. Whoever this person is, responding to my review edits is vitriolic, hates pirates, and blames them (and not the company&#39;s greed) for everything. Our excha",
