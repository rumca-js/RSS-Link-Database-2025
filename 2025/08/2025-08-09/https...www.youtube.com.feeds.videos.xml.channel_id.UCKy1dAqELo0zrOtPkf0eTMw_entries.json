        "description": "Metal Gear Solid 3, Yakuza 0, Red Dead Redemption 2, what is the best video game prequel of all time? Let's find out.\n\nPrequel games often benefit from better technology and development tools, making them visually and technically more impressive than their predecessors. But truly great prequels aren\u2019t just remembered for how they look or play, but by how they transform the way we experience the original games we fell in love with and add to the stories we already hold dear.\u00a0\n\nWith that in mind, the following prequels were chosen not just for their technological and gameplay achievements, but because they forever changed the way we look at some of our favorite characters and worlds. That extra chance to develop and deepen what we already hold dear means some games on this list are even considered the best in their entire series. So without further ado, here are the 10 best video game prequels ever made.\n\n#IGN #MetalGearSolid #RedDeadRedemption",

        "description": "Before The Avengers, the X-Men, and Spider-Man, there was Marvel\u2019s first family, a group of characters who\u2019ve been re-imagined several times. But when it comes to their movies, something\u2019s usually amiss. Created by artist Jack Kirby and writer Stan Lee, the Fantastic Four have been a mainstay of Marvel comics since the company\u2019s inception in 1961, up to and including major crossover events like the 2015 Secret Wars, the basis for its own Avengers crossover. So why didare the Fantastic Four go, OH for four on the big screen before arriving in the MCU? Why was it so hard to make a good Fantastic Four movie?\n\nWith Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby leading a new iteration with The Fantastic Four: First Steps into the MCU, they're entry is pretty clearly the strongest. But it's worth looking in to 20th Century Fox and the old days of Comic Book movies that even pre Captain America Chris Evans couldn't save.
