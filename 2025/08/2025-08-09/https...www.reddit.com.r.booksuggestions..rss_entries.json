I want a book that deals with themes of fame such as the dark side of fame, dealing with fake people with ill intentions, the struggle to find real romance. The book can also follow the life of a socialite but I\u2019m mainly just looking for something written from the perspective of someone who has a good amount of fame.

I know it\u2019s the beginning of August but I am just really eager to get into my fall reads! I have never read horror before so to be honest I\u2019m not really sure where to start. I love literary fiction, historical fiction and fantasy. I\u2019ve only been reading for like 4 months and so far I\u2019ve really liked anything by V.E. Schwab, Fredrik Backman and Kristin Hannah if that help but I am open to any recommendations!
