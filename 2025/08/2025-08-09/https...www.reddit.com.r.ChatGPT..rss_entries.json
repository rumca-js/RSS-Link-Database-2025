I&#39;m not just complaining about a minor dip in quality; I mean every single use case I had is now providing unusable results.</p> <p>My workflow was perfect. I was a heavy user, paying for Plus and even the Pro tier when my projects demanded it. I had specific instruction templates for work, for my studies, for personal projects, and even just for messing around and learning new topics with 4o. I knew exactly which model to pick for which task, and it worked beautifully.</p> <p>This new model feels like a cheap, restrictive router. The fact that the API is now dirt cheap is a huge red flag for me. It screams cost-saving move. My theory, OpenAI felt the heat from all the recent AI releases and rushed out this router system that is nowhere near ready, just so they could have a launch. I also read a comment here that made a lot of sense: this kind of &quot;best&quot; model indicates we are nowhere near the AGI they tried ",
