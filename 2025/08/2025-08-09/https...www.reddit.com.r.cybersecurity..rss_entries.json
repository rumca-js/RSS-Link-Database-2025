I work in a SOC and we are currently evaluating options. One thing we have felt is that most AI tools focus on their own platform only for alert triage (Crowdstrike&#39;s Charlotte AI) or that they are more like chatbots (AI copilots). I&#39;d be keen to hear if there are any use cases out there we are not aware of before committing to a certain path. What we&#39;d like to see is something that can actually automate analyst workflows and then present findings back to reduce time spent on L1 triage tasks. That way, our analysts can focus on more complex tasks. </p> <p>I&#39;ve written up some thoughts/initial research here: <a href=\"https://robed28.substack.com/p/cyber-security-vendor-ai-tools\">https://robed28.substack.com/p/cyber-security-vendor-ai-tools</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rob_ed28\"> /u/rob_e",
