If a package has a breaking change that causes some issues, you can just reboot into the second partition and restore the first one. All of this is done without BTRFS relying on the stability of ext4. Thats kind of the point why i made it.</p> <p>So, it creates 7 partitions on the specified disk (look at the post&#39;s image) and labels them as well.</p> <p>I hope to see testers, contributors or people willing to join the team!

In that time I never used a terminal file manager. Prior to Unix I used DOS 3.x and I think Norton Utilities had a terminal file manager, but I primarily used &quot;ncd&quot; - which zsh&#39;s cd + cdpath manages to scratch the same itch.</p> <p>Anyway, generally just use the shell to do my file management. And it works for me. However, this old dog is always up to learn some new tricks. So if you use a terminal file manager, what problems make you turn to it? Which ones, is there a configuration to it you&#39;ve done that makes it awesome for you?</p> <p>I&#39;ve installed nnn, lf and mc to play with them to see what I&#39;m missing. So far it&#39;s not obvious, but I&#39;m also at the &quot;learn the keys&quot; stage. Hoping that once I&#39;m through that I&#39;ll see some replies with some things to try.",

I&#39;ve got a Geforce 1660 Super and I&#39;m using the default NVIDIA drivers with the linux-lts kernel. Everything works perfectly fine when I boot using an HDMI cable. I can also boot without any monitor cables and then plug in my DisplayPort cable afterward, and it works great. The problem only happens when I try to boot from the very beginning with the DisplayPort cable plugged in. The system throws a kernel panic with the message &quot;VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)&quot;. The attached image shows the full error. It seems to be an issue specifically with booting while the DisplayPort is connected, which I know sounds strange. Has anyone seen anything like this before or have any ideas what might be causing it? Any help would be awesome.

But I hate having to re-flash my USB every time I want a new distro on it. I\u2019ve had some bad past experiences with certain OSs that ended up ruining the USB (my fault).</p> <p>Recently, I discovered Ventoy, and thought it was a fun alternative to the flashing method with Rufus or Balena. However, I\u2019ve realized not all OSs work well with Ventoy. I set up a virtual machine and tried ZorinOS and Ubuntu, but they haven\u2019t been running smoothly plus the lag is kind of a mood killer.</p> <p>So, if you guys have any recommendations, and maybe a good Oracle VM setup, that\u2019d be great. One day I do want to switch to Linux, but I\u2019m not ready to jump straight into it just yet.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IAm",
