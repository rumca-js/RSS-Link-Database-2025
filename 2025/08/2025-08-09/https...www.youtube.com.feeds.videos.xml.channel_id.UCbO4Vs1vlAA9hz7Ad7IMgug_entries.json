        "description": "DEFIANCE is almost here! HALO has a new faction in the form of renegade Brutes and Elites that have come storming into the battlefield. With a new Points Match system for big games with no respawn, new guns and units, Defiance adds a whole new dimension to the HALO game.  Take command of a Squad of Spartans in Red or Blue and throw down in familiar game modes in HALO: Flashpoint, based on the Deadzone system.\n\nThanks to Mantic for the complimentary copy of the box to review. \n\nGMG is publicly supported.
