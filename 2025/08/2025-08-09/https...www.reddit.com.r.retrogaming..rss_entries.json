I mean like a life lesson; a takeaway, something tangible.</p> <p>I enjoy this process over the calculated, traditional review. If I&#39;m not overly concerned about whether the controls were a 6/10 or the graphics an 8.5/10, I feel like games have a lot more to say. They can point to truths in our real world and act as a catalyst to evoke deeper thoughts, feelings or discoveries. </p> <p>Seriously. Even a seemingly simply game like TMNT on NES sent me down a rabbit (tortoise?) hole, pondering the realities of &quot;playing favorites&quot; in social groups, and how we as humans subconsciously assign hierarchical status to the people in a group based on their capacity to bring value to said group (hint: Leo&#39;s been demoted to &quot;doing machines&quot; and someone else is getting a promotion).

I have used it with my N64, NES, PS1 and PS2 with zero issues.</p> <p>For some reason though it isn&#39;t working right with my Genesis Model 1. The picture quality is great but there is no sound. If I unplug the video though, the sound immediately starts working. If i then plug composite the video back in the sound immediately stops. </p> <p>Being a model 1 it&#39;s din port only has a single audio channel. Thinking it was an issue with the Retroscaler 2X requiring a signal to both ports i got a splitter to split the mono into two RCA plugs which did nothing.</p> <p>Thinking that maybe there was an issue with the signal strength that was causing issues, I bought a headphone to 2 RCA adapter to use the headphone jack on the front",
