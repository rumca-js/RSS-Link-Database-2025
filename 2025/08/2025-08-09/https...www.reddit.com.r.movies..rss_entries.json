I cant explain how incredible these movies are and also for being released in the early 70&#39;s they hold up very well. </p> <p>Part 1 10/10</p> <p>Part 2 10/10</p> <p>Part 3 8/10 (incredible and al pacino acting is masterclass) just some issues with pacing in my opinion. While being weaker than the OG 1,2 its still an amazing movie. </p> <p>Dont be like me and please go watch ASAP!!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/previouslyontheflash\"> /u/previouslyontheflash </a> <br/> ",

Rhonda is shown straight away to be the smartest person in the group, but not in a cringy or overdone way, and it\u2019s never questioned or undermined. Val, Earl, and everyone else just accept it and keep looking to her for advice.</p> <p>&quot;What&#39;s it doing, Rhonda? Why do you keep asking me?&quot;</p> <p>There\u2019s the usual romantic plot, but it doesn\u2019t take away from her role. Even the romance sidesteps the usual clich\u00e9s. There\u2019s a scene where Val cleans Rhonda\u2019s wounds and her legs are clearly unshaven \u2014 of course they are, she\u2019s been out in the desert doing research and shaving isn\u2019t exactly a priority. He doesn\u2019t care at all. The fact that it\u2019s even shown feels unusual. For a big mainstream creature feature in the early nineties",
