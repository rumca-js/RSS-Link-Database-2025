Now, with large language models in the mix, the question isn\u2019t just what your app does out of the box, but what you allow AI tools to do with it.</p> <p>In this post I look at two clear patterns for making software AI-friendly: </p> <ul> <li>Expose a command surface (like MCP) so an LLM can call your app\u2019s functions directly.</li> <li>Expose a programmable surface (SDK, DSL, low-code) and let the LLM write code that uses it.</li> </ul> <p>Both have strengths, trade-offs, and a place in most serious products. The key is deciding where to draw the line \u2014 and making sure the door you open matches the way your users (and their AIs) actually work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WifeEyedFascination\"> /u/WifeEyedFascin",
