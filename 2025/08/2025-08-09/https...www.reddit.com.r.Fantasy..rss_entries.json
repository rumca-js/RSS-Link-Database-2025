What starts out as the framing of a pair of thieves for regicide quickly turns into a series spanning plot involving the fate of all mankind, and the bromance between Royce and Hadrian is just so much fun to read about.</p> <p>From what I understand the author <a href=\"/u/MichaelJSullivan\">u/MichaelJSullivan</a> purposefully wrote the series so that each book is more complex and even better than the last, and that he wrote the entire series before publishing the first volume, and from what I understand he absolutely sticks the landing with the final two volumes.</p> <p>If you haven&#39;t checked them out yet and are looking for a fun read, give the first omnibus volume (titled Theft of Swords) a try, you might just enjoy it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GamerGee",

More people should read Tanith Lee in general, but even compared to works like Tales from the Flat Earth or Silver Metal Lover, Paradys doesn&#39;t get mentioned much.</p> <p>The Books are a series of connected novellas and stories, not sharing characters, but setting, theme and concepts. The books all take place in Paradys (Paradis, Par Dis...), different version of alternative Paris. Not Paris with the grandeur of the Enlightenment or the licentiousness of Bohemia, but gothic Paris. Goth Paris. The aesthetics of Notre Dame and the Catacombs, the atmosphere of being lost in labyrinthine alleyways as the absinthe is wearing off. The stories are all explorations of similar dark themes- damnation, madness, death, sex, violence.</p> <p><strong>The Secret Books of Parad",

They\u2019re all anger\u2014 the big political plots are solved just with aggression and outbursts.

And the way everyone treats Kip for being fat is just\u2026 c\u2019mon\u2026 it\u2019s treated like a joke.

I absolutely loved Hobbit, it feels rich, personal and full of life. After that, I started LotR. </p> <p>I liked some aspects of LotR, which kept me going for some time. Now, after the Battle of Helm&#39;s Deep, I decided to drop it. Though I love the writing and worldbuilding, the story is just too predictable for me. Also, I love villains with lots of personality, and LotR doesn&#39;t really focus on that either. LotR is great, but doesn&#39;t really do it for me. </p> <p>Now I&#39;ve been wondering whether I should pick up Wheel of Time, by Robert Jordan. I&#39;ve read that Jordan tried to follow a similar style as Tolkien, however. How different is it from LotR? </p> <p>If WoT turns out to be too similar, I&#39;ll likely try Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
