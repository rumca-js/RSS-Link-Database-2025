Unfortunately. The article states the safest place for your data is not on the phone, but in the cloud. I&#39;m starting to think all apps should be configured this way.</p> <p>It goes on. No matter how much effort you put in securing a Pixel, even with GrapheneOS, you will not be safe from justice and forensics research, as is now proven.</p> <p>So the question is: Do we really need to pay Google \u20ac800,+ for a Pixel, that can be just as insecure and easily cracked as any other phone with other, maybe fair, hardware component, just to be able to deGoogle?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot_Bee5198\"> /u/Hot_Bee5198 </a> <br/> <span><a hr",

I don&#39;t plan to root, because GrapheneOS should handle any ambient privacy concerns I have, and I need this as my &#39;daily driver&#39;.</p> <p>What apps would you guys recommend once I get my phone upgraded to GrapheneOS?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TaatsNGR\"> /u/TaatsNGR </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1mleyj6/what_should_i_expect_moving_to_grapheneos_from_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.red",
