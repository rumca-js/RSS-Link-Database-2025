I tried using Unity Mod Manager added as a non-Steam game running Proton and it even says &quot;Installed&quot;, but then it keeps reporting &quot;<strong>Access denied</strong>&quot; when I try to add mods. I can straight-up extract mods into the Mods folder after UMM installation and they even show up in UMM. However, UMM and the mods don&#39;t load up when I start WOTR.</p> <p>This is strange to me because I used this method when modding Pathfinder: Kingmaker in Fedora 42 and it worked well so it must be some distro difference. And yes, I did take ownership of all non-root drives and even reinstalled the game on the same disk as the UMM.</p> <p>Would appreciate any help.

I know Steam has Proton but I haven&#39;t looked at how to install Steam games with it. How difficult will it be in getting my games from Epic Games and GOG to run under Proton? </p> <p>I also use Vortex from NexusMods to mod a few games, Cyberpunk 2077 &amp; Oblivion Remastered. How difficult is it getting that set up? </p> <p>Thanks in advance. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jonr1138\"> /u/Jonr1138 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mly45i/looking_for_a_little_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mly45i/looking_for_a_little_help/\">[comments]</",
