        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, Patrick Hart of Aria Labs creates an interactive procedural music score from scratch with MetaSounds, Quartz, and other UE Audio features. \n\nUnreal Engine has made it easier than ever to get started making procedural music in games. This talk aims to demystify the process and show that it\u2019s easier than one might think to integrate a rich procedural soundscape into your project.\n\nThe project shown in the video starts with the First Person Shooter template, and builds a procedural system that generates background music with multiple layers, synchronizes and tunes gunshots to the music, and triggers musical changes and flourishes from gameplay.\n\nThe presentation explores how to manage procedurally generated sounds and music data with Blueprints, covering the basics and touching on more intermediate and advanced tips and tricks to help our sounds stand out and enhance gameplay. \n\nThe session also discusses the advantages of using react",
