It&#39;s updated daily with official state scratch-off lottery data from 31 states, calculating real-time odds, highlighting top prizes, and helping you find scratch-off tickets with the best odds of winning.</p> <p>It started because I noticed that while state lotteries publish odds and remaining prizes, the data is usually scattered and hard to interpret. Even more surprising, many states keep selling scratch-off tickets for games even when all the grand prizes are already gone. That means unless you dig into the numbers, you could be buying a ticket with zero chance at the top prize.</p> <p>I also found that a lot of sites offering this kind of scratch-off analytics hide the best data behind paid subscriptions. I wanted to make something that\u2019s completely free and open to everyone.</p> <p>I&#39;m very open to feedback and I&#39;m happy to answer any questions.</p> </div><!-- S",
