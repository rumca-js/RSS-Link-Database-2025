I disagree with this criticism, because it draws a false dichotomy between style and substance. In filmmaking, the way images are presented on the screen is both the style <em>and</em> the substance: the medium is the message, as they say. His storybook visual flair and love of orderly symmetrical compositions aren\u2019t just superficial details; they work to emphasize the whimsical, rose-colored lens through which many of his stories are told. The seeming emotional distance created by his convoluted, deadpan dialogue isn\u2019t just a pretentious quirk; it serves to highlight the characters\u2019 fear of emotional vulnerability, which heightens the sense of catharsis in the rare moments that their facades break down.</p> <p>This is not a ",

I <em>can</em> think of a few audiobooks that scared me a bit, but like films, they have an easier time creating an atmosphere; with a good narrator and background sound effects, that is. A film can be scary just by setting and tension, you don&#39;t even have to like the protagonist to feel uncomfortable, which <em>may</em> be a requirement in a book? I think you have to fear <strong>for</strong> the protagonist (what is about to happen to him), rather than a &quot;scene&quot; being spooky. Poor lighting conditions doesn&#39;t have the same effect in words, after all :)<br/> I don&#39;t find blood and gore scary, I can just read a medical book, if I want to be grossed out.
