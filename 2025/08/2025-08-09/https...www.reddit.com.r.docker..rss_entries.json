I&#39;ve run into some issue where services need to reach out to external endpoints, so a singular `internal` network doesn&#39;t work, but an `external` network is too broad to my understanding. I&#39;ve tried a two-network solution, where the container belongs to networks `container_internal` and `container_external`, for example. This works, and other containers can access the service via the `container_internal` network while the service can make outgoing requests via `container_external`. While I don&#39;t 100% understand networking yet - is this not the same as having a singular, external network?</p> <p>I imagine the best solution lies in `iptables`, which I&#39;m starting to learn, but a nudge in the right direction would be appreciated (along with any recommended learning resources you have!)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",
