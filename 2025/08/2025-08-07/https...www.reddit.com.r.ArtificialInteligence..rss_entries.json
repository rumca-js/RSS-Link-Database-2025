After the hype that Sam Altman made, I waited for something game changing, some AGI kind of stuff. Seriously even GPT-3,5 could give some medical and life advice.

In a certain way, they are perfect librarians of &quot;The Internet Archive&quot;, able to read every book at once and find connections between them. But a librarian, no matter how brilliant, has never fought a war. It has never built a house. It has never felt the physical reality of the books it reads. LLMs are minds without a world. They are fighters who&#39;ve never fought. Their &quot;understanding&quot; is an incredibly sophisticated pattern-matching of symbols we created to describe reality. It is not an understanding of reality itself. </p> <p>This is the core limitation. The true gap to AGI is not computational power or bigger datasets. It is the absence of consequence. An LLM knows what fire is, but it has never been burned. It cannot learn from trial and error because it cannot try and it cannot fail in a physical world",

ScaleAI, SurgeAI etc made billions by providing data to the companies making LLM models. They use already present data, label them, clean the data, and make it usable and sell that to the LLM. One thing that I&#39;ve been wondering that why not just use AI to create synthetic data using the already present data in the LLMs. Currently the data that the AI models are using are pretty nice and quite vast, so why not just use that to make more and more synthetic data or data for RL environments.
