A lot of this is just false memory warped by nostalgia, but in the UK at the moment there are eight former prime ministers and they provide a sub-set that does, sort of, stand up the theory.</p><p>Five of them were in office after 2010 \u2013 David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak \u2013 and their contribution to public life at the moment is, frankly, minimal, or negative. But the three who were in office before 2010 \u2013 John Major, Tony Blair, and <strong>Gordon Brown</strong> \u2013 remain serious voices. Major is 82, he does not speak out much, but when he does, he is always worth hearing. Blair is running a thinktank actively trying to shape policy in the UK and around the world",
