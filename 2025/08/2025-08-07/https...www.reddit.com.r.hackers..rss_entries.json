She doesn&#39;t speak like that. Tweaking apparently has to do with computer software in some way. I texted her to let her know my concerns. But now I question if I should&#39;ve done that- because what if they hacked her phone, ya know? Sorry if I sound like such an old lady right now haha. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/offinherownoddessy\"> /u/offinherownoddessy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1mkcupj/shouldve_i_have_texted_my_friend_to_let_her_know/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1mkcupj/shouldve_i_have_texted_my_friend_to_let_her_know/\">[comments]</a></span>",
