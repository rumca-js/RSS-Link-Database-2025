To put this in perspective, every 2-3 times you clear out the room (3 lily pads), one of them drops a bag of 110 gold. At this point, all from killing lily pads, I have 50,000 gold. That&#39;s 454 bags dropped by the lily pads. And if each bag represents about 6 lily pads, I&#39;ve killed nearly 3,000 lily pads, and still haven&#39;t seen the armor. That&#39;s a drop rate of like 0.03% and shrinking. Why even put something in your game that rare? For most players it will be functionally nonexistent. </p> <p>Is it only certain rooms, certain lily pads, certain methods of attack that drop the armor? Or ha",
