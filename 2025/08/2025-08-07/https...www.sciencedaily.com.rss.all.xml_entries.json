        "description": "Astronomers have stumbled upon an incredible cosmic chain reaction: a young star launched a high-speed jet that ignited an explosion, creating a massive bubble in space that is now slamming back into the very star system that birthed it. This startling feedback loop, caught for the first time using ALMA data, may reshape what we know about how stars and planets form, and the volatile environments they endure. Nature, it seems, still holds dramatic surprises.",

By analyzing thousands of brittle stars preserved in museum collections, scientists discovered these ancient creatures have silently migrated across the planet's seafloor for millions of years, forming a vast evolutionary network from Iceland to Tasmania.",
