        "description": "Dora Levite | August 7, 2025\nMIKE loves and uplifts those he cares about. During his 71-date Artists of the Century tour, every chance he got, his heart would pour over with gratitude for his fans, his family and his collaborators onstage. His Tiny Desk performance isn\u2019t so different.\n\n\u201cWe are the band of the century\u201d MIKE proclaims as he smiles behind the Desk as a light and breezy melody follows closely behind him. It\u2019s a reimagined sound for the Brooklyn-based rapper, former teen prodigy and founder of independent label 10k. His set is sweeping and vulnerable, touching on all eight years of his discography \u2014 including \u201cnite flite,\u201d a dj blackpower cameo \u2014 with immense gratitude, family pride and a few tears. He raps deeply about moments with his late mother in \u201cEvil Eye\u201d and reflects on growing up with his sister, Victoria, in a fresh arrangement of \u201cparkS,\u201d supported by labelmate duendita and frequent collaborator Liv.e. In his classic fashion, he fills the room with appreciation ",
