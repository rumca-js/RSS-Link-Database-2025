Game was about maze and fighting monsters but I can&#39;t remember what was the goal of that game. Maze was made from the hedge and only monster I remember is ghost in a stereotypical white bedsheet or something like that. There was D12 or I just added that to make a game more interesting, I&#39;m not sure. Cover art from the box of that boardgame looks like this:</p> <p>A hedge maze seen from above at some angle, ghost flying out of there directly into our point of view, there was starry night with full moon</p> <p>Its not much, but I hope someone know that game or have a clue how to find it.
