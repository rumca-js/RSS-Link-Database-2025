I am already halfway through the CompTIA Security+ Cert.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>About a year ago I accepted a SOC Manager position at the company where I started my cybersecurity career. At the time, it felt like the natural next step, climbing the ladder, more responsibility, more pay. But now that I\u2019m in it, I\u2019m realizing that I just don\u2019t enjoy managing people. I miss being hands on and doing the work of a lead SOC analyst: digging into incidents, building detections, threat hunting; the technical stuff.</p> <p>So, I started applying and interviewing for senior analyst roles elsewhere, but I\u2019ve noticed something weird in the process. When I explain why I want to move from a SOC manager to an analyst role, it feels like the interviewers don\u2019t quite know what to make of it. I sense hesitation, like they\u2019re not sure if I\u2019ll be happy in the role or something. </p> <p>To make things more complicated, internal demotion isn\u2019t an option I\u2019d take a huge pay cut. And I\u2019m not sure if leaving the manager role off my resume would make thin",
