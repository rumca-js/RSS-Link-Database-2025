        "description": "Searching for life on Mars has been an explicit goal of the astrobiological community for decades. However, they have not really had the resources to effectively do so, and they might be running out of time. Crewed missions to Mars are planned for as little as 15 years from now (though those timelines might be changing\u2026again), and by the time that happens it may be too late to separate Martian life from unintentionally transplanted Earth life.",

According to the study, habitat characteristics\u2014which are mainly influenced by land-use\u2014were the main driver of the variation in Finnish moth communities over a 23-year study period. In contrast, the relative importance of the climate depended on the functional traits of the species and the dominant habitat types surrounding the 109 study sites.",

At the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the PAS, using titanium and its oxide by way of example, it has been proven that this obstacle can be overcome.",
