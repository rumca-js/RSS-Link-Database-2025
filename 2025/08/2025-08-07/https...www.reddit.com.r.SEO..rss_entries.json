I thought about signing up in both platforms just to increase my EEAT but doing a quick research on Reddit there are horrifying stories about those platforms, such as hiding good reviews if you don&#39;t pay for their ads, writing fake bad reviews and not being able to delete them in any way, and so on...</p> <p>So, being in Europe, is it worth signing up with Yelp and Trustpilot? Maybe with the European laws they are not legally allowed to do such a horrific things like the ones I mentioned? Or at least with GDPR ",
