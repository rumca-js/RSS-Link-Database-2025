        "description": "EA Skate's original promise was to be a reflection of real skateboarding culture. And their first 3 games did a great job at doing that. After 15 years of waiting for the 4th version of the game.. we realize they have abandoned their roots. Nno story mode, no professional skaters, no SKATE mode, no custom parks, no real skate culture, no offline play, and no soul. Instead, it offers fortnite-esque visuals, forced online multiplayer, and overpriced microtransactions.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Social Medias \u2714\ufe0f\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/patrickcctv\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@patrickcctv?lang=en\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/patrickcctv\n\n\ud83d\udfe2Watch My Videos on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/01jpwYaJalv5OZN4CcE2Rj?si=031adfb43dd94512\n\ud83c\udfa7 Stream My Music \ud83c\udfa7 https://www.hoo.be/patrickcctv\n\ud83d\udca7Second Channel\ud83d\udca7 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX0aUB-99m_b958ljpioOhQ\n\ud83d\udc7eMy Discord\ud83d\udc7e https://discord.gg/MAJUre2kFD",
