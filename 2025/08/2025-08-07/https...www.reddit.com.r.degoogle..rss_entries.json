I&#39;m learning every time a litte more and every time i realised it was all a msitake. I realised i have a clear digital footprint, all my emails are all bound to each other somehow (for example, Google knows i have proton cause I set a Gmail as a recovery email for proton ecc). This time I want it to be the real one</p> <p>So I&#39;m starting to hoard stuff cause of this closure of content, I&#39;m in italy and I&#39;m torrenting with no vpn, using stremio with no debrid service, I&#39;llhave to get these but i don&#39;t want to start it all over again... this time this is my basic plan: creating an ultimate proton email via tor, with a random username generated by the password manager, but proton asks for an email... even if I can get past this, how do i pay the plan?
