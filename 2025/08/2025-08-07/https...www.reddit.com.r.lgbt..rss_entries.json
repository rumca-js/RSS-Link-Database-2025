As if when we give ourselves over to the capitalists they will use sex as a way to control us. And so because of this the dystopia we find ourselves in is puritanical in nature and Christian led so that despite the fact we\u2019re giving ourselves over to the corporations that own us they politicians can act like it\u2019s a victory over the \u201cpro sex\u201d dystopia in said media.
