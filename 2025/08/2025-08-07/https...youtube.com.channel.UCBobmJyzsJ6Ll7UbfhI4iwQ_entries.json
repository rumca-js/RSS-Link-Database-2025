        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, you\u2019ll discover how Arm and Epic Games are empowering developers to achieve new levels of visual quality on mobile.\n\nFor maximizing player immersion, mobile gaming demands ever higher-fidelity graphics without compromising performance or battery life. Arm Accuracy Super Resolution (Arm ASR) brings the latest temporal upscaling techniques to Fortnite for console-level quality graphics for mobile devices\u2014at a fraction of the performance cost, and with less time spent optimizing graphics.\n\nWatch this video for a deep-dive into the integration in Fortnite to reveal practical tips for implementing the platform-agnostic, open-source Arm ASR, and how it outperforms traditional methods such as TAA and spatial upscalers, enhancing experiences for developers, publishers, and players.\n\nTo find out more about using Unreal Engine for game development, check out our website: unrealengine.com/uses/games\n\n#Fortnite, #ArmASR, #MobileGames, #ArmAccu",
