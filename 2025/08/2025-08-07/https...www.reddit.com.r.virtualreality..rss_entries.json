Right now all we have are slidemills like the Kat Walk and Omni One, but these look like the next generation of VR locomotion so I&#39;m hyped.</p> <p>First we have the Freeaim VR shoes, already in an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/freeaimvrshoes/freeaim-vr-shoes-step-into-the-future-of-immersive-gaming\">Kickstarter</a>. These feel like the wrong solution to me personally with their battery life concerns and lack of sideways (strafing) movement. Price starts at around $1.1k.</p> <p>Next one, <a href=\"https://www.xeleratevr.com/\">Xelerate VR,</a> just popped up about a month ago at an LA convention, looks amazing. They use the same slidemill concept, but replaced the slippery surface with ball bearings, and replaced the 2D mouse-like tracking with 3D tracking using Vive Track",

I&#39;m fine with redrawing the plans in whatever modeling software it might require, if that&#39;s what it takes; but I haven&#39;t even been able to find a decent generic 3D model viewer.
