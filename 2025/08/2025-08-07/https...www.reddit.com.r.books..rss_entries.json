Several books already now appear in my ever-growing reading list that cover him in great detail, but after randomly finding out there\u2019s a new book zeroing in on the aftermath of his most famous work, <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, something I have already read about, but not in book-length form, I decided to throw my carefully crafted plans to the wind and see what an expanded look at a controversial book by a rather pious man did to the world of science and religion in the immediate aftermath of publication. Also, another look at Thomas Huxley in action is a win-win for any fans of draw-dropping retorts, apocryphal or not.</p> <p><em>Origin Story: the",

Everything is \u201cbird like\u201d and everything is the \u201cgreen and white worlds\u201d. And Nirgal is the ~chosen one~ because he\u2019s a special boy who can \u2018see it all\u2019 (eye roll).
