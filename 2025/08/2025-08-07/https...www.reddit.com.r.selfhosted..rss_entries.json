I followed some blogs and posts from <a href=\"/r/selfhosted\">r/selfhosted</a> to set this up. I enabled subnet routes in my Mini PC&#39;s Tailscale so I can reach Plex remotely with Tailscale and without Plex remote pass. To enable this I also had to enable ip forwarding(<a href=\"https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets#enable-ip-forwarding\">https://tailscale.com/kb/1019/subnets#enable-ip-forwarding</a>). I&#39;m a beginner in networking but after some googling and ChatGPT the recommendation was to add a rule in iptable to forward only for Plex(as below). How big of a security risk if I do not do this? Has anyone done it and could point me to the steps/blogs?</p> <pre><code>iptables -A FORWARD -d 172.18.0.2 -p tcp --dport 32400 -j ACCEPT # Only Plex iptables -A FORWARD -d 172.18.0.0/16 -j DROP # ",
