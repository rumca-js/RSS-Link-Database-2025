It\u2019s kinda happened to me. October 2019 after Joker came out, I was going to an arthouse theater that was playing Joker, but also a showing of Halloween 1978. I was getting my concessions and some teens came out of the theater hallway, stood in the concession area, and were loudly talking about everything that happened in the Joker movie. \u201cIT WAS SO CRAZY WHEN HE KILLED HIS MOM WITH THE PILLOW!\u201d Thankfully I had seen it, but would be a bummer if I hadn\u2019t, and if there was anyone else in there that hadn\u2019t yet that wanted to. </p> <p>Anyone had something like this happen? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GWGTRLBG\"> /u/GW",

In fact, many of the scenes that general moviegoers assume may be CGI are actually practical. </p> <p>In the hospital chase when Robert Patrick is being shot at, he has tiny holes in a shirt - devices are hidden inside them, that when operated via remote control, they expand outward through the hole revealing the metal plate, aka gunshot. The elevator blast was a dummy on a spring. The shotgun blast through the windshield of the nitrogen truck was a dummy. The blade through the hospital security guard was a real blade on a dummy&#39;s head from the back view. Eye hole was a dummy. The loss of legs when frozen was a amputee stuntman. CGI was only used when we see him in metal form reverted back to his Robert Patrick mode, the bullet holes reverting to normal on camera, the bar scene, the helicopter morph, and a couple of other shots.</p> <p",
