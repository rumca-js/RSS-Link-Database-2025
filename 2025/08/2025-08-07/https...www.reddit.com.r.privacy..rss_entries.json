When I looked at the photo sure enough it was the exact same account from 4 days ago. I straight up told my gf that I have no idea who that person and don\u2019t know why that\u2019s taking place. My gf decided to message the account to get answers and the account provided a screenshot that we FaceTimed this past Sunday. </p> <p>This was incredibly baffling as I haven\u2019t FaceTimed anyone since July 12, nearly a month ago.

Like how stopkillinggames did their initiative. Would doing something like that make any difference? Or atleast I think it could help in terms of spreading more awareness and shining more light on the issue, since these things tend to only stay visible in privacy conscious spaces like this subreddit for example, it could help break the discussion about privacy more into the mainstream.
