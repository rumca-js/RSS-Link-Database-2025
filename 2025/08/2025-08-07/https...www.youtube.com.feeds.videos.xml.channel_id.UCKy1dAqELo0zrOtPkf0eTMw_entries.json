        "description": "Directed by Christopher Leone (Parallels), CODE 3 is a high-octane action dramedy that follows a world-weary paramedic on his final 24-hour shift as he trains his eager but inexperienced replacement. What begins as a routine night quickly unravels into a chaotic, citywide odyssey, testing their endurance, instincts, and sense of humor as they race from one emergency to the next. \nBlending heart, irreverent comedy, and edge-of-your-seat action, CODE 3 offers a gritty, behind-the-scenes look at the life of first responders, where every call could mean disaster or redemption. \nRainn Wilson, Lil Rel Howery, and Aimee Carrero lead a dynamic ensemble, joined by Rob Riggle (21 Jump Street) and Yvette Nicole Brown (Community), bringing both heart and levity to the chaos.",
