I have <em>really</em> enjoyed all that I have read though so I\u2019d love to read more! </p> <p>I don\u2019t want any ones that make you feel icky though, just ones that are kinda scary, if that makes sense. Like nothing grotesque, although violence is fine\u2014-I\u2019m a teen so basically keep that in mind LMAO. I\u2019d also like supernatural horror?? I\u2019ve always thought that\u2019s cool. It\u2019s okay if you mention authors too, I\u2019d prefer that actually since I\u2019m so new to this genre. Thanks! </p> <p>Also. Also I somehow ended up with a copy of Stephen King\u2019s Cell\u2014-is that worth reading as an introduction to his writing?

By this, I mean: I can completely understand why these characters like each other and can see the progression from whatever they started as to love, and it&#39;s not insta-love. The absence of these things tend to be my biggest pet peeves in romance books, so I really wanna find some that have them. I also tend to prefer LGBTQ+ romances, but non-LGBTQ ones are also fine to suggest.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Milo-Miloo-Milooo\"> /u/Milo-Miloo-Milooo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mjliy8/a_believable_romance_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mjliy8/a_believable_romance_book/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It\u2019s quieter. Smarter. Sadder. Meaner.</p> <p>Starts off as a gardening club. Ends\u2026 differently. I won\u2019t spoil anything, but let\u2019s just say it made me laugh and feel vaguely homicidal.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I loved: \u2022 The characters are flawed, emotionally starved, and weirdly relatable \u2022 It\u2019s got this dry, literary tone that reminded me a bit of Shirley Jackson or Ottessa Moshfegh \u2022 Domestic noir but with more soul\u2014and way more psychological insight \u2022 Legitimately funny in that \u201cI\u2019m fine everything\u2019s fine :)\u201d kind of way \u2022 There\u2019s a metaphor with wasps that hits hard by the end</p> <p>If you\u2019ve ever wanted something like: \ud83e\ude93 The Push but more layered \ud83e\udde4 We Have Always Lived in the Castle but modern \ud83c\udf3a Big Little Lies if it didn\u2019t care about being likable</p> <p>\u2026this i",
