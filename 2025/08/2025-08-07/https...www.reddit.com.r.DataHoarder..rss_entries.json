My dad was an amateur photographer and I dabbled in photography and videography in school. I have mini dv tapes, slides, and cards as well as hundreds of negatives and photos (somewhere) that I would like to digitize and store. I found a local library that offers the services for free but it books far out and I know when I get into it, I&#39;d rather have the flexibility of doing it myself or sending it out. </p> <p>What do you recommend for DIY or is it worth it to send out elsewhere? Is there something that can handle all the things or do I need different types of equipment? Would a LaCie external drive do for storage or would I be better off with a Samsung T7 Shield?

I&#39;m comparing enterprise HDDs and basic consumer SSDs here, to have 10-20TB of storage.</p> <p>According to my rough calculations (taking into account the power consumption of a HDD) these SSDs are twice as expensive as HDDs for an equivalent storage space.</p> <p>What I&#39;m doing with my storage: downloading stuff (mostly Linux ISOs) and seeding them for years, to maintain my ratio. Sometimes I delete some items and then download something else, but it doesn&#39;t happen that often.</p> <p>From what I understood, having HDDs read random chunks 24/7 is using the heads. Will my HDDs have a significant shorter lifespan because of this? (e.g 2-3 years lifespan instead of 5+ years)<br/> On the other hand, SSDs wear out when you write to them, but random reads do not damage them.",
