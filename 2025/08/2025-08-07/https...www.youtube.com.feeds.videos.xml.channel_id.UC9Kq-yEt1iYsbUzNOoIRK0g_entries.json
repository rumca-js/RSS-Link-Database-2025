With Spielberg and Tom Cruise being the last to tackle it, it\u2019s time for\u2026 Ice Cube to get his hands on it! And have it be focused on Zoom calls!\n\nThat sounds like a good idea, right?

Is Ice Cube the worst DHS agent of all time? Why is the most action-packed scene of this movie based around assembling a spreadsheet?\n\nTo answer all these questions and more, step inside Ryan George\u2019s Pitch Meeting for War of the Worlds (2025)\n\nCheck Out These Other Videos:\n\nThunderbolts* Pitch Meeting\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCks7E4Qa6k\n\nPitch Meeting Episode 400\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNH2if9ymBE\n\n#pitchmeeting #ryangeorge #waroftheworlds #icecube #evalongoria #amazon #pri",
