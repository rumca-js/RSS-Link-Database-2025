On windows I was using a fork of sunshine called Apollo, used it to stream on moonlight clients on my steam deck and TV. It had auto resolution and a virtual display, my pc screen used to get disabled when ever i was streaming to a device and the resolution for the desktop was automated. </p> <p>Sunshine works out of the box, I wanted to achieve something similar on Linux, auto resolution and pc screen being disabled when i start a stream. I am using a ryzen 7600 with 4070Ti Su. Can someone help me with this or direct me towards the right path.
