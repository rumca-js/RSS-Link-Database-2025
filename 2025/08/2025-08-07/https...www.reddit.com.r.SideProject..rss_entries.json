I&#39;ve posted here a couple of times marketing it, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m here right now.</p> <p>Do any of you have tips where to find users that will use my app for 14 days just so I can release it? I tried some subreddits and I got one reply to my forms. It&#39;s a completely free app, no ads and with more features than the paid versions of known apps out there, so I&#39;m not looking to make bank, just share my little passion project.</p> <p>This project means a lot to me, maybe it can help more people.

After hearing &quot;there should be an app that shows all sales on one map&quot; for 3 months, I finally built Grabbit with React Native app with a pretty simple Node.js backend that displays local sales on an interactive map, lets users post their own sales with photos, and plan optimized routes between multiple locations. Launched this a few weeks ago and hoping to get more people posting sales so it becomes useful for the broader garage sale community. Would love feedback from other developers who&#39;ve tackled location-based marketplaces!
