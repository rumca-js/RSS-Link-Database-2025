Is there a good template or even a detailed walkthrough anywhere for a pi based digital picture frame? </p> <p>For backstory: I am a relative noob at using linux, but have a fairly technical background. I decided a couple days ago to try and have chat gpt teach me some basic linux skills and chose to use an old pi3b that I had laying around from a previous, gui based, application, and have chat show me how to create a digital picture frame that pulls from a google drive. lets just say that I feel like I have been going in circles with our new AI overlords for way too long for what I would think to be a fairly basic operation. I want no gui to weigh things down (and to force me to use linux CLI), pull from a gdrive, remove pics from local storage when removed from the drive, and start on boot. Any help is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ac1d_bern\"> /u/ac1d_bern <",
