Cronos is shaping up to be another nightmare-inducing adventure with a sci-fi twist that looks unlike anything the studio has made. Cronos takes place in a futuristic rendition of Eastern Europe where an event known as The Change has radically altered the landscape, which is now stalked by horrific, mutating creatures. Players take the role of the Traveler, who searches the twisted environment for rifts that connect back to 1980s Poland so they can rescue key people from the past on behalf of a mysterious group known as The Collective. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cronos-PlayStation-5/dp/B0FKNMXH4V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20\">Preorders</a> are open ahead of its September 5 release, with two editions ",

Yes, after over a decade, we <em>finally </em>have a new Ninja Gaiden--but with Team Ninja and Platinum Games collaborating on its development and Microsoft publishing, is the series' identity at stake? It's a question that's been on many long-time fans' minds, as well as my own.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">After all, there's no denying that some of what makes Ninja Gaiden such a beloved series are the little quirks we overlook out of affection. And, more often than not, these are the very same friction-inducing qualities that are promptly removed when a series is remade or rebooted. At the same time, does opting to retain each and every one of these qualities prevent the game from evolving, or becoming an exciting, modern entry-point? After spending around four hours with Ninja Gaiden 4 and speaking with the team behind it at Platinum Game's Tokyo office, I've come to a preliminar",

You start in a fairly small plot of land, surrounded by darkness, and you have access to three minigames: apple-collecting, fishing, and mining. As you explore each game, you start an automated counter that gathers materials for you, while also obtaining them manually by playing the minigames.

The original Season 5 was an eventful and memorable season, as it introduced a couple of the game's most beloved battle pass skins in Strider and Drift, and it got the Fortnite story going in earnest with the arrival of Kevin the Cube. But Season 5's most lasting impact probably actually came from some of the new items it introduced to the loot pool. It was in this season when we originally saw shockwave grenades and grapplers, Fortnite's most persistent movement items, for the first time.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">While many items are sticking around from Season 4, Fortnite OG Season 5 will add a nice pile of toys to the loot pool for Epic's throwback mode. Let's take a look at them now.</p></p><br/>     <p><h2>Double Barrel Shotgun</h2><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uplo",

With the start of OG Season 5, we get to see the lasting effect of those rifts on the island. The swamp biome in the southwest has dried out completely and is now a desert, the farms at Anarchy Acres have been turned into a golf course, and a Viking Village has appeared up on the mountain next to Greasy Grove.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Season 5 also introduces some of our favorite smaller landmarks from the old map, like the dinosaur statues, the teleporting Durr Burger head that ended up on a random hill, and the birthplace of Kevin the Cube. Let's look at what's in store for us on the island in Fortnite OG Season 5.</p></p><br/>     <p><img src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1757/17577455/4545025-fortniteogseason5map.j",

How hefty? Well, it's 100% off! Now, that does come with the catch that you have to pick it up within the first 24 hours of launch, which started at 12 AM PT / 3 AM PT / 8 AM BST / 9 AM CEST, so you'll have to figure out how many hours you've got left yourself. Once you've claimed the game, it's yours for life, but if you miss out after the 24 hours are up, it'll revert to the still-pretty-affordable price of $5.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For those that haven't heard of Guntouchables before, it's a roguelike where the \"entire world has fallen and the surface has been overrun by a hostile and aggressively evolving horde of mutants. Well, not entirely.\" That last part is in reference to a group of preppers, i.e. the characters you play as, who are tasked with defending their doomsday residence from the mutants.
