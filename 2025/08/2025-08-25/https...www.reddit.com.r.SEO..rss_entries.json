Pages can show up if you do a site search, but they&#39;re not ranking at all.

Used to get indexed within 5-10 minutes, sometimes even faster, but now it\u2019s taking over 3 hours or more. I checked Google Search Console, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any major issues flagged. </p> <p>I also heard there have been some recent updates or changes in the Google Search Console API or indexing process, but I\u2019m not sure how that might affect indexing times. </p> <p>Has anyone experienced similar delays lately? Any ideas or solutions on how to speed up the indexing? Could it be related to API updates, or is there something I\u2019m missing? </p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shimul006\"> /u/shimul006 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1mzq0uf/google_search_console_api_updates_indexing_delay/\">[link]</a></span",
