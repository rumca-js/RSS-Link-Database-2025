One of the elements that makes them so hard to beat is that beating them seems so inconceivable. Even when they hit a bad run, the expectation is always that at some point they will rediscover their form. To some extent, Manchester City did that last season. As miserable as much of the campaign was, after losing to Nottingham Forest at the beginning of March, they put together a run of 10 games unbeaten and ended up third \u2013 even if defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final demonstrated the shortcomings that remain.</p><p>That game showcased City\u2019s flatness at times going forward but also a strange openness at the back that was apparent again in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/01/manchester-city-al-hilal-club-world-cup-last-16-report\">4-3 defeat to Al-Hi",

Back in the late 90s I was working at the golf magazine Fore! when the deputy editor Simon Caney returned to the office after being thrashed 6&amp;5 by a tiny eight-year-old who had shown him no mercy. His name? Tommy Fleetwood. Now the rest of the world knows that killer instinct exists, too.</p><p>But Fleetwood\u2019s FedEx Cup victory, his first in 164 events on the PGA Tour, also reinforced something else. Everyone loves Tommy. Right. Left. Maga. Liberal. Whatever. It doesn\u2019t matter. At East Lake they were chanting his name as he lifted the trophy \u2013 while on X, Tiger Woods, Adam Sandler and Caitlin Clark all tweeted their support. Even on social media, so often a cesspit of anger and bile, the equivalent of a Christmas Day armistice broke out.</",

Nobody in Germany remembers, and an era when Bayern Munich\u2019s centre-forward seemed even vaguely stoppable seems like a very long time ago.

Their leading men, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, respectively, brought a lot of that goofy small-screen banter \u2013 this time loaded with testosterone and F-bombs \u2013 to a buddy cop movie.</p><p>Bad Boys opens with an announcement of their arrival. Lawrence\u2019s Marcus Burnett and Smith\u2019s Mike Lowrey are cruising around Miami in a Porsche 911, doing a sitcom bit as they bicker over French fries and cupholders, before a pair of car thieves catch them by surprise and hold them up at gunpoint. When Smith\u2019s Mike warns that they\u2019re cops, one of the car jackers dismisses him \u2013 \u201cWell, I\u2019m a stand-up comedian, and I suck\u201d \u2013 as if speaking for an audience unconvinced that these two comic personalities could plausibly exist in their new roles.</p",

Last season, after taking over in November, Amorim supervised 14 league games against clubs that ended up between seventh and 17th. United won two, drew two and lost 10, scraping eight points out of a possible 42. One of those two wins was at Craven Cottage, a streaky 1-0. Here, again, they needed luck to take the lead as Leny Yoro got away with a two-hands push on Calvin Bassey; this time they blew it, and they couldn\u2019t complain.
