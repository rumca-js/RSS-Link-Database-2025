Surprise! Windows 10 and 11 has one of those too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Windows\u2019 case, though, you don\u2019t get supernatural powers. What you get is access to a whole heap of commands that you\u2019d normally have to dig deep to find in menus, submenus, and tabs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use Windows God mode to find and manage Windows administrative tools quicker than I normally would be able to, to adjust and check things like my PC\u2019s power plan, and to view my devices. Suffice it to say it saves me a bunch of time by cutting down the time I spend with useless faffing about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, I recommend Windows God mode as a quick way to access functions that you use a lot and wish you had shortcuts for on",
