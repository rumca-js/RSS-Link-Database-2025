I enjoy historical fiction, but I also enjoy something set more modern day, I&#39;m just not picky about the setting.

I am looking for books that provide guidance on mental clarity and making meaning of where I am in life. Past readings for this kind of reflection have included Why Buddhism is True (Robert Wright), Playing Big (Tara Mohr), Atomic Habits (James Clear), Untamed (Glennon Doyle), The Artist&#39;s Way (Julia Cameron), a few Brene Brown books. I&#39;m not super religious but am up for books in the generally spiritual category. </p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your reading recommendations for reflection and reenergizing.
