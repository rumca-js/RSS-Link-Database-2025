Applying a high-binding-energy organic material, which is resistant to degradation under electrical and thermal stress, to the hole transport layer (HTL) is expected to contribute to developing next-generation QLEDs that can maintain brightness and stability over extended periods.",

Its powerful gravitational pull disrupted the orbits of small rocky and icy bodies similar to modern asteroids and comets, called planetesimals. This caused them to smash into each other at such high speeds that the rocks and dust they contained melted on impact and created floating molten rock droplets, or chondrules, that we find preserved in meteorites today.",
