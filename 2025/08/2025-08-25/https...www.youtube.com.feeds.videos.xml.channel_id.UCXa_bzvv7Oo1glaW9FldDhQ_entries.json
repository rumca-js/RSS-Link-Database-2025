        "description": "Unreliable story set-ups that facilitate excessive killing are nothing new for Reikon Games. So it was for Ruiner, its stylish and surprisingly compelling twin-stick shooter from 2017, and so it is for Metal Eden.\n\nLaunching on September 2nd for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC due to a delay for additional polish, the sleek cyberpunk future is replaced with something decidedly more Brutalist and harsh (built on Unreal Engine 5, no less). You're also no longer viewing the action from on high but through the eyes of ASKA, a powerful Hyper Unit who tears through the opposition.",

        "description": "The Metal Gear Solid series is one of the legendary franchises out there. Although the plot is complicated, even for the most hardcore fans, there is no denying that it has one of the best casts of characters and an intriguing lore in the medium of video games.\n\nWith Konami bringing back the series in the form of a remake, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, after ten long years, we thought it would be a great idea to take a look at the entire Metal Gear Solid Saga, explained in the most detailed manner possible. We have tried our best to explain each and everything, and tried to connect all the dots across eleven games.\n\nSo, buckle up, and get ready. Because this is going to be a pretty long ride.",

        "description": "Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is a must-buy. For side-scrolling action fans, it's a wonderful trip across numerous gorgeous levels with incredible combat mechanics, stellar controls, and varied platforming mechanics. \n\nFor long-time fans, itching for the franchise's return, it's everything you could want, but expanded and enhanced in all the best ways. If this is the trend that revivals will follow going into the future, then perhaps the best is yet to come. Regardless, you owe it to yourself to witness Joe Musashi's return in all its gory glory.",
