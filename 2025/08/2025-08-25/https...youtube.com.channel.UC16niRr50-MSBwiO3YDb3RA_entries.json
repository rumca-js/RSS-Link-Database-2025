        "description": "At least 20 people, including 5 journalists working for the international media, have been killed in two Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. The Israeli military hit a hospital - Nasser - in the southern city of Khan Younis. \n\nAfter a first attack, a second strike took place as rescue crews and journalists rushed to the scene.   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel regretted what he described as a 'tragic mishap', after the UN Secretary General condemned the killings.\n\nThere was international condemnation of Israel, from the head of the United Nations as well as from charities working in Gaza and media organisations.  \n\u00a0\n\u00a0It follows an Israeli strike two weeks ago which killed six journalists - who also worked for western news outlets - outside another hospital in Gaza City. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nIsrael does not allow international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Lucy Williamson in Jerusalem.\n",
