I have a pi2 and a pi5, but I&#39;ve never been able to get any use out of them with my basic python understanding and my extremely beginner understanding of interacting with hardware. Can anyone suggest a project (or even resources online to help me)? I want to be challenged, but I also want to be able to complete it.
