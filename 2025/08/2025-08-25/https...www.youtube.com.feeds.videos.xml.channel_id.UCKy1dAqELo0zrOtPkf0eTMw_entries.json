        "description": "Shinobi: Art of Vengeance reviewed by Tristan Ogilvie on PlayStation 5. Also available on Xbox Series X|S, PC, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.\n\n\"Off the back of 2017\u2019s Wonder Boy: The Dragon\u2019s Trap and 2020\u2019s Streets of Rage 4, developer Lizardcube had already proven itself to be a safe pair of hands when it comes to resurrecting classic Sega series\u2019, and Shinobi: Art of Vengeance has only further cemented its reputation as a studio capable of making everything old feel new again. This is a genuinely engaging 2D action platformer, beautiful to behold and even better to play. It\u2019s blessed with a combat system that expands in an invigorating way, as well as a healthy amount of secret side objectives that offer some serious optional challenges outside of the main story path. Like a ninja strapped onto a surfboard, Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is eyecatching, deadly, and totally rad as hell.\"",
