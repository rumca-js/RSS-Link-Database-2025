I feel like there is a smaller set of acceptable solutions for smaller networks but if your network is large, expansive, or involves hundreds of other networks (eg, MSSPs), the complexity quickly scales out of reach.</p> <p>I&#39;ve recently been leveraging graphs and Markov chains to capture summary dynamics and I&#39;ve been pretty happy with it. Adjacency and transition matrices can reveal a lot about traffic in a network and can be used to identify anomalous changes. It&#39;s been really useful to create attack graphs to characterize certain threat actor and identify their targets. However, like all things, these aren&#39;t perfect and I wanted to see if anyone else uses a different type of model or capturing method to baseline. I&#39;m also interested in hearing if graph-based baselining is widely used.</p> </di",

That would mean retroactively carrying out things like risk assessments and updating technical documentation where needed. If not, the product can\u2019t legally be sold in the EU beyond 2027.</p> <p>For anyone who\u2019s read the Act (or the blogs and guidance around it \u2013 my sympathies), do you agree with this interpretation?

I have thousands of hours spent coding in C/C++, both drivers and regular usermode shit. I would love to get a job that involves reverse engineering but every thread I see about the topic either says it\u2019s absolutely unemployable or the most employable thing on earth\u2026 I was hoping someone in the field may have a more straightforward answer. I have a massive amount of experience with reversing all sorts of obfuscated binaries (BattlEye, Easy Anti-Cheat, paid cheats, highly obfuscated games), so I feel pretty confident that a malware analysis position would fit me if I put some time into it.
