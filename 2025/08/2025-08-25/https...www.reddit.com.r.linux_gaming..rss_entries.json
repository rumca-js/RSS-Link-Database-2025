So far its been pretty good, i haven&#39;t played lots of heavy games, just simple stuff or lightweight games. But lately ive tried some games like Battlebit Remastered, which used to run perfect on windows with high and stable fps. But on under proton (tried various versions) I noticed the game has a decent frame rate, arround 140, but sometimes drops or it feels slugish, even while having a good amount of fps, keep in mind the game always has atleast 100 fps, it rarely drops from that number. I also played Doom 2016 which had like 90 FPS or sometimes even 130 but it feel off.<br/> My PC isn&#39;t really strong, its a Ryzen 5 5600GT with 16GB of ram, pretty basic stuff. But I wonder if this happens because i don&#39;t have a dedicated GPU and proton requires more resources or its just a bad configuration on my end.<br/> Thanks in advance and sorry if this is a basic question. </p> </div><!",

I would describe my skill/experience level as intermediate, so its very possible I&#39;ve missed something simple, but I&#39;ve been having issues with some mouse and keyboard games on my primary desktop. To make things simpler, I&#39;ll just focus on one game (series) for this post, Supreme Commander. I would like to also mention that I&#39;m not having these issues on my laptop (Nobara 42, Official, 7840HS, 7700s).</p> <p>The primary issue that I&#39;m having is that elements of the game do not react to cursor presence. For instance, I can click to skip the opening video, but menu items are not highlighted as they should be when the mouse is hovering over them. I have to close the game with Alt+f4 and then Enter to respond to the &quot;Do you want to exit&quot; dialog.</p> <p>Issues:</p> <pre><code>1. Clicks do not register 2. Windowed mode does not work </code></pre> <p>System Specifications:</p> <p",

However, in some games, when using --force-grab-cursor, the mouse movement is weird and jittery. I am using the gamescope-git package from the AUR, and my launch options on steam are <code>gamescope -W 1920 -H 1080 -f --force-grab-cursor -- %command%</code>. Does anyone know a fix for this?
