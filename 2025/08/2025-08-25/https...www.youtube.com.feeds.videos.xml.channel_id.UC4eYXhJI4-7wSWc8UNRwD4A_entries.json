        "description": "Suraya Mohamed | August 25, 2025\nJohn Oates and percussionist John Michel are accustomed to Colorado\u2019s intense sun and high altitude. \u201cWe\u2019re two local boys. We just came down from the mountain to play for ya,\u201d he told the Aspen Ideas Festival audience standing amongst the sage brushes that fill the meadow.\n\nOates and Michel have been playing together for more than 20 years, which is evident in this easygoing, yet steadfast performance. Though just a duo, their sound is full of harmonies and rhythms that enhance the songwriting. \n\nBut if you\u2019re expecting to hear an old Hall & Oates hit, John Oates has some news for you: \u201cSongwriters always want to play their new songs and the fans always want to hear the old songs. Well you\u2019re out of luck.\u201d Actually, it was a fortunate opportunity to hear some lovely songs from Oates\u2019 solo projects, including one from a soon-to-be released album.\n\nSET LIST\n\u201cArkansas\u201d\n\u201cA Ways Away\u201d\n\u201cReunion\u201d\n\u201cGet Your Smile On\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS \nJohn Oates: vocals, guitar\nJoh",
