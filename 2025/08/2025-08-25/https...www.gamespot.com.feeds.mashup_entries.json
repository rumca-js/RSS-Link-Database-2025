A mirage.\"</p><p>The developers chalk this up to one of two potential causes. One is that \"[the game's map generator] randomly rolled ALPINE 7 days in a row which has a 0.78% chance of happening.\" While that's possible, they submit another potential cause: \"Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr its (<em>sic)</em> a bug.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-bug-that-left-gamers-",
