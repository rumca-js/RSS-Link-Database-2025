My maximum connections are all ridiculously high, but for some reason, all of my torrents are now being pushed into queue instead of downloading. The maximum download connections it will actually hold right now are 7. It dropped from 17 two days ago. The commanded maximum connections in the actual settings are 2000. I am at a loss.</p> <p>Has anyone else had this issue as of late? I attempted forum searches here and elsewhere with minimal success.
