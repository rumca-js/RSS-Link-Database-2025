Sure it\u2019s not as violent/gory, vulgar, or grim, but it\u2019s still got everything else we love about the other Abercrombie books; great characters, witty banter, action, plot, twists.

I have some series already that looked interesting so I bought, but never read, one among them was a trilogy on sale: </p> <p>Fitz and the Fool by Robin Hobb.</p> <p>Went to start it the other day but my gut told me to just check online, and I found that it&#39;s the closing trilogy of &quot;The Realm of the Elderlings&quot;? Which I&#39;m assuming is the universe that all her books exist in? Is that right? </p> <p>This is where I&#39;m confused because I couldn&#39;t find any good answers online about read order or if each trilogy was standalone within the same universe etc. </p> <p>The blurb of book one (Fools&#39;s Assassin) seemed like the start of a new story so my question is;</p> <p>Do I need to read all of her other books to full",
