        "description": "Whether they plan for it or not, plenty of parents are likely to find themselves in the same boat. About 60% of parents with children ages 18 to 34 said they had helped their kids financially in the previous year, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center survey. Parents are finding that the rising expenses that trail them from their child\u2019s birth through college are now extending well into adulthood.\n\nThey commonly chipped in for housing, debt payments and everyday expenses such as groceries, according to a Bankrate survey last year. A third of younger millennial home buyers got help with the down payment from friends or family, according to an April report from the National Association of Realtors.\n\n#Parenting #Tips #Shorts",
