Back in undergrad I did an AI/ML research internship, and honestly that\u2019s where my real passion is.</p> <p>Lately I\u2019ve been feeling a little stuck career-wise and not sure which direction to go:</p> <pre><code>\u2022 Master\u2019s in CS: seems like the \u201cstandard\u201d path into AI/ML, but it\u2019s expensive and my company doesn\u2019t offer much tuition help. Not sure if the payoff is worth it vs. self-teaching. \u2022 Self-learning/entrepreneurship: I like the idea of using that time and money to build skills on my own and eventually start something (I\u2019ve seen other people with technical backgrounds merge business + tech and do really well). \u2022 Academia: I really enjoyed research in undergrad and could see myself going back into that space, but I don\u2019t know what the reality looks like",

If not, they send a message in the chat box telling you to make sure your eyes and mouth are in view.

The tool reportedly disclosed limited details from other customers\u2019 accounts when asked about invoices. Sage described it as a minor issue, confirmed no actual invoices were exposed, and stated the problem was quickly addressed.</p> <p>While the impact seems small, it highlights an important point: when using AI in accounting or finance, data isolation and privacy safeguards are critical. Even minor glitches can raise concerns when sensitive client information is involved.</p> <p>Blake Oliver, CPA, noted this reflects the broader challenges of deploying AI in systems that serve multiple clients. It seems like a reminder that privacy controls need to be built into the architecture from the start.</p> <p>Curious to hear your thoughts: how should firms approach adopting AI while maintaining client confidentiality?</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://www",

(Fortune)</p> <p>Here\u2019s the problem: GPUs are the current backbone of AI, but they\u2019re costly, energy-intensive, and in short supply. OpenAI itself says it has stronger models than GPT-5, but can\u2019t deploy them because the hardware simply isn\u2019t there.</p> <p>This is why new processor designs like NVIDIA\u2019s SLM optimizations and Groq\u2019s LPUs (Language Processing Units) are so important. They represent a shift from brute force to efficiency, exactly what\u2019s needed if AI is to scale without draining global energy resources.</p> <p>The big question: can we innovate fast enough in chips and infrastructure to keep pace with model development? If not, the AI race risks being won not by th",

He made a claim (not sure if it was originally his) that stuck with me. He said the person who builds a single-person billion-dollar company won\u2019t be someone who codes an AI from scratch that automates something, but someone who can get AI to attach to identities and, through prompts, manipulate those identities into doing certain things in certain scenarios. Basically creating simulations of the best way to get someone to act a certain way and the person with the most humanistic data, and a lot of it, could train the AI to do this.</p> <p>The first person I thought of was Elon Musk. And with this perspective, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that most of his ventures line up with exactly this. X for the data. Tesla for decision making. Grok as the personality and simulation. And worst of all, Neuralink.</p> <p>A while back I heard Alexander Wang, former CEO of Scale AI, s",
