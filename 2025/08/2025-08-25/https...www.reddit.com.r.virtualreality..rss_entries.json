Just staring at the instruments in the space capsule or the planets outside the spaceship makes me feel that these are real. Every time I walk into the abandoned space station, I can feel the loneliness and oppression, as if the air around me has turned cold.</p> <p>What I find most interesting in the game is the puzzle-solving.

I just purchased hidden memories and when I start the game I go into loading screen which never boots the game. On the monitor I see that the game loaded everything appears stuck. </p> <p>I had this issue with beat saber and I could go back in a previous version of beat saber and it fixed it however there is no previous version of this game. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheeNecroWolf\"> /u/TheeNecroWolf </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1mzdebf/hidden_memories_issue/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1mzdebf/hidden_memories_issue/\">[comments]</a></span>",
