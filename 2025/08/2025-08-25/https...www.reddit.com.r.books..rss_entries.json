The only issue I have with the book is that Roberts tends to employ an unrelenting amount of specific vocabulary that my M17 brain has a bit too much difficulty understanding. Some words, like &quot;harangue&quot;, &quot;licentiousness&quot;, &quot;morainic&quot;, etc. I&#39;ve managed to effectively log away in my head but there&#39;s a lot more vocabulary that I feel as though I&#39;m leaving behind. </p> <p>One potential exercise I was considering was consulting another friend who reads, and having a conversation where I attempt ",
