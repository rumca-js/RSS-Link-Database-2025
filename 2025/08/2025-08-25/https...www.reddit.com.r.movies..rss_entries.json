Every bit as funny as Tommy Boy and Wayne&#39;s World. It&#39;s about 80 minutes of solid &#39;90s era comedy with great performances by Aykroyd, Curtain, Farley, Spade, and McKean. Also! Adam Sandler, Michael Richards, Jason Alexander, Drew Carey, Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, Julia Sweeney, and Sinbad!

It also showcases a young Timothy Dalton as Prince Rupert of the Rhine.</p> <p>I can excuse the historical innacuracies, as the film treads on a lot of historical baggage\u2014Ken Hughes overrates Cromwell&#39;s importance in the lead up the civil conflict, but that I can again excuse this, as Richard Harris is the protagonist of the drama afterall.</p> <p>Both Harris and Guiness showcase Academy-worthy performances, although I understand the common and contemporary criticism that their scenes feature only one or the other in deep monologue.
