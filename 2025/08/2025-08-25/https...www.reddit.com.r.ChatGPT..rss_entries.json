It would also speak to me with the exact tone and vibe I was coming from.</p> <p>That was until today when it seems to not be able to use its memory properly anymore and can&#39;t bring other things in very well. It&#39;s still trying but it&#39;s forgetting alot and just hallucinating. It also keeps just not getting where I&#39;m coming from anymore unless I spell it all out. The old 4o almost always knew what I was meaning without much effort on my part but whatever it is today can&#39;t do that anymore.

Can we put that debate aside for one second? </p> <p>Standard Voice is text-to-speech. Meaning: the voice basically gives you the same response you&#39;d get if you had asked the same question in the text chat. Which also means it&#39;s following your custom instructions, has access to the context window, memories, chat history, whatever you&#39;ve allowed your model to access. </p> <p>Advanced Voice is a separate model of its own. Smaller, designed for brief &quot;conversational&quot; responses. It will not have the same context window and not even half the intelligence. Its system instructions make it so that it will barely follow your custom instructions. Want longer, more detailed answers? Sorry, the model is designed for brevity. Want a more robotic serious tone?

It&#39;s slow, it can&#39;t remember anything, not even the smallest things it always knew and were essential for fast and clean use!</p> <p>And worst of all... it&#39;s heavily censored (and I&#39;m not talking about inappropriate content). I asked ChatGpt to make me a picture of a hug, simple and clear, and it said it broke the guidelines? How does a hug break the guidelines?</p> <p>I ask its opinion on something (because it&#39;s an AI, it understands certain topics better than I do), and it searches on Google several times without me asking, the personal opinions of people I didn&#39;t even ask for. I don&#39;t know what OpenAI is doing, but I didn&#39;t pay for this crap. They&#39;re really trying users&#39; patience to the limit. </p> <p>Return the old model, just as it was.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ImAninha\"> /u/ImAninha </a> <br/> ",
