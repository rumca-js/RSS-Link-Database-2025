We like the negotiation in catan, the backstabbing from coup, and the bluffing from Avalon/werewolf/ \u201camong us\u201d the video game. The snappiness from libertalia.</p> <p>So after some research today I looked into the dune games. There\u2019s a bunch and I was confused but It seems that dune 2019 is what I\u2019m looking for. On the other hand , I heard GoT was kinda the same ish but without the time sink?</p> <p>Some questions I had: * can you just be \u201celiminated\u201d from dune? Like in let\u2019s say, risk, where you can get out and be out for hours. * dune is said to be played with 6, 5 is ok. Anything below is meh. Is this true for GoT? * is the back stabbing that harsh? * for a play through it seems like 4-5 hours? * me, and the rest of the group, don\u2019t care for the universe. But the game to me still seems fun. * this game would be a big dive for a lot of the group. We ",
