I know I can remap keys and everything but I enjoy having 2 supers, controls and alts. Mostly for when I&#39;m actively typing and just want to use one hand to hit a shortcut. I don&#39;t love stretching my hand across the keyboard to hit left super + whatever key on the right side. When running Windows for work, I don&#39;t mind only one super.

That will probably never be 100% the case, especially considering how often some games just don&#39;t work at all even on Windows, but at this point, we&#39;ve finally gotten far enough with Proton and Wine that most games just work with little to no configuration.</p> <p>The other major reason was convenience. I never had money for a second drive to try Linux, I&#39;ve never had external drives I can leave my files on, and I never really feel like I know what I&#39;m doing enough to switch.
