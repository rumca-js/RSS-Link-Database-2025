Their car bottomed out and they were left stranded in the wilderness. Tami wrote a series of notes and placed them on surrounding trails, hoping someone would look for them as they remained lost in California's Sierra Nevada. A search and rescue team discovered them 24 hours later after discovering the notes.",
