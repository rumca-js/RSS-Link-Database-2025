I&#39;m working on a new open-source project called <strong>OpenWebTTS</strong>, and I&#39;m looking for contributors who might be interested.</p> <p><strong>What is OpenWebTTS?</strong></p> <p>The idea is to make an open-source alternative to popular text-to-speech platforms like Speechify and ElevenLabs. The goal is to create a free and customizable TTS tool that facilitates reading articles, texts and books using local models or API-friendly TTS, while making sure the UX is up to standard to modern TTS platforms. Right now, the codebase is relatively simple but <strong>already 100% usable</strong> with support for Piper and Kokoro as well as PDF and Epub parsing. We are using Python for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend.</p> <p><strong>How can you contribute?</strong></p> <ul> <li>Any help is welcome:</li> <li>Coding (Python, JavaScript).</li> <li>UI/UX</li> <li>Documentation.</li> <li>Testing.</li> <li>Ideas and feedback.</",

Receipt Wrangler is a self-hosted, ai powered app that makes managing receipts easy. Receipt Wrangler is capable of scanning your receipts from desktop uploads, mobile app scans, or via email, or entering manually. Users can itemize, categorize, and split them amongst users in the app. Check out <a href=\"https://receiptwrangler.io/\">https://receiptwrangler.io/</a> for more information.</p> <p><strong>Development Highlights:</strong></p> <p><strong>Itemization (Desktop, Mobile WIP):</strong> Users can now actually itemize. This has been a missing feature in Receipt Wrangler for a long time, but now users may truly itemize. There are some UX improvements around adding items and shares, making it much faster to add them manually. Users may also split these new items as well, giving more flexibility in how to charge users.</p> <p><strong>Sync",
