And I remember shooting other players in a multiplayer platform and you have to survive to win or something along those lines. I remember it being played with a controller, but I have no idea if it was Xbox or PlayStation or some other console. It was pretty pixelated, but I do remember you\u2019re in like an arena of some kind in some of the maps. </p> <p>Please someone tell me I\u2019m not making this game up \ud83d\ude2d</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy_Secret8904\"> /u/Icy_Secret8904 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/",

Over a decade ago, there was software called 3darcade that served as a frontend for both cabinets and pins - it was a vr arcade without the need for glasses. The site looks like it hasn&#39;t been updated in quite some time (2021), so my question to you all is this: has anyone tried this recently or is still using it, and if not is there a more updated alternative? It&#39;s not that I&#39;m lazy or anything - I certainly don&#39;t mind putting in the time to set it all up for them, but I&#39;d hate to pitch the idea to them only to dash their hopes later on.
