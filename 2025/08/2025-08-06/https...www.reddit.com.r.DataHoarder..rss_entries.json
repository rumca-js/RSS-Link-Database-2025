When I add these files to MultiPar and create one par2 file, does it mean I cannot remove individual files from the list without compromising the recoverability of the other files? I never intended to link all the files but rather create one par2 file for each individual file, but still as a batch job out of convenience.

I currently have 1-1.5TB of data which will slowly increase over time. It&#39;s taken years to get to this point so it&#39;s not just going to shoot up overnight. I&#39;m debating on whether to go with a NAS or just some external drives that I&#39;d swap around for now..</p> <p>If I do a NAS, I would probably get something with 4 (or more) bays and start with two 4TB drives. After a while when that fills up, I can add a 3rd drive and go from there. 4-bay NASes look to generally be $200-$500 plus the drives. Plus I need a way to backup the NAS itself which would either cost more $$ for a large USB hard drive that I&#39;d have to manually swap around or cloud storage or something.</p> <p>The alternative is to just buy some 4TB external hard drives (like maybe the Seagate STGX4000400 for $99) and setup a rotation/sync between them. Even if I buy",

I currently own two separate servers with 3 main storage drives each, plus a cache drive and another one for TrueNAS. Due to how I&#39;d like to distribute the data, I&#39;d rather make them a single box and I&#39;m planning on using the leftovers to build an off site backup NAS. However, I&#39;m having a hard time finding a decent 8 drive NAS type case that can hold at least 8x3.5&quot; SATA drives that isn&#39;t huge and also supports a regular ATX PSU. </p> <p>I&#39;m not looking for anything too fancy, but I figured I might as well ask for people&#39;s recommendations as I didn&#39;t find posts that weren&#39;t a few years old. I considered getting this one but it seems like it needs a flex type PSU which I&#39;m trying to avoid: KCMconmey NAS-812</p> <p>I&#39;ve also seen a few options from Jonsbo that look pretty nice, but I&#39;m struggling to find a supplier that&#39;s not aliexpress.
