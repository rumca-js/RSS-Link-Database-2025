I used to be able to use apps like OVR Toolkit, but all of a sudden, it started lagging really bad when I tried to use it two nights ago, and it hasn\u2019t stopped since.</p> <p>I notice it happens a lot, when I\u2019m IN GAME, however, if I\u2019m in my home menus for either SteamVR or Meta- It doesn\u2019t lag, that I can see.</p> <p>When I\u2019m having these horrible lag spikes, it doesn\u2019t affect my desktop, only me in VR. Which is where I\u2019m confused, I\u2019ve even checked to see if my PC components have been overheating or anything, but no.</p> <p>Has anyone else been experiencing this, or is it just me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Saltee006\"> /u/Saltee006 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments",

Recently, I heard that Gravity Sketch just came to VR, so I got pretty excited and decided to give it a try. To be honest, I was totally surprised by how powerful VR modeling is. </p> <p>First came the feeling. In traditional modeling, you use a mouse and keyboard, and it feels like there\u2019s a barrier between you and the model. But in VR, I\u2019m grabbing shapes with my hands, pulling them out, rotating them, scaling them. It feels like molding clay in the air, and it&#39;s so intuitive. </p> <p>Also, the sense of spatial freedom was something traditional modeling just couldn\u2019t compare with. I could walk around my model, inspect it from any angle, and even scale the whole scene up until I could walk into it. </p> <p>Also, there&#39;s a small issue I&#39;d like to mention. When doing modeling, the controller plays an important role. Make sure ",

Around 2018 I was using Tiltbrush &amp; Kodon to do previs design for large scale sculpture, and build VR to 3D printing workflows. The system I was using then was a Nvidia 1080ti with HTC Vive.
