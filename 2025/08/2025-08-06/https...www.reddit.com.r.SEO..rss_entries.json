I&#39;m helping out with a website rebuild for a local organization, and they&#39;ve asked if we can soft-launch the new site one page at a time. That&#39;s not my usual MO, so I want to dot my I&#39;s and cross my T&#39;s before I wreck their rankings, if this is even an advisable way to do things.</p> <p>As best I can figure, the plan would be to create a subdomain (new.organization.com or similar) for the new site, and then build one page at a time there, one-by-one swapping out links on the old site for new subdomain ones as I go, until, when all of the new pages are finally built, I flip the switch and route the primary domain to the new site for good.</p> <p>Questions:</p> <ol> <li>What is the risk to our page rankings, if any, when users are re-directed to a subdomain?</li> <li>Should I be using 302 redirects on the primary domain side? 301? Or just in-line link swapping?</li> <li>What question should I be asking that I am not?</li>",
