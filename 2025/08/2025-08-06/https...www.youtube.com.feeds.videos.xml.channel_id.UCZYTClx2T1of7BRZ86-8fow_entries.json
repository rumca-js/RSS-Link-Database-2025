But after that, the disease supposedly vanished off the face of the Earth. With fatality rates as high as 90% according to some sources (perhaps closer to 30\u201350% on average), and death often coming in less than a day, it was far more serious than its name might suggest. And scientists still aren't sure what caused it. \n\nHosted by: Stefan Chin (he/him)\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon supporters for helping us keep SciShow free for everyone forever: Lyndsay Brown, David Johnston, Adam Brainard, Garrett G",
