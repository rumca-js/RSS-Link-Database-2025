The sales person has essentially posed that he could solve our problems be adding an agentic AI layer to essentially replace needing a L1 SOC analyst team. He is saying he needs access to our internal ticketing data rather than the log data the SIEM is ingesting to map out the incident management process for what they are building. I may be being over protective but I don&#39;t see why he would need access to our internal ticketing data to build an automation for alerting in potential security incidents. I built an everywhere rudimentary AI chatbot for helping agents determine if an alert should be escalated and did not need to feed it internal tickets to do so. </p> <p>If anyone could my ignorance in a space I&#39;m not fully versed I&#39;d fully appreciate it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",
