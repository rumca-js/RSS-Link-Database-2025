Scientists using cutting-edge satellite and drone data discovered that the Tintina fault, previously considered dormant, has produced multiple major earthquakes in the recent geological past and could do so again. These hidden fault lines, now identified near Dawson City, may be capable of triggering devastating quakes over magnitude 7.5, posing a serious threat to communities, infrastructure, and the unstable landslides in the region.",
