I just released OpenAuxilium, an open source chatbot solution that runs entirely on your own server using local LLaMA models.</p> <p>It runs an AI model locally, there is a JavaScript widget for any website, it handles multiple users and conversations, and there&#39;s zero ongoing costs once set up</p> <p>Setup is pretty straightforward : clone the repo, run the init script to download a model, configure your .env file, and you&#39;re good to go. The frontend is just two script tags.</p> <p>Everything&#39;s MIT licensed so you can modify it however you want.
