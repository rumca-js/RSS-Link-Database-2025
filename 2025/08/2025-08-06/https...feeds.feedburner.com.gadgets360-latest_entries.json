        "description": "In July 2025, a massive 8.8 earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered eruptions in seven volcanoes, including Klyuchevskaya Sopka and Shiveluch. Scientists called the rare multi-eruption event a \u201cparade of volcanoes\u201d\u2014not witnessed in nearly 300 years. Experts believe the quake altered crustal stress, making eruptions more likely. Dormant volcano Krasheninnikov erupted for the first time in 500 years. Though the region is sparsely populated, ash plumes could affect air travel. Researchers are watching closely, but say it\u2019s too soon to determine if all eruptions were directly triggered by the quake.",

However, a power issue on one spacecraft, SV1, has caused intermittent communication. Engineers believe the issue relates to sunlight availability on its solar panels and plan recovery efforts in August. Meanwhile, the second satellite, SV2, is healthy and undergoing final instrument commissioning. Once ready, SV2 will begin its science mission independently, while NASA works to recover SV1 and resume full dual-satellite operations critical to the mission\u2019s original research goals.",

Cosmic rays, which can penetrate rock and ice, break water molecules apart to release hydrogen, oxygen, and energy-rich electrons. These can fuel microbes in subsurface water, much like bacteria living deep below Earth. Simulations show Enceladus has the strongest potential for such life, followed by Mars and Europa. This expands the search for life to darker, colder environments\u2014even on rogue planets adrift in space.",
