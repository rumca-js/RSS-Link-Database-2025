I thought this community might have particularly interesting perspectives given Linux gaming&#39;s international nature.</p> <p>This study examines how non-native English speakers develop language skills through gaming. English often serves as a lingua franca in gaming communities, creating contexts where players regularly use English for communication and coordination. We&#39;re measuring language abilities and gaming habits to understand this population better.</p> <p>I&#39;m posting here because Linux gaming communities often have unique multilingual dynamics, and this community values software transparency. Our entire research infrastructure is built using only Free/Open Source software with no commercial APIs or proprietary tools.</p> <p><st",
