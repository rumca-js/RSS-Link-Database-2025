I would just like to say how disappointed I am in everybody here for continuing to use the app. Duolingo uses ai which harms the environment due to data cooling centers, replaces artists, replaces jobs for humans such as linguists, and removes human connection which what languages are all about. This company is setting the precedent for companies to downsize and make it harder for everyday people to survive due to ai. I am so disappointed and hope you all consider boycotting Duolingo until they pull back. They will simply continue to do this and other companies will follow. Crash the stock and let a company who doesn\u2019t care for you, yes they don\u2019t care for you, hear what we have to say. I beg of all of you in here to boycott and let them know this is not okay. The future will become very difficult very soon, in both our personal lives and environment.</p> ",

Now, I\u2019m not a tech guy but I\u2019m usually able to do the basics and Google stuff. However, this time I went to chat gpt.

But I can\u2019t help but get curious about the idea of having an AI girlfriend. I like anime and I use a couple of AI apps like Nectar AI to create anime-style arts for my wallpapers. That\u2019s how I found out that these platforms also offer an AI girlfriend. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m shocked that this kind of service exists but I was surprised by how popular it is.</p> <p>I tried it myself, with my girlfriend actually. We were laughing but we were seriously shocked and fascinated at the same time. It\u2019s way too realistic. They flirt and banter. They can empathize. You can call them. They can even send you pictures. Now I understand why some people truly fall in love with these AI companions.</p> <p>But what I\u2019m wondering about is what it\u2019s like from the other side. Nowadays, it\u2019s not just IQ that machines are learning. It\u2019s also EQ. So, is it really that impossible for a machine to genuinely fall in love wit",

Some people say it\u2019s a game-changer and the future of AI training and gaming, while others think the hype is a bit much given its apparent limitations and the fact that it\u2019s not widely accessible yet.</p> <p>What do you think does Genie 3 live up to the rumors, or are people getting ahead of themselves?

Go to any pro-AI thread and you&#39;ll see people literally making the argument akin to &quot;AI is a net positive. We just need UBI to be adopted and humanity can survive&quot;. Effectively translates to &quot;yeah, almost one will ever find work again. Humans will be basically obsolete, and we&#39;ll all starve to death if we don&#39;t all get free money forever&quot;.
