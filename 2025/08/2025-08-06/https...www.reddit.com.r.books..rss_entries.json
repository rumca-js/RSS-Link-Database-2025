The writing is so clunky and disjointed it\u2019s almost painful to read. The narrator \u201cthinks/feels\u201d one way and then says something completely different. It\u2019s so in your face at times that it feels like it\u2019s been written by AI. Half the time I\u2019m wondering what anything means. It\u2019s an interesting concept, but no depth at all so far. I\u2019m writing this to share my thoughts, which I\u2019m sure aren\u2019t novel, but also for someone to help me and point out why I dislike the writing so much in a more eloquent way. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ravenclawpatronus46\"> /u/ravenclawpatronus46 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1mjh4ui/red_rising_writing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1mjh4ui/red_rising_writing/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I was pleasantly surprised, because considering it was written in 1889, parts of this book are absurdly hilarious! </p> <p>On the surface it sounds rather boring: a travel story of a boat trip in a skiff up and down the Thames over a couple of weeks by the three friends, Jerome (our narrator and hypochondriac), George, and Harris, and the dog Montmorency. I later learned it was originally conceived to be a serious travelogue, with details of scenery and history, but somewhere in the course of writing it the comic elements took over. </p> <p>The humorous parts are the highlights \u2014 and thankfully, they make up most of the book.

A full half of the book is about &quot;Bloody Week,&quot; the pitched battle by the Army of Versailles to retake Paris from the Communards.

On one hand, we have the Communards, who have set up a functioning government of sorts, although as revolutions go, this one resembles more of an attempt to herd cats than anything else.
