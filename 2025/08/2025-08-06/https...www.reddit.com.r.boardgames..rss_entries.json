I do plan on buying the rest of the expansions as I absolutely love this game but the problem i would like to solve is to have everything in one box. I know stronghold games sells a big box for TM but that comes with the minis and im not going o repurchase the minis just for a cardboard box.

A little confusing since numbers are skipped, so its hard to really tell if you have them all and I couldn&#39;t find anything online about how many cards are in each Individual decks, just the overall count. Here&#39;s the info for anyone else who was looking for the same thing:</p> <p>(All card counts include the Act title cards as well as the &quot;Set up&quot; cards) Act 1- 75 Act 2- 82 Act 3- 89 Combat Skills- 12 Starter Weapons- 6 Races- 6 Classes- 12 Loot- 16 This equals the 298 total cards.

It&#39;s something I grew up with, but I\u2019ve never seen it documented or shared online before \u2014 so I decided to give it a name: High Card Curse.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fast-paced game for 2\u20136 players using a standard 52-card deck. One of its unique twists is that if you can\u2019t follow suit, you have to play a Curse card \u2014 which adds tension and strategy every round. The game is simple to learn but surprisingly competitive and fun.</p> <p>I\u2019m not looking for free work \u2014 just sharing the idea in case anyone in the dev community finds it interesting enough to adapt digitally or prototype it in some way. I&#39;d love to see it gain some recognition.</p> <p>\ud83d\udce9 feel free to DM me if you have any doubts and ill explain how it works.</p> <p>Thanks for reading, and I hope some of you give it a shot!</p> <p>High Card Curse \u2013 Rules and How to Play</p",

These friends always divided up the decks among everyone playing, and then we each laid our bunch of cards out in front of us so we could see the backs of all of them. So you can imagine our surprise when, after playing this way 15+ times, we see in the instruction booklet that you&#39;re not supposed to do this. And we don&#39;t understand why!
