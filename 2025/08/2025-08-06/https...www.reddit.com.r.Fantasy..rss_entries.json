My debut epic fantasy novel, <strong><em>Eternity&#39;s End: The Call of Zeil&#39;Galia</em></strong>, is officially out.</p> <p>For anyone in the long slog of writing a complex, multi-POV story, the biggest lesson I learned was the importance of letting your characters breathe and make mistakes. My story is about a young man named Aden who is thrown into a world of political intrigue and ancient magic, and the most rewarding part of writing it was seeing him and his found family of outcasts grow and fracture under that pressure.</p> <p>Finishing this book was the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever done, and I couldn&#39;t have stayed motivated without communities like this one. Thank you for being a source of inspiration. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions about my ind",

The finish product is not as bad as one should expect, however. This movie spins the franchise into a different direction by focusing on a different group of remarkable individuals, as they are studied and held captive in a sinister corporate asylum for mutants. With a colorful cast of characters with different powers, it made for a very fun movie. However, the story was very predictable, any and all plot twists were expected, and the main character really just felt like a vessel for conflict and to move these other character\u2019s stories along. It was not an unpleasant experience, though there were a few things they could have adjusted, but as a superhero fan knowing this is a \u201cnot-really an X-Men\u201d kind of movie.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ygseril\"> /u/Ygseril </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

In the sense that this magic has well-defined limits, a history, a logic, and requires conditions. All of Brandon Sanderson&#39;s novels have this type of magic, the &quot;hard magic system&quot;, but also novels like the Dreamblood duology (which I recently read), The Broken Earth trilogy, Powdermages... And today, many authors use this to create original magic systems. So, it&#39;s great because it keeps fantasy from going around in circles and allows readers to discover new things. But unexplained magic is very good too! People would hate The Lord of the Rings if it came out too because of its magic system, which would be considered too little explained. There are plenty of other books like that: Harry Potter, The Witcher... Let&#39;s take Harry Potter as an example. I find that the m",

I\u2019m not necessarily the biggest fan of Marvel aside from X-Men.</p> <p>Are there any novels that have a less pre-teen/teen outlook on being a superhero? I\u2019m looking for a grittier, more realistic outlook on the profession and it\u2019s hazards. I\u2019ve really enjoyed Invincible and the character arcs and concepts the series involves. </p> <p>Any recommendations? I don\u2019t really have a preference on gender when it comes to this genre, but outside of it I typically enjoy reading female protagonists more, however, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re in short supply outside of multi-pov books.</p> <p>I typically read more LOTR or GOT type of Fantasy rather than more sci-fi territory, but I\u2019ve been enjoying superheroes/villain media lately. Please give me your best recommendations/personal favorites!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

It has Eragon vibes but is even more interesting to me. I like how the magic is written and how power growth happens.
