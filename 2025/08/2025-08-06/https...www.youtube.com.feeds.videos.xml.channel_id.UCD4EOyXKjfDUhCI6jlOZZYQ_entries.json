They create the framework to deploy, manage and monitor connections between API's and Services.\n\nHe has worked to integrate AI into their platform and services and we will talk about his real world experience and results of this work. We'll talk about how he decided on which problems to try to solve, and then the process of trying to implement those solutions.\n\nIt's easy to say \"AI will take all of our jobs\", but it's a bit harder to get it to reliably work in production at scale.\n\nhttps://www.pandium.com/\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/shon-urbas/",
