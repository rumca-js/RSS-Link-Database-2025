I\u2019ve got a basic server running and can connect to some endpoints, but I\u2019m running into several major issues. I\u2019m using BIN files for data storage and processing, an HTTP debugger to intercept and analyze traffic, and the 2K24 API as a reference to understand and build 2K15\u2019s backend since the official 2K15 servers are offline. The problems I\u2019m facing include VC (Virtual Currency) not showing or updating correctly. I can\u2019t buy anything and the balance never updates. The store is completely broken. Prices don\u2019t show, and owned items aren\u2019t displayed. When trying to use MyPark spots, the game freezes and becomes unresponsive. The game also freezes or errors out when accessing online features like affiliation or rep reset. I\u2019m unsure if my server responses match what the game expects, especially since I\u2019m adapting the 2K24 API for 2K15. Th",
