        "description": "With a playable \"Pre-Alpha\" for the Earth 2 Metaverse finally in the hands of a select few community members... its time to take an honest look at what the \"game\" is, where it came from, the promises that have been made, and whats actually been delivered. \n\nFor the precious few that still cling to a delusion that this project will break technological barriers never before considered possible, seeing this new pre-alpha is sure to be an eye opening experience. \n\nCrypto projects that were built to capitalize on hype, by selling skins, and land for a game that doesn't exist, are sometimes exactly what they appear to be. Smoke, mirrors, and failure. \n\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: h",
