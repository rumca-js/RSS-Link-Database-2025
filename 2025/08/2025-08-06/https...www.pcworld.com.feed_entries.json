But today, Acer (via its official branded eBay store) is offering just such a deal: a refurbished 27-inch 1440p 240Hz gaming monitor, with that crucial IPS tech, <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/267099941092\">for just $178.99</a>. That\u2019s over $100 off the retail price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That refurbished status is presumably what\u2019s driving this hefty discount, and you\u2019d be right to be wary. But considering that this is coming directly from the manufacturer with a two-year warranty included (Allstate, so not amazing but better than the usual 90-day fare), I\u2019d say this still qualifies as a bargain\u2014and a pretty good one at that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding a fast IPS panel in this category is pretty tricky on a budget.

Since most of the apps I use daily are within the Microsoft ecosystem, it makes sense to use the Microsoft To Do app to make my list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re unfamiliar with it, To Do is Windows 11\u2019s built-in app for managing tasks. It works on the web but also across iOS and Android, which means I can get reminders about things I need to do from anywhere. It\u2019s also free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I especially like the My Day feature in Microsoft To Do, which is the app\u2019s personal daily planner. It\u2019s easy to follow and straightforward to set up tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I want to show you here is how to use Microsoft To Do to create tasks based on emails you flag from your Outlook inbox. It\u2019s something I do every morning, and it really boosts my productivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wh",

Yep, you can snag discounts on Windows 11. How much you\u2019ll save depends on your circumstances (and your stomach for hassle), but if you\u2019re lucky, you could technically get it for free. Legitimately for free, since installing Windows without ever activating it doesn\u2019t count as a full, sanctioned copy of the software.
