You just type in what you want to follow, AI keeps fetching the latest news for you every hour.</p> <p>I built it because I often had to jump between tech news sites, LinkedIn, and sometimes X to stay updated. But they either require me heavy filtering or get me distracted by something else. So I built this tool for myself to track recent stablecoin startups and later realized it can be useful for anyone for any topic.</p> <p>So it reads from about 2,000 sources: The Verge, TechCrunch, The New York Times, The Guardian, arXiv, IEEE, Nature, Frontiers, The Conversation, and many more. It covers everything from tech and research to politics and Hollywood.</p> <p>We\u2019re currently in beta. If you\u2019re interested to try it out, pls let me know!</p> <p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1mjesmf/video/g7bjzvxweghf1/player\">https://reddit.com/link/1mjesmf/video/g7bjzvxweghf1/player</a>",

Validate before you build, talk to users, don\u2019t just code in a vacuum, etc. I know all the lean startup advice. And yet\u2026yesterday, I broke my own rule and started building before doing any real validation.</p> <p>Why? Honestly, I got stuck. I just didn\u2019t know what else to do. Every guide out there says \u201cmake a landing page and collect emails,\u201d but what exactly do you put on that landing page if you don\u2019t have a product yet? Just a lot of text? That feels kind of pointless to me. I know I wouldn\u2019t trust a wall of text promising something cool \u201ccoming soon.\u201d And if someone asks me \u201chow does it actually work?\u201d I didn\u2019t have a good answer I could show.</p> <p>So I started building an MVP. I wanted to see if the tech side was even possible, and maybe, if I\u2019m being real, if I was actually capable of making it myself. I know there\u2019s always the risk of overbuilding or making something ",
