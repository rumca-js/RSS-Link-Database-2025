        "description": "Today I'm paying tribute to Terry Reid who has died, aged 75. He was responsible for one of my favourite albums, \"Seed of Memory\" and had, in my opinion,  the greatest voice. The second part of this tribute is a review of \"Faith To Arise\" from that album. \nTerry contributed so much to music. Many of the headlines this week mention Led Zeppelin - claiming that Terry \"turned down\" a request to join the band. The reality was more nuanced and it was actually Terry who introduced Robert Plant and John Bonham to Jimmy Page. Anyway, there is a lot more to say, but I urge you to listen to his music.\n\nTo see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nFor more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nRequest Cameo messages here: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Ri",
