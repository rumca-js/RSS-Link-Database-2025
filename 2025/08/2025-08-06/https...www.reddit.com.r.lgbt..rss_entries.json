I just don&#39;t really understand it and I&#39;d love to hear directly from people who are trans or know someone who is. How do you know you are trans? What does it feel like before and after hormones? Do you need hormones to feel better? Is surgery a must or can someone be trans without it?</p> <p>I know I can Google this but I feel like it&#39;s different hearing it from real people who\u2019ve lived it.</p> <p>For a long time I didn\u2019t really accept the idea maybe because I didn\u2019t understand it or had my own biases but then I thought I\u2019d be no better than the people who hate me for just being gay if I stayed close minde",
