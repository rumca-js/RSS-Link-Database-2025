        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone! I\u2019m new here and just getting started with a Raspberry Pi 5 project. We&#39;re currently working on a build that includes the Raspberry Pi 5 along with an AI Hat, but we\u2019ve run into a bit of a challenge when it comes to the casing. We\u2019ve been searching around for a case that can properly accommodate both the Pi 5 and the AI Hat stacked together, but so far we haven\u2019t had any luck finding one that fits well or offers proper ventilation and support for the hardware.</p> <p>Ideally, we\u2019re looking for a case that can securely hold both components, offer easy access to the ports, and provide decent cooling\u2014especially since we expect the AI Hat to generate a bit of heat during operation. If anyone here has experience with a similar setup or can recommend a case that works for this combination, we\u2019d really appreciate your suggestions. Links or product references would be super helpful too. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit",
