I have heaps of time to crunch out audiobooks at work and i\u2019ve recently finished some good solo books and now i\u2019m looking for a new, long series to get stuck into. Im quite picky with the books i\u2019ve read, i\u2019ve dropped a few books cause i couldn\u2019t quite stick it out for various reasons, but if they\u2019re recommended enough i\u2019ll persevere. </p> <p>Love some sci/fi / fantasy, horror, mystery, anything like that with a good jaw dropping moments. Can be funny too but has gotta have some twists or some \u201choly fuck\u201d moments. Big fan of like cool magic systems too. </p> <p>Some recent books i\u2019ve finished and loved are Dungeon Crawler Carl, The Girl with all the Gifts, Project Hail Mary, and In The Shadow of Lightning,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lumberjack1888\"> /u/Lumberjack1888 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mjkjr9/help_me_choose_my_next_book_serie",

One of our units is coursework, where we have to write an essay comparing and contrasting two novels, one being pre-21st century, and the other being 21st century (my exam board is CCEA). The school chooses a vague theme from a list, and we write our own question, choose our own novels etc. Our theme is &quot;Outsiders&quot;.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read Giovanni&#39;s Room by Baldwin and I love it to bits. I&#39;m dead set on writing about it for my coursework as my pre-21st century novel, but I&#39;m now struggling to pick a good comparison novel. Could anyone suggest some novels from the 21st century that fits the theme of &quot;Outsiders&quot; and would compare well with the themes of Giovanni&#39;s Room?</p> <p>Sorry for the somewhat long post, I felt that the context was important, lol. Thank you in advance!</p> </d",

I like books that are entertaining, but also help you learn something. It doesn&#39;t need to be strictly educational, just help you know more about the topic than you did before. My favorites are born a crime by Trevor Noah (I learned more about apartheid), modern romance by Aziz Ansari (love the sociology aspect), and everything is tuberculosis by by John Green. I also love learning about subcultures, especially cults. I enjoyed educated by Tara Westover and I love listening to cult podcasts. I exclusively use audiobooks while multitasking, so I have a hard time getting into complicated fiction narratives with multiple characters. I like books where you can accidentally tune out for a minute and not totally lose the plot.

Part of the challenge is you have to read 10 pages everyday of a non-fiction book (I\u2019m doing 20 pages to tweak it a little bit). Just as the title says tho, I\u2019m halfway through my 20\u2019s now and still feel kinda lost. Looking for a book that after I\u2019ve read it, I come out with a clearer mind and maybe a different outlook on life. Nothing too crazy lol but it\u2019s time I start having more of an open minded view.</p> <p>Any and all suggestions are appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Appropriate_Tie2168\"> /u/Appropriate_Tie2168 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mipoka/looking_for_books_that_help_when_you_feel_lost/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mipoka/looking_for_books_that_help_when_you_feel_lost/\">[comments]</a></span>",
