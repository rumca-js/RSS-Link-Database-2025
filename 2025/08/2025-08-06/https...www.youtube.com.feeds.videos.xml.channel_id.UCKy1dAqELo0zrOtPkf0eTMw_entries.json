The beta goes live for this weekend and next, but early access to those with codes begins tomorrow. And early access or not, expect some long wait times if you're trying to get in. In Nintendo news, the creator of Pok\u00e9mon and the former CEO of The Pok\u00e9mon Company confirmed that Nintendo of America had some notes on Pikachu's original design. Before the game made its way to the U.S., Nintendo of America reportedly wanted to add \"large breasts\" to everyone's favorite electric mouse, and also wanted to toughen up some of the other pok\u00e9mon, to make them less cute. Thankfully, those notes were ignored. And finally, Genshin Impact is being delisted on PS4 next month, and will be shutdown for that console next year. Don't worry, PS5 players will not be affected.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Battlefield6",
