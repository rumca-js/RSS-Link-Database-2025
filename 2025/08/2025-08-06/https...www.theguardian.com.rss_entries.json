Whether they\u2019re the actual record-holder (The Simpsons), a once-canceled cult show turned institution (Family Guy, or the cable-channel-hopping Futurama), or a \u201cnewer\u201d show that\u2019s actually entering its 16th season (Bob\u2019s Burgers), these shows leverage their age-defying format to serve as both a constant in their viewers\u2019 lives and a living document of contemporary American life over their many years on the air. So it\u2019s not unusual that King of the Hill, a Fox cartoon that aired in the late 90s and throughout the 2000s, would rejoin its corporate cousins for a 14th season on Hulu. But just as during the show\u2019s original run, it\u2019s an odd fit with those other, brasher animated sitcoms \u2013 sometimes bless",
