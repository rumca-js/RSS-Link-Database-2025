I actually can write something &quot;OK&quot; with Django and build my idea in a very complicated way ( though this is my next problem, I don&#39;t know what goes well and wrong ). If you guys have any experience writing product-style code what kind of coding structure/formula do you use, is what makes code production level is following DRY or SOLID principles or anything beyond. If there&#39;s a github repo you follow as a model for your Django projects or any other kind of resources ( a youtube tutorial or an online e-book), I&#39;d be happy to hear.
