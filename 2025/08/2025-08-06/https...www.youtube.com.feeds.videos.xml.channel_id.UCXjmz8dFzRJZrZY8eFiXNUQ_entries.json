        "description": "Some franchises start with a bang\u2026 and end in disaster. Others flop right out of the gate. Today, we\u2019re diving into the biggest failed TV shows and movie franchises that had all the potential in the world\u2014and still crashed and burned.\n\nFrom Westworld, Prison Break, and True Detective\u2014shows that began with huge buzz but lost audiences after Season 1\u2014to major box office misfires like The Mummy (2017), Tomorrowland, and Conan the Barbarian, these projects were supposed to launch cinematic universes and long-running series. Instead? Cancellations, bad reviews, and millions lost.\n\nSo what went wrong? Poor writing? Studio interference? Audience fatigue? We break it all down.\n\n#failure #westworld #themummy #prisonbreak #truedetective",
