But I&#39;m really keen to start using my NAS for a few Self Hosted services such as Calendar and Notes via Nextcloud to be able to sync with other devices that aren&#39;t on my local network. I&#39;d also like to be set up some kind of rudimentary file transfer web portal for my clients. So, ideally I&#39;d like to use my own domain.<br/> I&#39;ve dabbled in the past with using my own domains via Cloudflare, with proxy enabled, pointed at my external IP. Purely for my own personal use, but I noticed through Cloudflare stats that the domain was getting 10&#39;s of thousands of requests within 48 hours. So I got nervous and took it all offline.<br/> Is there a more secure way to set up remote access just for both my own convenience, but then also be able to share files with anyone?<br/> Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mar",

I&#39;ve been in the selfhosting scene for about a year and have always struggled with finding the best/right way of getting my docker containers to access storage on my remote NAS. </p> <h1>My Setup</h1> <p>For the sake of my issues, my current setup consists of a mini pc running proxmox and a synology NAS. </p> <p>On proxmox, I have an Ubuntu VM running portainer with a few docker containers. I have jellyfin and immich running this way. Because these services typically need to utilize a lot of storage, I have setup these services to store their data on my NAS with 8TB of storage available. </p> <p>The way I have connected them is by creating a shared folder on my NAS for each service and enabling NFS connections from my ubuntu server and then mounting the connection to my VM. So when setting up Immich for example, I would create a shared folder called &quot;Immich Data&quot; on my NAS, enable and configure NFS connections for the shared folde",
