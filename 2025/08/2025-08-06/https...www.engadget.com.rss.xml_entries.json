The rover has several goals, most of which are meant to help scientists determine whether Mars could ever have supported life in the past. And while it&#39;s still very much operational and doing science, NASA has had to make adjustments and give it new capabilities to ensure that it can keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/marking-13-years-on-mars-nasas-curiosity-picks-up-new-skills/\">new post celebrating</a> the 13th anniversary of the rover&#39;s landing, NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has detailed the updates the Curiosity team has had to implement.
