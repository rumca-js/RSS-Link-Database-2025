I used to see posts/comments sometimes they posted themselves (I would notice when they would be called out by the replies), but often they just showed up in the comments of other posts and still be called out. I was new back then and a bit skeptical, but how did members know? Was it because they acted in ways that made them stand out as real law enforcement? How did the community actually spot them?

When a new episode comes I out, I wait a day or so until the sites are updated, but then sometimes this shit happens and it keeps showing the wrong show. Whoever is in charge of these servers needs to do a better job when uploading the files. Who tf wants to watch Skinwalker Ranch when they&#39;re in the mood for a new South Park? Anyways, I just wanna know why yhis happens. There&#39;s also another occurrence with shows that have an A and B plot, they split them as their own episodes, which is fine, but not when they start messing up the order or the names, or have an episode repeat because they uploaded the two halves and then upload it as one on another episode. These guys who post the files don&#39;t really seem to know what they&#39;re doing, and it always takes months to get fixed. But why, is what I want to know?

I always look for 1080p x265 to start with and expand from there if I&#39;m not finding what I want at my preferred quality. I definitely prefer bluray rips over web-rips or web-DL&#39;s. </p> <p>For this particular show, the only x265 bluray rips I found had bitrates on the low side, mostly ranging from 2 Mbps up to 3 Mbps. I prefer a minimum of 4 Mbps, especially if it&#39;s something with a lot of action/effects (which this is). I actually have kind of a narrow range I aim for, big enough not to regret it later (in terms of picture quality), small enough that it doesn&#39;t eat up all my hard drive space (I can&#39;t afford a new drive right now). </p> <p>Looking beyond x265, I found no remuxes on public sites (I&#39;ve never gotten into private ones), the only bluray torrents I can find are releases from BORDURE",
