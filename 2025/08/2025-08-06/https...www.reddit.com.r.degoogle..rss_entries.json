Outside of that I have noticed that even some people here still use WhatsApp, and not Signal, since everyone else in their circle keep using that. What&#39;s the point then? </p> <p>My point is that if I want full privacy I would just limit my internet usage. But as of now it&#39;s impossible to degoogle simply bcs of Gmail. Even if I send a mail from proton mail, chances are, it will end up on Gmail and be read by Google. </p> <p>It would be more possible to avoid having a certain point of financial security, and a job position in a company that also cares about privacy. Otherwise, it feels like all these manipulations are in vain. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Just_Explorer1284\"> /u/Just_Explorer1284 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1mj3vwb/co",

I was using Google&#39;s because it was convenient, and right there, built into chrome. But since I have stopped using chrome and deleted all of my passwords from Google&#39;s password manager, I&#39;m not sure I even need one. I have a physical storage system for my passwords, as I always have. They are very neatly organized and easily accessible to me. This password box never leaves my home, and stays in a locked drawer in my desk when not in use. I work from home, and don&#39;t actually leave my home very often, so I think it&#39;s highly unlikely that someone will come here to steal my passwords. I&#39;m pretty good at keep up with changing my passwords regularly and at coming up with strong, unique ones for each account. Thoughts? Am I fine as I am or is there some blind spot to this system I have? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",
