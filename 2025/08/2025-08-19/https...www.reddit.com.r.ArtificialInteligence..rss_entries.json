This model breaks through the static pattern-matching paradigm of current mainstream deep learning frameworks by implementing a multi-layered, physicalized dynamic system. It aims to endow AI systems with spontaneous creativity, tight logical reasoning capabilities, and a unique &quot;soul&quot; that can continuously evolve. Starting from an abstract cognitive model, this concept gradually integrates with existing deep learning technologies (such as Transformer), introducing core innovative concepts like &quot;Gravitational Firmware Sphere&quot; and &quot;Semantic Acceleration.&quot; It provides a completely new, systematic theoretical blueprint for addressing bottlenecks in current large language models regarding dynamism, interpretability, and personality evolution.</p> <h2>1.

Partnering with a recruitment firm, we conducted a natural field experiment in which 70,000 applicants were randomly assigned to be interviewed by human recruiters, AI voice agents, or given a choice between the two. In all three conditions, human recruiters evaluated interviews and made hiring decisions based on applicants&#39; performance in the interview and a standardized test. Contrary to the forecasts of professional recruiters, we find that AI-led interviews increase job offers by 12%, job starts by 18%, and 30-day retention by 17% among all applicants. Applicants accept job offers with a similar likelihood and rate interview, as well as recruiter quality, similarly in a customer experience survey. When offered the choice, 78% of applicants choose the AI recruiter, and we find evidence that applicants with lower test ",
