The wait for <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2\">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> has been an excruciating one. This is the long-awaited follow-up to <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/retrospective-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines\">the flawed but respected Bloodlines 1</a> from 2004, and it was originally announced in 2019 with a release date of 2020.

I do. That was when the titanic scale of FromSoftware's magnum opus hit me: pools of glinting water stretched as far as the eye could see; mist curled around endless rock formations. Such was the sheer massiveness of the space, I felt as if I was being swallowed whole by it, experiencing a kind of horizontal vertigo.
