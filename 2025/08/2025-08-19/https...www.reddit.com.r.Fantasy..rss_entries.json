My favorite series are The First Law, Realm of the Elderlings, ASOIAF and the first few books of Stormlight. I also really enjoyed the Bloodsworn Saga, some of Mark Lawrence&#39;s works and (obviously) LOTR.</p> <p>I also like to read literary fiction, especially the &quot;sad girl summer&quot; aesthetic (i.e. works by Ottessa Moshfegh, Sally Rooney, Sylvia Plath etc.).

This is all just theoretical for if he ever changes his mind.</p> <p>Abraham wrote the Graphic Novels for ASOIAF which implies a close relationship with Martin and that he is a big fan of the series already, similarly to how Sanderson was a huge fan of Wheel of Time. He also co-wrote The Expanse with Martin\u2019s editor Ty Franck under the James S.A. Corey pseudonym.

I\u2019ve read series by authors like Brandon Sanderson, George R R Martin, Joe Abercrombie, Pierce Brown, Robin Hobb, James Islington, Christopher Ruocchio, Evan Winters, etc etc. It\u2019s definitely my cup of tea. However when it comes to watching TV I\u2019ve found myself enjoying more modern and contemporary thrillers and dramas (ex: Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul two of my favorite shows of all time). So I started thinking more about maybe reading books outside of the fantasy/sci fi genre to broaden my tastes. I\u2019m really open to anything, but I\u2019m always going to be a sucker for thrillers and mysteries, but I\u2019m open to other things as well. Definitely anything that\u2019s character driven with a good plot. Preferably series because I\u2019m a big series guy, although I don\u2019t mind a standalone either if you have a really good standalone rec. I\u2019m also looking for more contemporary pieces but I\u2019",

I have only ever given two other books 10/10 (Wuthering Heights and Name of the Wind). Mammoths at the Gates surpassed both handily (to the point where I am considering lowering their scores, but I won&#39;t do that until I re-read them). The way this novella addresses the fullness of grief (the bad, and even a bit of the good) has me literally tearing up just thinking about it. Actually perfect, imo. Makes great, if somewhat indirect, use of the series&#39;s foundational themes of storytelling, as well as Chih&#39;s journey.</p></li> <li><p>Empress of Salt and Fortune-9/10.
