        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, been seeding about 7 files (TV series) on QBittorent from my D: drive for a few months but it recently got wiped due to the SSD failing (was complementary with the laptop so we suspect it was already failing) and I stupidly did not have a backup. Is there any option to just change from seeding the torrents (showing expectedly as error: missing files) to downloading the torrents? I haven&#39;t finished watching some of them :( thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RaspberryFluffy5955\"> /u/RaspberryFluffy5955 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1mun4lv/possible_to_switch_from_seeding_to_torrenting_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1mun4lv/possible_to_switch_from_seeding_to_torrenting_in/\">[comments]</a></span>",
