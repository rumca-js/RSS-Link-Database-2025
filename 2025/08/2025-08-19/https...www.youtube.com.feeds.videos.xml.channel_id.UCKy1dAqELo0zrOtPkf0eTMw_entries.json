        "description": "I didn't really know what to expect from Vampire: The Masquerade -- Bloodlines 2 given the long, shadowed path it took to finally rest in my undead talons. But leading with a well-written and well-voiced mystery story that lets me explore my urban hunting ground with cool movement abilities has me intrigued to say the least. I don't love the combat so far, and the Masquerade system seems a bit too forgiving. But I'm thirsty to spend more time with it. Previewed by Leana Hafer\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
