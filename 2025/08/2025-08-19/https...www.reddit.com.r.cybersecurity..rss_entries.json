This isn\u2019t just a visual refresh, it\u2019s a fully updated, actively maintained platform designed to make exploring certifications easier and more insightful.</p> <p>Key Features:</p> <ul> <li><p>Advanced Filtering: Narrow down certifications by vendor, specialty, sub-specialty, budget (across 6 currencies), exam type, and soon, HR-recognized status.</p></li> <li><p>Certification Comparer: Select any two certifications and compare them side-by-side across multiple criteria.</p></li> <li><p>Help me build by using the buttons: Request a cert to be added, request an official cert review, report a bug, suggest a feature</p></li> </ul> <p>Cross-Platform Access:</p> <ul> <li><p>Desktop version: Full-featured experience</p></li> <li",

Let me explain better, I need to understand when a software is developed for a large company what are the limits, the advice, the directives to be given to make it develop as much as possible in compliance with the company, what the reference directives are. Cubersecurity has many frameworks and many directives but from this point of view I still see people developing in C# without a minimum of security control. That is, I am interested in what needs to be considered in each phase of development, what needs to be advised to the developer and much more. Thank you. For now I have been general if the discussion takes hold I will add more details.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Surprise_6660\"> /u/Ok",
