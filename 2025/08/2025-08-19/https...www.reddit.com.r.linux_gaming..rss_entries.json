Now typically, when running on both hyprland and kde, the process is very simple. All you should need is a compositor that supports hdr (Hyprland/KDE/GNOME/maybe some others), an HDR monitor, a new version of mesa and a game with hdr support. If you&#39;re playing games on wine you&#39;ll probably also need Proton GE 10 since HDR requires proton to be on wayland. The launch options that work for me in 99% of cases are `PROTON_ENABLE_HDR=1 PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 %command%`. This kind of HDR implementation should work for any games support HDR PQ. The expected and usual behavior is that when the game opens, your screen should switch into HDR mode and you should be good to go.</p> <h1>Common issues:</h1> <p>HDR BLOWN OUT:</p> <p>I found nearly instantly a few issues with the approach I just outlined above.

On my Ryzen 7600X/RX7900XT box running Ubuntu 24.04.3 (kernel 6.14) and Mesa 25.2 (from the mesarc PPA) enabling frame gen drops my 1440p FPS to ~120 from the usual ~180. I&#39;m not running any FSR/XESS or RT and all settings but motion blur are on high. This is fairly standard setup, no optiscaler or other tweaks.</p> <p>On my Windows 10 install on the same box turning on frame gen results in an average FPS of ~320 from the usual 175. I installed Zorin 17 to see if a older kernel (6.8) and an older Mesa revision would help but it didn&#39;t. I&#39;ve also tried every combo of upscaling/graphics tweaks to no avail. I just bought Cyberpunk this weekend so I don&#39;t have any data from an older version to compare it to nor do I have another game that uses frame gen.

I\u2019ve noticed a strange issue, the higher the FPS, the more laggy the game feels. At 60 FPS it feels smoother than at 100+. I\u2019ve tried every possible Proton setting, but nothing seems to help. Even when capped at 60, it feels smooth and playable at first, but after about 30 minutes it starts feeling like 15 FPS even though the Steam FPS counter still shows 100\u2013110 FPS. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there a known fix or setting I should try?
