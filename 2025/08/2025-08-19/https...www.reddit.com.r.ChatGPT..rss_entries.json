OpenAI\u2019s global revenue is around $12B a year, and most of that\u2019s coming from the U.S. and other developed countries because people there are more likely to pay $20/month.</p> <p>If you look at traffic share + who can actually afford the Plus plan, the U.S. probably brings in like $4B+, the UK maybe $600M, Canada and Australia closer to $200\u2013250M each. These are very rough estimates. Obviously, the actual numbers may vary a lot.</p> <p>Now India\u2019s been one of the top traffic sources (like 9% of global users), but almost nobody was paying $20. With 68M free users there, even if just 3\u20138% convert at $4.60, that\u2019s about $110\u2013300M a year in new revenue.</p> <p>Basically, India could end up contributing as much as Canada or Australia, maybe even the UK, on the low end.

I can explain a problem 30 times and it still doesn&#39;t figure out how to do it. It keeps using methods I told it doesn&#39;t work, or methods it&#39;s tried before that got nowhere. It feels like I&#39;m banging my head at this point.</p> <p>I give it simple instructions and it just cannot manage it. I&#39;ve resorted to just insulting it for failing so much. Nothing&#39;s really changed besides it starting every response with &quot;I understand your frustration&quot; like the fuck you do!
