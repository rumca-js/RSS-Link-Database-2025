Also, I&#39;m not from North America, but my question is in reference to that region.</p> <p>If a game (let&#39;s say Wild Arms for PS1) released in mid-1997, would you still be able to walk into a mall in USA or Canada and find a copy in the summer of 1998? This game never got a Greatest Hits re-release and wasn&#39;t part of any big franchise so I&#39;m wondering.</p> <p>I went to a mall in Miami in summer 2002 and found Zelda: Oracle of Seasons &amp; Ages still there. Those games originally released over a year before (May 2001) but Zelda is a huge franchise so it&#39;s not too surprising it was still there. </p> <p>Any insight?
