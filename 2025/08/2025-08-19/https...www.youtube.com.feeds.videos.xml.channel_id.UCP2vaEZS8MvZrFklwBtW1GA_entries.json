        "description": "ZipWall dust barrier tips\u2026I have to protect this new vanity from drywall dust. The combination of three @zipwall_llc poles, 4 mil plastic and FoamRails keep the cabinet and lights safe. I use this system on every project to keep my work area separate from the rest of the home and maintain a dust-free environment for clients. Many thanks to ZipWall for sponsoring this project \ud83d\udd25#zipwall #dustbarrier #homerenovation #diy #homerepairtutor",
