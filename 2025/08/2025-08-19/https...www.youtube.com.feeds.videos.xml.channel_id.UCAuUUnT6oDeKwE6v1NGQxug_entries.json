Join us for future events by becoming a member today.\nIf you think democracy is some kind of inevitable, default setting for the world, then you aren't going to have it for very long, says historian and author Timothy Snyder. From World War I to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Snyder dives into the structures that uplift and tear down political systems, offering a historical perspective on the current state of democracy around the world as well as the patterns of thought that lead to tyranny. Learn more about a new approach to democracy that could help create and protect a future of freedom.",

        "description": "Sometimes feeding just one child can seem challenging. Not for entrepreneur Wawira Njiru, who\u2019s gone from serving lunch to 25 children from a makeshift kitchen to establishing her nonprofit, Food4Education, as a cornerstone of Kenya\u2019s school meals system. Currently serving half a million meals to children every day, she\u2019s now thinking even bigger. Hear about her incredible plan to serve delicious, nutritious daily meals to millions of kids across Africa by 2030. (This ambitious idea is part of The Audacious Project, TED\u2019s initiative to inspire and fund global change.)
