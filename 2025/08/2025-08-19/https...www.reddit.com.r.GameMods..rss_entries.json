        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So ive recently started a retro video game collection. And when i tried tracking down some n64 games i realized how expensive they are so i decided to go the route of a flash cart for the n64. Found one with good reviews. It seems to work really well a for the most part. But ive notice after using it a few times for a few solid hours of game time when i go to put everything away my n64 and the flash cartridge itself are very warm not quite hot like it doesnt burn my hands or anything and doesnt seem to be causing any noticeable damage. But its enough to concern me and i cant find any other reviews stating they had this pioblem. So i guess my question is. Should i be worried about it or is that normal i feel like its not meant to get that hot and i cant tell if its coming from the flash cart or from the console because of the flashcart. Thank you for any advice anyone could give me hopefully ive posted this in the right place im not very familiar with ",
