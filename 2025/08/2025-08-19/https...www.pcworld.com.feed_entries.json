So it\u2019s more important than ever to have a great VPN that works well on your phone. While some services work best on Windows, others particularly shine when used on Android devices, and I\u2019ve curated a list of my favorites to help you find the best choice for your smartphones and tablets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When determining what makes for a good VPN for Android, I consider several criteria on top of standard VPN essentials. It\u2019s crucial that it has full functionality on the Android OS. Also, since Wi-Fi can be inconsistent at times, I test these apps over multiple days to look at speed and consistency of service.
