I\u2019m especially looking for one-on-one or small group conversations (big groups overwhelm me a bit \ud83d\ude05). Nothing formal, just chatting, hanging out, and making friends while improving.

I bought my quest at a time shortly before the quest 3 was released. My PC is pretty high-end, so I could usually handle my VR quite well.<br/> My question is, if you guys think a quest 2 is enough or a good enough choice?</p> <p>Also there is an issue I&#39;m facing. I usually connect my quest to my PC durring gaming sessions via link cable. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve recently run into an issue where my computer fails to recognize that my quest has speakers, making it that I can&#39;t hear the game through my headset.
