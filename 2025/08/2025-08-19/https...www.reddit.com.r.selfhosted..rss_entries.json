Welcome <a href=\"https://github.com/EldritchGarden/dailimage?tab=readme-ov-file\">dailimage</a>, a lightweight and simple web server to serve random images. Well, technically it can serve any file type, but it&#39;s <em>intended</em> for images.</p> <p>It&#39;s written in Go using the Gin web framework, and it&#39;s also my first Go project so roast me if it sucks. For now the only way to run it is with Docker, but I&#39;ll probably release standalone binaries in the future. I also have only built images for amd64, so for now you&#39;ll have to build it yourself for arm. I will release arm builds in the future.</p> <p>This is the very first release, and there&#39;s two routes available:</p> <ul> <li><code>/random</code> : Get a random image from the mounted media dir</li> <li><code>&#39;/random/*subdir</code>: Get a random image from<code>subdir</code>under the media dir.

This is particularly relevant if you want to use the device as a server, as it needs to be connected 24/7.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working on a systemd service to address this issue. WakeMyPotato (WMP) will schedule automatic rtcwake calls in the near future so that the service restarts automatically after an accidental shutdown. If the laptop has a battery, WMP will also safely disconnect any RAID devices before performing an emergency shutdown to prevent mechanical wear to the HDDs. The service will restart automatically once AC power is restored!</p> <p>I&#39;m really happy with this project so far. It&#39;s easy to install and maintain, and is freely available on GitHub.

I tired and really tried enabling the GPU in Jellyfin for an accelerated transcoding. I watched youtube videos, used chatgpt, but nothing worked. I realized there was a Jellyfin NVIDIA on the CasaOS after like 6 hrs of just trying. I deleted Jellyfin and afterwards I installed the &quot;dedicated&quot; version. It also didn&#39;t work.

I configure services, write scripts, deploy my app, tweak settings\u2026 and for months I remember all the commands because they\u2019re in my shell history.</p> <p>But when I leave the server for a while and come back later - I forget everything.</p> <pre><code>\u2022 Which services are running where? \u2022 How do I restart them? \u2022 Which scripts live in which folders? \u2022 What were the exact deploy steps? </code></pre> <p>It takes me hours to recall or re-learn the workflow.</p> <p>What I wish existed is a tool that could analyze my shell history, detect patterns, and generate multiple small playbooks/guides. Something that would summarize: \u2022 how I usually deploy, \u2022 how I usually fix issues, \u2022 how I run and maintain services.</p> <p>Basically: auto-docs/playbooks from my command history.</p> <p>Does something like this already exist?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",
