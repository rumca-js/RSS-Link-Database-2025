This is the studio's debut game, and a hands-on demo is available for those at Gamescom this week. I watched the demo ahead of its release at a preview event, and the game is an alluring combination of part-ghost story, part-musical, and part-renovation game. The heart of the game is the ghost story, though, and the developer works to make this spooky seaside tale approachable for everyone.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">In There Are No Ghosts at the Grand, you play as Chris David, a character who has inherited The Grand, a dilapidated hotel located along the English coast. Chris is initially only tasked with restoration of the hotel, but he is ultimately drawn into rooting out a deeper mystery that surrounds the town and the people who live there.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data",

In a nutshell, RTX Hair uses Disjoint Orthogonal Triangle Strips (DOTS) to improve lighting and shadows in video game hair, which Nvidia says is a solution that doesn't require a lot of extra memory as opposed to using triangles to render hair for every frame.</p><p>By using linear swept spheres, hair will look more realistic because the geometry is naturally round, thus making it easier to avoid self-intersection when casting shadow and reflection rays. This will allow Harrison Ford's digital doppelganger in the Indiana Jones game to sport a fuller head of hair when the update to the real-time path tracing mode arrives next month. The feature will be available to RTX-50 series GPUs, and earlier this year, <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/render-path-traced-hair-in-real-time-with",
