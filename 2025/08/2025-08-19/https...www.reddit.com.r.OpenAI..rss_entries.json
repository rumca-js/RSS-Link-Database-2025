I\u2019m on the Plus plan with a 32K window and I dont use memory or preferences. I run sessions manually, supplying a directive file each time. One of my directives is indexing, where every reply starts with an alphanumerical index prefixed by @. That way I can reference earlier points directly. If I stop seeing the index, I assume the directive fell out of context and I just re-provide it. With earlier versions that worked fine.</p> <p>With chatGPT5 though, re-providing doesnt really work. It acts like it\u2019s obeying but then doesnt follow the instructions correctly. In one session, after I re-sent the directive file and told it to continue indexing, it literally wrote the word \u201cINDEX\u201d and then resumed numbering, but not in the right format. Which makes me think it isnt actually reading the directive, just guessing at what it was. Ot",
