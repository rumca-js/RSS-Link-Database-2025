Lubuntu. and more.</p> <p>And after trying all of these distros. i eventually settled on mint just because it seemed to be the most streamlined.</p> <p>But ive thought a lot. Why do you even bother with other distros? the only thing i notice are the difference in package managers. Obviously theres a difference in Desktop Environments. But thats different. Why would you use Ubuntu with KDE instead of Fedora with KDE. Because i really wouldnt notice the difference.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DefinitelyChriss\"> /u/DefinitelyChriss </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1mu97jp/why_do_you_use_your_distro/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1mu97jp/why_do_you_use_your_distro/\">[comments]</a></span>",
