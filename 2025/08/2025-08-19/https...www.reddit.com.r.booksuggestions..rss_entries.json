There have been issues with animals, but i wont go into that here. Despite all these traits, he can be super charming and friendly.

I\u2019m currently reading the last book in the inheritance games saga, glorious rivals, and I\u2019m in the market for a new book similar to TIG once i finish. To be honest, I started the series for the hawthorne brothers and not the mystery (though i love that part too)- so looking for recommendations of books with a similar theme. Mainly just overprotective but emotionally vulnerable guys like Grayson and Jameson or something with a similar brotherly bond \ud83d\ude04 I\u2019ve heard people like the naturals by the same author, so should I read that one next?

I have a fresh second grade kiddo who is currently reading at a a pretty high level. He needs to do nightly reading for school and I\u2019m having a hard time finding books that he enjoys that are at his reading level. He mostly enjoys non fiction books. Last year he devoured all of the battle vs books where it shows who would win in a fight between certain animals. This year he has been using the 1950\u2019s set of encyclopedias that I have to look up and read about random topics. He has asked for more books about animals and also wants \u201cscary books\u201d we tried goosebumps but he was not impressed. He has also finished all of the magic tree house books the summer before kinder and enjoyed those. So I\u2019m looking for 1. Scientific books that are age and level appropriate 2. Horror that won\u2019t scar my 7yr old( we argued for 30 minutes about why he couldn\u2019t read my copy of IT and Pet Ceme",

What I have noticed is that most protagonists upgrade only little of their attributes while leaving the others in the dust. Say a protag had strength, dexterity, regen, endurance and intelligence, he/she would probably focus on strength and regen and leave the rest of attributes trailing behind. You can see that in Hell Difficulty Tutorial, Savage Awakening, Primal Hunter, Defiance of the Fall, etc. And I am tired of that. I am looking for a story where the protag evenly distributes upgrades to all of his attributes. Any recommendations? Also if possible, any cultivation or other types of fantasy where the protag tries to learn as many different styles of combat, weaponry and chi/mana/madra/chakra/&quot;insert relevant energy source&quot; types as possible?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",

And it just shows what they&#39;re really capable of. And then their comrades come in, and they&#39;re still kinda out of it and trying to protect the body of the deceased because they&#39;re blinded by the rage and sadness that they can&#39;t see it&#39;s their friends. These scenes fill me with so much emotion it makes me feel so much for the mc, and I can&#39;t help but love these moments. My best example is one I just read from Frostbite by Richelle Mead at the very end. It was devastating, and I bawled my eyes out. I finally watched K-pop Demon Hunters and it also had a similar moment and it was everything. Any recommendations for books like this? I just need to feel somthing latley. </p> </div><!-- SC",

I don&#39;t think iv actually read a book and finished it since I was in high-school (that was long ago). So I asked a friend of mine - who I know is an avid reader - for request. She told me she had just finished this series that she could NOT put down. She went off about how incredible these books where and how much I would LOVE them. I got super intrigued as she told me the premise as I love fantasy (loved GOT and grew up watching LOTR). I hopped online and immediately ordered the first book in the series - Fourth Wing by Rebecca Yarros. So I started it and... it wasn&#39;t good in my opinion. None of the plot made any sense to me and a lot of the characters were very pretty flat. Again, this is my opinion pls no one com",
