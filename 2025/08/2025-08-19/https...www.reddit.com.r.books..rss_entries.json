The book raises a possibility I can\u2019t shake: what if consciousness isn\u2019t an evolutionary advantage, but a costly side-effect? We like to think our awareness makes us special, but Watts\u2019 story suggests a universe where intelligence without self-awareness might be more efficient. That turns the usual human-centered story upside down \u2014 consciousness could be redundant, or even maladaptive. Is consciousness just an elaborate hallucination our brains create for no real purpose? Could life thrive \u2014 maybe even better \u2014 without it? If self-awareness isn\u2019t useful, why did it emerge at all? Curious if others here have read Blindsight and what you made of it. Do you think Watts is on to something, or is he just playing with a provocative thought experiment?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hour_Reveal8432\"> /u/Hour_Reveal8432 </a> <",
