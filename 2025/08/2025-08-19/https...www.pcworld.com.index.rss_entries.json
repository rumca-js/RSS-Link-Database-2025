That would give it about two percent of the company, as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-us-government-stake-22a7f987\">noted</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real question is what the United States government is pushing for, and if it will be allowed to: essentially convert the $10.9 billion previously earmarked for Intel as part of the U.S. Chips Act into equity.

But that\u2019s not a problem if you have your own high-performance charger, like this Baseus 65W 3-port option. Normally $50 for two, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FBWXH36X/\">you can now grab double for just $30</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 65W of total output, this charger is fast enough to get your phone back to 100% in no time. It\u2019s a 3-port charger, too, with two USB-C ports and a USB-A port, so you can simultaneously charge up to 3 devices. Note that when multiple ports are in use, the top USB-C maxes out at 45W while the other USB-C and USB-A max out at 15W combined. But when used solo, each USB-C maxes out at 65W while the USB-A maxes out at 60W\u2014so no worries there!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this c",

But if you\u2019re looking for a monitor with speed, a 1440p resolution, and a high-quality LCD, then you\u2019ll want to take a look at this Newegg deal: a 27-inch ASRock display with IPS panel and 180Hz of refresh <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/asrock-pg27qft1b-27-qhd-180-hz-ips-black/p/N82E16824946003\">for just $157.77</a>. That\u2019s over $50 off the retail price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ASRock makes reliable gaming displays, even if the brand tends to shoot for the budget market. This particular model (PG27QFT1B) is light on extras, with nothing but two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm headphone jack\u2014no USB in sight. But it has a few things I always look for in a display, starting with that IPS LCD panel. That\u2019s much better for color accuracy than fa",

Unfortunately, it\u2019s only for those of you in Europe, as Nvidia makes a slight cut to some of the latest RTX 50-series desktop graphics cards in the region.

The top-of-the-line RTX 5090 gets the biggest drop, from \u20ac2,329 to \u20ac2,099, just a hair under 10 percent. The RTX 5080 goes from \u20ac1,169 to \u20ac1,059, while the RTX 5070 drops from \u20ac649 to \u20ac589. The RTX 5070 Ti, 5060, and 5060 Ti are not getting any price drops at the moment. No",
