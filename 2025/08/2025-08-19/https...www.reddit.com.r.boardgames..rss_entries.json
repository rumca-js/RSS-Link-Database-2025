This one is gonna be a total strategy and tactical masterpiece, with all possibilities that appear on the field, including injury and subs too! Here the managers are their team&#39;s GOD, they manage the system and everything to the core. Even there are fan effects and &quot;FLOW CARDS&quot;. There is no die rolling or luck things in the general gameplay, but where luck matters (like shot deviation), luck is there. </p> <p>Yes, the mechanics are totally done, and the rules are copyrighted by me, Arjuna0pm6 (Rick). I just want to know from you guys that how well will the football community recieve it? As for my friends, they are loving the prototype. But what about other?</p> <p>Some cons that I know : The game is a bit slow because its tactical and stat comparison based. But a bit slow doesnt mean it is any less that real football.</p> <",

I use to play and love a modified version of HeroQuest that I would love to start up again.
