So just full disclosure I am a hobby website builder and a total amateur and have never had any formal education on any of this stuff. So please be gentle with me. There&#39;s just so much information out there on SEO and I don&#39;t know where to start or what to listen to. That said ive built a website and im wondering the best way to do the SEO to rank locally with landing pages. Ive seen different threads that conflict each other so I just want to get an up to date opinion from you pros. On one hand ive seen things that say build a landing page for &quot;car repair in (insert city)&quot; and just duplicate that times whatever cities you want. That seems spammy? I&#39;m thinking the best way to do it for different local cities is to just make them from scratch and unique and useful as possible? I want traffic from all over SoCal essentially.
