I can only find drives from Asus and Verbatim and neither of them manufactures the drives themselves to my knowledge. Are these burners perhaps all NOS?</p> <p>Does it make sense to buy one or two of the maybe last devices and store them now, or do they wear out even if they are not used? And yes, I know the alternatives, but I would like to also have important data in a cold storage.</p> <p>Thank you for your estimations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative_Trip4138\"> /u/Alternative_Trip4138 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1mueyt8/are_there_still_manufacturer_of_bluray_burners/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1mueyt8/are_there_still_manufacturer_of_bluray_burners/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The touch screen is completely broken, but the phone itself still works (I can connect mouse with OTG if needed). I don\u2019t use the phone anymore, so I want to turn it into an external hard drive.</p> <p>Basically, I want it to work like a USB HDD/pen drive \u2192 just plug it into my laptop and use the whole storage for files. The main reason is that my laptop has low space, and I usually download big FitGirl / DODI repacks (games like 80\u2013100 GB). So I want to download the repack/setup to the phone and then run the installer from there to my laptop.</p> <p>Is this even possible? Can I really convert the phone into a hard drive so that Windows just sees it as one big external disk? Or will it always stay as a normal Android phone with folders like DCIM, Downloads, etc.?</p> <p>I\u2019m a total noob at this, so please explain like I\u2019m 5 \ud83d\ude05.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Adorab",
