Somehow, My dad&#39;s late grandfather wanted to see Age of Ultron, because I was big into Marvel at the time, also he wanted to go too despite not being a huge fan of fake stuff, especially sci-fi besides for the occasional thing.</p> <p>We go to Target to get some candy. Turns out that he wasn&#39;t picking his feet up. I knew something was happening to him, then we get to the theater with our popcorn and candy and get to the auditorium which was in IMAX (back when IMAX was slowly growing). He seemed to enjoy being with us considering how he was starting to struggle by then. And sure enough a few days later, he got diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s. It was sad but at the same time, it was fun going to see a movie with Grandpa which he never went to the theaters",

It&#39;s understandable that Chinese viewers respond especially positively to a movie centered around Chinese mythology. I recently watched an early screening of the film (dubbed) and here is my personal review as an average American viewer.</p> <p>Each and every review lauding this film have every reason to do so. I have followed CGI animation closely and this film pushes boundaries just as Pixar once did back in its prime. This film is remarkably dense with countless stunning scenes that other films, if they even reach this level of visuality, only have a few of. It keeps this up for over 2 full hours, which is remarkable given the intense and diverse set of particle effects, physics showcases, etc. Visually, this film is breathtaking in every way.</p> <p>Regarding story, I struggled to maintain each p",

It&#39;s a great parody of war movies and of the cutthroat Hollywood movie system, but goddammit it&#39;s actually a GOOD WAR MOVIE, too. Nice character development, setting, cinematography AND action. 8+ on my personal war movie scale</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gdfuzze\"> /u/gdfuzze </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mu6bo8/tropic_thunder/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mu6bo8/tropic_thunder/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019m not talking about a film shaving off 5 minutes here or 10 minutes there. Instead I mean a film that has a scene that feels conclusive BUT JUST KEEPS GOING. </p> <p>The biggest example of this I can think of is Spielberg\u2019s \u201cLincoln\u201d. The scene where they talk about leaving for the theater would\u2019ve been such an ominous ending. However, we go to the theater, we see the funeral train, more speeches, etc. Quit while you\u2019re ahead. </p> <p>An unpopular opinion is that I don\u2019t really care for \u201cParasite\u201d because it has so many ending scenes - the dad running away, the son reading the letter that turns out to not be real.
