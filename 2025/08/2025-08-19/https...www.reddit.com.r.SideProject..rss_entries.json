Since I have been building projects just like many of you guys have, I have come to realize it&#39;s necessary to be a jack of all trades. With this tool I hope to help you in the journey of marketing/sales by providing leads!

And they completely removed the app and migrated users to the new Klarna app... which SUCKS! It is a lot slower, loyalty cards are not the primary scope, there is no widget and it requires internet to work. And, to make things worse, it constantly logs me out. After the 3rd time I was at the checkout and I got logged out exactly when I needed to scan my loyalty card, I decided to just build my own.</p> <p>What I wanted was something fast, easy to use, no-internet required, and to have a widget for quick access.

We also give out a good amount of free credits for testing \u2014 maybe it could even help with your own side projects.</p> <p>I know the product isn\u2019t great yet, but I\u2019d really appreciate",
