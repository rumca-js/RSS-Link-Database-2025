        "description": "You\u2019re building your game in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), and now it\u2019s time to build your user interface, but you\u2019re dreading the hundreds of lines of Verse UI code you\u2019ll have to eventually write and manage. You\u2019re wishing for something more visual; something that lets you build your UI and easily preview it. Where do you even start?\n\nThis talk demystifies the use of Unreal Motion Graphics UI Designer (UMG) to make a truly custom UI purely driven by devices, without the need for code. Attendees will walk away with an understanding of how to get started in UMG, how Viewmodels enable you to display custom UI on devices, and how to utilize different devices to showcase the UI that you want in your game.",
