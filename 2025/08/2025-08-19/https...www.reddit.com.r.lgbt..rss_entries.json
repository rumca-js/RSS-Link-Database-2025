I thought that would be the end of it until right before I got to bed, my dad knocked on my bedroom door and told me we needed to talk. I assumed I had a missing assignment or something (my dad frequently talks to me about those whenever he receives an email from my teachers), but when I opened the door, he was holding my pin. \u201cWhat is this pin?\u201d He asked. I told him it was a pin with a picture of a sunset. He wasn\u2019t convinced and said, \u201cIs this a rainbow? Do you know the bad meaning of a rainbow?\u201d I said no and that it was just a sunset.

I\u2019ve been married to my husband (44M) for 12 years, and we have a 10-year-old daughter. We\u2019ve always had a good partnership, he\u2019s a great dad, we communicate well, but our sex life has been stale the last year.</p> <p>Back in June, we started talking about ways to spice things up. We actually floated the idea of a threesome, which shocked me at first, but the more we talked, the more it made sense. We wanted something exciting and new. After some swiping, we found a bisexual woman (43F) who seemed amazing over text.</p> <p>The first night we met her, we went for drinks, and I was surprised how natural it felt. I never had the opportunity to explore my attraction to women, but I found myself super attractive to her. That was nice rhythm and banter when we were together don\u2019t quite comfortable and yap her ear off \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d</p> <p>We kissed outside the bar, and later went back to ours. Hone",

So many LGBT individuals voted for parties that are now trying to erase all the rights. This group is now divided itself on its stance on Trans people when trans people just want to exist as themselves similar to the rest of the group. But no a big portion of the community thought going against Trans individuals should be a good thing not realising that they are slowly coming for the rest of us too. We should stand together united fighting for each other rather than fighting each other. I am not trans or American I am talking about the world as a whole as a lot of us has been letting Trans individuals rights getting tking away and some even supporting it.
