Don\u2019t judge me, but I read series like Twilight (this is what started it all at age 11), Vampire Academy, The Hunger Games, The Day After Yesterday, and many more within that YA Romance genre. Life beat me for a bit and I fell out of reading, but I\u2019ve grown and healed and I\u2019m back! I\u2019m getting a library card and I\u2019m so excited to get back into reading. Here\u2019s the thing - I just turned 27 and I\u2019ve definitely grown past the books I used to like. I want the same style, but without too much of a \u201ccringy YA\u201d vibe. Can anyone give me recommendations? Literally any good ones, a matured-version of the old books I used to read would be appreciated, if those exist (Romance is the base, Sci Fi is always a good add on, but I could dabble in some non-fiction and see how I like it)!

I&#39;ve read a few NF books but I&#39;ve noticed that when a book is heavily focused on a single topic, I tend to find it dragging and exhausting past a certain point. I&#39;m interested in many topics: art, history, music, politics, anything goes but bonus points for history in humanities-related fields. The best way I can think to describe what I&#39;m looking for is broad strokes of a paintbrush rather than meticulous line-work; instead of history covering a specific event, think moreso a broad time period in which that event is also touched upon.
