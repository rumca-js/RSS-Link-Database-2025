What the hell happened??</p> <p>There\u2019s a bunch of others that pop into my head from time to time, stuff like Guillermo del Toro\u2019s Lovecraft movie, Fincher doing a Jules Verne thing, or all those weird Star Wars spinoffs that probably died the second someone changed jobs at Disney.

Everyone seems super interested in the &quot;clues&quot; that will tell us what is actually happening, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the point. The whole plot is carefully designed to lend itself to many explanations of what happened and it would require at least a little bit of guesswork to declare any certain outcome the true answer. </p> <p>This, to me, was a film that expertly highlighted how the human mind frames things. In our brains we have far more nodes/receptors for sensory processing than we do for storing that information. So, when we are given raw information, we have to somehow decide what gets kept and why it gets kept. A lot of those decisions have to do with what narratives we subscribe to and how we can position those <em>pictures</em> in our existing framework of the world. ",
