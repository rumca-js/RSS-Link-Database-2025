        "description": "If you combine a spoonful of Mary Poppins with 3 ounces of James Bond and an intensive four-year childcare curriculum, you'll get a Norland nanny. These highly trained, highly paid professional nannies have long been sought after by England's elite, providing childcare to folks like Mick Jagger and the royal family. \n\nFor 130 years, Norland College has provided a unique and rigorous program that teaches students skills like self-defense, skidpan driving, sushi making, and more. Admission used to be limited to Europeans, but in 2021, Norland opened its doors to Americans for the first time. We visited the college in Bath to see what's drawing American students to this British institution and what it takes to become a Norland nanny.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n1:28 - Roxanne Takes On Triplets\n2:30 - Self Defense\n4:43 - Skidpan\n5:09 - Cooking\n5:34 - Sewing and Sustainability\n6:16 - The Basics\n7:20 - Why Norland\n9:18 - History\n10:57 - Virtual Babies\n12:10 - Why Americans\n13:43 - Conclusion\n\n----------",
