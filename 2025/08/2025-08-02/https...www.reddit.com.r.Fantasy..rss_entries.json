One thing I\u2019ve noticed from a few books (more on the litrpg side) is the writing isn\u2019t always the best. This doesn\u2019t really bother me most of the time, but when looking for exceptionally written stories the only things I ever see recommended are classics, Tolkien, asmiov, etc. while these are great, the language, writing styles, and societal norms (would it have killed asmiov to write a female character that was half way decent?) are quite dated. I\u2019d love to find a few books that were written in like the last 10-15 years that have exceptional writing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TrueAction7217\"> /u/TrueAction7217 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mg3y6a/what_modern_fantasy_book_do_you_consider_to_have/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantas",

Usually as I am finishing a book I am left with a big void in my heart, sadness that I cannot experience more of this but when I finish TWOK I was relieved haha. This book was a slow burner but I can commit to that and I never gave up even when the first three hundred pages followed a boring story of only two characters. I feel like I am missing something and I cannot understand how everyone is so hyped for this book while I couldn\u2019t find any hook in it. Almost twelve hundred pages of answers given, characters that do only what\u2019s expected of them. No surprises, no mystery, no riddles, everything is pretty much written for you and the interactive experience that I look for in a book especially in fantasy was completely missing.</p> <p>The main reason I am bringing up this discussion is to find some hope because I got super invested",

They are very different in background and story role, but both have this mix of eccentricity, warmth, and quiet depth.
