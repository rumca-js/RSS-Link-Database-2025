        "description": "Schluter shower flood testing tips\u2026I finished waterproofing my client\u2019s shower but I have to flood test it. I use an Oatey 4\u201d Gripoer Plug in the drain and mark the wall with a Pica Dry wet jet pencil. Then I use a SharkBite washing machine angle valve to fill the shower with water. I wait 24 hours, look for leaks and inspect the water mark. After passing the flood testing I start tile work.
