The study highlights how conventional physics may not fully explain ultra-fast reactions. These groundbreaking results, published in collaboration with international labs, have far-reaching implications for high-energy environments like asteroid impacts and nuclear systems.",

This fresh approach could revive interest in previously ruled-out models and offers experimental pathways to test these elusive particles through the intensity frontier in future particle physics experiments.",
