        "description": "<p>There are two new paint sets from Monument Hobbies and Atomic Mass Games \u2013 and there\u2019s quite a bit of confusion about what these AMP paints actually are. An expansion to Pro Acryl, or are they an entirely new standalone paint line? And is the formula different from the Pro Acryl main range? So many questions \u2013 and in this review, I\u2019ve got the answers for you. I\u2019ve tested both sets thoroughly and will explain the similarities and differences with Pro Acryl, and whether these AMP sets are worth a spot in your paint collection, or not.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/08/review-amp-cosmic-paint-sets-1-and-2/\">Review: AMP Cosmic paint sets 1 and 2</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
