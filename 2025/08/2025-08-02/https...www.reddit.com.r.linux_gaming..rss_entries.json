The frame rate was much lower compared to Windows.</p> <p>I initially suspected that GNOME might be consuming too many resources, so I looked into various optimization tips. Aside from switching to &quot;Best Performance&quot; mode and closing background apps like the browser or Discord, I didn\u2019t find much improvement. I also considered Wine as the bottleneck but couldn&#39;t find a clear solution online.</p> <p>Interestingly, native Linux games like Hollow Knight run better than on Windows, so the issue seems specific to Wine or Proton.</p> <p>Does anyone have tips, configurations, or guides to",

I recently upgraded from a 3090 Ti and although I&#39;m getting a lot more performance, it has actually been a worse time.<br/> On all three distros, I get horrible stuttering and frame drops, in some games once per second. I&#39;ve tried problem solving by trying different proton releases, different launch commands, VRR on and off, RT on/off, lowering/increasing settings and even with gamescope but to no avail. Checked kernel version and I&#39;m way above the minimum for RDNA4.</p> <p>It seems to me like the 9070 XT mesa drivers still have a long way to go with gaming, is anyone else having the same experience? Sadly on Windows, I don&#39;t get any frame drops at all. System Specs below:</p> <p>CPU: 14700K<br/> RAM: 64GB Corsair LPX 5600MTs<br/> GPU: XFX Swift 9070 XT<br/",
