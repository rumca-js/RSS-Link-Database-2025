There just isn&#39;t much available that offers performance and quality. I want to build an on-body (glasses case) or near-body (tumbler) camera to use in my investigations. It can be as simple as incorporating an on-off switch and collecting video on a mini-SD card, to inclusion of vibrations, LED lights, a fan, wifi and maybe an app. I would like to at least start with the basics.
