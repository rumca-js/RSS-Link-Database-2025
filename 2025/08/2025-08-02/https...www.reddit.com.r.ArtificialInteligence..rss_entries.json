I&#39;m not the type of person who&#39;s even remotely anxious, but rather excited to see what AI is capable of doing for the world + my creative projects.</p> <p>I had this short conversation with Gemini (2.5 Pro, for those who care), literally asking how I could possibly contribute to this insane growth that&#39;s happening. My question basically asked what specific things, like maybe learning Python or even just responding to simple &quot;Do you like this response?&quot; surveys in the app, would actually help in general.</p> <p>Obviously, I wanted to see what these AIs had to say about &quot;helping&quot; in the overall sense, and here are just 3 examples it gave:</p> <p><em>1. Use AI tools regularly and give feedback</em></p> <p><em>2. ",
