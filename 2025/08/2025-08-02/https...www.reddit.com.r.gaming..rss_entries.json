If you have 101% critical strike in Warframe, you always crit, you always deal at least 2x (or more depending on weapon) damage, but you now have a 1% chance to deal 400% damage (or 300%, it&#39;s been a while, I forgot). You get your crit chance up to 200% and you are now always doing 4x damage.</p> <p>I can&#39;t think of any other game that lets you do this. I know some games let you go above 100% critical strike chance, mainly because some enemies then have a critical strike avoidance stat, but you never deal more than your normal damage.</p> <p>Also not talking about games that allow you to modify critical strike damage. If that is all you get to, that doesn&#39;t count. It has to be a &quot;double crit&quot; or &quot;red crit&quot; that happens when you get past 100% critical strike chance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",
