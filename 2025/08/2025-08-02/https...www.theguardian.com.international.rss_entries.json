It features former Australian rules footballers battling for a single $US3m NFL punting contract with the New Orleans Saints.</p><p>This year\u2019s showdown began with Matt Hayball, a former Geelong Cat and the Saints\u2019 incumbent punter, against James Burnip, a 198cm rookie from Mount Macedon in Victoria, who just wrapped a standout punting career at the University of Alabama. The Saints complicated the battle this week by signing a third punter, American Kai Kroeger.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/03/cut-throat-nfl-roster-cull-pits-australian-pair-against-each-other-with-millions-at-stake\">Continue reading...</a>",
