Substack has indies convinced that they build an audience for you through some sort of secret-sauce network effects, but I\u2019ve seen no evidence that\u2019s true. Writers with established reputations and readerships joining Substack are helping build Substack\u2019s brand, not their own.</li>\n<li>The whole, you know, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/02/substack-nazi-notification\">Nazi thing</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Less commented upon but just as bad is the branding trap. <em>Substack</em> is a damn good name.

It\u2019s as unstable as a SpaceX launch, as\n<a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/dems-taunt-stephen-miller-over-191520373.html\">overpromised</a> as a Stephen Miller marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Substack does not have a clear future as a newsletter business,\nI\u2019m not the first to notice that. But it doesn\u2019t have to fail\noutright to be a disaster. It just has to keep trying to become a\nlife-sized map of the internet: maximum content, maximum churn.\nThe center cannot hold\u2009\u2014\u2009especially not for newsletters, a format\nthat depends on intimacy and long-standing trust.</",
