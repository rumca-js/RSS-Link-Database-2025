However, a lot of the tutorials mention keyword research tools that are paid and pretty expensive for someone that is just starting / just wants to experiment. </p> <p>After some hours or researching I found 6 keyword free keyword research tools that are 100% free and don&#39;t have any search limits, which is a great starting point. However the free tools all have different features (keyword difficulty, search volume, etc). So I built an online directory of the tools I have found to easily visualize and compare what each tool offers. The goal is to create a resource of these tools for people like me that want to get started without spending too much upfront. </p> <p>So, are there any other tools you know of that I missed, so far I have these:</p> <p>- surfer (browser extension)<br/> - ahrefs keyword generator<br/> - ryan robinson keyword tool<br/> - words",
