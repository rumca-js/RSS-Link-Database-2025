I got to say, it hasn\u2019t been easy or reliable, and a lot of learning. I have an unraid server at home, but it only has 1 TB of storage and I use it for movies. Money is tight right now and I can\u2019t afford to purchase $1000 worth of new drives to expand it, so I purchased a 2GB, 2 core, raidv2 VPS to bring my data in my control. Softwares I tried so far are;</p> <p>Nextcloud AIO: Seems to bog down my server causing extremely slow upload speeds and sync errors.</p> <p>Owncloud: I installed the old version of owncloud (not OCIS) and it did the same thing as Nextcloud AIO, just never worked right. I got to the old version as I wasn\u2019t aware of the new one and it was where the documentation lead me to.</p> <p>Opencloud: Huge difference in speed, when it worked it was awesome. Way higher speed, minimal CPU usage and no sync errors. I thought I found the solution for me. But then",
