IDK though because it&#39;s only showing a max speed of 1200mbps in virtual desktop. Better than the 866 previously but not what it said it should get. Did I just buy a bad router?

The link is below, and for those who don&#39;t care to watch a video, I&#39;ll also write out my thoughts.</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/WLUHTi9ZahI\">https://youtu.be/WLUHTi9ZahI</a></p> <p>I recently went hands on with the new Quest (Both Quest 2 and 3) early access title TABLE TROOPERS! Its a worms clone, and so far a pretty good one! it cost about 10 and has a 1-2 hour single player campaign (Promises of more to come) and 3 person multiplayer. </p> <p>Table Troopers really captures the classic 2D worms feel but in glorious VR! Moving is very similar to Demeo, you pick up your character, set it down to get into position. Attacking feels close to angry bids mechanics. Most weapons feel like you are aiming with a sling shot. And that feels exactly like how you would want a worms game to be!</p> <p>It has probably 10 or so different maps to battle it out with your friends and around 20 weapons.</p>",

Imagine there was a passthrough type Starwars sandbox that scans your room and can interact with your walls and floors and ceiling with a lightsaber leaving burn marks and such. You could set &quot;spawn points&quot; aka where your doors are for enemies to come in. If there was also a way to some how make the lightsaber reflect light off your walls and stuff that would be sick. Along with a force mechanic would be and maybe multiplayer lightsaber battles with other people. IF THERE IS ANYTHING LIKE THIS lemme know pls.
