Two clock domains. One for fetching instructions and writeback (fast), another for execution (slow). Been reading through the listings and I don&#39;t yet remember exactly what I did some things for, since it&#39;s been 5 years since its creation.</p> <p>I am sure that with some collaboration we could fabricate it. As it is right now: no job, no money, not even the dev kit I had at the time. Homeless since 2023 actually. I don&#39;t know what the next step is in this adventure other than putting it up for everybody to see.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",

CM4/5), or even Mini-ITX. Ideally, I\u2019m after something that has good mainline kernel (and optionally distro) support, so mostly SiFive or StarFive designed cores seem to be the safer bet at the moment?</p> <p>I\u2019ve already tried the Milk-V CM and while it looks great on paper, it\u2019s been a total paperweight for me - I had it working once, then it died. I know other Milk-V boards, but they lack any active kernel/distro work going on, so I\u2019d rather avoid another orphaned board.</p> <p>Would really appreciate recommendations or experiences with: - Boards that follow Pi/CM/ITX form factors - Strong mainline Linux support (ideally booting without vendor kernels) - StarFive/SiFive-based chips, or any others that are upstream-friendly</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
