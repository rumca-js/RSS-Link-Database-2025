It was a blast! We lucked out with a very clear cut mission card, so we knew exactly what to do to &quot;win&quot; the first game. After about 2.5 hours of very fun gameplay, we met the criteria for our mission and decided to call the game there, even though we were given the option to continue playing with a destiny card provided when completing the mission. That was the only destiny card we saw in the game. We mostly quit just because it&#39;s time to start getting stuff ready for dinner.</p> <p>We played on the recommended difficulty setting, which I was concerned might make for a short game, but neither of us ever came close to running out of resources",

But i felt like i saw a youtube video of a gaming convention where they were showcasing a game where people threw custom discs on top of other peoples discs to flip them? Like a really old childhood game i played? But they made it with custom powers? Did i dream this? Can someone tell me the name if i didnt?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fallen_angel_of_luck\"> /u/fallen_angel_of_luck </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mfpkn8/finding_game_name/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mfpkn8/finding_game_name/\">[comments]</a></span>",
