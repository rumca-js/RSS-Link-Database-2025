Nowadays, they&#39;re too addicted to screens, and most famously, ROBLOX. Its a nightmare for parents to get their kids off of the game to do literally anything. Games like Grow a Garden, where over 20Million+ people are playing simultaneously, and shortform content like Shorts, Reels, is ruining the kids&#39; attention span.</p> <p>I&#39;m an older brother to such a kid and it&#39;s hell, he won&#39;t do anything. So my idea is that the app will have specific tasks set by parents, like &quot;Read Chapter X of Book Y&quot; , or &quot;Memorise Surah Nas&quot; (I&#39;m a Muslim btw). This way when they complete a task, they can earn points and &quot;level up&quot;. And with every level up, parents can reward them with say $5, or even more or less.</p> <p>Trying to s",

I&#39;ve been working on a project that I&#39;m really excited about - Rapid Chat. The idea is to bring together different Large Language Models (LLMs) in one place, so you can easily switch between them. I&#39;ve also integrated Groq to make it super fast.</p> <p>I&#39;d love for you to check it out and let me know what you think. Your feedback will help me make Rapid Chat even better.</p> <p>Here are the links for the site:<br/> <a href=\"https://fafb.vercel.app\">Rapid Chat</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://speedchat.vercel.app\">Rapid Cha",
