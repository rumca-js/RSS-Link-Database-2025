Now I have the sinking feeling that we are going to be regaled with the details of each murder. This does nothing for the plot of the character development. It\u2019s just gratuitous. And it happens in more and more thrillers or mysteries-the crimes are called \u201cunimaginable\u201d and then are carefully described. (although if they really were, how did the killer come up with them?)</p> <p",

So incredible in fact, that I just had to tell someone about it. To my chagrin however, I remembered that I don&#39;t have friends. So, I downloaded Goodreads to write a review, where I was immediately reminded why it&#39;s a bit embarrassing to read books in public; because pulling out a paperback at a cafe, no matter how good the book was, would inextricably associate me with a certain kind of reader, the ones you find at Goodreads. You know the type: a five page review that&#39;s mostly a showcase of how &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;quirky&quot; the reviewer is, the obscenely long and flowery reviews on classics by people who very obviously stitched up fragments of the plot from tiktok reviews and video essays, so on.</p> <p>Now, I&#39;m not the fun police.
