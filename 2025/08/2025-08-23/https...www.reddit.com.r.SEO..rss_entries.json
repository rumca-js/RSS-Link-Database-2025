        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>So I have been learning SEO for a few months now and honestly I am still confused about some basic stuff. Like when you find a good keyword, how do you actually know how many backlinks you need to rank for it? And what is the minimum DA score you need? I have heard different numbers from different people. Some say 30 is good, others say you need at least 50.</p> <p>Also if your content and the keyword do not match well enough to rank, how do you decide which keyword to focus on instead? Like based on your current DA score and other factors. I wanted to know if anyone have did this properly and can share some tips. I have been trying different approaches but nothing seems to work consistently.</p> <p>Any advice would be really helpful. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Electronic-Disk-140\"> /u/Electronic-Disk-140 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comm",
