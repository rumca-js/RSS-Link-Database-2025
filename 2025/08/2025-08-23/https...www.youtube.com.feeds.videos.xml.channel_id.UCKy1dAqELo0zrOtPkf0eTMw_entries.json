According to SteamDB, 2017's Hollow Knight hit an all-time concurrent high with 23,840 players this week. While it's not the most concurrents across all Steam games, it is a franchise peak. In other news, Donkey Kong Bananza's somewhat controversial control scheme came at the suggestion of Donkey Kong creator Shigeru Miyamoto. Bananza's game director, Kazuya Takahashi, revealed that it was Miyamoto's idea, but they left the option to swap the 'punch down' and 'jump' buttons in case players had a hard time re-wiring their muscle memory.\n\nPresented by Universal Orlando Resort and its new theme park, Universal Epic Universe.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

On the eve of professional football\u2019s annual scouting Combine, Cam is attacked by an unhinged fan and suffers a potentially career-ending brain trauma.\nJust when all seems lost, Cam receives a lifeline when his hero, Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary eight-time Championship quarterback and cultural megastar, offers to train Cam at Isaiah\u2019s isolated compound that he shares with his celebrity influence",
