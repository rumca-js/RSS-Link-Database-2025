As part of my research on nonlinear escalation and emergence behaviors, I seek insights from experienced professionals like you. This study focuses on how working professionals observe and respond to nonlinear escalation and emergence within IIoT. Your participation will help advance knowledge in this field and provide critical insights for corporate, federal, and academic communities.</p> <p>Pravine Viswakumar, a Doctor of Philosophy in Cybersecurity Leadership student at Capitol Technology University, leads this study.
