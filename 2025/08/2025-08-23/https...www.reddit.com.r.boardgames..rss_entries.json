I like a lot of Stan Kordonskiy&#39;s games and you can definitely tell that this is one of his. Like a most of his games it&#39;s doing a lot, bordering on maybe too much. But with Minos everything dovetails together very nicely way more than his other games. I really like the dice drafting mechanic in this game, it&#39;s very similar to Coimbra. It&#39;s also got multi-use cards, trade routes, progress tracks",
