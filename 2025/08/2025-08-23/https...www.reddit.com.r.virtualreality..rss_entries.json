        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Looking at the excitement over Hollow Knight Silksong recently, it struck me that VR really suffers from not having a cheap, relatively easy art style that indie games can use and still look good, just like pixel art for 2D.</p> <p>You often hear people complaining about VR games that &quot;look like they are from PS2&quot;, etc, but you never hear anyone complaining that Stardew Valley &quot;looks like SNES&quot;.</p> <p>Pixel art is the go-to style for many indie games, but there&#39;s nothing quite like it for 3D and VR. Although personally I think a lowpoly style like The Light Brigade and Dungeons of Eternity look just fine. I guess anime style like VRChat avatars also look fine to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zeddyzed\"> /u/zeddyzed </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1my5ykh/vr_suffers_from_3d_not_having_an_equivalent_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",

I also noticed that the audio seemed a fair amount quieter than it did with my old Quest 2 however I think that may just be down to my in-game audio settings. I have confirmed that it happens in H3VR and Blade &amp; Sorcery, with H3VR running in SteamVR and Blade &amp; Sorcery running in the Oculus boot option. Headphones fixed the problem but I prefer not to have extra bulk on my head while I&#39;m playing if I can avoid it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",
