As the title says, I\u2019m looking for some fantasy novel recommendations but it\u2019s a genre I\u2019ve really only dipped my toes into occasionally. I can be a bit picky so it\u2019s daunting to try and figure out what fantasy books might offer the kind of read I\u2019m looking for.</p> <p>When it comes to reading, I\u2019m typically more drawn to literary fiction. I like compelling characters and well written prose, and I really don\u2019t enjoy getting too bogged down in lore. Of course, lore is an inherently important element of fantasy, but when I pick up a book and am faced with pages of history or rules for the magic system of the world it just loses me. I do enjoy political intrigue and reading about the ways the systems (political, magical, etc) of the world affects the characters and how they interact with the world and lore though. </p> <p>Would love any recommendations if any come to mind after reading this post, thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",

I liked game of thrones and i liked wheel of time up until sanderson took over then i dropped it. But to be honest i started falling off closer to the 7th book. I also like terry prachett</p> <p>Then there is the fantasy that i really really dont like and have tried multiple times because of peoples reccomendations. Which would be brandon sanderson books jim butcher books terry good kind etc. i just find them hard to get into and not to offend but to me a little generic.

I would literally read in all my spare time, while eating food, right when I woke up, right before bed, etc. My favourites were always fantasy, though because I was younger they were usually young adult fiction.</p> <p>A few years ago I stopped reading due to a myriad of reasons, and recently decided I want to get back into reading. I&#39;m a bit older now than I was when I stopped reading, and as such have no idea where to begin finding books that suit my maturity, which is why I came to ask for help.</p> <p>To help this, my favourite book series&#39; when I was a pre-teen and early teen were the following, and I hope these help indicate what sort of books I am looking for: The Spook&#39;s Apprentice Series (Joseph Delaney), Summoner Series (Taran Matharu), Percy Jackson and the Olympians (Rick Riordan), The Shadowhunt",

I don&#39;t know what it is, but I never really clicked with them. They feel a bit more edgy to me than anything else.</p> <p>For other authors I adore, I&#39;d say: Ursula K.
