They were incredibly sweet with their follow-up and said they&#39;d consider my request. Lo and behold, a few months later, and the product was available on their website as two pins and a sew-on patch.</p> <p>Two days ago, someone even left a positive review for the product. Knowing that there are others out there like me who now have access to this representation has been incredible.</p> <p>Ever since then I&#39;ve been so grateful that they did this small gesture for a customer. I don&#39;t know if anyone who works there will see this, but thank you. I wish the team could see this message and know how happy I was to see myself represented on a national page.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheThrowaway4Uni\"> /u/TheThrowaway4Uni </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https:/",

Where I\u2019m from it\u2019s usually men that are masculine and women feminine. So I get attracted to masc guys, boom straight. But I\u2019m not attracted to feminine guys. And honestly I am attracted to masculine girls and enbys. So what I\u2019ve found out is: I like masc. masc guys, masc girls, masc enbys. What would that make me? I know labels are confusing, but not having a label is also confusing. I accept micro labels as well. I don\u2019t want you guys to label me, rather suggest labels similar to what I\u2019m feeling so that I can look them up and think if they suit me or not? And if not I\u2019m gonna go unlabeled.
