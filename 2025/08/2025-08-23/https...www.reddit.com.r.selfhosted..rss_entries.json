I installed Calibre Web Automated, up and running, lovely stuff... added some books... personally I&#39;m finding the reading experience provided by it as quite poor. Found myself looking for a third party client or something, my ideal is something like Google Play Books or Kindle app vibe and features. I read lots of folk use Calibre Web to send a book to their kindle email address but this seems a little disconnected and counter intuitive to me. Big question is .. what am I missing? Am I alone in my feelings about the reading experience, or missing something everyone else does? If you&#39;ve got experience of other options, should I consider something else?

I figured out the biggest pain in the a## for photographers is to share photos with guests after event shoot (like weddings) So I come up with a solution in which the photographers will upload all the photos they clicked. They (photographer) will get 2 links - 1 with full access to all photos, 2nd with face recognition (guests will have to upload their selfies and the system will sort and display only their photos out of the full album). This way all guests can receive their photos conveniently and the privacy is also maintained (guests can see only their photos and nothing else) I just completed the backend system, created the album with my wedding photos and published the link on my instagram. The guests are getting their photos and all is working perfectly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",
