        "description": "Twinmotion is rapidly becoming a go-to tool for easy 3D visualization in nearly every industry. This talk pays homage to Twinmotion\u2019s roots in archviz by showing how it can fit into and enhance every aspect of the AECO lineup, from designing buildings and visualizing engineering data to selling residences. The session also highlights several case studies and hypothetical examples to illustrate Twinmotion's efficacy in these areas. \n\nBoth new and older features are covered in this session, in context as they relate to Twinmotion's usability in multiple phases in the AECO life cycle. Specific features covered include point cloud import, presentations with Twinmotion Cloud, configurations, phasing, animation import, and the Twinmotion-to-Unreal Engine workflow.",
