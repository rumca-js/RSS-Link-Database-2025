Each turn you\u2019ll draft action cards, collect artifacts, and trigger reckonings. Big clashes that drain resources but let winners rewrite the victory conditions. Build monuments, reclaim relics, and twist the rules in your favor as the ages unfold.\n\nIt\u2019s part area control, part engine building, and part \u201cmake the rules up as you go.\u201d Across three ages, every choice nudges how the afterlife will be scored, so your path to victory is never the same twice. At the end of the third age, one faction claims dominance, and everyone else fades into ghostly obscurity.\n\n#boardgames #games #gamenight #gaming #tabletop #tabletopgames #shorts",
