My area is an internet dead zone where you might get a bit of 4G on a nearby hill, but that\u2019s about it. No cellular for phone calls, and the best I can hope from a landline connection is 3 Mbps. As a modern man with a modern family full of modern devices, I need fast internet\u2014so I readied Starlink even before my kids\u2019 beds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked pretty well, too. At first I heard a bunch of buzzing noises that I was <em>not</em> expecting, but that sort of coil whine is apparently pretty typical. A few minutes later, I was online!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Having Starlink isn\u2019t like having fiber internet, and I ran into several surprises along the way. Here are all the things I wish I\u2019d known before getting Starlink at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class",

I\u2019ve clicked through so many warnings about how my PC will be \u201cat risk\u201d unless I pay up for extended protection, and those McAfee alerts are in a stark red color that\u2019s surely designed to scare me. It\u2019s too much!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not just a problem on <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/699203/best-laptops-under-500.html\">budget laptops</a>, either. I even see it on high-end PCs, like the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2871296/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-rollable-review.html\">world\u2019s first rollable laptop from Lenovo</a> that I recently reviewed. That\u2019s a $3,299 machine! Yet despite its lofty price tag and sci-fi-esque hardware, it still subjected me to scary messages encouraging me to pay for McAfee antivirus. What a bad experience.</p>",
