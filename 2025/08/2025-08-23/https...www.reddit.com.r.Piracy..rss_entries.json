Let&#39;s just say I would download something directly from a website, then my ISP could see that I visited that website and what I downloaded there so they would technically be able to fine me for piracy if they cared, no? Is there any other reason I am missing on why DDL is safer or are we really relying on the fact that ISP&#39;s don&#39;t and won&#39;t care?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Smofkey\"> /u/Smofkey </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1my2sow/a_question_regarding_ddl_safety/\">[link]</a></span> &#",
