I dont mind it so much, but it is a little tiring, in my opinion...sometimes I wish they could just release everything with the game.</p> <p>Like the latest Assassin&#39;s Creed game. I&#39;ve already got two playthroughs, one isn&#39;t quite done yet; and NOW they&#39;ve released NG+?</p> <p>I can understand it&#39;s to maintain gamer interest and all; but by the time something is getting added, I&#39;m already onto other games, or in the process of one. So going back can be annoying, even for my favorite games.</p> <p>Just thought I&#39;d do a mild rant for a bit, see who else has similar thoughts.

Mid-life crises have set in and we haven&#39;t been keeping up as well as we used to and we&#39;d like to find a game that we can play together while we&#39;re on voice. If the game takes up 100% of our time and attention, it&#39;s not going to work. For example, Portal 2&#39;s multiplayer is probably the best co-op experience in gaming history..... but it&#39;s a lot of careful planning and kibitzing to solve the problems at each stage. We&#39;d be entirely in the game headspace with no time to be chatting about how much our kids drive us insane.</p> <p>We used to play a game that I&#39;d guess fewer than one in a thousand people here have even heard of: Netrek. We played Baldur&#39;s Gate Dark Alliance 1&amp;2 when they released on Switch, but both games have mechanics that make them a little too much of a slog.

I don&#39;t know exactly what it is, other than just the vibe is really enjoyable to me. It&#39;s normally late night, usually just a couple of people (radio host and producer) alone in a building but also connected with the community around them. Often, it&#39;ll be horror or have a horror vibe to it, and maybe that&#39;s part of it: It&#39;s kind of cozy horror, where bad things will be going on in the outside world, but the people in the radio station are participating but also apart from it.</p> <p>So I was wondering: Are there any games set in a radio station, or that at least have that as a big part of the story? The main one I&#39;ve seen is Killer Frequency. You play a late-night DJ in a small town taking calls trying to help the residents survive a serial killer and figure out who it is (and it&#39;s really excellent in VR, by the way; great vibes).
