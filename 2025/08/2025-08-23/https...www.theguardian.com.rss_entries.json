That\u2019s what makes Cena\u2019s spandex-clad Chris Smith AKA Peacemaker so inherently funny: he looks the part but is a demonstrably terrible superhero. Being a hard-charging, self-sabotaging meathead with a propensity for violence and a hair-trigger temper will never make you as beloved as Superman. But it can be highly entertaining to watch.</p><p>To give Peacemaker his due, he is a survivor.

Abdul Fatawu\u2019s sensational strike was the sole goal in a victory that ended a streak of nine winless away games.</p><p>The style of play Cifuentes has tried to implement is clear, with the visitors favouring the triangle of Hamza Choudhury, Boubakary Soumar\u00e9 and Fatawu to get the ball up the pitch. But Charlton were aggressive from the first whistle despite the lack of possession and Conor Coventry specifically covered a lot of ground in midfield to block the passing lanes of Leicester\u2019s right-sided trio. As a result of the press, it was the hosts with the early chances, with Tyreece Campbell and Greg Docherty having back-to-back shots blocked in the fourth minute before Miles Leaburn\u2019s ",
