        "description": "Black Myth: Wukong works well on the Xbox, and is well worth the effort that Game Science has put into bringing it to the console. It's a game that has continued to remain relevant in the year since its release, and is probably going to be back in the news as soon as its rumored DLC becomes available to its players. \n\nIt's worth every penny you pay for it, and it is definitely an experience that could remain among your favorites for a long time to come.",

        "description": "I think this game would definitely have gone down better if, rather than being a whole standalone product that has to be assessed by itself, it had been a part of a larger collection of mini games. It has a surprising amount of depth, and the core mechanics are fun to engage with. \n\nBut the absolute lack of content, combined with the lacking audiovisual presentational aspects, and the occasional control issues, all create a lot of problems to consider. At a budget $20 price, Drag X Drive is not breaking the bank, and may be cheap enough for several to pick it up as an impulse buy, to have a game that shows off what the mouse controls should be like \u2013 but even at that price, it has enough issues that unfortunately hold it back from being something, if not special, then more.",

It's been a long wait for a \"new\" Metal Gear Solid title, but given how faithful Konami has made this, several tips and strategies from the original still apply. That doesn't mean there aren't several remake exclusive things to consider, though.\n\nHere are 15 tips and tricks to keep in mind when playing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, whether you're a new player who's entering the jungle for the first time or a grizzled veteran.",
