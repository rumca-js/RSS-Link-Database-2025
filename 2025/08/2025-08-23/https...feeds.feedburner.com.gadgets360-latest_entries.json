The moon, called S/2025 U1, is just 6 miles (10 kilometers) wide, too small for Voyager 2 to detect during its 1986 flyby. This discovery brings Uranus\u2019s total known moons to 29, with S/2025 U1 orbiting 35,000 miles from the planet\u2019s center. Scientists say its presence hints that Uranus\u2019s crowded system of moons and rings may still hold more hidden surprises awaiting discovery with Webb\u2019s powerful instruments.",
