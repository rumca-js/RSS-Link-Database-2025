I'm going to be talking about some of the things that I learned about Lords of the Fallen 2 at Gamecom this year. You may not have seen the announcement, but Lords of the Fallen 2 is indeed coming next year, and I have something kind of special here. I actually have an interview with David Valjalo, who is the creative portfolio strategist at C.I. Games. He's involved with C.I. Games in terms of deciding what games they're going to create, how they're going to create them, what mechanics are involved in them, and how to market them. He is involved with high-level decision-making across the board in terms of development and marketing.\n\nThe Lords of the Fallen Wiki: https://thelordsofthefallen.wiki.fextralife.com/\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Lords of the Fallen 2 Gamescom Interview\n0:59 Question 1\n2:10 Question 2\n2:52 Question 3\n3:57 Question 4\n4:39 Question 5\n5:21 Qu",
