It&#39;s an old gaming PC motherboard Z77 extreme 4 (2012). I am replacing a 14 TB drive in unraid, but I can&#39;t even get to bios with this thing plugged in.</p> <p>Things I have tried... Updating to latest bios (2012 bios to 2018 bios) Testing the drive in its enclosure on my laptop (worked fine). Unplugged all the other hdds in case power draw was too high. Tried different ports, including on my raid card/motherboard.</p> <p>Any ideas? I would greatly appreciate it. I&#39;m hoping that my system isn&#39;t too old for this hard drive. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a thing, but I am running out of ideas.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RegularDinner13\"> /u/RegularDinner13 </a> <b",
