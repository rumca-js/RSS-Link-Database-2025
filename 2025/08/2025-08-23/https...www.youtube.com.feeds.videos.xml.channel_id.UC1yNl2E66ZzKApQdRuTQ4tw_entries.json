This indicates that our current standard cosmological model does not fit reality. Recently, a team of researchers came up with a theory which they claim does fit the new observations \u2013 they say that dark energy is caused by black holes. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/yb2k-kn7h\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/",
