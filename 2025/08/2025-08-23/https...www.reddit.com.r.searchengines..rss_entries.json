I know there are extensions to bypass them but I\u2019m using Brave on iOS so I can\u2019t use them. </p> <p>I\u2019m looking for a new search engine that gives the same results as Google without captchas. Privacy is good but not that important to me tbh. Do you have any suggestions? I know a lot of search engines but usually I prefer google results, so the closest results the better. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GarbageUnique4242\"> /u/GarbageUnique4242 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1my0y7x/search_engine_with_google_results/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1my0y7x/search_engine_with_google_results/\">[comments]</a></span>",
