I love the vertical tabs, and I can\u2019t go back to Chrome anymore, so I want another browser with the same style. Currently, I\u2019m using Mozilla Firefox because it has vertical tabs. But features like choosing which tab to switch to when I press Ctrl + Tab, or moving between tabs with the arrow keys, are things I really liked in Arc but Firefox doesn\u2019t have.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen some projects like Zen Browser, but I don\u2019t want to give it a try since the team abandoned it too, just like Arc. Edge seems to have a similar style to Arc, and when I asked ChatGPT, it told me it\u2019s more effective than Firefox, so I\u2019m thinking of giving it a try.</p> <p>What browser do you use? Do you have any opinions?

It doesn&#39;t have that occasional jitter here and there like most chromium. Also adblock is good if you enable advanced blocking from settings. I use edge (special kiwi edition) on my phone and do sensitive work on chrome. But privacy concerns aside opera might actually be better choice for casual reading (bonus text reflow) or watching movies.

I LOVE the workspaces in that browser and I was trying out edge but the workspaces in edge piss me off. First, when I open a new window it doesnt open in an existing workspace, and every time I open a new workspace, instead of swapping it opens a whole new edge window. I dont like the chrome tab grouping, I like a sidebar where I can click a button for a workspace and only see those tabs</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chaneriel\"> /u/Chaneriel </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1mxp96m/what_broswer_to_use/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1mxp96m/what_broswer_to_use/\">[comments]</a></span>",
