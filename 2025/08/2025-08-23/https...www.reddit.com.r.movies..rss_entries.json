I&#39;ve been lurking here for a long time and I rarely post but I reached a milestone recently and thought it might be nice to celebrate with you by jumping on. </p> <p>I have been keeping a list of movies that I&#39;ve watched for nearly 25 years (since I was ~13). It started in a notebook and eventually I moved the list to a spreadsheet. I log the name of the movie, the name of the director(s), the year it was released, my own rating (out of 5), whether or not I own a physical copy, and what my thoughts were after watching it. Today that list is over 3,400, entries strong!</p> <p>In honour of the last WTF movie I watched, I wanted to share a list of my most recent and memorable WTFs that I&#39;ve either seen more than once or would watch again, for anyone else who likes this as a &quot;genre&quot;. If you enjoyed at least one movie from this list, then I&#39;m fairly confident you&#39;ll also enjoy any of the others which you haven&#39;t",
