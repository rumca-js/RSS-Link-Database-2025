But throughout it all, from his eye-popping rotoscoped origins to his leap into the third dimension, and then, over the last few years, back into the side-on world again, there's one thing that's consistently defined the series' core: movement. Sure, old Prince was positively plodding compared to his later incarnations, but a sense of unparalleled <em>fluidity</em> has stayed true. I say all this, because The Rogue Prince of Persia, which has just had its 1.0 release on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, PlayStation Plus, and Game Pass after a year in Steam early access, still manages to feel like part of the series' nearly four-decade legacy, despite yet another reimagining of its form.\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://",
