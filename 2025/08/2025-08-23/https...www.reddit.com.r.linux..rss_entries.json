My backup server and media volumes which span disks are still LVM/EXT4. The servers however have their root volumes as BTRFS now. I upgraded the root volumes with a fresh install of Debian Trixie when it was released. I think they went back to Debian 10 and I also wanted to increase the EFI volume size on each for use with systemd-boot so it became an upgrade opportunity. So once the server root volumes were upgraded I decided to do the same thing with my workstation.</p> <p>My workstation root volume was LVM/EXT4 with a half dozen different Linux distributions with their own root partitions and a separate data volume which they all link to. I basically recreated that with a subvolume for each root partition labeled &quot;@Debian&quot; or &quot;@Mint&quot; or whatever the distribution was. The Data volume was &quot;@Data&quot;.

Mint and Popos had the same issues, so I tried the Nvidia version of Popos which worked great, but only for the test and install. Every attempt to boot after that got stuck in a boot loop saying \u201cProbe with driver nvidia failed with error -1\u201d</p> <p>I tried the previous version of Ubuntu, which installed but then didn\u2019t have audio. Rebooting doesn\u2019t work unless I hold option and select efi which isn\u2019t a huge deal, but that only worked once. Now it won\u2019t even boot again.</p> <p>Anyways, if anyone has a recommendation please let me know! I want to give life to an old computer, but this has been such a rough experience I might just buy a new one if I can\u2019t figure it out</p> <p>Thanks for any help or advice! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit",
