My mom however, thought the green bubbles are the end of the world. 8 months later,me and my mom finally agreed on terms. I would let her see my location on Life360 (I hate this app so much), I&#39;d set up BlueBubbles to talk to her in blue bubbles, and I could get an Android phone.</p> <p>I get the Samsung S25 Ultra and immediately debloat it within two weeks after finding out about Shizuku, Canta and PCAPdroid.</p> <p>I chat with friends and family on my phone often. Recently my mom decided to add more terms to our agreement, to which she didn&#39;t notify me (similar to Mojang not telling us about ToS updates, asking for our agreement, yet applying them anyway).
