On Linux and macOS, you get shells like Bash, Zsh, or Fish, often paired with powerful tools, package managers, and extensibility. On Windows, CMD is still stuck with a very limited command set, and while PowerShell exists, many developers (myself included) find it verbose and unintuitive for day-to-day coding tasks.</p> <p>So I asked myself: what if CMD could behave more like a developer assistant rather than a dumb shell?</p> <p>Here are the main technical directions I explored:</p> <ol> <li>Multi-language execution Instead of typing python script.py or node file.js, the tool auto-detects interpreters and runs files in Python, JS, C++, Java, PHP, etc.</li> </ol> <p>Question: Would you consider this approach safe?
