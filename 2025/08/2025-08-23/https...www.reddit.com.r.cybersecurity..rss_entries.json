While I don&#39;t have any formal education in Cybersecurity I&#39;ve done quite a few certifications so far: Google Cybersecurity Certificate, ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity, CompTIA Network+, Security+, CySA+, and AZ-900. I&#39;m also following the certification path of WGU&#39;s masters program for Cybersecurity and Information Assurance to eventually enroll in the program. I also regularly do labs on tryhackme focusing on Blue team labs.</p> <p>With all of these in pocket or under way, I am wondering if the BTL1 is worth it for me? My hope for it is to get the practical knowledge as i feel the Comptia certs are rather theoretical. I don&#39;t care for the certification itself much. Is it wiser to go for Splunk cert instead? Or should I ignore both and continue my cert path for WGU (Next would be Pentest+, SecurityX, and finally CISM)</p> <p>Could really use some guidance. I&#39;",
