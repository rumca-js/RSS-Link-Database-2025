I tend to usually like kind of tense, sad books full of yearning and longing. But it&#39;s been sad and anxious year and I find that my usual taste in books is not hitting like it usually does. The most important things to me in a book is good writing and well developed characters - I am not picky about genre much at all. I read a lot of literary fiction, fantasy, sometimes horror, modern retellings, classics, sometimes romance, some nonfiction and history. Not big on true crime or thrillers, intense horror, or romance/romantasy. Just looking for something interesting and captivating and perhaps lighter than my usual picks. </p> <p>Here are some I&#39;ve enjoyed recently </p> <p>Fiction: The Deep by Rivers Solomon The Hounding by Xenobe Purvis The Starving Saints by Caitlin Starling Vicious by V.E.

I very much enjoyed the first part of Molloy as well, although that&#39;s still fairly realistic compared to the rest. I&#39;m looking for books with a similar approach, where the bleakness is palpable but it all remains somewhat impenetrable and abstract. Some wit and gallows humour would be appreciated as well. I also gave Bernhard a go and while I didn\u2019t dislike him, his books (at least the two I&#39;ve read) are way more grounded in &quot;normal&quot; life, as opposed to the barely coherent rambling of a man crawling through mud, and I somehow prefer the latter.

I want to learn how to gain a greater appreciation for the things I already have. I\u2019m not very into self-help books necessarily but I\u2019m open to trying them. I imagine there might be some Buddhist books or writings that cover these kinds of things, or other philosophical books?</p> <p>Open to fiction too (non-fiction flair ",

The thing that was unique about her was that she deliberately doesn&#39;t copyright her works so that people can freely adapt them. (Or maybe she copyrights them, but just has some provision that allows people free use, I don&#39;t remember). Can anyone tell me her name?</p> <p>The only other additional info I can provide is about the content of one short story. Sorry I don&#39;t remember more... it was a love story. The two met at a school or university. They spend a lot of time in the library. She takes him home to meet her creepy family who live in a weathered house by a pond or lake. That&#39;s all I remember LOL.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Title pretty much says it. Im a huge comic book need, and Sandman and its affiliated comics are my favorite comics. I ended up reading through much of his work. I dont wish to promote his work, but for reference as to what I liked: American God&#39;s, Good Omens, and Norse Mythology are my favorites, with Neverwhere, and Fragile Things being up there.</p> <p>Growing up I read the Harry Potter books as well and loved those. I tried to get into LOTR, and my ADHD doesnt allow me to read several pages of text describing the setting. I zone out and forget what I read by the time stuff starts happening.</p> <p>The only author ive really loved that isnt a horrible person is Brain Jacques. I read every single book as a child all the way up to Rackety Tam.</p> <p>So yeah, I love whimsical, larger than life stories. I like to see a good heros journey. But i&#39;m mostly into solid world building.</p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted ",
