Despite legal challenges, Meta views public data as essential for AI training. U.S. users have limited protections, with no opt-out feature available, but can set profiles to private to reduce exposure. In contrast, EU and UK residents can formally object to the use of their data through a process outlined in Meta&#39;s privacy settings, thanks to stricter data privacy laws. The US should do a better job protecting tech platforms users, but hey, that\u2019s for another edition. For now, every tech platform out there is using your data to improve their models and to monetize their services. Today we will show you how to opt out of some of them.</p> <h1>To Opt Out of ChatGPT\u2019s AI Training:</h1> <ul> <li>Click on your profile on the top right hand corner (U",

These models come in two variants: gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b. The smaller model can be run locally on consumer GPUs, while running gpt-oss-120b requires 80GB of VRAM and a more robust computing setup, which many users may not have.</p> <p>To help, I have compiled a list of free and easy ways to access the larger model. You can run the model locally using Ollama, Transformers, or the vLLM framework. There are also free chat applications where you can test the model, as well as numerous fast and free large language model (LLM) inference providers that you can try.

It is the engine that drives it. Human intelligence is deeply rooted in the ability to generate novelty, reframe context, and seek patterns that do not already exist. Any attempt to build true autonomy in machines must recognize creativity as the foundation, not the result, of intelligence.</p> <h1>2. Biological Basis</h1> <p>Many organisms demonstrate intelligence through problem-solving and adaptation. Some, like dolphins, also display creativity in mimicry, play, and innovation. However, human creativity operates on a different scale. This difference may be linked to both cognitive flexibility and physical affordances, such as opposable thumbs, which allow abstract ideas to be realized in the physical world.</p> <h1>3. Creativity as an Emergent Force</h1> <p>Creativity emerges from the interplay of three conditions:</p",

The difference from this model from gpt 4 besides the pricing difference is not nearly as groundbreaking as gpt 3 to 4.
