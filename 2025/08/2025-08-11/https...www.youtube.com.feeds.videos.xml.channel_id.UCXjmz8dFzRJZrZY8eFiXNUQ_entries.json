        "description": "When it comes to heist films, few do it better than Ocean\u2019s Eleven. With a star-studded cast led by George Clooney and Brad Pitt, razor-sharp direction from Steven Soderbergh, and a pitch-perfect tone, Ocean\u2019s Eleven didn\u2019t just succeed\u2014it redefined the modern heist genre.\n\nBut what makes this 2001 remake of the original Frank Sinatra Rat Pack film so enduring? Why does it still hold up over two decades later\u2014even after a wave of sequels and a soft reboot?\n\n#oceanseleven #georgeclooney #bradpitt #nerdstalgic",
