One of the primary goals as the octopus is to eat every sea creature. To do that you need to learn and then place the given brick on the board and switch one out. If you then play the action card and you are adjacent to it you can eat it. ANd here is my question:</p> <p>The rulebook clearly states that if you eat a sea creature you remove the piece and swap it out for a shell. My question reagrding this line is what happens if you don\u00b4t have any shells to swap with. Imagine this:</p> <p>You learn a new hunger card and swap the reagrding stone with the one trap piece on the board, now you only have one trap stone in your pocket.

The game gives you up to 6 checkpoints and tons of different boards to combine, though I find that any more than 2-3 checkpoints or two boards makes the game take way too long. I find each turn to be very sluggish since you have to plan out 5 actions for your hand of 9 cards (which could potentially be junk), and then once you send your robot off, other players can interact with your robot, potentially pushing it, stopping it in its tracks, and causing it to take damage or fall off the board (resetting progress and taking more damage). Then when you inevitably take damage, it can add even more chaos and randomness you have to plan around and usually you end up having to scrap plans or settle with making no progress this turn. Then when you want to &quot;reset&quot; your damage and cards in hand, you have to wa",

Me and one of my friends were looking to play some board games at the hotel bar. But we didn&#39;t get the opportunity to even start playing, the waitress said that any game isn&#39;t allowed. That playing is against the law. I asked why, the waitress called the manager and he kindly invited me to avoid playing any games because it is against Egyptian law. I asked why because I felt that was quite a silly excuse just to avoid us from being loud. He answered that it is to avoid gambling. But even when I ensured the guy that we weren&#39;t planning to gamble anything they still forced us to not play. The only place allowed is the casino (where for sure you are not going to play a boardgame) or in a room.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t argue and ofc we didn&#39;t play.
