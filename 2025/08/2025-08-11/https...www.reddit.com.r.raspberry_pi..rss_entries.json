Then out of the blue it works but gives all zero readings for power etc. I also have tried the command to confirm the address of the device &quot;sudo i2cdetect -y 1&quot; and I get all zeros but then occasionally I get random hex values which shift each time I run the command again. Does anyone have any experience with this device and has anyone got it to work? I have re-seated the hat a few times as it seems the pogo pins can be finicky.
