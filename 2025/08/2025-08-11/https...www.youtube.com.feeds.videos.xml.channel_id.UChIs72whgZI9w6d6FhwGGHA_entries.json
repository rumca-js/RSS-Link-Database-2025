        "description": "SUPPORT OUR BLACK MARKET GPU MOVIE: https://store.gamersnexus.net/black-market-gpu-backers (launches August 15 to YouTube)\nIn this video, we're recapping Intel's last year of downward spiral as it has failed to launch competitive CPU products, has delayed, slowed, and canceled fab construction projects, has swapped CEOs, and has laid off tens of thousands of employees around the world.
