Sound familiar? Developer Arrowhead thinks so. Calling the new Fortnite mode, \"Helldivers at home,\" Arrowhead also tossed some praise toward the ever-popular battle royale, recognizing it as the 'king of video game drip.' In other news, McDonald's in Japan recently ran a promotional offer for free limited edition Pok\u00e9mon cards with the purchase of select McDonald's meals. The offer quickly got out of hand as countless food items went uneaten as fans and scalpers bought meals just to get the cards, and discarded the food itself. After running out of cards in about a day, McDonald's Japan cut the promo short and apologized to those who never even had a chance to get one of the cards. And learn all about Borderlands 4's newest vault hunter: Vex the Siren.\n\nPresented by Borderlands 4.",
