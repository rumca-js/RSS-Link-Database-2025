I am currently working on figuring out the best way to structure a self-hosted library of TTRPGs and was hoping people might have some advice. My core use case is to either access this with a PC during game time/prep, or via a mobile device/tablet for casual reading.</p> <p>The struggle I&#39;m running into is that these titles often fit into various categories, often different per system, per version.</p> <p>As a result, its rarely useful to want to sort by just author or a singular game (a la Comic/Manga patterns). Instead, I frequently might want to subset down to, &quot;all adventures for D&amp;D v3.5&quot; or &quot;Lore books for Pathfinder 2e.&quot; There is also supplemental content like supplied PDF-based maps or pre-made character sheets.</p> <p>Does anyone have a solution they&#39;ve found that works well for this?

I copied my comic files to the NAS and I found instructions for a new install of Komga using Docker, which I was about to do.</p> <p>Before I do that, would it be possible to copy the Windows files (not just the comics library, but the configs, sqlite database files, etc) directly to the NAS so that I wouldn&#39;t have to re-create all my current Komga setup? I have my doubts but I figured I would ask just in case.</p> <p>I am not very familiar with Docker.

While researching, I\u2019ve seen conflicting advice: some say it\u2019s not possible, others say it works if you use a \u201cstream\u201d (which I\u2019m unfamiliar with in NPM), and others suggest a reverse proxy isn\u2019t the right tool and I should instead use an SRV record.</p> <p>I\u2019m also curious about alternatives to NPM, as I\u2019ve found parts of it frustrating to set up.
