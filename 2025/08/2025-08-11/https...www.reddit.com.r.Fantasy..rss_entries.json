One problem I face as someone from India is that just like most of the world, the English books we get are almost always the same as the UK version. And for some reason, the cover art on UK editions of books are almost always so plain and boring compared to US editions. The biggest example I can think of is all of Brandon Sanderson&#39;s books. All his Tor covers look absolutely fantastic, especially Stormlight. But all of his UK covers are black and white with different series having a different third colour (red for SA, blue for Mistborn, orange for Elantris etc.) which are so boring, plain and fail to do justice to the amazing story within them. The only UK Sanderson cover I really like is Oathbringer which goes hard for no reason but that&#39;s an ex",

Honestly I feel the book actually spent more focus on her flittering around (somehow on her lotus feet? Which were horrifically painful to walk on but I think there&#39;s a part of her walking in high heels) with her two boytoys and killing other women for the disgusting crime of wanting to protect their children.
