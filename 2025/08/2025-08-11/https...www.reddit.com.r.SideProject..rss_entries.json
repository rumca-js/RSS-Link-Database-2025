So, I decided to make a quick side project: This or That.</p> <p>It\u2019s simple: \u2022 Register &amp; login (no email required) \u2022 Vote on polls \u2022 Change your vote once per poll, so your decisions matter \u2022 See live results instantly</p> <p>I\u2019m hoping to fill it with fun, odd, and maybe slightly heated topics. Would love if you tried it out and maybe posted your own questions.</p> <p>What\u2019s your favorite \u201cthis or that\u201d debate? I\u2019ll add some of the best ones to the site.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Familiar_Crew9396\"> /u/Familiar_Crew9396 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mnkqpp/marvel_or_dc_try_this_or_that_link_is_in_comment/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mnkqpp/marvel_or_dc_try_this",

Any copy/templates you like?</li> <li>Have you actually get Stripe disputes in similar cases?</li> <li>Any gotchas with proration/partial refunds when auto-pausing or cancelling?</li> </ul> <p>What\u2019s worked for you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IssueOverall7738\"> /u/IssueOverall7738 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mn",
