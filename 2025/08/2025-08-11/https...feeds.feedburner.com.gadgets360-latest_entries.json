Announced on August 7, 2025, the mission will carry a plant-growth module, a meteorological station, and a radiation detector to collect crucial data during the six-month journey and on the Martian surface. These experiments will study plant growth in space, monitor Mars\u2019 weather, and measure cosmic radiation\u2014information vital for future human exploration. The launch is targeted for the November\u2013December 2026 Mars window, pending Starship\u2019s readiness. This partnership signals a new era of commercial interplanetary missions, enabling nations to buy payload flights without building their own spacecraft.",

Recorded about 70 minutes after the quake, the wave measured 1.5 feet in open water but could grow to 30 feet at shore. SWOT\u2019s advanced radar mapped the wave\u2019s height, profile, and direction\u2014providing data never before captured in such detail. NOAA\u2019s Center for Tsunami Research found that integrating SWOT data could greatly improve forecast accuracy, a major step forward in disaster preparedness. Experts see this as a breakthrough in early tsunami detection.",
