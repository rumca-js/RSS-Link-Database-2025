        "description": "The Helldivers 2 player base is about to be much larger on August 26th when the Xbox port releases. While no exclusive content is coming with the Xbox port, Helldivers II is receiving a new update across all platforms. \n\nBeing over a year out from its initial release, Helldivers II has been patched and updated many times, granting Xbox users a fantastic base to start from. \n\nFor those unaware of the IP, Helldivers II is a third-person co-op shooter with a campy tone and some user-friendly live service elements. For one, there are no limited time items or weapons, and everything can be earned in-game without paying real money. \n\nWe\u2019re looking forward to where the game will go in the future and what the next August 26th Update will consist of, but here are 15 things to know before purchasing the Xbox port of the game.",

        "description": "Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is a special game, perhaps the best entry in the long running Metal Gear Saga. In this video, we go in-depth into the themes of Snake Eater, and how the character named Jack, codenamed Snake, rises to the status of a legend. \n\nChronologically speaking, Snake Eater is the first game in the story. Hence, we'll also be taking a look at the stories of Zero, The Boss, Volgin, and several other details, making this video one of the most comprehensive story recaps of MGS3 out there.",

        "description": "When Nintendo first premiered Drag x Drive at its April Direct, which also served as the big Nintendo Switch 2 showcase, there was no shortage of confusion, mostly due to its scope and scale. It seemed interesting enough, especially with the control scheme, but was that really all it offers? Thankfully, it wasn't, and the company followed up with many more details, and a Global Jam demo for Switch 2 players to go hands-on.\n\nDrag x Drive launches on August 14th for the console and costs a mere $19.99 (excluding the cost of Nintendo Switch Online for online play). Here's everything you should know before diving in.",
