I already plan to discuss Babel by RF Kuang and Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson. But I&#39;d specifically like to draw some examples of books that have a thorough bibliography or notes section at the end of their book. Does anyone have any recommendations? Bonus if they&#39;re fantasy or sci-fi.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Writer-Folk\"> /u/Writer-Folk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mnonm5/novels_with_bibliographies/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mnonm5/novels_with_bibliographies/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I really want to read, but I don&#39;t know how to get into it. I want to read because I want to learn, but theory books are difficult. I find myself pausing and looking up definitions and figuring how they fit in the context of the book. This is very discouraging and I don&#39;t know how to overcome that except maybe by reading books that don&#39;t demand as high of a reading comprehension level. It sucks, in elementary school I had one of the highest reading comprehension levels in my class. Trauma, mental illness, and neurodivergence make reading really difficult for me.

It doesn&#39;t have to be sci-fi, but I&#39;m looking for something that grabs you from the first chapter and doesn&#39;t let go, with a compelling mystery, some great twists, and writing that makes you care about the characters.

I feel like I can&#39;t really connect with the characters or put myself in their shoes. I have no problem with interesting nonfiction books. I want to really feel something when reading so maybe a book with the following elements would help me. An ugly male character (doesn&#39;t have to be the main one) with some past tragedy or trauma he&#39;s unable to overcome. He&#39;s preferably a social outcast, or mildly tolerated at best -- kind of living on the periphery of otherwise normal people. There should be intense jealousy on his end but in a resigned way, like he knows his place in society and he plays along even though he doesn&#39;t like it. He should be weak both in a physical and mental sense. The sadder the ending, the better.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hsjnskoshiieb\"> /u/hsjnskoshiieb </a> <br/",

I love his style too much to read anything \u201cnormal\u201d right now.</p> <p>What I find so special about Murakami is his completely relaxed, almost casual narrative style, in which he seems to simply describe everyday life but at the same time there&#39;s this feeling that something is lurking in the background, something magical, surreal, crazy, that could break into the story at any moment, and that it doesn&#39;t just remain a normal story, but at some point this one moment comes that casts everything in a different light and makes it worth reading basically the whole book about one boring protagonist who is just being followed through his boring daily life.</p> <p>I look for books that have exactly this mixture of calm atmosphere and latent surrealism, stories that read like a dream: sometimes ",

Every single book i find online seems like its only about finding yourself and learning to accept family and embarrassing high school things but I dont want to hear about that when i just want to read. And if not that it talks about history. </p> <p>Some books I enjoy, which Im not sure if its similar to the stuff I&#39;m explaining i just liked the writing style, but they were Hatchet, The yellow wallpaper, the borrowers, Charlotte&#39;s web, or even a book like the secret garden. </p> <p>Please and thankyou to anyones suggestions! I dont know if its really immature of me to not like those other kinds of books, it just makes it hard to enjoy.

But I\u2019ve really been wanting to read a book where the main, or even just any character is gay or trans or whatever, but it\u2019s not treated as the focus point of the story. For example, I don\u2019t want a gay sci-fi story, just a sci-fi story where the character happens to be gay. I guess I\u2019m just looking for representation in books where I don\u2019t feel like my identity is treated as the most important part or like a talking point or used to make commentary about something. I think that has its place, but I guess I want something more lowkey and just there, where the focus is on the rest of the story.
