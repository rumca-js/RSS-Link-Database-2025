It&#39;s a bit monotone in presentation but tons of fun replaying, pure 8-bit action with fluid controls and sweet vintage graphics - Gonna hit it up again, would you guys like to choose the fighter? Johnny Cage didn&#39;t make it canon-wise for this one, meaning that my main is out of the roster. Let&#39;s save/conquer Earth Realm with the winner and show <strong>all Fatalities and Secret Fights</strong> on our way up! (There&#39;s only 6 options so clone characters are bundled).

I tried wizards and warriors 2 ironsword as well and it won&#39;t work at all but worked in a real nintendo.</p> <p>Anyone else have issues with games not on the list? I think mine was a first run one so is glitchier than a more modern or hdmi one.</p> <p>I wonder if hyperkin retron 5 is any better. I am sure it has its own issues though.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Substantial_Skin_709\"> /u/Substantial_Skin_709 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1mnjptk/retro_trio_3_issues_with_random_games_not_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1mnjptk/retro",
