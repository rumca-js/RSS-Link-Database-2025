This post was somewhat clarified for me thanks to the Boycott Battlefield 6 post a few days ago and i have some general questions: If an anticheat runs in User level mode can they still access all our files trough wine? (not to sure about this even after research cause im generally not knowledgeable about how wine fully works). As far as i also know there is a possibility of making anticheats in linux load into systemd with DKMS to get true kernel level anticheat. What can we as the people of the penguin do to stop this horrid invasion of privacy (other then not installing the game, cause thats just given as common sense) how can we stop companies pushing their malware?

I tried all of the fixes I could find online: reinstalling, -opengl or -vulkan in launch options, disabling steam overlay, and the only thing that worked was changing the Proton version to Proton Experimental (Proton Hotfix, GE-Proton, and Proton 7.0 - 9.0 didn&#39;t work). This created a new problem though; now in-game, certain options like settings or weapon upgrades can&#39;t be selected at all, clicking on them will cause them to flicker with nothing changing, it almost looks like it&#39;s clicking and un-clicking really quickly twice? I could change settings using arrow keys and enter as a workaround, but I can&#39;t select weapon upgrades at all. It&#39;s very strange because it worked perfectly out of the box, and I can&#39;t figure out which update broke it. Has anyone encountered this and found a fix?

My laptop currently has a Ryzen 5 5600h and a Radeon RX 5500m. The laptop is slow now, back then when I first i got this laptop for Christmas. It was working fine with Windows, however over the years it began to got slower and I knew it may be time to switch to a different operating system. Please let me know by replying! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Storm_Chasing\"> /u/Storm_Chasing </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mmyjtn/best_linux_gaming_distros_for_amd_intergrated/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mmyjtn/best_linux_gaming_distros_for_amd_intergrated/\">[comments]</a></span>",
