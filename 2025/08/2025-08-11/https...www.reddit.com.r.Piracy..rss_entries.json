The digital version does not give you access to a PDF. It gives you access to their shitty website that takes forever to load and doesn&#39;t work on mobile. So I fixed what they couldnt and turned their manual pages into a portable PDF, accessible without an internet connection and with a better UI.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to upload this PDF somewhere so that other owners of this particular vehicle can access it, for free.

I go off attempting to download it as I&#39;ve become accustomed to, but EVERY 8 season torrent was marked as infringing on Real-Debrid.</p> <p>This led me to discover stremio+torrentio from a post here I think. I set it up in a few minutes and was completely blown away! Not only could it find the entire 8 seasons of Dexter, it could find some of the more obscure things I&#39;d had a very hard time finding a working torrent for and just play them!</p> <p>Then I read about how stremio is fine now, but if/when Paramount and friends get more active, things might not be so easy in the future, so I decided to try to replicate the stremio+torrentio setup, but have it go to my 8T drive on my jellyfin server.</p> <p>I spent the day setting this up in docker with Gemini&#39;s help and it works %98, BUT I can&#39;t seem to get anything to utilize my real-debrid account to cover the last mile as it were.</p",
