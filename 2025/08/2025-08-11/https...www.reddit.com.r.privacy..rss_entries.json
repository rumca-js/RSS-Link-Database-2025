My main worry is im worried im going to get him in trouble due to the online safety act. Do they check messages? Most of my images are deleted so idrc but im just worried about this one photo thats in our chat history still. Im of age now and that photo was taken when i was of age but still. We havent been able to talk a whole lot lately due to our schedules being the way they are so i cant communicate with him for a bit. Im so worried. Please will he be ok? Im so anxious i could cry. Will i get him in trouble?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/imPrettyStrawberry\"> /u/imPrettyStrawberry </a> <br/> <spa",
