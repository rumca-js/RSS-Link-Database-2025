        "description": "How did life start on Earth? The answer is a big scientific mystery scientists are actively investigating. After talking with many scientists, host Regina G. Barber found that an abundance of water on Earth is most likely key, in some way, to the origin of life \u2014 specifically, in either deep sea hydrothermal vents or in tide pools. It's for this reason some scientists are also exploring the potential for life in so-called \"water worlds\" elsewhere in the solar system, like some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn. This episode, Regina digs into two water-related hypotheses for the origin on life on Earth \u2014 and what that\u00a0<em>might</em>\u00a0mean for possible alien life.<br><br><em>Have another scientific mystery you want us to cover on a future episode?

Videos like: \"Flat Earthers vs Scientists,\" \"1 Conservative vs. 20 Feminists,\" and, \"What Makes a Real Man?\" are just some of the few topics they cover.   <br><br>It's what caused The Atlantic staff writer <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/spencer-kornhaber/\"target=\"_blank\"   >Spencer Kornhaber</a> to write his article, \"<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/01/jubilee-media-profile/681411/\"target=\"_blank\"   >Jubilee is Like Gen-Z's 'Jerry Springer Show</a>'\".  <br><br>But their most recent video, \"1 Progressive vs 20 Far-Right Conservatives,\" has gone viral for what some feel is a dangerous platforming of fascist ideals.   Brittany is joined by The Atlantic staff writer Spencer Kornhaber to get into the state of public discourse, and how traditional media may led us to this moment.",
