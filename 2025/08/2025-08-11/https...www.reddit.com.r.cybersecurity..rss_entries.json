On diving deeper, I was fascinated how return addresses are modified to execute code stored in the buffer and also the security measures undertaken by operating systems and compilers to avoid such attacks.</p> <p>I am not a cybersecurity expert (I&#39;m into ML and Android dev), but the breadth of low-level concepts covered while researching the topic, motivated me to combine all my findings/ideas in a blogpost.

We find ourselves in a situation where we want to control the software that users install in order to have some degree of control. To do this, we have an administrator privilege management tool, and users have to fill out a form documenting why they need the tool, the cost, licensing, etc. My manager has asked me to have all software installed from now on analyzed by my cybersecurity team. We have no knowledge of reverse engineering. For now, the process is simply based on extracting the installer&#39;s hash and searching Virus Total. We also have a private sandbox where we launch the installers, although I find that they are almost always flagged as malicious due to the installer&#39;s own behavior.</p> <p>Any ideas on how to perform this software analysis p",

I&#39;m very distrustful of SMS as a form of authentication for multiple reasons (primarily because I can&#39;t prevent a silver-tongued scammer from successfully executing a SIM swapping attack), but I can acknowledge that in conjunction with a strong password it&#39;s better than no 2FA. However, I&#39;ve noticed that some sites require 2FA, only support SMS as a 2FA method (no TOTP or physical key or passphrase), and allow me to use SMS to reset my password. So basically I&#39;m forced to give them my phone number in order to use the site, and access to that phone number alone can get an attacker into the site. Isn&#39;t this, like...really bad? </p> <p>I can&#39;t think of any examples off the top of my head, but I recall seeing this pattern even in financial services as well as multiple B2B services (although SSO enforcement takes care of that).
