Thanks and please help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Willing_Progress_646\"> /u/Willing_Progress_646 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/pyt4tnh5reif1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1mnfwgu/best_usb_brandmodel_for_initial_bootinstall/\">[comments]</a></span>",
