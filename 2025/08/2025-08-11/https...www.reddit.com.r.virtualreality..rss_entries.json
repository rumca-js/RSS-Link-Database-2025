But your mechanical like completely mechanical. And it takes just a tiny bit to move in delay because this is not a tagging game or such. It&#39;s a lil bigger robot game. So bassicaly you would press a button on your controller and it summons an orb in your hand and you throw it to summon a bigger version of you. Kinda like the balls from orian drift. Now you can also give it weapons too using your bubbles like from yeeps hide and seek but just for your lil bigger robot. Now idk how this will work but most maps will be symmetrical and the mobot moves with you and if you don&#39;t want that you have another option to climb into the robot but only for movement and not for fighting.

Sadly, I haven&#39;t been able to find anything good by scouring Steam&#39;s Library. Does anyone have any good recommendations?

It causes me to become so distressed I have to take off my hmd and look around me to make sure I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s really disruptive, especially when playing beat saber since I might have to pause in the middle of a song.</p> <p>What&#39;s your advice for this?
