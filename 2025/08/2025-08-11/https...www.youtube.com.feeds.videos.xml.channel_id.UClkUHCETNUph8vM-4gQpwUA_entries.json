We're also going to talk about the hotfix that just happened the other day, as well as the roadmap that THQ Nordic posted about the game.\n\n0:00 - Titan Quest 2 Early Access Hotfix and Roadmap\n0:23 - Hotfixes\n1:30 - Major Updates\n1:57 - Roadmap\n3:36 - FAQ\n8:14 - My Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fextralife\nVisit our wikis: https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/\nCheck out our blog: https://fextralife.com/\nVisit our forums: https://fextralife.com/f",
