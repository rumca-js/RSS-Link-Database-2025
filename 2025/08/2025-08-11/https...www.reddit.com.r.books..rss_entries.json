Two, Jack doesn&#39;t remember because of the trauma of having been beaten to within an inch of his life by Batman in full view of the GCPD. Three, Jack is lying through his teeth.

What interested me the most, however, was the afterword, where Eco explained some challenges of translating the book into other languages, and some interesting bits on the English release. He wrote that Americans know less Latin than Europeans as a general rule, and so struggled with understanding the spirit of the Latin phrases used in the book, because Americans don&#39;t even have knowledge of basic ecclesiastical Latin, much less any contact with Latin in historical settings. This caused him to put in some moments where a character will speak a phrase in Latin, then repeat in English in what is really for the benefit of us, the reader. It was an addition that I think added much to flow of the book.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways, reading all the work that went into t",
