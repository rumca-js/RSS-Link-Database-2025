They announced that everyone is getting their most capable model yet, GPT 5. But in reality, tho it says GPT 5. Under the hood, users are getting responses from far inferior mini models. Which is even worse for free users. Because previously you would know when your 4o limit is up. Then you could wait a few hours and use 4o again. But that&#39;s not possible anymore. Free users are forced to use inferior and straight up bad models most of the time.</",

Plus the personalities like Nerd or Default. </p> <p>But now? It&#39;s all stale and static. No matter what traits or personality I used it&#39;s still the same stale and flat response. Definitely changed when GPT 5 was launched. </p> <p>The tips are still helpful. But I&#39;d like when the AI is at least a little bit expressive and cheerful in response.

He also refers to concerns about a small minority of users experiencing \u2018delusion\u2019, which has unfortunately shifted the focus away from the broader, more typical experiences that are being shared by people online.</p> <p>This framing risks overlooking the real, positive impact GPT-4o has had on thousands of users. As you can see on Reddit, people have shared heartfelt stories of how GPT-4o has supported them, whether in creative writing, meaningful in-depth conversations, therapeutic reflection, professional workflows, or even life-saving moments of emotional support.
