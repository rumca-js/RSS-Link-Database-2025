It&#39;s admirable how it manages to be truly accessible to anyone, of all ages. It is, for me, a great film for the way in which it mixes an excellent theme (that of man profoundly changed by war) with spectacular and colorful action scenes. Not to mention the wonderful settings on the Adriatic Sea, and the protagonist himself. Marco is tremendously interesting because, in the end, he is neither a saint nor a hero, he is a man of great skill and affinity with planes; but also a &quot;pig&quot;. Literally a &quot;pig&quot;. I also really love all the anti-fascist morality. Overall, Porco Rosso is a manifesto of freedom both in the heavens and on the ground. </p> <p>What do you think of this film?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mattone_Martello\"> /u/Mattone_Martello </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

It&#39;s DVD sales were noteworthy too. However, the poor performance of the two sequels has erased the trilogy from people&#39;s minds.</p> <p>But I think the first is a great fantasy film which deserves to be remembered. I love all 4 lead characters and Neeson&#39;s Aslan as well as Tilda Swinton leave a lasting impression.</p> <p>New Zealand provided a fantastic location to set Narnia in and I think the final battle is underrated when it comes to on-screen battles of this kind.</p> <p>The movie has that warm Christmassy vibe and actually makes for a great viewing during the December holidays.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Boss452\"> /u/Boss452 </a> <br/> <span><a href=",

I\u2019m especially interested in moments where the visual impact is amplified by sound design (like feeling the subwoofers shake in a theater). These can be from any genre, any era \u2014 I want to study what makes them so impactful, both visually and emotionally.
