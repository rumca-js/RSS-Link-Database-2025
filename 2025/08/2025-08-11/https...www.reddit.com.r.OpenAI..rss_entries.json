I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if GPT-5 turns out to be smaller than 4o, and maybe even five times smaller than 4.5. While this works very well in benchmarks and coding, it doesn&#39;t in other fields cause intuitive and emotional intelligence comes from the size of the model. There is no amount of reasoning steps to grasp the complexity of some situations, you need more parameters.<br/> So my question is: did OpenAI stop pushing for larger models because they hit a technological wall after 4.5, or is it just VC pressure to focus on more efficient, sellable models now?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/massix93\"> /u/massix93 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1mnf88m/will_openai_release_another_big_nonreasoning/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/O",
