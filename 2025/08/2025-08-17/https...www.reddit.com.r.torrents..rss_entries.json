Primarily I goto yts on my phone, use bitorrent to download, and transfer to a USB from my phone and watch on my shield. I feel its time to seek a better way. I used PureVPN for a while but cancelled. I tried Proton VPN free version to see if I like it, but the speeds are too slow to tell. I mainly just use my phone to download and transfer but wondering what&#39;s a better way to not get an email from my ISP.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Huge_Aide_825\"> /u/Huge_Aide_825 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1mt56g4/need_some_guidance/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1mt56g4/need_some_guidance/\">[comments]</a></span>",
