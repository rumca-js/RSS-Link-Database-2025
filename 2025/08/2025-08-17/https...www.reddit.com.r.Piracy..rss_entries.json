Speeds outside the &#39;local&#39; network were mediocre at best, even by 00s standards, but the whole point was having high speed connection to whomever was also on the same ISP. Moreover, the ISP had their own local DC++ server which you could connect to and speeds were pretty darn good by 00s standards, similar to a Gigabit connection nowadays. Wanted a movie? Just search for it, some people accidentally uploaded/made available their whole local disk and you&#39;d see personal info (i.e. prom photos 05). </p> <p>It was a wild era, pirating was so mainstream and commonplace that, looking back, the internet provider practically set it up for its users.

We would choose the amount of games and the dealer would burn it into CDR or burn the floppies. Does anyone remember these lists?

The year is not that important, as the variants produced 1991-1994 are more or less the same, but I can&#39;t find anything for any Opel Campo. Opel Campo is a rebranded Isuzu Pickup, and is supposedly almost identical to the Vauxhall Brava, but I can&#39;t find anything on those either.</p> <p>I&#39;m sorry if this sounds more car-related than piracy-related, but I don&#39;t think car subs allow discussion of piracy, and I really would like to avoid sketchy paywall sites.
