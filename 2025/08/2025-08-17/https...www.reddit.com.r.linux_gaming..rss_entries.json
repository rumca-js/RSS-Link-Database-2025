I used to be able to run most of the games I play at 60fps 4k (Motortown: Behind The Wheel, and Planetside 2 are the ones I&#39;m talking about specifically)<br/> I think one of the issues is that the gpu clock for some reason is capping at 380MHz and I have no clue why.

It handles everything great other than anything gaming related. Steam is sluggish, constantly giving me cloud sync errors, most games won&#39;t launch, and the ones that do launch take forever to load and just crash when loading into the game. Portal for example will load me into the menu, but whenever I try to load into a level the game will spawn me in and freeze. I&#39;ve purged and then reinstalled the apt, snap, and flatpak versions but they all give me the same issues. I&#39;ve moved game install files to a few different drives with different file systems.

To be completely honest, it is not my first time installing it. In fact, with how many reinstalls and dual-boots I did in the past I probably have done it at least 7 times... Thing is, the situation is completely different</p> <p>My new laptop, and my first time buying a laptop with my own money, is a gaming laptop (Acer Nitro 16, Ryzen 7, RTX 4070). Compared to my previous one, which wasn&#39;t meant for gaming (and was pretty poor in performance anyway), this one has... many things I don&#39;t understand. To begin with the elephant in the room, Nvidia. Most of my knowledge comes from 2-4 year old videos that highlight the problems it used to have. Many years have passed though, and I am pretty sure things have changed, drastically. But I can&#39;t wrap my head around it.</p> <p>To put things into context, I barely know what I&#39;m doing on Windows",

I have a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Nvidia 5080 with Version 575-Drivers. Tried it with Linux Mint and CachyOS, both got the same Problem. It loads initially, I can log in to my Microsoft-Account. After that you can see the loading bar move a bit and then it just stops. Background-Pictures continue to cycle for another 2 minutes or so, then Linux asks, if you want to wait or force the game to quit. Tried Proton 9.0-4, lates Proton GE, and on CachyOS the current native Proton, same Behavior.
