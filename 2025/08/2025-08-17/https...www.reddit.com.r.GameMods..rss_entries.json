Running seamlessly alongside any application, BLP provides clear metrics to help users understand system headroom and identify potential bottlenecks.</p> <p>BLP is a headroom visualization tool, not a full-fledged FPS meter or system profiler. It estimates potential FPS based on CPU and GPU utilization to highlight system constraints and performance trends, rather than reporting exact in-game frame rates.</p> <p>Key Features and Metrics: </p> <p>CPU &amp; GPU Potential FPS: BLP calculates the potential frames per second based on CPU and GPU utilization, giving an estimate of system headroom rather than actual in-game FPS. This helps users quickly identify whether the CPU or GPU is limiting ",
