We&#39;ve been working on it for about a year now, and are really excited to get it out there and have people try it. My true loves in games are making builds, and exploration. So with this game I tried hard to bring them together. I wanted lots of permanent progression, and just enough roguelike elements to give it a quicker play session and tons of experimentation. These days I find I don&#39;t have as much time to sink into something like PoE to really try out various builds.</p> <p>Trailer: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg4p6Ptx2gs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg4p6Ptx2gs</a><br/> Steam Page: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219180/Cursemark/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219180/Cursemark/</a></p> <p>If it looks cool give it a shot and let us know what you think.
