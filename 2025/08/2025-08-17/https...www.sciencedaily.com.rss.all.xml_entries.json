Recorded just over an hour after the quake, the satellite revealed the wave\u2019s height, shape, and path, offering scientists an unprecedented multidimensional view from space.",

The bacteria act like Trojan horses, carrying viral payloads to cancer\u2019s core, where the virus can spread and destroy malignant cells. Built-in safety features ensure the virus can\u2019t multiply outside the tumor, offering a promising pathway for safe, targeted therapy.",
