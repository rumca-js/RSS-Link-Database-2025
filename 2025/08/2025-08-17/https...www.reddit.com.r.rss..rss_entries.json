This is very useful for me as a consumer. Are there any other tools that do similar? Is there a place where one can find a directory of Typefully-based RSS X feeds to subscribe to? Is there a way to encourage X users who use or would consider using Typefully to make an RSS feed of their account available?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/strawberry444\"> /u/strawberry444 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1msm8k9/rss_for_x_via_typefully_inquiry/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1msm8k9/rss_for_x_via_typefully_inquiry/\">[comments]</a></span>",
