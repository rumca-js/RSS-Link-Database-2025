Can you read adult books to 1 year olds and toddlers and 4 year olds? Do they enjoy it less than kid books? Of course they will not understand all the themes like adults. But in the past parents must have children of all ages adult books because those would be the books they had. And kids would gather around the fire and listen. If you read the original Brothers Grimm, it is not written in easy words to sound out. Even Alice in Wonderland has complex language.</p> <p>Is there any reason kids today listen to Rafi and read &quot;cat hat bat&quot; before they&#39;re even old enough for phonics?

You may imagine how many expectations and fears I had before reading it.</p> <p><em>Midnight cowboy</em> is a dramatic novel that tells the story of Joe Buck, a young man who decides to leave his work as a dishwasher in Houston to travel to New York dressed as a cowboy, in order to become a prostitute there.</p> <p>You can guess he has a hard time in the city, but eventually, after collecting traumas after traumas, he will find what he really seeked for his whole, lonely life: a human connection. And he will find it in the last person you can imagine.</p> <p><strong>What I love about the novel:</strong> I love how <em>Midnight cowboy</em> tackles trauma. In fiction I often see traumas like &quot;my father tied me to the radiator and beat me everyday when I was a child, now I want to burn the world/I was raped 20 times and now I cry everyday and I&#39;m always angry agains",
