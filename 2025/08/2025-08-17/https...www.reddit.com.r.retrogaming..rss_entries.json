For starters, I really like the action RPG elements it uses as being that it\u2019s a Nihon Falcom based game, the game feels well designed as from what I remember is that the game was designed on a 2D plane as players could move left to right, and the controls were very responsive for the time because if I remember correctly, the attack input was very quick, meaning it didn\u2019t take much effort to point a weapon at an enemy because they down very quickly.</p> <p>If any of that didn\u2019t come out right, I am sorry because I have a writing impediment issue as basically I was trying to write my personal views on the game to show my appreciation because I wanted to start my post off with my feelings ",
