It feels like low-effort \u201cticket tossing.\u201d In reality, someone with actual expertise often has to sit with the teams and help remediate (atleast this returns immediate results), but then security ends up being seen as the \u201cfix everything\u201d team, which doesn\u2019t scale.</p> <p>How does it work where you are?

I was in the military for almost 12 years as an aircraft mechanic. I got it about 2 years ago and stayed in the reserves. Through the reserves I got basic intel analysis training and a clearance. I\u2019m supposed to start classes at my local CC for IT, however, i SUCK at math and fear I\u2019ll fail out of CC. My CC also offers a Cybersecurity Certificate option which basically bypasses all the math an associates entails. I know it\u2019s not as good as a degree and a degree would obviously be better, but if I decided to just go for the Cybersecurity Certificate would it still even be possible to get into cybersecurity? I should also mention I already know what direction I want to go in Cyber. I want to do Cyber Threat Intelligence. I feel like that utilizes all the other \u201cskills\u201d/\u201casset",

Starting my first official \u201ccybersecurity\u201d role and looking for any tips and advice to be as prepared as possible. I\u2019ll be working as DoD contractor providing technical support involving mainly RMF compliance, software testing, and communicating findings with stakeholders. I\u2019ll be working under the ISSOs at my company. I come from a tech support background and college education in Computer Science, and I have familiarized myself with the general RMF/ATO process by reading up the processes and documents that come with it(ex NIST SP 800-[53, 171, 37], FIPS-199, etc.). Any tips for success in this role? Seems like junior ISSO would be a fitting title based on the job responsibilities.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HospitalGullible3087\"> /u/HospitalGullible3087 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1mscc6a/starting_a_new_role_in_software_assurance/",
