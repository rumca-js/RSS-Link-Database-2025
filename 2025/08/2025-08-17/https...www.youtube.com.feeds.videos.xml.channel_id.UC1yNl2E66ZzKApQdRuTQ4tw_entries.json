Instead, physicists claim, it\u2019s slowly getting weaker. This has understandably shaken our understanding of the universe \u2013 this week, physicists show that the new data is compatible with string theory, and that the universe will eventually collapse. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24011\n\nThis video comes with a quiz which you can take here: https://quizwithit.com/start_thequiz/1755265655984x581035542926327800\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfe",
