After Siskel passed, it was still must see viewing to see Ebert&#39;s reviews (No knock against Roeper; the show&#39;s essence didn&#39;t change; which is a testament to him.)</p> <p>I agreed with Ebert about 90% of the time (overall thumbs up/down), but what mattered most was hearing his reasoning, which when combined with my preferences, it created a super quick heuristic to know whether I would love, like, dislike or hate a movie. For example, his review of Blue Velvet, which he disliked, gave me enough information to want to see it. </p> <p>Since his passing, there has been a void in me and surely others. Changes in cultural and technology are the main culprits, and I don&#39;t know of a good solution (for society as a whole).</p> <p>/mild rant over</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",
