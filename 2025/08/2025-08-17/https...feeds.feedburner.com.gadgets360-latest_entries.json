The first-stage booster, B1093, completed its fifth flight and landed smoothly on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You in the Pacific Ocean. This mission marked SpaceX\u2019s 98th Falcon 9 flight of 2025, raising the active Starlink constellation to over 8,100 satellites. Starlink currently delivers broadband service to about 130 countries and territories, targeting near-global coverage with a planned 12,000-satellite network. SpaceX\u2019s next mission, Starlink 17-5, is set for Aug. 15, aiming to send another 24 satellites into orbit to further expand the network.",
