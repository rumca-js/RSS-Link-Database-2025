I\u2019m running it on a Synology NAS with Docker and a 1GB Fiber (up/down) and everything is working great now \u2013 upload/download speeds are amazing, the web UI is super fast, Finder integration on macOS works nicely, and even big file Zippings on the fly are blazing fast. </p> <p>But there\u2019s one huge issue: I just found out that Seafile doesn\u2019t support \u201cFiles on Demand\u201d / \u201cOnline-only files\u201d like Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud Drive etc. That means I can\u2019t just keep everything in the cloud and only download when I need it. For me (and probably many other professionals with large libraries), this is a must-have feature.</p> <p>So my question:</p> <p>Is this feature planned for Seafile in the near future?</p> <p>Or is there maybe some workaround I don\u2019t know about? - Except for &quot;Library&quot;-Syncing, which i don&#39;t use b",
