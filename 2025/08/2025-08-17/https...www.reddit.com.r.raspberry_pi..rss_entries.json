The reset pin on the breakout goes to GP35 (TX pin for some reason) and despite trying that and other pins, nothing seems to happen. I use &quot;Pin(35, Pin.OUT)&quot; to address it.</p> <p>This is because the LTE chip seems to have a major issue where if it loses connection, it just never connects again and repeatedly times out. I just want to reset the whole module in code if it goes wrong as it needs to be self-reliant.</p> <p>Any help is really appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/A_Wet_Dog\"> /u/A_Wet_Dog </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1mt4hcd/resetting_clipper_lte_module_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1mt4hcd/resetting_clipper_l",
