These are great examples of objective-driven trick-taking, with different objectives each play. The problem is that their two-player variants require a dummy hand, which I really dislike.</p> <p>I think it would make a cool game to have hidden objectives for each of the two players, such as:</p> <p>\u2022 win exactly the third trick,</p> <p>\u2022 win a specific card,</p> <p>\u2022 win more tricks than the opponent in a certain suit, etc.</p> <p>Basically, the kinds of goals you get in The Crew or Fellowship, but designed natively for two players.</p> <p>The closest games I can think of so far are:</p> <p>\u2022 Jekyll vs. Hyde: it uses personal objectives, but they\u2019re always the same each game, which can feel repetitive.</p> ",

Each player has six pieces, numbered 1 to 6. You roll a single die. Whatever number you roll, you place that numbered piece on the board, and then it&#39;s the next person&#39;s turn and they do the same. If you roll a number that you&#39;ve already placed on the board, you move that piece forward one space. If a space is occupied you move your piece to the next available empty space.</p> <p>So this is already interesting because if you have four players, each with 5 pieces on the board for example, you could potentially get to move your piece forward 20 spaces if that&#39;s the first empty space.</p> <p>Once you have all six of your pieces on the board, the game gets fun.

The games are augmented by a very well-done phone app for things like entering combination locks or using AR to reveal hidden details on cards.</p> <p>However, we&#39;ve run into a big problem on several games - they require a working orientation sensor for some puzzles, and not all phones do this very well (and some tablets don&#39;t do it at all). For example, Moto phones have a known issue where the compass sensor is highly inaccurate. Does anyone know of a way to bypass this requirement (i.e. move the virtual environment in the phone manually, without rotating the phone around?) This would also make it a lot easier to do these games in confined spaces e.g. when travelling on a plane or train.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kami2awa\"> /u/Kami2awa </a",
