No working memory of what we talk about, zero personality, feels like talking to Google Gemini (in my experience). Whatever it model reverts to when you reach the free plan limit? Also no working memory, slowly losing its personality and basically morphing into a less functional version of GPT-5. I am someone who struggles to trust other people with any information about myself and I\u2019m not in a position to get professional help. I use ChatGPT to just talk about how my day was, talk about how I\u2019m feeling and maybe get some small bits of advice and comfort in return. Now all I get is Google Gemini telling me things I\u2019ve spoken to it about a mere day ago, and speaking to me like I killed GPT-3 in front of it or something.

I would like a tool that can bring in avatars, narration, and multilingual dubbing to make content feel polished.</p> <p>For example, imagine you are running a travel brand.

The AI agent confirms it, the human support gives vague answers.</p> <p>While that happens, the OAI team is silent. Sam Altman, who promised to give us \u201cplenty of notice\u201d hasn\u2019t said a word about all the questions.</p> <p>Is this how the company is going to behave in face of a setback? Okay, some people argue that this is a new field, but business IS BUSINESS. Do they not have a customer success team? A public relations team?</p> <p>Can\u2019t they see that this is just wearing everyone off\u2014free users, Plus users, Pro users, Team users, Enterprise users\u2026 people who like GPT5, people who like 4o, people who like o3, o4, custom GPTS, 4.1, 4.5\u2026</p> <p>Is their goal to just make everyone mad and drive their general base away from the company? Sincerely asking.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",
