Before Alcaraz and Hamad Medjedovic, his opponent, took to the court, they had no choice but to wait as Francisco Comesa\u00f1a and the big-serving Reilly Opelka worked through a tumultuous three-hour, three-set contest replete with manic momentum shifts, medical time-outs and a last-minute rain delay for good measure.

During the second world war, local women surrounded two men whom they had mistaken for a Nazi intent on stealing it.
