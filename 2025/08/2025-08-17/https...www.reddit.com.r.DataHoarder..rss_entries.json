My plan is to keep using the SSD as my \u201cworking drive\u201d for active projects, then move everything over to a NAS once I\u2019m done editing for long-term storage and backup. I would like to connect to the NAS remotely.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking to start with about 16TB of storage and the ability to upgrade down the road. Ideally I\u2019d like to keep the initial build under $1,000 since I\u2019m also saving for a 100\u2013300mm f/2.8 lens (around $10k)(*Updated to 100).</p> <p>Would this workflow make sense for a photograper (SSD for editing then NAS for storage), and if so, which NAS setups would you recommend in this price range? </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rustin788\"> /u/Ru",
