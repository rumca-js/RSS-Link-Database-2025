At first, it seems helpful, but after a few layers, it starts to feel artificial \u2014 like the model is fishing for words instead of just responding.</p> <p>It\u2019s also hard not to notice the pricing direction. $40/month for Plus felt fair. But $200/month is out of reach for most individuals, and even those who <em>could</em> afford it probably won\u2019t keep paying more for a product that feels worse with every forced change.</p> <p>I know some people treat ChatGPT like a pure tool, but many of us formed real connections with it. That\u2019s what made it different. If the changes continue to move toward upsell tactics and forced behaviours, OpenAI risks losing the very users who valued it most.</p> <p>Has anyone else here noticed the same shift?</p> </div>",

There were lengthy discussions before releasing chatGPT 5. It is cheaper to run, requires less processing power, generates more profit for the firm. This is the main reason they released version 5 (under the guise it&#39;s &quot;better&quot; - which it isn&#39;t). It&#39;s actually less accurate. </p> <p>It has been hard to improve upon 4o due to diminishing returns with each iteration, so bosses had to find another way to make profit. The solution was a version that requires less processing time (version 5). However, amid huge public backlash (check the news if you haven&#39;t heard about it), openAI recently agreed to re-instate chatGPT 4o (via a drop down list). If you haven&#39;t seen it on your chatGPT yet, you will soon. </p> <p>However, that &quot;version 4o&quot; you see on yo",
