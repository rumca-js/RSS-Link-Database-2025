        "description": "OFF reviewed by Michael Higham on PC, also available on Nintendo Switch.\n\nOFF is an important relic of the old RPG Maker scene, a pioneer in the realm of independent, small-scale RPGs that innovated in its own right. To have an accessible, modernized version that is a nearly 1-to-1 rerelease, without having to dig up old download links for a fan-translated version, is a win in itself. As a faithful remaster of a 2008 RPG Maker game, however, it also shows its age rather clearly, with a shallow turn-based combat system and barebones structure \u2013 such is the thing with aging. But even within those limitations, some things do age gracefully; the eerie atmosphere, off-kilter art style, cartoonish humor that feeds into a uniquely disturbing style of horror, and the breaking of convention that still sends chills down my spine. OFF walked so others could run \u2013 so, you don't have to love OFF, but you damn well better respect it.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

Black Ops 7 is expected to hit pretty much every major console\u2014yes, even PS4 and Xbox One\u2014except the Nintendo ones. Microsoft and Nintendo have a legally binding agreement to bring Call of Duty to the Switch platform, so it's likely a case of 'when' and not 'if' when it comes to a Switch 2 port. In other news, screenwriter and Solid Snake voice actor David Hayter has finally played Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. After voicing the character across several games starting with Metal Gear Solid in 1998, Hayter was unceremoniously booted from the role for MGS5 in 2015, only to be replaced by the more mainstream Keifer Sutherland. But Hayter has since gotten over it and played MGS5, which he thinks is 'amazing.' And we'll take a look at how all of Borderlands 4\u2019s V",

We got the first five episodes to review and all the bawdy, lewd, blood-soaked, grief-stricken, trauma-infused f-bomb enthusiasts are back to what they were up to last we saw them. But is more of the same from the 11th Street Kids enough to carry Peacemaker through another season and into the new DCU?\n\nChristopher Smith aka Peacemaker is joined again by his BFFs, Freddie Stroma as Vigilante, Steve Agee as John Economos, Jennifer Holland as Emilia Harcourt, Danielle Brooks as Leota Adebayo. Even Auggie Smith, Chris' racist White Dragon dad makes it back somehow. Saturday Night Live legend Tim Meadows is the new guy along with Frank Grillo as new head of ARGUS and grieving father, Rick Flagg Sr., there to make sure Peacemaker doesn't live down the events of The Suicide Squad.\n\nLet us know what you're most excited about for Season 2 of the HBO Max series and the future of James Gu",

Outside of a brief glimpse at the end of 1997's Alien: Resurrection, and a less brief glimpse in the alternate ending of that film, we\u2019ve never seen what Alien\u2019s future has in store for our\u00a0 humble home\u2026 until now. Alien: Earth, as the title would suggest, is set almost entirely right here on the blue planet. We talked to Noah Hawley about the challenges of designing a brand new vision of Earth around the corporations that rule it, how to maintain a recognizable retro-future in the mold of the 1979 Ridley Scott film and how the creative team behind Alien: Earth avoided the dystopian traps of science fiction.\n\n#IGN",
