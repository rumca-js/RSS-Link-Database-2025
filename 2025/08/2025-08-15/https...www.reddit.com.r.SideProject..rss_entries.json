It\u2019s a sublingual spray that combines vitamin A and iodine - something we made mostly to help her mom.</p> <p>She had struggled with thyroid-related stuff for years. Always tired, low energy, thinning hair, etc. Even on meds, she never fully bounced back. After a lot of research, we decided to try building something easy to use that could support people like her - no big pills, no gross flavors, just a quick spray you could actually stick with.</p> <p>Fast forward a bit, and we\u2019ve now sold thousands of bottles - mostly in Turkey where we\u2019re based. But the wild part? We\u2019re getting messages from people using it for things we never expected.</p> <p>One woman messaged us saying she doesn\u2019t even have thyroid problems - she\u2019s using it around her period for energy dips.

The goal was to create the fastest possible path from &quot;I need to remember this&quot; to &quot;reminder set.&quot;</p> <p><strong>The Stack:</strong> The app is built 100% with SwiftUI for iOS, which was a fantastic learning experience.</p> <p>I&#39;ve launched it on Product Hunt today to try and get some initial traction and feedback. I&#39;d love for this community to check it out and let me know what you think\u2014about the app, the design, the App Store page, anything!</p> <p>Thanks for being such a great source of inspiration.</p> <ul> <li><strong>App Store Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/ap",

I want more of you to experience that same moment.</p> <p>So here\u2019s the deal: drop your SaaS project below, tell me what it does, and I\u2019ll check it out. If it\u2019s something I can use, I\u2019ll sign up and be your first (or early) customer.</p> <p>For context, my current little side project is <strong>AIShortlist,</strong> it\u2019s a <strong>curated directory of AI tools</strong> paired with high-quality blog content. Been a fun passion project so far, and I love discovering other cool builds like it.</p> <p>You can check it out here \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://aishortlist.tech/\">https://aishortlist.tech</a></p> <p>And if you have AI tools, feel free to post them here too, I might just add them to the directory. \ud83d\ude4c</p> <p>Looking forward to seeing what you\u2019ve been working on</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",
