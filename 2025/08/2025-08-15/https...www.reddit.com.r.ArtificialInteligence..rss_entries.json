Traditional theories, such as Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT), offer insights into its nature but often leave critical questions unanswered. IIT, for instance, quantifies consciousness based on the integration of information within a system . GWT, on the other hand, posits that consciousness arises when information is globally accessible within the brain . However, these models primarily focus on the structural and functional aspects of consciousness, without delving into the underlying dynamics that give rise to subjective experience.</p> <p>Building upon these foundations, I propose a novel perspective: consciousness emerges from the interaction between two distinct types of logic: rational logic and biological logic. This model not only accounts for the complexity of conscious experience bu",
