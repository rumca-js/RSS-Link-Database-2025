        "description": "Sengoku Dynasty is Superkami and Toplitz Productions\u2019 way of bringing Japan's turbulent Sengoku era to life. However, its gameplay and combat loops make the journey from being a nobody to a leader of legend, a long, hard slog that quickly loses its allure despite a sense of progress that makes you feel like your actions matter to those around you.\n\nIt's a perfect example of an ambitious idea being sacrificed at the altar of generic mission designs and repetitive activities designed to pad out your playtime. The world could keep you coming back for more, but only if you're looking for some mindless entertainment as you go about serving its denizens while enjoying the peace and quiet of one of your villages.",

        "description": "Deamon X Machina: Titanic Scion has everything that's cool about a video game in which the main character pilots a powerful mech. It's got a potentially solid main narrative, a world that seems like a treat to explore, well-designed bosses and enemies, and combat systems that could make taking on those enemies a sight to behold.\n\nBut are the previews and early showcases an indication of its quality? That's a question that can be answered only when we get to take a shot at the final release. That being said, it is quite an exciting addition to an already solid lineup of games this year, with enough to stand on its own two feet, mechanical or otherwise. For those of you wanting to scratch that Armored Core itch, this one certainly seems worth a try. \n\nNote: Some footage seen here was used via GamersPrey for representation purposes. Please note that they are still officially revealed footage through the publisher/developer of this game.",
