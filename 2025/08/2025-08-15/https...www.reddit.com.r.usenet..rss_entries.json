I want to use Usenet on my Amiga 500 computer but cannot find any actual guides on doing that, I found one video by Dan Wood but that was using a much more recent version of Workbench. I&#39;m signed up to a Usenet service and I&#39;ll be using TCPser for connections. I use A Talk III already but I doubt anything related to this would function on A Talk III since it&#39;s more oriented on BBS&#39;s.
