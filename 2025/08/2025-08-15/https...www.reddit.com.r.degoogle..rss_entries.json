I&#39;m just trying to be thorough because I&#39;ve had my google account for over a decade and I know its had its hooks in just about everything. My main issue is making sure my android tablet no longer has any traces of google including play services. I kind of want it to be completely open source but I&#39;m not confident with jailbreaking or changing an OS. I&#39;ll need to do a lot more research to get to that point.</p> <p>Next step is to figure out linux and remove microsoft from my PC...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Useful_Ranger_2552\"> /u/Useful_Ranger_2552 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1mqj9sv/deleted_my_google_account/\">[link]</a></",
