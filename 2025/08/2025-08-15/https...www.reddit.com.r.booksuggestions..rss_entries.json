I&#39;m looking for some books for my mom. She used to be a really avid reader, but lost her love for it several years back. However, she&#39;s currently reading the first book in the All Souls trilogy by Deborah Harkness and is absolutely loving it. I&#39;m hoping I can find other books that can give her that same feeling.</p> <p>Things she generally likes about this book: - The romance. I get the impression that she specifically likes the forbidden elements of it quite a bit. - The supernatural elements. She really loves mythical creatures (especially vampires). She\u2019s also very excited about some of the magic they\u2019re using. - The historical and academic elements. My mom adores learning about history and enjoys deep dives into it. (This also includes fictional history, like learning about how fictional worlds came to be. I hope that makes sense.)</",

I don\u2019t like the real modern fantasy books like the powerless trilogy or once upon a broken heart, nothing like that. I would love some book recs!! Preferably ones that aren\u2019t set in this decade? Also nothing set before the 20th century. I love Stephen king and anything with strong friendships like the outsiders- se Hinton and the body- Stephen king. Or anything that has really good plot twists! Nothing too cheesy, romance is ok but it can\u2019t be the central theme, and nothing really spicy. My favourite books are The Shining, The Outsiders, Storyteller by Dave Grohl (idk if that helps) and the Godfather. Sorry if I sound picky, but hopefully you guys can help me out!!

I have the unfortunate curse of pickiness when it comes to books and would love some recommendations for novels based on things I have read and liked. General preferences (but not rules) include: books written in the third person, books following multiple different characters/storylines, magical realism, nature themes, dry and/or absurd humor, and especially books with really crazy and off-the-wall shit happening (mostly in terms of plot, but style and form are cool too). Bonus points for transgender and gay themes but those don&#39;t matter much.</p> <p>Mostly I care about the quality of the writing rather than specific plot elements, though. I have a hard time describing what specifically I like, but hopefully the list will give you a sense.</p> <p>all the books I have loved that I&#39;ve read in 2024 and 2025 so far:</p> <ul> <li><em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> and <em>Love in the Time of Cholera</em> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez </li",

At the moment I\u2019ve only really been reading autobiographies, but I want some fun and magic. I love Harry Potter and Percy Jackson but that\u2019s about it. I don\u2019t like the real modern fantasy books like the powerless trilogy or once upon a broken heart, nothing like that. I would love some book recs!! Preferably ones that aren\u2019t set in this decade? Also nothing set before the 20th century. I love Stephen king and anything with strong friendships like the outsiders- se Hinton and the body- Stephen king. Or anything that has really good plot twists! Nothing too cheesy, romance is ok but it can\u2019t be the central theme, and nothing really spicy. My favourite books are The Shining, The Outsiders, Storyteller by Dave Grohl (idk if that helps) and the Godfather. Sorry if I sound picky, but hopefully you guys can help me out!! I\u2019m sure there\u2019s so",
