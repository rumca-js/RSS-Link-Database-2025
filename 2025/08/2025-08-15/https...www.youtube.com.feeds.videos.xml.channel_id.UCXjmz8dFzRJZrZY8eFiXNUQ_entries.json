        "description": "The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are one of the most beloved entertainment franchises in the world\u2014spanning comic books, hit animated series, blockbuster movies, and toys that defined childhoods. But in the late \u201990s, the franchise made one of its strangest moves ever: introducing a fifth, female turtle named Venus de Milo in the live-action TV show TMNT: The Next Mutation.\n\nIntended to expand the lore and appeal of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to new audiences, the move left many fans scratching their heads\u2014and wondering why it was necessary at all. The result? A bizarre and often-forgotten chapter in TMNT history that many would rather pretend never happened.\n\n#tmnt #teenagemutantninjaturtle #tmntfan #nerdstalgic",
