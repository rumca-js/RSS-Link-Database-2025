I passed the workers on strike outside the Stratford site this evening and they filled me in a bit on what is going on. They are asking for fixed-hour contracts, proper rotas, paid on-site training and a few other things. Management will not even negotiate with them - they even shut up shop this evening to avoid engaging with the workers! Draughts is a cool place, but if you have been there you will know that the staff there really make the place, so it really sucks that they are treated so badly. Anyway, wanted to flag here so that others are aware of what is happening. Maybe we could write to management there and tell them to meet with staff?

How do you score 15 points with (probably unrelated) high value cards, before the engine builders catch up with you?</p> <p>My experience is that high value cards are a great way to jump out to a quick lead.

Also you have the option to make the game longer or shorter, but i feel the longer game is better. There are many things i can go into detail but i want to keep short and sweet. We played at 3 player count and took us about 1:30 to 2 hours. First game with trying to understand and getting in the flow took us about 3 hours.

From what I remember, it was essentially 2 player (1v1) and each person was trying to guess the \u201cshape\u201d that the other person had on their side, based on clues of how their \u201cguess\u201d bounced off the shape. It\u2019s not battleship, but I had thought it was sort of similar (just a casual game player, don\u2019t come for me LOL). The exact details are a little fuzzy so it might not be a 100% accurate description but any guesses are better than my random Google searches. Would anyone happen to know this game?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Quiet_Rhubarb_7470\"> /u/Quiet_Rhubarb_7470 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mqk0yo/need_help_finding_a_game_i_saw_in_a_video_once/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mqk0yo/need_help_fin",

However, located in Belgium, I can&#39;t seem to locate the Commodities expansion in English <em>at all</em>. It&#39;s sold out almost everywhere, expect if I ship it from pretty far away abroad, and then things get expensive fast. All I can find is the German version &quot;Rohstoffe&quot;...</p> <p>I was wondering if the components have language on them, or only iconogrophy. If it&#39;s only the rulebook that&#39;s in German and the components are language-independant, that&#39;s fine by me. I don&#39;t want non-english language on my boards/pieces though. Does anyone own this? I couldn&#39;t find much info on BGG. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kildash\"> /u/Kildash </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mqhuew/is_the_qe",
