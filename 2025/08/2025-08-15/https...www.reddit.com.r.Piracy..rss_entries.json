They look EXTREMELY good to bo honest.</p> <p>Howevere, I also downloaded some 4K movies at 40 or even 30 bitrate (~30 gb) and some 1080p at around 20 mpbs and they also look too good for me.</p> <p>I was comparing a hunger game movie with 40 bitrate to amazon prime video (basic subscription, no 4k) and the difference is huge in colors and details. You can say this about almost every movie you stream against a non too compressed download.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t downloaded a remux version for the hunger game movie yet, but given how good the 40 bitrate version looks like I think won&#39;t.</p> <p>So what&#39;s your opinion on this? I know most people don&#39;t care about quality but I do, and I know some people with good tvs also want to make real use of them. So, to that type of people, do you see a difference between 4k 40 mbps and 4k 80 mbps (or original bluray)?.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --",

It\u2019s scheduled to arrive today but I want to get insights here first, i will also check the specs of that box and if it\u2019s not legit as described I will return it anyways, it\u2019s just my smart tv runs on Vidaa OS and only have few app options. Just the usual Netflix, Disney Plus, Prime and HBO Max.</p> <p>I was also considering VPN which I think only works on google based smart tv and boxes.
