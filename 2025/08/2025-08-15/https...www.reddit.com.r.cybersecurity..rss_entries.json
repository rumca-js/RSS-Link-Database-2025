        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, all. I am a cyber security student with a strong focus and desire on Blue. I am trying to investigate an edge server from a real attack and report my findings. My system is secure as much as I understand (using double VPNs for host and Kali VM, IPv6 disabled, Kill Switches, different VPN countries, etc.). </p> <p>I have done passive reconnaissance but now I have reached the point where an Active one is needed, albeit a very simple one: an HTTP header request on the Cloudflare edge server of the attackers. I know it&#39;s safe to do it in many ways, but I am getting cold feet because I am a total newbie and this is a live target, not a sim. </p> <p>Is it safe to do so? Is there any way the attackers will be alerted (via logs maybe?). I need the CF-Ray data to complete my investigation and the only way to get it is to do this. </p> <p>Thanks all. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Avalastrius\"> /u",
