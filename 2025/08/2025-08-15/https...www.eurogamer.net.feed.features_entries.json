Indeed Hasbro, the owner of Wizards, has <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry\">talked quite openly about wanting a successor</a> before, which is why it's no surprise to hear Wizards president John Hight <a href=\"https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/wizards-of-the-coast-will-bet-on\">tell The Game Business</a> just the other day that, \"<a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate\">Baldur's Gate</a> [3] is an incredible game, and of course we're going t",

The creator of Steam sensation Bongo Cat, Marcel Zurawka, is taking a new idle typing game to <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024\">Gamescom</a> as he searches for a publisher for it. He won't tell me what it is yet when we talk on Discord, because he only has a small build to show publishers, he says, and is a month or two from revealing more. But if Zurawka can leverage even a fraction of Bongo Cat's audience to play the new game, it could be huge.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/bongo-cat-cracks-bot-problem-as-inspired-multiplayer-mode-arrives-and-creator-takes-new-idea-to-gamescom\">Read more</a></p>",
