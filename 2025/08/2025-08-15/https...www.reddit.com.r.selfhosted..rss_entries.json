        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve finally decided to set up proper access control and auth for my home lab services so I can share them with friends and family and have granular control over access and a single point of identity for the users. When looking at options, I&#39;ve stumbled upon Pomerium Core (open-source self-hosted version). It&#39;s not discussed too much, and most of the OAuth/OIDC documentation for services gives examples mainly for Authentik and Authelia.</p> <p>But after setting this up, replacing my old Traefik without any auth with Pomerium + PocketId (as OIDC), I must say this is a fantastic and comfy setup. Setting up OAuth authentication is business as usual with PocketID for the apps, but it really shines when you can also do an auth proxy (e.g. for Forgejo) where the proxy headers are treated as logged in session (so no additional redirect from OAuth).
