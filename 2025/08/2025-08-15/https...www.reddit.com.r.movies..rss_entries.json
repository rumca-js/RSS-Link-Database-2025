I&#39;ve seen a lot of negative feedback for that film and just wondering how yall felt about it? I went and saw it twice in a weekend when it came out and its the most fun I&#39;ve had in theater in like 2 decades. The way they went back to horror rather than an action film is probably what instantly earned my approval. While I realize its not a piece of art in the way something like there will be blood is, its still wildly fun which in my opinion is something that has been missing from movies for a long time now (with exceptions of course). Hell, its been a few months now and i still will just randomly smile thinking about a new <em>good</em> alien movie as I enter my 40s lol. Almost makes me emotional haha. Its just the coolest monster design by a country mile for me. The show is a little disjointed but I <em>love</em> how animalistic the xeno mov",

Specifically, the idea of two Mickeys existing at the same time due to an error. That would have been a great movie! Instead, what was advertised as the main concept feels like a subplot in the movie. Essentially the entire thing revolves around the intelligent aliens. And then there was also the plot with Mark Ruffalo being an obvious stand in for Trump. But then there was also the subplot with Steven Yuen.</p> <p>I finished the movie feeling incredibly confused, because how did they mess up the initial concept like this? The idea of a guy who is constantly sent on deadly missions and is revived is an absolutely golden idea. It also leads to an interesting discussion about consciousness and if a copy of you is still really you. But that\u2019s barely even brought up.
