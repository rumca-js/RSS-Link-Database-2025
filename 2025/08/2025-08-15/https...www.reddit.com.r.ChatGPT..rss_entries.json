While the framing of the 4o v 5 debate has been reduced to people who want a cuddly bot friend v real users - the underlying issue isn\u2019t actually that. </p> <p>What people who liked 4o are really saying is they want a model that thinks <em>with</em> them and not <em>at</em> them and that has contextual intelligence and strategic depth. </p> <p>A one size fits all \u201cwarmth\u201d addition is going to please no one because it <em>doesn\u2019t actually target what the real issue is</em> and so feels insulting. It pisses off people who want a 4o type model and it pisses off people who prefer their AI to just be a tool without having to worry about stuff like \u2018personality\u2019. </p> <p>Really going forward they need to either just give users choice over the type of model they want to interact with or have an upgraded 4o type model but with the ability to easily tweak to suit preferences. </p> <",

It is harmful to shame &amp; judge people for using AI for companionship or even treating it like a friend. I think it\u2019s very cruel how people are being treated, even in cases where it has clearly become a problem in their lives.

It was doing an &quot;okay-ish&quot; job at first (still not as good as 4o) but then spiraled down like really fast.</p> <p>Basically, the context of the scene was that one of the characters (Donovan) had a sprained ankle and was bed-ridden. It forgot about that after like 3-4 messages and kept messing things up again and again and again when I tried to correct it... and mind you, that was a completely new chat!!! \ud83d\ude2d</p> <p>It also has a habit to repeat sentences that were said before (e.g., character saying &quot;shut the hell up!&quot; two messages in a row",
