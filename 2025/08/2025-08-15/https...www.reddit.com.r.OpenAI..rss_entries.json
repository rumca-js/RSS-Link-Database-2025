The hype drove valuations through the roof, money poured in, and startups promised the future. Then the bubble burst, wiping out most of them while a few giants survived.</p> <p>AI today has that same mix of promise and overinflated expectations. Yes, it\u2019s powerful and transformative, but the market is treating every AI-linked company like it\u2019s the next big thing. We\u2019ve already seen some cracks like overpromising, underdelivering (most recently Sam Altman&#39;s overhype of GTP 5), and business models that depend more on investor hype than sustainable revenue.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zestyclose_Log5155\"> /u/Zestyclose_Log5155 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1mrd6pe/is_the_ai_boom_heading_for_a_dot_comstyle_bust/\">[link]</a></span> ",
