It doesn\u2019t disappear when you bury it.

Yet some of the loudest anti-LGBTQ voices today are people suppressing their own truth, projecting their shame onto others.</p> <p>Live authentically. Love who you\u2019re meant to love. Suppressi",

As a result ppl flirt with me, follow me to my car, and get really mad when I reject them. Some of them also continue to pursue me even when I\u2019ve dropped hint after hint. Which is so awkward bec we have to work on the project all semester together. I\u2019m bisexual but I always have the urge to say I don\u2019t swing that way to guys so they leave me alone. So\u2026 I\u2019m wondering, is it appropriate for me to say that I\u2019m gay to these men so they leave me tf alone? I know lying is wrong but idgaf if it stops the harassment. My main concern is if this is disrespectful towards lgbtq community? The lgbtq goes through a lot with ppl pretending to be gay for clout, discrimination, hate crimes, the list goes on! So I want to make sure I don\u2019t harm the community. What do you think I should do? Any advice, thoughts, perspectives welcome. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
