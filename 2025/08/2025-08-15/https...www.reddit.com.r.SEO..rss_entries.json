One kicked off search console domain migration immediately after the change, the other didn\u2019t have search console set up until almost 2 months after the change. </p> <p>I know domain changes are a potentially risky venture but these two websites have lost even branded keyword rankings.

In the past, the vast majority of page one for what my customers are looking for had real brick and mortar offices, with real street addresses, and humans that answered the phone and worked out problems. I paid them between $5-15 per customer lead and my salesperson converted around 3% of the leads, sometimes 3.5%. This is down to 1.9% now.
