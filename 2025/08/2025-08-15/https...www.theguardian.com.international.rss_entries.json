Customise this one by swapping the almonds for pistachios, and serving it with cherries or other seasonal fruit. Do seek out the anise seeds, though, because they add such a lovely pop of flavour. The praline can be made up to a week ahead and stored in an airtight container in the freezer, while the semifreddo itself will keep happily in the freezer for about a week.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/15/honey-and-almond-semifreddo-with-nectarines-recipe-helen-goh\">Continue reading...</a>",
