Were torrented assets, and I would make sure to upload at least 5x back.</p> <p>recently, and due to the nature of modern gaming, my focus has moved more towards software. Linux Mint, Libre office, and back to how it all begun with gaming, community created patches, servers etc for games long abandoned by their creators.</p> <p>Apologies for the slightly more &quot;out there&quot; question, and thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/0235\"> /u/0",
