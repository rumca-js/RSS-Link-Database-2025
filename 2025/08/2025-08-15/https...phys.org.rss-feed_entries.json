        "description": "Researchers at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge have demonstrated a new way to control radiation in the terahertz range\u2014an often-overlooked part of the electromagnetic spectrum\u2014with unprecedented dynamic range and speed. The findings could open the door to advanced technologies in communications, imaging, and sensing and mark major progress in the development of practical devices that operate in the terahertz range.",
