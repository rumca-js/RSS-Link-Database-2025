Free to play games so everyone can download or relatively cheap would be preferred.</p> <p>One of the games we have decided on is Smash Bros for switch and we&#39;re going to find as many controllers as possible to do local smash. FIFA is another we&#39;ll be playing but on 3 consoles with 4 people to each console.</p> <p>A lot of us are fans of shooters and battle royale so it would be great if we can find a game that allows private lobbies/servers we can all join on our respective system. Does Halo Infinite/Warzone/Apex or any of the other free to play games allow private lobbies?</p> <p>I know it&#39;s not a true LAN since we&#39;ll be playing online but at least we&#39;ll be in the same room :)</p>",

It&#39;s a classic, and is one of my favorite games of all-time as well as it being my favorite N64 title. I played the game so much that I almost know all the ins and outs. This game brought me joyful times. Rare Replay is the best way to play it.</p> <p>Although if you&#39;re more familiar with the original, you&#39;ll notice the differences it has. The manual aiming system being a pretty big one. It felt a bit awkward at first since I was more familiar with the original aiming, but once you get used to it it&#39;s pretty good. This was probably the only N64 title on Rare Replay to get the option to turn off inverted aiming as well as it getting a modern control scheme. It would be neat if they added the option to turn off the inverted camera control on the other N64 games in the collection such as Conker, as I heard that game has inverted camera controls.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3",
