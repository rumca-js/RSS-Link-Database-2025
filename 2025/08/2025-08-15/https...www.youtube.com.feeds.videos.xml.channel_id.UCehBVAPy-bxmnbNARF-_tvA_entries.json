        "description": "There\u2019s a new wave of predatory lenders on the market.\n\nThough \u201ccash-advance\" apps talk about fighting big banks, they make millions off of outrageous APR and hidden fees.\n\nSome borrowers are paying 4-figure interest rates \u2014 but these fintech companies still ask for a tip.\n-----\n\nMore Perfect Union is an Emmy-winning, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to build power for working people. Here\u2019s what that means: We report on the real struggles and challenges of the working class from a working-class perspective. We attempt to connect those problems to potential solutions. We report on the abuses and wrongdoing of corporate power. And we seek to hold accountable the ultra-rich who have too much power over America\u2019s political and economic systems.\n\n To support our independent journalism, subscribe, donate, and follow our other pages through the links below:\n- Help fund our reporting: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mpu-splash\n- Substack: https://substack.perfectunion.us/\n- TikTok: http",
