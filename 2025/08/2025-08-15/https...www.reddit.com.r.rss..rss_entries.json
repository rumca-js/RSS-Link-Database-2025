Lately, I\u2019ve been getting frustrated with the state of RSS apps and news sites: AI junk, paywalls, intrusive ads, \u201csubscribe to my newsletter!\u201d popups, and paid subscriptions that bundle in features you can\u2019t opt out of. Even apps I loved\u2014like Reeder\u2014have been marked \u201cclassic\u201d and replaced with subscription versions.</p> <p>So, I decided to build the app I wanted to use. What started as a side project turned into a year-long passion, and I recently released it on the App Store.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I wanted in an RSS app:</p> <ul> <li>Runs on all Apple platforms, not just iPhone</li> <li>Feels like a native Apple app</li> <li>No subscription</li> <li>Secure iCloud syncing with zero setup</li> <li>Blocklists for filtering unwanted topics</li> <li>Backups</li> <li>No lock-in (portable via .OPML)</li> <li>Tagging system</li> <li>Topic",

So I went back to RSS, but with a twist \u2014 I built <strong>A01ai</strong>, my own tool that:</p> <ul> <li>Lets me fully customize my feed so it\u2019s clean and distraction-free</li> <li>Pulls only from reliable, vetted sources</li> <li>Tracks things in real-time \u2014 whether it\u2019s news, stocks, or market changes</li> </ul> <p>It honestly feels like having my own private news wire again. No algorithms, no ads, no drama.</p> <p>If you\u2019re into RSS or clean feeds, feel free to try it for free.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xxxxfactor\"> /u/xxxxfactor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1mqxu45/built_my_rsspowered_feed_to_escape_the_noise/\">[link]</a></span> &",
