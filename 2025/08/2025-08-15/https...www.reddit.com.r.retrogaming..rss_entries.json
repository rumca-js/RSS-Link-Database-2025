Significantly more color and real stereo sound compared to the NES.

Incredible sound from that Sony sound chip, and the mode 7 scaling and rotation that was built-into the system at the hardware level allowed games like F-Zero to blow people away. More color than the Genesis and more simultaneous color than TG-16.</p> <p>In <strong>1992</strong>, the Sega CD came out, and obviously provided some amazing redbook audio that could accompany the game.
