Back when I bought it, it was amazing on Windows 10 \u2014 I could run AAA games smoothly.</p> <p>Now, after 3+ years, I\u2019ve upgraded to Windows 11 and my FPS has dropped a lot. Even games that used to run great now stutter or have lower performance. I\u2019ve already done the usual things \u2014 updated drivers, cleaned dust, repasted \u2014 but it still feels slower.</p> <p>I\u2019m wondering if switching to Linux could help improve my gaming FPS. I\u2019ve heard that distros like Pop!_OS or Nobara can be good for gaming, but I\u2019m not sure if they would actually give me better performance than Windows 11.</p> <p>Has anyone here made a similar switch?

Recently, I switched to Linux (specifically Pop!_OS) and was wondering if there\u2019s a way to run MTGO on it. </p> <p>I thought about using Steam\u2019s compatibility layer, adding the .exe as a non-Steam game and enabling Proton in the Steam properties.

When I run the game, I get a nag screen about an Xbox controller being recommended and that I should press Start. I press Enter and it lets me through to the main menu, so clearly keyboard is detected.**However**, I can&#39;t move the cursor with keyboard to select another menu item, or even press Enter to start the game! I don&#39;t know how to fix this. I tried looking for odd messages in the text console where I type the command to run the game, but there&#39;s nothing keyboard-related.</p> <p>I know I could work around this by downloading a Windows installer and then playing the game through wine, but now after finishing everything in Escape Goat except for Heart of Insanity, I&#39;m annoyed.
