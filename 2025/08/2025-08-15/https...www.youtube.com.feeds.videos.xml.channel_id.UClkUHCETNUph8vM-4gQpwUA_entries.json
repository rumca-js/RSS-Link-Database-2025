        "description": "Nightreign Everdark Sovereign LIBRA Creature of Night UPDATE & GAMEPLAY, TIPS & New GEAR\nIn this Elden Ring Nightreign video, we're going to be talking a little bit about the Everdark Sovereign Libra Boss fight. I just finished this today. I spent quite a bit of time yesterday on it. This fight probably took me 12-15  attempts or something like that. We had a lot of very close attempts in there. There were ones we had to down 10%, 5%. But this is by far the hardest boss fight that exists currently.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign Wiki: https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Nightreign+Wiki\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Everdark Sovereign Event\n0:34 New Relic\n1:20 Libra Creature of Night Everdark Sovereign Event\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fextralife\nVisit our wikis: https://www.wiki.fextralife.com/\nCheck out our blog: https://fextralife.com/\nV",
