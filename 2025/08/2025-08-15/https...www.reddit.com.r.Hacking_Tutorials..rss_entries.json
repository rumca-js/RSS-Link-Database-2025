It\u2019s just a chance to get hands-on with real tools and see how ethical hacking works in practice. Maybe you might want to join us in the future, who knows :)</p> <p>We also have structured courses for those who want a step-by-step learning path, but honestly, if you\u2019re just curious, start with the free stuff. It\u2019ll give you a solid foundation and help you decide if this is for you.</p> <p>If anyone\u2019s interested, I can share the link to our next bootcamp.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#",

Having these tools are rare as they normally get removed from the laptops but some slip through the cracks and make it easier for us MV enthusiasts to work on our trucks.</p> <p>I would like to preserve these tools but after attempting to image the drive I found that it is encrypted using bitlocker and the key code is a 48 digit. From my research these are almost impossible to crack. </p> <p>The cf-31 is powered by windows 10, there are 2 users. One I have the password to, it\u2019s just a normal user account. But the other windows user is an admin account that I suspect may allow me a little more freedom with the folders. Any suggestions on getting through to the admin account?
