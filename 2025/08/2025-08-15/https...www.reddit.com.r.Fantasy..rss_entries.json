Not only are there so many characters that grow in such fantastic and believable ways, but there are also so many little details from all throughout the series that have such good payoffs later on - and that 100% has to be due to the good planning the author did. I love it when series do this - Janny Wurts&#39; Wars of Light and Shadow is another series that does this, on a much grander scale, although it&#39;s also a much more challenging read than Riyria is.</p> <p>Granted, the writing of Riyria isn&#39;t always the best - it&#39;s the author&#39;s first published bit of work, and it definitely shows at times - but it&#39;s still such a quick and fun read regardless IMO.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GamerGeek923\">",
