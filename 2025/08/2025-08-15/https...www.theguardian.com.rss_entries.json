It\u2019s also proof, if proof were needed, that no teacher in the world can be as cruel and abusive as a music teacher. We have already seen JK Simmons\u2019 terrifying jazz instructor in Damien Chazelle\u2019s Whiplash and Isabelle Huppert\u2019s keyboard monster in Michael Haneke\u2019s The Piano Teacher; now there is Slovenian actor and musician Sa\u0161a Tabakovi\u0107 playing a demanding, yet insidious choirmaster in charge of a group of talented, vulnerable teenage girls.

Our intrepid tester tries unexpected options, from pickled onion to tzatziki</p><p>Generally speaking, the more TikTok trends you allow to pass you by in a year, the better. But some trends refuse to cease, and the egg flight is turning out to be one of them. The egg flight, in all its many forms, persists.</p><p>Simply put, an egg flight is to hard-boiled eggs what a wine flight is to wine \u2013 a varietal sampling, presented in one sitting. Unlike devilled eggs, where the yolk is scooped out, mashed with mayonnaise and spices and piped back into its former cavity, the egg flight is just some eggs \u2013 most commonly three, in six upturned halves \u2013 with different stuff piled on top. The result is meant to be a quick but still fancy appetiser range, destined to impress your guests, your family, or at least the rest of TikTok.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/15/the-egg-flight-trend",

Every decision relating to her career has been dissected and debated. The most banal details surrounding her personal life have been transfigured into headline news. In order to find herself on and off the tennis court, Raducanu has had to learn how to tune out the noise, which at times can be deafening.</p><p>Only one month ago at Wimbledon, the discourse surrounding the 22-year-old reached diabolical lows. Even though her on-court performances were strong, it was impossible to escape the speculation surrounding her personal life. In the bowels of center court at the Cincinnati Open, I offer my own blunt perspective: I have never cringed as much as I did while watching people trying to pry into her romantic relationships at the All England Club. \u201cYeah, and Cam\u2019s questions, too,\u201d Raducanu re",

Duncan finally has one night of passion with Carrie Bradshaw and the shows [sic] over \u2026 FOREVER???\u201d)</p><p>In any case, the fact that anyone cared at all showed that we had come a long way.
