But how do I know what 50\u00b0 fov is like? The window (rectangle) that would fit in the screen (circle/rectangle for some ar glasses) Can tell us what the fov is at least like for the window! The window would fill out all space until the edges are cut off. Therefore we would need to know how big the brain would perceive 143\u201c at (in this example like the xreal one) 4 meters. Since we\u2019re not likely to have 143\u201c TV at home, we can just use a laptop and decrease the distance! Because how big we perceive somethingHas of course to do something with the size BUT ALSO HOW FAR AWAY IT IS FROM THE POV! </p> <p>Break down: We want to know what the fov is circa by knowing what sized window would fit in (also if the displays are round, there will be space left since the window is a rectangle) So we take something that isn\u2019t 143\u201c big but also not 4 meters away.
