        "description": "Aside from its controls and core mechanics, Herdling isn't the most unorthodox adventure experience. The puzzles are far from head-scratchers, and the level design, well-paced and nuanced as it can be, is pretty straightforward. \n\nNevertheless, as part mood piece, part atmospheric mystery and part animal bonding simulator, its presentation and emotions come together in a memorable package. It certainly won't demand too much of your time, but it feels like the appropriate length for what's offered. As much as it differs from FAR, especially in its lack of survival elements or machine management, Herdling carries a certain charm that's unique to Okamotive, and makes an experience that's equal parts calming and emotionally harrowing.",

        "description": "We dive into all the juicy details in the latest Resident Evil Requiem showcase from Gamescom 2025, and try to guess where this entry is taking the story this time around. We also look at how the new title's gameplay is both thrilling and terrifying in equal measures, a balance that's achieved through the RE Engine's excellent use of light and darkness and through the eyes of Grace's clumsy attempts to flee for safety from a familiar enemy type.\n\nThere's a lot to unpack and look forward to here, and we recommend checking out both the story trailer and gameplay showcase before you dive in. But if you're impatient, perhaps this video can help you watch them with more information at your disposal. Either way, join us as we break things down with excitement, glee, and a fair bit of apprehension considering the sheer terror of it all.\n\nStalker image credit: Instagram user: kendogunsop",

        "description": "It isn't a question of whether Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater can offer as accurate a facsimile of Metal Gear Solid 3 as possible, to please fans, shareholders, the creatives, or even Kojima himself. It's more a matter of whether Konami can live up to Kojima's legacy \u2013 and in turn, the legacy of the franchise itself \u2013 by giving it the respect it deserves.\n\nPerhaps this is a matter that's inseparable from the quality of the remake for many fans, and maybe it will be irrelevant if it turns out to be excellent. And yet, how much of that could be on its own merits when it's so heavily leaning on the past while the higher-ups deny such a hefty part of it? We'll find out when Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on August 28th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.",
