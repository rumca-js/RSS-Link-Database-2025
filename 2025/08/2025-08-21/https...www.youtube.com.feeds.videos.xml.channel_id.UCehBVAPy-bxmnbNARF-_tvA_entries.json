        "description": "Rail lobbyists representing giants like Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern want to automate track inspections.\nWhy? It would bring rail carriers more profits.\nCritics warn this would undermine safety\u2014or even cause a repeat of what happened in East Palestine.\n-----\n\nMore Perfect Union is an Emmy-winning, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to build power for working people.

We report on the abuses and wrongdoing of corporate power. And we seek to hold accountable the ultra-rich who have too much power over America\u2019s political and economic systems.\n\n To support our independent journalism, subscribe, donate, and follow our other pages through the links below:\n- Help fund our reporting: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mpu-splash\n- Substack: https://substack.perfectunion.us/\n- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.",
