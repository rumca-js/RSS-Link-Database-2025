        "description": "A parole board in California is considering the cases of Erik and Lyle Menendez, the brothers who were convicted almost 30 years ago for the murder of their parents.\n\nThe notorious case has received international interest since the brothers\u2019 story was made into a TV drama.  Their lawyers argue that the killings followed years of sexual and mental abuse by their parents, a claim that continues to divide public opinion.   The prosecution argued that the motive for the killings was money. \n\nThe brothers were sentenced to life imprisonment without parole at the time of their trial.   However earlier this year a judge reduced the sentences, allowing the brothers to now be considered for early release.   Califiornia\u2019s parole board must decide whether they pose a risk to the public. \n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Peter Bowes in Los Angeles. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
