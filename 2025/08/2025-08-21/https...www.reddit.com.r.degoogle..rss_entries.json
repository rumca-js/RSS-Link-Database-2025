Also what other degoogling tools can i use already without changing OS, like how to get rid of google play and stuff. Also pixel 10 is eSIM only? how much tracking will they do with eSIM only ?</p> <p>If it doesnt work out then ill just swap with a pixel 9 pro after some months</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/11thwasted\"> /u/11thwasted </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1mvy4t6/grapheneos_on_pixel_10/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comme",

You will find gatekeepers in any community, extremists who probably started out normal but have become lost and have no sympathy or understanding about other peoples&#39; situations.</p> <p>I have realized from people who make helpful posts on here that are more nuanced that this is a marathon, not a sprint. If you don&#39;t pace yourself, you will burnout. You will have to find a balance based on your threat model, your financial situation and your technical expertise.

Two important criteria are that we need to cater the pitch to our audience (a bunch of university students), and we need a CLEAR call to action. I&#39;m really struggling with my call to action. I would like to say &#39;delete your google account&#39; but these days it seems like that doesn&#39;t really do anything... and is asking for a lot from people that don&#39;t really care about this topic. Perhaps it should just be to &#39;cancel your Google subscriptions&#39;? I&#39;d appreciate any help. I think the best CALL TO ACTION may have to encourage people to push their governments for more regulation. My other idea was pitching that they should cancel their Spotify subscriptions considering what the CEO has been up to recently.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Inner_Foundation",
