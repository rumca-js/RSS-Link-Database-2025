I read so many reviews praising the colors on the Pimax Crystal Light, how they&#39;re close to OLED. 70% there, one person said. I&#39;d say the colors are not that great. It was a little better than the G2 but not by much. I&#39;d say it&#39;s 30% to OLED. I adjusted the ini file to .01 dimming. I put the contrast up. Didn&#39;t really impress at all. Dark was still grey. From now on I&#39;ll only buy OLED. Before purchasing I took all the youtube reviewer praise with a grain of salt because I was burned by the G2 twice. Once on the G2 rev 1 and once on the G2 rev 2, which was supposed to have better colors. I thought the G2 was garbage with no presence. MRTV seems to always be blown away by every headset.</p> <p>The crystal gets closer to presence but is still way off. Still looks like looking at a decent LCD.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Using a well known VR mod for RDR2 again. Using swapped DLSS and it is amazing. Just amazing how well this works. BUT I have a playability issue. I am using the Window size change option in the VR mod options screen. This works great BUT my IRL screen is an ultrawide so I only have a 1440P vertical res. The optimal VR Window is around the 2700x2700 size which extends the game window beyond the IRL screen height which stops me being able to use mouse to select options off the visible screen as the mouse stops at the IRL screen edge. Is there a trick where I could use some setting to keep the render resolution of 2700 but scale the window on screen to fit inside of the 1440 vert res limit? Or maybe some kind of render the game window only in a virtual space? If not I could try and use a game controller to play the game but not preferred as the KBM is fav.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Thought_Coff",
