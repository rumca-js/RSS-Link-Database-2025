Of course there is still academia work, but with much smaller budgets and the promising researchers are bought off by corporations to work &quot;secretly&quot; for them. I think in the long run it might actually slow things down and the resulting systems will be more market-oriented and not cool, diverse set of tools made by passionate people that can freely analyse each other&#39;s work and come up with solutions to current problems.
