Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension in",

The Sophon SG2044 is SOPHGO&#39;s next generation 64-core high performance CPU that has been designed for workstation and server grade workloads. Building upon the SG2042, subsystems that were a bottleneck in the previous generation have been upgraded.<br/> In this paper we undertake the first performance study of the SG2044 for HPC. Comparing against the SG2042 and other architectures, we find that the SG2044 is most advantageous when running at higher core counts, delivering up to 4.91 greater performance than the SG2042 over 64-cores. Two of the most important upgrades in the SG2044 are support for RVV v1.0 and an enhanced memory subsystem. This results in the SG2044 significantly closing the performance gap with other architectures, especially for ",
