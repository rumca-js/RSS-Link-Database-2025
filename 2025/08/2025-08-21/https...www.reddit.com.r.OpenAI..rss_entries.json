        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I\u2019ve been having issues where SORA tells me I can only do one generation at a time, even though I should be able to do two. Fine, no big deal. But now it won\u2019t even let me run a single generation, even when there are no others in progress. I\u2019ve tried refreshing to see if there\u2019s a \u201csilent\u201d generation running in the background, but if there is, I can\u2019t see it. (For context, I\u2019m on Firefox.)</p> <p>I\u2019ll try again later, but honestly, why is the UI so meh? Why do I have to refresh just to check if my images are finished? Why can\u2019t we have consistent generation limits, or at least a courtesy message when load is high? And most importantly: why can\u2019t we have a queue? I mean the main UI functionality is pretty good except for the queue. Maybe make it a paid feature for the $20 and above tiers, and of course rate limit it to something sane but not cheap and scammy please. Just don&#39;t make me babysit! </p> <p>A queue would solve most of these problems. ",
