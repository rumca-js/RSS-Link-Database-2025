Recently I started seeing new people but not to get into a relationship again due to moving and because it\u2019s too soon for myself.</p> <p>BUT here\u2019s my issue.. I am overthinking the concept of love, what it means and especially the differences between liking, crushing and loving. I personally often have the problem that I can catch feelings quite fast so I find it hard to understand right now what it truly is. I would be glad if some of you could recommend some books dealing with those topics, also surrounding these issues in modern dating maybe also relating to feminist topics!

I want to get into romance fiction after limiting myself to thriller and noir. 23M with a strong academic interest in warfare, intelligence and organized crime.</p> <p>I would love to read books about a young man with low confidence that finds the drive to grow out of his comfort zone for love. Even better if he steps out of comfort zone to protect the woman he loves from some sketchy business (crime, espionage, blackmail). Even better if the woman is actually out of his league. I do not know if there is a trope for this dynamic.</p> <p>Book examples are The Crash by Michel Bussi and Bel Canto by Ann Patchett. Movie example is Come and Find Me (2016) which is actually similar to the point of uncanny.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Scholarsandquestions\"> /u/Scholarsandquestions </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mwkuyp/book_request_a_",

Give me your best holiday fiction recommendations! </p> <p>Ideally something exciting and you couldn\u2019t put down (e.g. Project Hail Mary was amazing) - could be thrillers and mysteries including cosy mysteries as well as crime mysteries, or could also be a book that is life assuring or restoring faith in humanity or increasing curiosity and fun in life and people (Tuesdays with Morrie was incredible for example). I am generally open to all genres actually, except for trashy romance perhaps (a good romance is also ok!). </p> <p>I am eyeing the Silent Patient but would probably get more books for the two weeks I am there.

J. Tudor. I also read Manga and I loved Death Note, Hellsing and Monster.</p> <p>But my current favourite book is The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.</p> <p>Also I have a compilation of the works from H.P.
