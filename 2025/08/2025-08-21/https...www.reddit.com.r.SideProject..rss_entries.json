I wanted to share a quick story from my garage-level hustle that might resonate with some of you.</p> <p>I was assisting a SaaS founder who was conducting about 10 live demos each day. While this was great for obtaining feedback, it was also incredibly exhausting. There was no time for strategy, and honestly, this approach wasn&#39;t scalable.</p> <p>We decided to run a small experiment: we created a 60-second \u201calways-on\u201d demo video that:</p> <ul> <li>Opens with a strong question: \u201cIs X draining your day?\u201d</li> <li>Shows the product in action with real UI and no fluff</li> <li>Concludes with: \u201cWant a deeper demo? Let\u2019s book it.\u201d</li> </ul> <p>Just two weeks later, we saw significant changes: - Live demos dropped to 2 per day. - The people who were still booking were far more serious, resulting in much better quality leads. - The founder actually found time to breathe and focus on building again.</p> <p>I",

It supports various case formats, including UPPERCASE, lowercase, Title Case, and more.</p> <p>Unlike some online tools or browser extensions, CaseCon operates natively within the Windows environment, offering faster and more seamless functionality without the need for an internet connection.</p> <p>Check it out here: <a href=\"https://github.com/kevin-bossa/CaseCon\">https://github.com/kevin-bossa/CaseCon</a></p> <p>Looking forward to your feedback! \ud83d\ude4c</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",
