After being impressed by the capabilities of Fluke's precision acoustic imager, Adam points its 64-microphone array at several vessels in the workshop that he knows has leaks. Using Fluke's Sound Beacon device, we're able to visualize and identify the specific location of those leaks without having to fill those vessels with water or other fluids!\n\nFluke ii915 Precision Acoustic Imager: https://bit.ly/44eUHVi\nFluke SB140 Sound Beacon: https://www.fluke.com/en-us/product/industrial-imaging/fluke-sb140\nAdam's experiments with acoustic imaging: https://youtu.be/UPVcwDzhBZ8\n\nShot and edited by Josh Self\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit b",
