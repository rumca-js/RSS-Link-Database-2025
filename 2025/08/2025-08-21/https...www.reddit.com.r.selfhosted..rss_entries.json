Tools like FaceSeek are super useful when you want to quickly find where a face appears across different photos or online, but the part that makes me nervous is always having to upload images to someone else\u2019s servers.</p> <p>What I\u2019d love is something that works locally, maybe integrated with my own photo collection, so I can run searches without worrying about data being logged or shared. It feels like a lot of us here already self-host for control and privacy, so I wonder if anyone has tried setting up a self-hosted version of a face search engine.</p> <p>Is it even realistic right now, or is cloud-based stuff like FaceSeek still the only practical option for most people? Would love to hear if anyone has tinkered with this or found a way to balance privacy with the convenience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",

I do not care about latency. I plan to do weekly full backup (currently 1tb, expected to grow at 8-10% anually). In case of a mishap, if i get back my data in a week&#39;s time i am good.

It&#39;s an API gateway for Windows Server (also available as a Docker image) that can expose legacy applications and/or SQL Server objects as REST APIs.</p> <p>I know Windows Server isn&#39;t the most popular choice here, but there are still plenty of setups where someone needs to expose a legacy application (without a secure API) to the internet. That\u2019s where Portway comes in, it can proxy requests to internal services and make them accessible in a secure and modern way.</p> <p>If you&#39;ve got legacy software or SQL Server data locked away and need API access to it, Portway does the heavy lifting. Just point it at your database, drop in some JSON config files, and it&#39;ll generate a full OData REST API with CRUD operations, filtering, etc. No changes to your database required.</p> <p><strong>Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Runs on Windows Serve",
