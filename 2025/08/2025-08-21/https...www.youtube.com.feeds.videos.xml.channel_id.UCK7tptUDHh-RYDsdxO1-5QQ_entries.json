        "description": "The U.S. timeshare industry has consolidated behind a few major brands: Hilton Grand Vacations, Marriott Vacations Worldwide and Travel + Leisure. The industry has evolved significantly from its notoriously scammy origins, having much higher standards and using more flexible points-based systems. Executives say the bait-and-switch days are behind timeshares and have rebranded them as \u201cvacation clubs,\u201d offering a wide range of accommodations and experiences. But there are still issues and scams to look out for when getting into a timeshare. WSJ explores how timeshares became a $35.7 billion dollar industry, how they work and how issues still persist in the industry. \n\n#Travel #Timeshare #Shorts",
