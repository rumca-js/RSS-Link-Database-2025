Nope, it\u2019s the fact that it <em>isn\u2019t </em>an Xbox, it\u2019s a Windows 11 PC, albeit a teeny-tiny one. And with Microsoft onboard, it\u2019s packing a refreshed, streamlined build of Windows that\u2019s all about gaming. Asus says that the updated interface is coming to the older ROG Ally and Ally X handhelds, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t all that shocking \u2014 Microsoft itself confirmed that the new interface is coming to other Windows-based handheld gaming PCs, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2807732/the-rog-xbox-ally-is-ashamed-of-windows.html\">starting in 2026</a>.

Most new-to-the-market smart lighting controls do their best to not <em>look</em> like smart lighting controls. This is typically accomplished by limiting the number of buttons on the device, making it less intimidating to the user and eliminating confusion as to which button performs which function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Festooned with no fewer than <em>five</em> buttons, two of which can be programmed, the Cync Keypad Dimmer makes Lutron\u2019s Cas\u00e9ta family of geeky smart dimmers look tame.

But a handful of people still avoid it, and usually it\u2019s because they think doing so will help keep their accounts safer. It won\u2019t.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that\u2019s not you, chances are that someone close to you believes this. And it\u2019s a problem. If the account owner doesn\u2019t set up and control online access, that leaves an opportunity for a hacker or scammer to do it instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty years ago, the offline approach made sense. Online security was frustratingly limited. (For example, bank passwords often set a length restriction of just ten characters\u2026and with unlimited tries for guessing.) Other barriers made sense for staying analog\u2014you could ban permission to online access or your financial institution may have required opening an online account",
