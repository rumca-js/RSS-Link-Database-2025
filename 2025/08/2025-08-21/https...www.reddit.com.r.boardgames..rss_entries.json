        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am confused about how battle works. The rulebook says that first, the attacker decides how to allocate any incoming damage from the defenders to his fielded forces, then the defender allocates incoming damage. Does that mean that in effect, if it\u2019s a \u201cnormal battle,\u201d the defenders attack first? When the attacker assigns incoming damage to his forces does he discard the wounded ones immediately so that he has to attack with less? Or can his wounded forces still send damage? If so, what\u2019s the point of having the attacker assign incoming damage first? Also, are all fielded forces, whether they received damage or not, discarded at the end of the battle?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pitiful-North-2781\"> /u/Pitiful-North-2781 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mwdls2/battle_in_ortus_regni/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgam",
