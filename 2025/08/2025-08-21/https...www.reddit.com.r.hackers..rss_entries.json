Im a 14 year old kid, and i have been getting cyberbullied for the last few days. I live in Turkey and theres a lot of &quot;Roadmen&quot; here. The story of how it started is i gave my friend an instagram acc of a girl, and her ex texted me. He threathened me, my friends, my family etc. He is still threathening me (sorry if i mistyped that) and my friends and family. He says he has some &quot;friends&quot; who can kill me whenever they want. I don&#39;t know what to do. And if anyone can hel p, in any way, i would really appreciate it. I can&#39;t take this anymore</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WhiteSubstancePowder\"> /u/WhiteSubstancePowder </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1mwou98/hello_dear_hackers_i_have_been_getting/\">[link]</a></",
