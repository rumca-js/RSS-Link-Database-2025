We talk endlessly about technical vulnerabilities, zero days, and patching, but what about the vulnerabilities within our teams? The silent, insidious threat of burnout.</p> <p>It&#39;s not glamorous, it doesn&#39;t have a CVE, and it&#39;s rarely discussed openly. But the consequences are real. Burnout leads to mistakes, decreased vigilance, and ultimately, weakened security posture. We&#39;re human beings; we can&#39;t operate at peak performance 24/7. We&#39;re susceptible to fatigue, stress, and emotional exhaustion.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen it firsthand: colleagues cracking under the pressure, making critical errors due to simple oversight. The constant pressure to respond to alerts, meet deadlines, and keep up with the ever-evolving threat landscape takes its toll. We&#39;re so focused on protecting our systems that we often forget to protect ourselv",

What features would be must-haves?</p> <p>Would love to hear honest opinions and stories. Sometimes these niche tools sound great in theory, but I want to understand if they\u2019d actually fill a gap or solve problems you face day-to-day.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts!<",
