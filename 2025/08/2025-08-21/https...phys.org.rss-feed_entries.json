The key to achieving selectivity tunability relies on the control of the pulsed-induced structural and chemical catalyst transformations. This research offers insights which could help to reduce CO2 emissions and produce renewable energy sources.",

Fruit flies are major economic and quarantine pests that impact fresh fruit production and impede international trade. Flies lay their eggs on fruits, making the infested fruit their host, resulting in millions of dollars in damage annually. For international trade, fruits must undergo quarantine treatment or other mitigation measures to control possible infestation by fruit flies and other high-risk pests.",
