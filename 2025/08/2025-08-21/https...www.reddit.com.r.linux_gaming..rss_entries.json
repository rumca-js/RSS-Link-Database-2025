I had this issue before on Pop!_OS and I could solve this by switching to Wayland. I tried it now as well, but sadly, I cannot change the keyboard layout on Wayland and there are other issues as well, such as Steam not opening. My PC has a Ryzen 5 5600 CPU and a RX 6750XT GPU.

My PC configuration is a Ryzen 5 5600G, 16GB Corsair DDR4 3200MHz RAM, no dedicated graphics card, and a 1600\u00d7900 monitor. As expected, I get low FPS in certain areas of <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. On Windows, Lossless Scaling was a big help\u2014it gave me around 60 FPS in most areas. Unfortunately, Lossless Scaling is Windows-only, and I can\u2019t run it with Wine since it can\u2019t interfere once Proton handles the display translation.</p> <p>I recently came across <em>Gamescope</em>, which seems to work similarly to Lossless Scaling, but I\u2019m not sure how to set it up or whether it can give me the same (or even better) results.</p> <p>For reference, I\u2019m using Arch Linux.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy_Duty1149\"> /u/Icy_Duty1149 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mw0paz/wuthering_waves_with_gamescope_can_it_match/\">[link]</a></span",

I have tried setting the libinput quirks to AttrScrollDiscrete=1, and ive tried changing settings with imwheel, and nothing works, It seems like source 2 is reading raw mouse inputs and interpreting the 10 or so +15 high_res outputs my mouse sends as multiple inputs.</p> <p>I also cant use the scroll wheel in any menus, settings for example, nothing happens when i scroll up or down.</p> <p>If i boot cs2 with a compatibility layer such as Proton Experimental, then it fixes the overshoot scroll issue, but now i am getting dropped scroll inputs. </p> <p>Does anybody have any idea how to fix this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zovek\"> /u/zovek </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"h",
