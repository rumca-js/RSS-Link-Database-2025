        "description": "I thought I'd spoken about this for the last time but then I caught Rick Beato's latest episode on my way to Norway. I cannot believe things have got this bad and that his whole channel is now at risk because of copyright strikes. I hope UMG can see what's at stake. Rick is unsurpassed on YouTube and he's supported me recently. What can we do to help? \n\nTo watch Rick's episode, click here: https://youtu.be/zBq_krhKbW4?si=40-wF1R30_up-0U1\n\nTo see this show - Justin Hawkins Rides Again - LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from me and JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #rickbeato",
