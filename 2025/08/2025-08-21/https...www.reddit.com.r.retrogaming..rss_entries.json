I know this market is also awash with copycats and intellectual theft, so I want to make sure that I\u2018m supporting the right people too, even if it\u2018s a bit more expensive. </p> <p>So what are the things I need to pay attention to when buying a hardware N64 HDMI mod? I\u2018m capable of soldering, so that\u2018s the direction I\u2018ll be going with. </p> <p>When looking on Ebay, most offers look like they\u2018re coming from the same original source, because it\u2019s the same set of items and screenshots. Is this correct? What original source would that be? Surely I can\u2019t just simply get one of those, with the board, cables, miniHDMI jack &amp; adapter from any seller, there is a difference, if not in hardware then in ethics, correct?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jate",
