Even those screenshots looks dull. In fact, SDR versions of the same movies actually look better than the HDR ones.</p> <p>Is this happening because:</p> <p>My video player isn\u2019t handling HDR correctly (I\u2019ve tried VLC, MX Player, etc.)?</p> <p>Or is there some setting in OnePlus that I\u2019m missing?</p> <p>Has anyone faced this on OnePlus devices or found a good solution (specific player/app/setting)?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sammisanni\"> /u/sammisanni </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht",

Anything and everything I could want to watch no matter what, at any time (unless the servers go down temporarily) and no VPN required. </p> <p>All that is great, but I wonder if there is anything better. I&#39;m always down to learn the new tech to have and any more ways I can save more money over time. I used to do Kodi plus add ons but that was sketchy, complicated, disorganized, and needed a VPN. Then I went to Plex shares and so far it&#39;s great but wondering if there&#39;s even something better.</p> <p>So my question is, is there something better out there where I can watch whatever I want whenever I want, no VPN required, unlimited amount of people I can share my account with, and generally below 30 dollars? Let me know, I&#39;m glad to do research with the right leads, thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",
