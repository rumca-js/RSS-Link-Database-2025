        "description": "In August, the FDA recalled Walmart\u2019s Great Value frozen shrimp in 13 states because it was potentially radioactive. The shellfish in question were farm-raised in Indonesia. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time imported shrimp has reached the US with unhealthy banned chemicals. In February, the FDA turned away shipments from India because of illegal levels of antibiotics. But despite cases of tainted crustaceans, 90% of the shrimp Americans eat is imported. That\u2019s because it\u2019s so cheap. And that low price tag has driven the cost of American wild-caught shrimp down with it, hurting Louisiana fishermen who\u2019ve spent decades catching it in the Gulf of Mexico. \n\nSo how does chemical-laced shrimp make it past the US border? And why did imported shrimp choke out wild-caught crustaceans to begin with? \n\n00:00 - Introduction\n1:11 - Shrimp Po\u2019 Boys\n4:14 - Shrimp Factory\n6:05 - History of Shrimp in Louisiana\n7:25 - The Rise of Imported Shrimp\n8:06 - Catching Shrimp with \u201cKnuckles\u201d\n11:08 - Shrimpers Strug",
