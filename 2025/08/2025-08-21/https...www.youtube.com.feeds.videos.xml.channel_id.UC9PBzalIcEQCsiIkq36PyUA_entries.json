Up until now, we weren't quite sure what to expect from this long-in-development title, but we've played it now on PC - and we like what we see. John and Rich explain what impressed them about the demo, how the gameplay works and what high-end features you can expect on PC (tested on RTX 5090). A bit of an update: we've now played the same content on PS5 Pro at Gamescom 2025 and can confirm 60fps and RT - this is looking very cool.\n\nGo here to check out DF merch! https://store.digitalfoundry.net\n\nSubscribe for more Digital Foundry: http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe\n\n00:00:00 Overview \n00:01:13 Gameplay \n00:05:36 Ray-traced GI and reflections \n00:06:24 Concluding thoughts",
