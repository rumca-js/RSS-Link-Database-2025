        "description": "Copper pipe repair leaks\u2026This leak was in a tight spot. I deburred the inside and outside of the pipe. Then I marked the depth and used a SharkBite Max 90-degree elbow. All the tubing was supported every 32 inches using a HoldRite telescoping bracket and universal clamp. Many thanks to SharkBite for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#plumbing #sharkbiteplumbing #homerenovation #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
