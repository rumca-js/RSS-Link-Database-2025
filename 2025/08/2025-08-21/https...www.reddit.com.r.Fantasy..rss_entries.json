But for me, there needs to be something new and interesting to put a spin on things, and the character work needs to be excellent. I don\u2019t feel that for this book.

I don&#39;t mind really at all if my fantasy has romance in it, but I don&#39;t want it to be the main <em>point</em> of the story. I don&#39;t like most romance tropes, I don&#39;t like formulaic writing or stock characters, and I think most writers are really bad at writing smut so spice just violently rips me out of the story (especially if the building-to-the-spice-scene is the primary plot between the characters).</p> <p>But nowadays, it feels like every fantasy book is obligated to sell itself as a romantasy, and it&#39;s getting a lot harder to find anything I&#39;m looking for.

I&#39;m excited to shre my thoughts on The Aspect Emperor series, which serves as the sequel to R. Scott Bakker&#39;s compelling Prince of Nothing trilogy. I finished the original trilogy last year and was captivated by its bleak yet incredibly deep world. Bakker has created a setting that rivals the greats of the fantasy genre, and it left me wondering, does this first book improve on what&#39;s come before? How does it compare to The Darkness That Comes Before? Let&#39;s dive in and find out! As always, I&#39;ll be sure to avoid any major spoilers, but please note that this review will touch on some aspects of the previous trilogy (nothing too major, just general information). I will also include a TLDR section at the end as well. </p> <blockquote> <p>A score of years have passed since the events narrated in The Prince of Nothing.

It strays from the premise of the other 7 books, and meanders through info dumping at a glacial rate. My hope is that the remaining plot points to be tied up are more in line with the first books in the series, and MAE plans to deliver the book with those in the near future.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kababalan\"> /u/Kababalan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mwdgne/the_stiger_chronicles/\">[link]</a></",

Intentionally ridiculous comedy of manners. Set in 1887 but with distinct Regency tendencies. Very fun if you enjoy this sort of thing. </p> <p>Heavy on the romance, light on the speculative details. Seriously, I would shelve this in the Romance section, not SFF. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even Romantasy, whatever that is. </p> <p>I&#39;m probably going to DNF the second book in the trilogy. It will be great reading when I&#39;m looking for light popcorn romance. Right now there are a bunch of other books I&#39;d rather be reading. To be clear, I enjoy romance. It&#39;s just not what I was looking for right now.</p> <p>Side note, this post is inspired by a lot of awesome people I just met at Worldcon, who encouraged me to stop lurking and maybe use some of my words. </p> <p><strong>Overall Rating: 2.79/5</strong> </p> <p>Plot: 2.5/5</p> <p>Pacing: 3/5</p> ",

Elle Kennedy, Liz tomforde, and Sarah Adam (the cheat sheet) are up there too. There\u2019s a whole lot of other standalone romance I\u2019ve read but aren\u2019t standing out right now.

I\u2019ve also been hooked on game of thrones (which I\u2019m still reading) and read the first dune book, so I know I can get into the political side of fantasy. </p> <p>I like smutty books, but the ones that I can\u2019t put down are smutty with a solid driving plot.
