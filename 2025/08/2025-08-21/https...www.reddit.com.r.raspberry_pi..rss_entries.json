Also is it possible to use any third party hdmi kvm switch or do I actually need the one from pikvm? If third party is okay, any brands you recommend for their reliability with a pikvm setup? Has anyone run such a setup and if so, was it reliable?

My pc is not in a good spot for wifi, but my raspi is, which is why im trying to share the connection. I initially followed this <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bridging-network-interfaces\">https://www.baeldung.com/linux/bridging-network-interfaces</a>, but it didnt end up working. So i tried <a href=\"https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=193770\">https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=193770</a> which also didnt work. So im doing a clean and fresh install of pi os lite. I know i need to do the update, get bridge-utils, and setup my adapter. What is the proper way to do this??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Earthbender2689\"> /u/Earthbender2689 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1mvzl4e/trying_to_create_a_bridge_with_wlan1_and_eth0",
