My new favorite is Read You (<a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.ash.reader/\">https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.ash.reader/</a>). What I like most about this app is that I can specify the font that looks best on my Samsung tablet. Regardless if the source had a font that I don&#39;t care for, it shows up as my preferred Roboto Slab font that I find most readable.</p> <p>One feature that I wish it had is the ability to alphabetically sort the feeds. The default of many rss readers seems to list them in the order they were subscribed to. I find this cumbersome when I want to go to a specific site to read. </p> <p>I have found a workaround that others might find helpful:</p> <ol> <li>Under Accounts I did &quot;Export as OPML&quot;.</li> <li>Load the &quot;Feeder - RSS Feed Reader&quot; extension on a desktop Edge browser.</li> <li>Under the Library tab click on &quot;Impo",

And Im quite happy with the results.</p> <p>For those who are looking for a rss reader but not looking to install an app, you can just go to:</p> <p><a href=\"https://feedable.doublememory.com/\">https://feedable.doublememory.com/</a></p> <p>Or if you already have a feed, you can simply append the url to it, like:</p> <blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://feedable.doublememory.com/%5Bhttps://feed-url.example.com%5D\">https://feedable.doublememory.com/[https://feed-url.example.com]</a></p> </blockquote> <p>If you&#39;d rather watch a demo than try it yourself, here: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ltFP-t9Jruc\">https://youtu.be/ltFP-t9Jruc</a></p>",
