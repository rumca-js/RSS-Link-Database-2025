There\u2019s a problem with that, though. Socialist Cuba sucks.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"rumble\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://rumble.com/embed/v6vzu8o/?pub=4430ut\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div><p><strong>MINNEAPOLIS SHOOTING: DUMBEST REACTIONS</strong></p><ul><li><strong></strong><a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/transpop-suicide-press-release/\" rel=\"noopener noreferr",
