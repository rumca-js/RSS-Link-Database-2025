With everything going on in tech and tariffs, I\u2019d say $480 is about as good as you can hope for right now\u2014and if you happen to be in the market <em>right now</em>, Newegg has one for you. This ASRock 27-inch 1440p OLED monitor is <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/asrock-phantom-gaming-pgo27qfs-27-qhd-240-hz-oled-black/p/N82E16824946004\">on sale for $479.99</a>, a cool 25% off the retail price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This just about hits the baseline for gaming-focused OLED monitors right now, with a 2560\u00d71440 resolution and fast 240Hz refresh rate.

A good-quality arm not only frees up usable space on your desk\u2019s surface, it enables more ways to move and position your display/s for optimal comfort and ergonomics. And a monitor arm makes your office setup look really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only catch is the price. Most monitor arms worth buying will cost close to $200, and heavy-duty arms capable of holding two large displays can be priced even higher. The good news is that a good-quality monitor arm is likely to last you for a very long time. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to make the right choice when you purchase a monitor arm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help you with that, we\u2019ve tested several popular monitor arms, for both single- and dual-monitor setups.
