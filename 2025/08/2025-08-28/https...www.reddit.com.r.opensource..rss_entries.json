I believe it\u2019s mostly because I didn\u2019t talk much about it online after releasing it and only added 1-2 features since I didn\u2019t need to extend it beyond what\u2019s supposed to do.</p> <p>However, this desktop app is different and I believe it could be bigger and I have more ideas to add to it with right community. </p> <p>Anyone managed build and maintained an open source community as a solo developer?
