So the game works much better and more responsively, in my opinion. True, during the game I notice random crashes from games. Then I decided on their appearance and found a pattern. The game crashes because of spam of the buy menu and tab menu. I did not find any extraneous problems anywhere, no matter how I tried, and I did not understand anything in the logs.
