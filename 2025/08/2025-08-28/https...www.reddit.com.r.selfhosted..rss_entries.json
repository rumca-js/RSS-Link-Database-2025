However, the main reason I looked into it was so that I could play the retro games on my phone when I&#39;m away.</p> <p>I tried playing on my mobile browser but it&#39;s not as responsive as I hoped it would be. Some controls like start and select are not in the view, if I scroll down to see them the screen gets cut off at the top so I can&#39;t see the game in whole etc. I don&#39;t want to play having to constantly scroll up and down to make it work. It works great on desktop but like I said my primary purpose was to play on my iPhone.</p> <p>I was hoping there was a third party app for iOS that would allow me to play my games on my RomM instance much like how I use:</p> <ul> <li>Panels for Komga</li> <li>Plappa for Audiobookshelf</li> <li>Infuse for Plex</li> </ul> <p>If anyone knows one, please let me know as I&#39;m r",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just set up Dawarich on my unraid server and have it reverse proxies into the app. I can connect, however I am curious if there is anyway to run it in the background WITHOUT having it live in the Dynamic Island. I am also curious if there is any way to have it geofenced for when I leave work, school, home, etc to turn on. Should I just use Home Assistant to track instead?
