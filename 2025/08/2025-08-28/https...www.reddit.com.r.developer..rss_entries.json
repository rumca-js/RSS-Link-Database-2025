But when I check the sniffer logs, I notice something interesting:</p> <p>The first few authentication frames between the phone and the AP show algorithm number 0 (Open System).</p> <p>After that, I start seeing algorithm number 3 (SAE) being used.</p> <p>I was confused, so I asked ChatGPT, and it mentioned that even with WPA3, the initial Open System authentication frames are a mandatory part of the low-level 802.11 connection process. Basically, they establish a basic logical link before the secure WPA3-SAE key exchange begins.</p> <p>Does this explanation sound correct? And is it expected to always see those initial algo 0 frames before SAE? Can someone please help me with this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/secretshanta69\"> /u/secretshanta69 </a> <br/>",
