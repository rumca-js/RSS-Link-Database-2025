        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>As the title says! I want to start reading books that will enhance my brain and knowledge. I started reading &#39;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&#39; by Thomas Piketty, a (as i understand) classic, and want to read more of these kind of books. I don&#39;t want self-help or anything as I am not really interested by them (tried books like Atomic Habits but didn&#39;t really find them interesting), just some factual and interesting read on any subject. </p> <p>I&#39;m trilingual so I can read in English, French or Spanish, so it doesn&#39;t HAVE to be in english (I even prefer french if possible).</p> <p>Also, I don&#39;t want any heavily biased book, so I would like to stay &quot;far&quot; of politics, unless it&#39;s about political history that can be fact checked and aren&#39;t full of opinions and clear bias.

Some of the recent books I\u2019ve listened to from internet lists are packed with metaphorical significance and and don\u2019t really have all that much story. That kind of book is pretty boring for me and when I am half focused on driving it\u2019s easy for me to lose focus. A perfect book for what I\u2019m talking about would be Holes by Louis Sachar. It\u2019s got a great story and has some adult themes but it\u2019s easy to follow along while also focusing on driving. Most importantly, it\u2019s entertaining so it makes the drive really enjoyable. I\u2019m not necessarily looking for a kids or YA book but something that has a story that actually moves and the characters accomplish something. I tagged sci fi/fantasy but I\u2019m open to pretty much any genre with a good story. I also love a good mystery. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lark",
