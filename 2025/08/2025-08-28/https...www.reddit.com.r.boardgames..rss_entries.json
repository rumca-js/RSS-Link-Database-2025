I found a video that showed the exact process I want to follow, and I already have all the tools and materials ready to go except the cards themselves. Unfortunately, the link provided in that video no longer works, and after spending the last 3 days searching online I still can\u2019t track down a working source.</p> <p>Ideally, I\u2019m looking for pre-cut, 10 mil inkjet-printable PVC cards that are durable but thin enough to run through an inkjet printer.
