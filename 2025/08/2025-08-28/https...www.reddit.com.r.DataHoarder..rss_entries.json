I should be able to just connect it to one of my unmanned computers, share it out, and then access it over the network anyway. I&#39;ve just never used a device like this before so looking for opinions.</p> <p>I&#39;m not attached to this specific device if there are better ones that have 4-5 bays and can do RAID 5.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by ",
