I dislike using guides, and the horror stories around the game requiring the player to bomb and burn every wall and tree in order to progress further put me off playing the game. Not my idea of a fun or well-designed game. </p> <p>Retro gamers who grew up in the era often say that Zelda&#39;s cryptic design was a feature and not a bug, that Shiggy Miyamoto purposely designed it in such a way (after being inspired by his walks through a local forest) in order to create that feeling of exploration through an uncharted territory, so neatly laying things out with quest markers, obvious hints, and such would undermine that vision. Miyamoto also wanted the game to be something of a community activity in which kids would share their discoveries wit",
