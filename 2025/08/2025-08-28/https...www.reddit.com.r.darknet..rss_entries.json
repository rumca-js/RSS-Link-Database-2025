I can\u2019t sell or transfer it because I don\u2019t have an ID to verify at the moment. It\u2019s been a frustrating experience, and I\u2019m looking for a better alternative. I\u2019m thinking about using ChangeNOW to buy BTC and swap it for Monero, but I\u2019m worried about running into the same issue with funds being locked due to ID verification. Has anyone here used ChangeNOW for crypto swaps? What\u2019s your experience been like? Specifically, do they require ID verification for BTC-to-Monero swaps, or can I stay anonymous? Any tips to avoid getting stuck like I did with Cash App?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/God_Remi\"> /u/God_Remi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/1n2kloj/buying_monero_through_changenow/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",
