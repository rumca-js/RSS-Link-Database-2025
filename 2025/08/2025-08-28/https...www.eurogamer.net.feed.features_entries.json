There's an opening that I probably couldn't get away with on any other major games site, hey. But, really: that moment of channel-hopping and catching the smirking visage of Sean Connery, Roger Moore, or Pierce Brosnan as a bit of late-night terrestrial TV filler is as British as fish and chips, smashing up your shiny new alloy on a pothole, and needing to do a blood sacrifice for his majesty's government in order to send a DM on social media.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/a-love-letter-to-that-one-time-james-bond-battled-the-villain-in-a-crappy-arcade-game-instead-of-at-cards\">Read more</a></p>",

It isn't nuclear dread or even hide-and-seek, often involving a cardboard box. And it's not tactical espionage action. I think it's a tone, or rather a carefully un-careful blend of conflicting tones. On one side there's a movement towards steely realism. On the other, there are these bright lunges at absolute fantasy. It's realism and its opposite. I just tried to google what realism's opposite actually is, by the way. There is no one standard answer as far as I can see. How very Metal Gear.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/why-snake-eater-is-a-perfect-example-of-the-tension-between-the-real-and-the-unreal-thats-at-the-core-of-every-metal-gear-solid-game\">Read more</a></p>",
