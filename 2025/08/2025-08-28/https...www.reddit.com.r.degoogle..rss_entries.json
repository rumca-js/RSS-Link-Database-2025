Sometimes it seems that to replace 1 or 2 Google apps, you end up needing a lot of different ones.</p> <p>To be clear: I do believe our personal data is very valuable. But at the same time, I can\u2019t help but think we\u2019re just a \u201cneedle in a haystack,\u201d and that these big companies mostly care about macro-data rather than each individual.</p> <p>My genuine question is to better understand the motivation behind all this effort, because I find it really interesting and I follow this subreddit/group quite often.<br/> Cheers! \ud83d\ude4c</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nico_Ogallar\"> /u/Nico_Ogallar </a> <br/> <span>",

I\u2019ve only ever used Windows before, so I\u2019m not sure what would be the best choice for me now. Should I stay with Windows and try to harden it, or would it be better to go with something like Pop!_OS, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or another Linux distribution?</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen people mentioning tools like Firejail, random MAC addresses, Quad9 DNS, and VPN tunneling, but I\u2019m not sure how much of this is actually necessary for everyday use. Do you think it makes sense to separate browsers for different tasks, like using one only for banking, another one for entertainment, and maybe another for social media? And if so, does it also make sense to use a different VPN connection for each browser session, or is that overkill?</p> <p>For passwords, I was thinking about using Proton Pass since I already use Proton services and it looks convenient, but",

I like the interface and the public transport option seems to work good. </p> <p>But I found one problem - the data is soooo much old. </p> <p>For example - quite a big company I work for is not visible and it is 2,5 years old. Instead there is company that was in this place before. There is one shop and one pharmacy not visible and they are there for few months. That is annoying, because I do not know how many things I will be missing with them and I have to do everything around.</p> <p>Therefore I would like to ask if you know any map that have:</p> <p>- working public transport option,</p> <p>- Is up to date regarding places</p> <p>- have clear interface (here Here WeGo looks good)</p> <p>- nice if it has some recommendations (i.e. restaurants/parkings/attractions nearby)</p>",
