Not only was she trying to take steps forward after a life-changing summer, her off-season had been ravaged by contracting Covid-19, which forced her off the court for weeks in December. In her first match of the season, she found herself up against Elena Rybakina in Sydney. She left the court with just one game to her name, losing 6-0, 6-1.</p><p>That first encounter between Raducanu and Rybakina was a good representation of the difficulties Raducanu has had to navigate over the past few years: the pressure from her sudden rise, her underpowered game against the best players in the world and the fact that there was always another physical issue around the corner.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/28/raducanu-test-herself-",

In the late 2000s and 2010s Vice grew from a punk magazine into a digital media empire by telling the world what was cool (more specifically by telling millennials, then in their cool-seeking prime). By 2017, it was valued at nearly $6bn; in 2023, Vice filed for bankruptcy. A man who saw it from the inside is TV chef Eddie Huang, the director and frontman of this film. He had a long-running show on the Viceland TV channel and says he\u2019s still owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties.</p><p>Huang is also an advert for the best of Vice: fast, funny and authentic.

        "description": "<p>A restaurant in the English county of Cheshire has launched a water menu, as have a number of US establishments. Is it really possible, though, to tell one terroir from another?</p><p>For diners at a fancy restaurant in Cheshire, there is now a new twist to the usual routine. First comes La Popote\u2019s menu, created by the owners, the chef Joe Rawlins and Ga\u00eblle Radigon, who live upstairs with their children. Next comes the wine list, which includes more than 100 bottles. And then, in what is very much a&nbsp;first for Cheshire, a water list.</p><p>Rawlins, 32, presents the new menu as I get comfy in the dining room in a converted redbrick barn in Marton, a village halfway between Manchester and Stoke-on-Trent. A choice of seven waters ranges from a \u00a35 bottle of Crag, which comes from the nearby Peak District, to Vidago, a mineral-rich water from a Portuguese spa town, which will cost you \u00a319.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/28/water-sommeliers-rival-win",
