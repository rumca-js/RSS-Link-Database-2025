        "description": "<p>Truly phenomenal video from Real Engineering about a genuinely phenomenal product. In my <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/09/airpods_pro_2_usbc\">review of the AirPods 2 in 2023</a>\u2009\u2014\u2009a year after they originally shipped, when the cases were changed to use USB-C\u2009\u2014\u2009I called them \u201cthe best single expression of Apple as a company today\u201d. That remains true. AirPods exemplify everything that sets Apple apart: miniaturization, \u201cit just works\u201d ease of use, opinionated design (you get them in any color you want, so long as it\u2019s white), and, most of all, joyfulness.</p>\n\n<p>It occurs to me that Apple doesn\u2019t brag enough about its engineering accomplishments these days. Under their previous CEO, they\u2019d spend more time in product introduction explaining how things work, like a lecture in a 101 college course. I miss that. This Real Engineering video fills in those gaps.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018How AirPods Work\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/08/28/how-a",
