        "description": "FFmpeg 8.0 brings GPU-accelerated video encoding via Vulkan -- and can now subtitle your videos automatically using integrated speech recognition. From a report: At the start of the week, the FFmpeg project released its eighth major version. It's codenamed \"Huffman\" after the Huffman code algorithm, which was invented in 1952, making it one of the oldest lossless compression algorithms. \n\n[...] The changelog lists 30 significant changes, of which the top new feature is integrating Whisper. This means whisper.cpp, which is Georgi Gerganov's entirely local and offline version of OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition model. The bottom line is that FFmpeg can now automatically subtitle videos for you.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=FFmpeg+8+Can+Now+Subtitle+Your+Videos+on+the+Fly%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F08%2F28%2F1844210%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\">",

From a report: The proposal, believed to be the first of its kind in Japan, is currently being debated by lawmakers after being submitted by Toyoake municipal government in Aichi earlier this week. Toyoake's mayor said the proposal -- which only applies outside of work and study -- would not be strictly enforced, but rather was meant to \"encourage\" residents to better manage their screen time. \n\nThere will be no penalties for breaking the rule, which will be passed in October if approved by lawmakers. \"The two hour limit... is merely a guideline... to encourage citizens,\" Toyoake Mayor Masafumi Koki said in a statement. \"This does not mean the city will limit its residents' rights or impose duties,\" he said.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?statu",

The Guardian: The study, published in the journal Plos One, estimates humans can inhale as much as 68,000 tiny plastic particles daily. Previous studies have identified larger pieces of airborne microplastics, but those are not as much of a health threat because they do not hang in the air as long, or move as deep into the pulmonary system. \n\nThe smaller bits measure between 1 and 10 micrometers, or about one-seventh the thickness of a human hair, and present more of a health threat because they can more easily be distributed throughout the body.

Carta's equity management data reveals that while solo-founded companies grew from 17% of 2,600 startups in 2015 to 35% of 3,800 startups in 2024, their share of VC funding barely moved from 15 to 17%. \n\n\"Valley VCs don't like solo founders,\" Pai, who is a partner at India-based venture firm Blume, writes in his analysis. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan confirmed the accelerator's practice of persuading solo founders to find partners after acceptance.The bias persists despite prominent solo-founded successes including Amazon, SpaceX, and Zoom. Pai notes that \"most unicorn startups have cofounders\" but questions whether this reflects genuine risk differences or simply that cofounded startups receive five times more funding opportunities. \"The bias against solo founders is so strong,\" ",

The Trades Union Congress (TUC), a federation of trade unions in England and Wales, says it found that people are concerned about the way AI is being adopted by businesses and want a say in how the technology is used at their workplace and the wider economy. \n\nIt warns that without such a \"worker-first plan,\" use of \"intelligent\" algorithms could lead to even greater social inequality in the country, plus the kind of civil unrest that goes along with that. The TUC says it wants conditions attached to the tens of billions in public money being spent on AI research and development to ensure that workers are supported and retrained rather than deskilled or replaced.

It argues the UK risks similar hold-ups if the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) pushes ahead with plans designed to open up markets the regulator says is too dominated by Apple and Google. \n\n[...] The CMA wants UK app makers to be able to use and exchange data with Apple's mobile technology -- something called \"interoperability.\" Without it, app makers cannot create the full range of innovative products and services, it argues.

The survey was carried out by researchers from the University of Florida and the University of London, and charts a 40 percent decrease in daily reading for pleasure across the years 2003-2023, based on responses from 236,270 US adults.\n \n\"This is not just a small dip -- it's a sustained, steady decline of about 3 percent per year,\" says Jill Sonke, director for the Center for the Arts in Medicine at the University of Florida. \"It's significant, and it's deeply concerning.\" The number of US people reading for pleasure every day peaked in 2004 at 28 percent, the researchers found, but by 2023 this was down to 16 percent.

According to the paper, the process yields \"gasoline range\" hydrocarbons, mainly molecules with six to 12 carbons, which are the primary component of gasoline.

        "description": "samleecole shares a report from 404 Media: An app developer has jailbroken Echelon exercise bikes to restore functionality that the company put behind a paywall last month, but copyright laws prevent him from being allowed to legally release it. Last month, Peloton competitor Echelon pushed a firmware update to its exercise equipment that forces its machines to connect to the company's servers in order to work properly. Echelon was popular in part because it was possible to connect Echelon bikes, treadmills, and rowing machines to free or cheap third-party apps and collect information like pedaling power, distance traveled, and other basic functionality that one might want from a piece of exercise equipment. With the new firmware update, the machines work only with constant internet access and getting anything beyond extremely basic functionality requires an Echelon subscription, which can cost hundreds of dollars a year.\n \nApp engineer Ricky Witherspoon, who makes an app called SyncS",
