        "description": "Suraya Mohamed | August 28, 2025\nKnown for its panoramic views of Colorado\u2019s Roaring Fork Valley, Smuggler Mountain was conveniently a couple of miles from the Aspen Ideas Festival campus. The band Lucius and our crew took a short trek up a dirt road to arrive at the historic Smugger Mine. Once inside, we walked through the cold and damp Clark Tunnel and arrived at a man-made cavern. There Lucius played \u201cDusty Trails,\u201d perhaps appropriate for the fossilized surroundings. \n\nThe subsequent songs come from its latest self-titled album. Performed just outside of the mine entrance, the audience had the good fortune to take in catchy tunes and a gorgeous background overlooking the town. \u201cFinal Days\u201d is a reminder that the human experience is filled with unknowns. The sugary \u201cGold Rush\u201d highlights lead singers Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig\u2019s solid vocal connection. The set ends with \u201cMad Love,\u201d a beautiful ballad that inspired some grasshoppers to sing along.\n\nSET LIST \n\u201cDusty Trails\u201d\n\u201cFinal ",
