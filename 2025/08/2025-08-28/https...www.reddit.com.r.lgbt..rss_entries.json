And I&#39;m sorry for any mistakes in the text, I don&#39;t know English well) .I recently identified myself as a bi-person, although before that I thought that I only liked guys (at least sexually). But... Now I notice that I used to pay attention not only to guys, but also to girls. I want to meet someone, but unfortunately, LGBT is recognized as an extremist organization in Russia. Moreover, LGBT people themselves are allegedly &quot;not prohibited,&quot; although fuck it, any mention is almost a crime. But come on, I just came to complain that I want to find a girlfriend or boyfriend, but I don&#39;t know how. And if everything is OK with the guys, you can find them in clubs or in various dating apps. It&#39;s not like I go to clubs... I don&#39;t even drink or smoke. That&#39;s how boring I am, phah. </p> <p>",

It&#39;s difficult to believe that most gay men are like this, and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s even true, because it seems like these racist and transphobic posts get an inordinate amount of upvotes while any posts and comments opposing them get concerted downvoted by a few dozen users (doesn&#39;t matter how deep or low they&#39;re in a thread) in a way feels like organized brigading.
