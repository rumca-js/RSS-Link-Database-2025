In the medical domain, decision-making often requires integrating heterogeneous information sources, including patient narratives, structured data, and medical images. This study positions GPT-5 as a generalist multimodal reasoner for medical decision support and systematically evaluates its zeroshot chain-of-thought reasoning performance on both text-based question answering and visual question answering tasks under a unified protocol. We benchmark GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, GPT-5nano, and GPT-4o-2024-11-20 against standardized splits of MedQA, MedXpertQA (text and multimodal), MMLU medical subsets, USMLE self-assessment exams, and VQA-RAD.

Later on when people work more than what they used to work before AI then the GDP would again rise. Hence the jobs that are being lost will not be replaced instead new companies in new areas will be formed. To me it looks like Tech companies need only 1% of their current headcount to continue in the same way in the AI era.
