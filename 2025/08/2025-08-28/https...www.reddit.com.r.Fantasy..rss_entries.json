I\u2019m not sure exactly when the shift began but around 2014 Tor started publishing fantasy novellas that have led slowly to a new \u2018trend\u2019 in publishing \u2014 the return of the SFF novella. The most famous example probably being Martha Wells\u2019 The Murderbot Diaries which was recently adapted for TV. </p> <p>But in the realm of fantasy, I have been excited by the volume of new queer and POC authors that this new wave of novellas has put on my radar. As much as I love a chunky \u2018Priory of the Orange Tree\u2019 or \u2018Black Leopard, Red Wolf\u2019 \u2014 these short form works that house new Black fantasy worlds of Kai Ashante Wilson and P Djeli Clark, or the Asian-inspired worlds of SL Huang and Nghi Vo, or the cross-genre work of Aliette de Bodard and Emily Tesh.

I&#39;ve always found them to be so cozy and at the same time full of adventure and tense moments. I love the walking or riding a horse through forests and across mountains. Eating bread and cheese, trapping and hunting animals and filling waterskins from a river. Finding shelter from a storm in a cave. Building a fire in a clearing hidden from enemies. Seeping under the stars, using saddles or packs as pillows and cloaks as blankets. Taking turns keeping watch through the night.</p> <p>Do you also love those situations?

It took me far longer than I would have liked, but I&#39;ve finally had the chance to finish <em>A Cavern of Black Ice</em> by J.V. Jones. Lately, this series has been getting a lot of love, and with Jones&#39; recent announcement back in March that she had completed <em>Endlords</em>, the fifth book in the series, after a 15-year hiatus, I felt like it was the perfect time to at least dive into the first installment. As always, I&#39;m not here to drop any major spoilers about the plot, but we will be talking about the overall setup of the story. Again, nothing major, just some general conversations about how the world is structured and the initial character paths. It&#39;s worth noting so you can decide if you want to read it now or come back later. I&#39;ll also be including a brief TLDR summary at the end that does its best to recap my overall thoughts and opinions.</p> <p>With all of that out of the way, le",

She should also stop being lazy with fantasy.</p> <p>I wrote this review because I read Katabasis with a few friends as an eARC, and as an author/reader myself, I cannot believe the good press currently coming out about this novel. I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with this- or Kuang as a fellow author, though this is the first novel I\u2019ve read from her- if the praise weren\u2019t so uncritically shining, and were the story\u2019s construction not so obviously mediocre. </p> <p>Before we begin, I\u2019ll be upfront about my background. I write a lot of short, speculative fiction, and have read my fair share of long-form work. In fantasy, I like high stakes with strong movement; rich, rigorous, and consistent world-building; deep character work; vivid language; and finally, ineffable magic.

It&#39;s under 1000 rating ratings on Goodreads, if we use the bingo definition, and it&#39;s certainly a gem. I was randomly thinking about it yesterday, and I was surprised to find no real talk about it, here or elsewhere. While it is an older book, I still expected to see something. I was surprised it only has 517 ratings- even if a victim of shifts in the publishing industry in the early &#39;90s, I was still expecting <strong>Steven Brust</strong>/<strong>Mercedes Lackey</strong>/<strong>Martha Wells</strong> (pre-Murderbot) popularity. It&#39;s a similar age, and in my opinion of a similar quality to those of their works I&#39;ve read.</p> <p>The book is unfortunately a victim of three marketing misses- first, a rather uninspiring, if technically apt, title.
