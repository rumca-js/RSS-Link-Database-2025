        "description": "Gears of War: Reloaded's presence on the PlayStation 5 is an excellent showcase of how Sony's gaming powerhouse has become a very attractive option for developers who may not have chosen the platform in the past. \n\nAside from a very solid gameplay experience made even better by the PS5's unique strengths, the fact that this once Xbox-exclusive franchise is now playable on the PS showcases a shift towards a gaming industry in which console-exclusivity has made way for a more player-focused approach to releases new and old. \n\nAside from the potential to create more ambitious projects that bring larger communities of players together, this shift cements the PlayStation as a great option for single-player blockbusters, and a console that, like the Gears franchise, has withstood the test of time.",
