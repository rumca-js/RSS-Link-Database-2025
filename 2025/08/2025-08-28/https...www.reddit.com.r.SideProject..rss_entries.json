Languages, frameworks, databases, endless debates. You could spend weeks without writing a single line of code that actually mattered.</p> <p>That world is gone. You don\u2019t need a tech stack anymore. You need a vibe stack.</p> <p>A vibe stack is not about syntax or frameworks. It is about flow. It is the set of tools that keeps you moving from idea to prototype to launch without friction. Tools that feel natural, keep your momentum alive, and let you stay in creation mode instead of stuck in decisions.</p> <p>If the tools match your vibe, you will ship. </p> <p>If they don\u2019t, you will stall.

The problem I keep running into: the free tiers barely cover anything, and to even test a full project you end up needing to pay way more than expected. It kind of defeats the purpose if the \u201cMVP\u201d costs hundreds before you even validate an idea. A friend recently suggested I try out some newer AI agent platforms like MGX. From what I\u2019ve heard, the way it works is more like a team of agents collaborating, so supposedly it uses credits more efficiently compared to single big calls. Haven\u2019t tested it deeply yet, but I\u2019m curious if anyone here has experience with it or similar tools. So has anyone here managed to build something profitable without sinking tons of money into API calls? What platforms worked for you? Any tips for keeping the experimentation phase affordable?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

I had always heard of it but never really knew what it was and I never felt like searching it on google and reading a bunch of articles etc, i like learning through videos or podcasts. so i made a website that solves this for me, it includes videos, articles (wikipedia for now) and podcast related to the search topic. I have loved listening to podcasts about these things since they go much more in depth and give me a better understanding, heres the link:<br/> <a href=\"https://kno-three.vercel.app/\">https://kno-three.vercel.app/</a></p> <p>corny name ik, im not super creative</p> <p>please leave feedback, i have no clue what im doing as you can guess by the long rant</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maximum_Possible531",
