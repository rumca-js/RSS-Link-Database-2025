These companies are asking for permission to collect data from years of your personal conversations, financial information, and private communications. The privacy policies are written in a way that it is not clear what will happen to the information. Most of them say that they use it to \u201cimprove services\u201d or \u201cprovide better recommendations\u201d but this could mean anything including selling aggregated data to third parties. I started wondering if there are any email cleanup tools that will not invade your privacy while keeping your inbox private. I found inbox zapper which works locally but I would like to know what others think about email tool privacy.

But honestly, it feels harder than ever in 2025. Everything\u2019s connected, everyone\u2019s using 10+ apps a day, and even &quot;privacy-first&quot; tools sometimes feel half-baked or inconvenient.
