        "description": "Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at MGS3 Delta, this game is not something I had massive hype for since it was billed as a 1:1 remake of the original PS2 game. This is the exact same game with just some performance issues that need to be seriously fixed. If you've never played MGS3, consider changing that.
