Whether you're dealing with annoying dead zones, buffering video calls or laggy gaming sessions, the right Wi-Fi extender can help expand coverage and improve connectivity without forcing you to move your router.<br><br>There are different types of Wi-Fi extenders to choose from. Some models use external antennas to push the signal farther, while others, like mesh extenders, create a seamless, whole-home network. If you're simply looking to extend coverage into a specific room, a Wi-Fi repeater can do the job \u2014 but it may cut your bandwidth in half. More advanced extenders, however, can help maintain strong speeds and reliability throughout your home.<br><br>We've rounded up the best Wi-Fi extenders to suit different needs, whether you're looking for an affordable fix or a high-performance upgrade.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-cont",
