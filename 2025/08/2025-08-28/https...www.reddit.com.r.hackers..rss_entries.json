We started having wifi back in 2023. I have a HUGE feeling that my phone, or one of my social media accounts, is being monitored or is under surveillance through a spyware virus.</p> <p>I have already asked this before in here but a tech expert person told me this type of hacking is too expensive to do. But looking at it with these suspected people I am seeing, it appears possible because it involves a group of influencers who earn millions (one of them has youtube channel with million subscribers, the other works with famous personalities) and the former founder of Bumble who also founded fansly.</p> <p>The reason why I suspect it is because I used to download Bumble before this person resigned from her position and back at that time I also clicked random links on Instagram.
