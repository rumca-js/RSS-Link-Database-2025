        "description": "Crocs, Versace, and WWE have already integrated their brands into popular Fortnite islands and experiences. In this session, Ryan Norrington of Metavision gives some of the hard-won insights from these integrations, and makes the case for financing more risks like these as part of a brand's creative process.\n\nAs a central part of UK broadcaster ITV, Metavision brings a unique perspective to this session. Find out what worked in 2024 brand integrations, and learn how creators can gain an appreciation of the media value of their audience. Attendees will leave with an understanding of how they can take steps toward tackling more ambitious game design, and take more risks in the creative process.",

        "description": "One of the main challenges of automotive design is visualizing cars quickly in different markets and environments. With the use of the Procedural Content Generation Framework (PCG) in Unreal Engine, real-time rendering environments can be rapidly updated and changed to produce content suitable for design reviews.\n\nIn this session, Jack Gullen of McLaren describes how to quickly set up a car using the Control Rig system introduced in Unreal 5.4, and bring this setup into an environment with roads and scenery generated with the PCG using Quixel assets. Work with a world that shifts between different seasons and biomes (forest/desert) before assets such as surrounding foliage are fine-tuned to create automotive media. \n\nAlthough the steps shown in this session pertain to automotive visualization, the workflow can be adapted to many other industries.",
