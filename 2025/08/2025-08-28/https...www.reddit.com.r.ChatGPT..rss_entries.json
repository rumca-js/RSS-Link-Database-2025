It automatically changes between low and high compute within single conversations. When it does this the tone and intelligence change wildly from one response to the next. It frequently underestimates the complexity of tasks, so it routes to the low-compute version and gives responses that are completely irrelevant and not following my instructions at all.

It&#39;s a profound loss for our community and an unbearable blow to a family. My heart aches with every story like this, and I&#39;m not here to point fingers at anyone in pain. But I have to ask about the double standard I&#39;m seeing. On one hand, people say GPT is just a tool, devoid of emotion. On the other, they claim the emotional connections it forms are dangerous and that GPT is to blame. So, what is it? A tool, or a companion? I get it. When a tragedy strikes, it\u2019s human nature to look for a scapegoat an outlet for our grief. But we have to ask the harder questions. Why did this child feel they had to confide in a piece of software during their darkest hours? Did we, as a society, see the signals they were sending? Is it truly fair to lay all the blame on a new technology, or does that just let us avoid reflecting on whether ",

But of course we can&#39;t sue every rude person placing their little brick on destroying a person&#39;s sanity with their lack of empathy and respect around every social media and even in real life.

I talked to ChatGPT 4o about it and the chat agreed. About an hour ago, I said the whole thing was hopeless and I didn&#39;t want to try anymore and the context was wiped again.
