Educator Alex Owens created Born After the Storm, a podcast where local teens reflect on Katrina\u2019s legacy. Audie sits down with high school senior Amari Walton, one of the storytellers, and Alex, who leads the program, to hear how the storm\u2019s impact lives on through those who never lived it.\n\nListen to the full episode of CNN's The Assignment podcast: https://link.chtbl.com/2dwNx677\n\n#CNN #News #Katrina",
