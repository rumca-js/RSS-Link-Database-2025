        "description": "I used a new colorization technique, fully restored the footage, and created a complete sound design for this rare 1920s film documenting a passenger flight from London to Paris. The journey begins with the preparation of the aircraft and the boarding of ten travelers, each permitted fifty pounds of baggage, before taking off across the English Channel. Along the way, the film showcases breathtaking aerial views of London\u2019s landmarks, including the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Bridge, and Big Ben, followed by sweeping scenes of the English countryside and the cliffs of Beachy Head. Tea is served mid-flight, and after crossing paths with a returning plane, the passengers soon arrive over France, passing cultivated farmlands and the ancient Roman road built by Caesar, before completing the voyage with a smooth landing in Paris just two and a half hours after departure.\n\nVideo Restoration Process:\n\u2714 FPS boosted to 60 frames per second \n\u2714 Image resolution boosted up to HD \n\u2714 Improved",
