        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I know art if subjective, so no one can truly define what makes good prose &quot;good&quot;. Bad prose seems easier to define: confusing, clunky, unrealistic in its choice of words or syntax, inaccurate in its use of analogy. And yet, often, books that are lauded for being masterpieces often have these traits as well: dense wording that comes off confusing, syntax that breaks convention, word usage that has you consulting the dictionary every other page.</p> <p>At the end of the day, I wish I could appreciate prose more, because I see how deeply it can effect others, and I desire to feel that way myself; but realize I am more interested in concept and plot when reading a book, than I am in flowery prose. So what is it for you? Just the feeling the words give you, or is it more definable?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LeviBateman\"> /u/LeviBateman </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",
