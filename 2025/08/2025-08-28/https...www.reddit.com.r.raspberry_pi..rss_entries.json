I flashed the OS to a micro sd card and even toyed around with pre flashing configuration so SSH was enabled, plus set up an admin name and a password etc. The first time I connect it it worked fine, but when I tried to SSH to it with my Macbook pro it didn&#39;t accept the password I set up. I had the bright idea to reflash the micro sd to set up another password during the configuration part. Now it wont connect to my wifi at all. I tried turning it off and on, reflashing it again, turning the router off and on. Nothing worked. Any way that I can salvage whatever I did wrong?

I set up my Pi with Kodi and Plex, and have the composite video and audio signal passing through an RF modulator for cable output. This is running to a matching transformer to the TV&#39;s antenna lugs. I&#39;m getting a wild amount of buzzing through the TV&#39;s speakers that shifts tone as things on the screen change, especially when the pi boots and the loading process text for DietPi displays onscreen. I am unsure if it is EMI from the pi itself, or what it might be.</p> <p>I tried this on a &quot;modern&quot; 2005 CRT and the noise is completely absent. But that is not the TV I want to use. I need to figure out a way to filter this noise to keep the older tube tv from picking it up.

This is not available for projects where we are working in automobile or other low voltage DV source. Something like a PD Decoy board but in reverse (DC in, PD compatible USB-C out) is not really available</p> <p>- If I do have a power source like a Buck converter providing the required 5.1VDC and 3-5Amps, I could feed it into a USB-C male plug and connect that to the RPI5",
