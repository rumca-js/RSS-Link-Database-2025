        "description": "This video presents the first cinematic recording of the Pyramids of Giza, filmed in 1896 by filmmaker Gabriel Veyre. The footage documents the monumental structures, including the Sphinx, offering a unique perspective of these ancient sites as they appeared in the late 19th century.\n\nThe images, an important piece of cinematic history, capture a crucial moment when the wonders of the ancient world were recorded in motion for the first time. This recording is a testament to Veyre's pioneering work and a valuable historical document that preserves the landscape and surroundings of Giza from more than a century ago.\n\nJoin as a member to support this channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8abMPJmTPmsaSc7j-lwIhQ/join",
