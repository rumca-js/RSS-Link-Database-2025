In this episode of Seen on the Screen, Jacqueline Coley sits down with Bob to talk about the highly anticipated sequel to his sleeper hit action film.\n\nBest known for his iconic role as Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, nobody is more surprised than Bob Odenkirk by his pivot to action. He opens up about the deeply personal inspiration behind Hutch Mansell, and how he trained like his life depended on it.\n\nHe shares stories from set, why Jackie Chan\u2019s Police Story is a creative touchstone, and how comedy, rage, and physical exhaustion all found their way into this unlikely action franchise.\n\nFollow and listen to Seen on the Screen with Jacqueline Coley wherever you listen to podcasts \ud83c\udfa7\n\u00b7 Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/seen-on-the-screen-with-jacqueline-coley/id1741444966\n\u00b7 Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/2SHvyxkJKOPhxreqtQuhv5?si=750395b35c6a4c4b \u200c\n \nFollow Make It Universal:\n\u00b7",
