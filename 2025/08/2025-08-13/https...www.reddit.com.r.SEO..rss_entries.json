I have done some free online courses, and slowly teaching myself things through a combination of courses, youtube tutorials, articles and also trial and error - running things past another freelance SEO who I work with. I&#39;m looking for advice on the best way to get started as I feel I need a bit more support. </p> <p>Would it be a good idea to try and find a role as a junior seo in an seo based company and learn from there? Or is it possible to teach yourself? I really want to learn but i do find the more technical aspects a bit more difficult to get my head around. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Mirror6575\"> /u/No-Mirror6575 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1mp6513/best_way_to_get_into_seo/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1mp65",
