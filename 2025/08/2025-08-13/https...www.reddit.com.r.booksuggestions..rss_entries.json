I just read Marc Morris\u2019 book The Anglo-Saxons and was interested by Alfred the Great and am looking for some recommendations. I\u2019m about 30 pages into David Horspool\u2019s book on Alfred the Great and it\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s primarily a historiographical analysis of separating myth from fiction rather than a narrative of his life, which is not really what I wanted, so I\u2019m thinking of returning it. I\u2019m looking for something which is a narrative history but does still feature some analysis, and is more in depth than Morris\u2019 chapter on Alfred (obviously, or I wouldn\u2019t be looking for suggestions lol).

The story is very heavy and <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">the main character ended up doing su1cide . </span>So basically I want a book that would make me cry so bad to the point that it would be very difficult for me to continue. I also prefer it if it tackles family problems and I would much prefer if it was written in first person. If anyone knows any good books like this, pls let me know. Oh, also, it would be great if it is accessible online. And if possible to know where you guys usually read since I used to only read through physical books and sometimes wattpad (but there aren&#39;t really good books there to find there).

I&#39;ve found that the narrator&#39;s delivery can really enhance or ruin the experience for me, so I was hoping to get some suggestions. I&#39;m not necessarily looking for a big production or anything, just audiobooks with narrators who properly match the emotional energy of the story.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking primarily for fantasy, sci-fi, or horror recommendations. I&#39;m open to other genres, but generally prefer books with a surreal or fantastical element. Ideally I would prefer recommendations that are not part of a series. I&#39;ve got too many of those to keep track off right now.</p> <p>Some examples of books I&#39;ve enjoyed in the past: </p> <ul> <li>Piranesi by Susanna Clarke</li> <li>The Buried Giant by Kazuo Ishiguro</li> <li>The Broken Earth series by N.K.
