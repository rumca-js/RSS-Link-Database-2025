But right now, you can score <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DD2ZB3DZ/\">this Innocn 49-inch model for only $712.02</a> (was $1,000), which is the lowest price it\u2019s ever been and a darn good deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is it physically huge, but this ultrawide display has a 5120\u00d71440 resolution, essentially the same as two 1440p monitors side-by-side. The OLED panel delivers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and gorgeous visuals for both gaming and media streaming. It also has a 144Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time for smooth frame rates and minimal lag, assuming your PC is powerful enough to push high FPS at this size.
