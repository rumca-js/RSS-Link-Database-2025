It is a prize-garlanded and Oscar-nominated film that made a serious player of its director and an international name for its then 69-year-old female lead, Brazilian stage and screen star Fernanda Montenegro. She plays a querulous woman called Dora who finds herself travelling across the country, on the edge of poverty and almost on the run, from Rio to the Sert\u00e3o in Brazil\u2019s remote north-east, in the company of a bewildered, angry, vulnerable little orphan boy whose life she has just (unwillingly) saved.</p><p>It\u2019s an often unashamedly sentimental movie about redemption in the tradition of Charlie Chaplin and Vittorio De Sica.
