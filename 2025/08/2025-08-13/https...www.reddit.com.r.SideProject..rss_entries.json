Why?</p> <p>I built <a href=\"http://leadlee.co/\">Leadlee</a> \u2014 a Reddit growth tool to find customers and grow on Reddit. I got the idea to build it this June after observing the pain points of solo builders and Indie Hackers. Everyone can build a product nowadays, but not everyone can master distribution. So, I built it to help founders grow their products on Reddit.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the product took off faster than I expected. It\u2019s just over a month since I launched it, and we already have 1,400+ active users and $300 MRR.</p> <p>It was becoming harder and harder to manage both my 9-5 and my SaaS, and seeing the opportunity and validation I got for my SaaS, I thought, fu*k it, let\u2019s go full time on Leadlee. So, I resigned from my job and will be going all in on Leadlee.</p> <p>I know it\u2019s a huge risk, but let\u2019s see how it goes. We\u2019re all gonna die anyway, so why not try",
