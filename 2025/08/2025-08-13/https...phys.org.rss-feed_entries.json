Thus ended the brief and brutal history of Hernando de Soto, a Spanish soldier who helped conquer Nicaragua, overthrow the Inca empire in Peru and famously led an extensive expedition and military campaign from present-day Florida up through South Carolina and west to Arkansas.",

But understanding this layer of the atmosphere could improve the accuracy of weather forecasts and climate models.",
