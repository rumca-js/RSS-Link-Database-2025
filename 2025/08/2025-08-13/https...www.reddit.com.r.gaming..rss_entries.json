Ezio was the best, story was the best, they improved mechanics by a big chunk in comparison to AC 1 and it was very very polished - and fun!</p> <p>AC3 was very weird to me, Black flag was different game. Unity and Syndicate for example were OK, but not so catching.</p> <p>The endless Valhalla and the other ones that focused so much on RPG were too much for me. Way to long and complex.</p> <p>Mirage went back to the roots, but it did not beat Ezio in my opinion.</p> <p>And so on...</p> <p>I still love to play AC2 over all the others and I still replay it...
