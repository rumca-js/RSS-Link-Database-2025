Quick question about the radio mechanic:</p> <p>The rules state that if the position indicated by your die doesn&#39;t have a plane, then nothing happens. What I&#39;m wondering is, if you play a die that exceeds the remaining positions (e.g. a 5 when there are only 2 positions visible), that means nothing happens, right?</p> <p>The reason I ask is that the traffic die doesn&#39;t work this way when adding planes to the track. If you exceed the remaining positions, a plane is added to the final position, the airport, but it doesn&#39;t seem that removing planes works the same way. This creates more pressure as you approach the airport because you need more low-value dice to clear any planes that have accumulated.</p> <p>Thanks for any clarification!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vezwyx\"> /u/vezwyx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"",

Unfortunately the mat got wet and so we put it in the pram to dry. Somewhere along the way we think it fell out and can\u2019t find it. Searching online I can\u2019t find a way to get a replacement one in the UK. Does anyone know how I could source one or have one I could buy off them?

Enough that it&#39;s effecting the fun of the game. So I&#39;m wondering if there are any other really good trivia games we might enjoy?</p> <p>We like a good mix, as I&#39;m good with technology, arts, architecture, TV/movies, my friend is good with literature, language, geography and science, and my other friend is good at technology, sports, traditions &amp; beliefs, general history etc. So we&#39;ve got a really good mix of topics we&#39;re good at.

The person teaching the game mentioned one of the boxes being better for beginners, but I don&#39;t remember which one they said.

I have only played Kinfire Delve and would be teaching it to the others in my group so looking at it from that perspective. If any of them have bosses that are easier to explain to other beginners of Kinfire.

We just watched the new dune movies and decided to try one of the board games.</p> <p>Also the younger kid should not get frustrated by the game, so I was thinking maybe the one which is less confrontational and doesn\u2019t require to think 5 turns ahead? </p> <p>We play regularly, but almost never with expansions, so I want one base game, because we have many games. But not on an expert level, more like till around 2,5 weight, max. </p> <p>I\u2019ve read that Uprising is the \u201cbetter\u201d game, but Imperium is more accessible. So maybe if we don\u2019t plan to play over 100 games we will be fine with Imperium? Or is it too punishing, and the options in Uprising are more rewarding or will they just be overwhelming? </p> <p>Please help! </p> <p>Thanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",

I was wondering if this was normal, or what the expected lead time normally is from them. I don&#39;t have much experience ordering from WizKids, hence my uncertainty as to whether or not they typically wait a bit before shipping.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nathan314159265\"> /u/Nathan314159265 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mopo6a/wizkids_lead_time/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mopo6a/wizkids_lead_time/\">[comments]</a></span>",
