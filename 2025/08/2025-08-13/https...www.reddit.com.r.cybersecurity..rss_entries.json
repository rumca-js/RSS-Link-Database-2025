From what I understand:</p> <ul> <li>SIEM collects logs from multiple sources, analyzes them, and helps detect threats, but usually requires additional tools or manual intervention to respond.</li> <li>XDR seems to combine detection, analysis, and automated response across endpoints, networks, and cloud environments.</li> </ul> <p>So my question is: if a company already has a strong SIEM setup along with the necessary response tools, is XDR really necessary? Or is it mostly useful for organizations that want a more integrated and automated solution?</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your experiences or thoughts from professionals in the cybersecurity field.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Working_Ferret_3911\"",
