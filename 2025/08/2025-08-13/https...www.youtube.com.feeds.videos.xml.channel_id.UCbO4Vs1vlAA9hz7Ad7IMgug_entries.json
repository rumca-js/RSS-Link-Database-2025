        "description": "We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Thirty-Three! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\n\nI'm a huge fan of early 90's style Apocalypses. Deep Star Six, HARDWARE. Tabletop games like VOR the Maelstrom, Video Games like Fallout 1/2 or the RPGs like Twilight 2000 or Red Dawn all give a grim future informed by the paranoia of the 80s. WORLD WAR APOCALYPSE sets us firmly in that gritty era of hopeless Post Apocalyse where warbands of Retrofuturistic fighters take to a hopeless end times to war with each other. Let's dive in!\n\nCheck out the rulebook in digital  HERE: https://www.wargamevault.com/product/524996/World-War-Apocalypse-10-Core-Rules-and-Art/?affiliate_id=210041",
