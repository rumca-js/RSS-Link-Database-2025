Apparently the lawsuit was from California but i can assume they were selling data from people worldwide. From what i understand they didnt just sell data to google but allowed them to get data through the app. Information such as sexual activity, peoples moods, period times, if people were on birth control. And google used that for marketing and to train their ai for advertising purposes</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FuzzbuttPanda\"> /u/FuzzbuttPanda </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/d",

I couldn&#39;t make any posts or comments that could be seen by others, and all I could do was lurk. Eventually, I was unable to login to Reddit at all. This issue still persists.When I created an alt account tied only to an email, it too was shadowbanned quickly. For weeks I tried to appeal to no avail, until recently when it was miraculously unbanned without even notifying me.</p> <p>My question is this: did Reddit shadowban me because I was using a non-spyware browser and/or an ad blocker? Do they stifle adblocker users intentionally?

I\u2019d like for anyone to confirm if they\u2019re safe or not or just recommend me a different one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/miifanatic_1788\"> /u/miifanatic_1788 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1mosnug/any_paypal_alternatives_i_can_turn_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1mosnug/any_paypal_alternatives_i_can_turn_to/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It was really bad compared to fairphones android 15 build and iOS. </p> <p>I had previously used a pixel 3a XL to test lineage OS and found little difference between fairphone\u2019s android build and lineage (after fully setting up a degoogled interface). </p> <p>Using arora, droid-ify, termux and micro G (banking apps) more or less gave me similar results compared to a non-degoogled android. </p> <p>This is where I want your help. A lot of people seem to suggest that iOS is more secure and private than lineage OS. So should I just degoogle my current iPhone and use Apple services (iCloud storage, iCloud mail) or stick to lineage OS on fairphone 6 whenever they support it. </p> <p>Also for the sake of argument, no I will not buy a pixel to use graphene OS. I don\u2019t have the money xD</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
