Those last-gen consoles are more than 12 years old at this point, and the current-gen PS5 and Xbox Series X|S are well into the middle of their lifespans, so it's not entirely surprising. They did confirm that cosmetics and other items purchased and tied to a player's account will transfer to the current-gen versions of the game. In other news, inZoi, the hyper-realistic life sim aiming to dethrone EA's The Sims, will get a PS5 release sometime next year. The dev team also hasn't ruled out an Xbox Series X or S version, but no decision has been made on that port.

Max Porter serves as executive producer. It is written by Max Porter. The music is by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow.\n\nSteve, directed by Tim Mielants, opens in select theaters on September 19, and on Netflix on October ",

        "description": "Drag x Drive reviewed by Logan Plant on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nDrag x Drive controls like nothing else I\u2019ve ever played, and it asks a lot of you in order to get used to its complicated mouse and motion mechanics. Obviously, if you don't like (or literally can\u2019t use) forced motion controls like this, then you should steer clear. But once I put in the time to \"get good,\" I really enjoyed the surprisingly deep fundamentals of Nintendo's unique take on wheelchair basketball. Its online three-on-three matches are a lot of fun, and it has some good ideas for provoking friendly competition between rounds that I wish were fleshed out a little bit more. That lack of substance is the most disappointing part about Drag x Drive, with little in the way of unlockables, customization, personality, and variety. I imagine a hardcore group of fans could rally around it, because its movement is very cool and there is a ton of potential to discover in its exciting trick system \u2013 but with a high initial bar",
