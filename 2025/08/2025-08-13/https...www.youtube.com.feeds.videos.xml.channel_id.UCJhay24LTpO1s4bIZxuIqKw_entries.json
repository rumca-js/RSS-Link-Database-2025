Has code quality/technical debt been addressed ? How does tactical fixes versus strategic direction achieve different versions of being finished ? what about the vital task of decommissioning of old code or refactoring cleaner solutions as better thinking on solutions emerges?\n\nIn this presentation, we will e",
