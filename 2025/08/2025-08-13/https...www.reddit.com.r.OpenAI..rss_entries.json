At one point it even stated \u201cI can not run the search at this time\u201d, and when challenged it reversed course and said it was minimizing token count and chose not to. When pressed it ran the search with success. </p> <p>Have others noticed this? I couldn\u2019t care less about personality changes\u2026 but new steering guidance to make the model use less tokens unless I fight with it has made things difficult.

There are rumors from app beta code that an annual plan around $200/year might be coming, but nothing confirmed. Makes me wonder:</p> <p>Is OpenAI avoiding annual plans to keep revenue flexible in case they need to raise prices or change the product tiers?</p> <p>Maybe they think AI is evolving too fast and locking people into a year could create backlash if something better (or cheaper) comes out mid-year?</p> <p>Could it be about cash flow predictability vs. comput",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Another sign that GPT-5 is actually a much smaller model: just days ago, OpenAI\u2019s O3 model, arguably the best model ever released, was limited to 100 messages per week because they couldn\u2019t afford to support higher usage. That\u2019s with users paying $20 a month. Now, after backlash, they\u2019ve suddenly increased GPT-5&#39;s cap from 200 to 3,000 messages per week, something we\u2019ve only seen with lightweight models like O4 mini.</p> <p>If GPT-5 were truly the massive model they\u2019ve been trying to present it as, there\u2019s no way OpenAI could afford to give users 3,000 messages when they were struggling to handle just 100 on O3. The economics don\u2019t add up. Combined with GPT-5\u2019s noticeably faster token output speed, this all strongly suggests GPT-5 is a smaller, likely distilled model, possibly trained on the thinking patterns of O3 or O4, and the knowledge base of 4.5.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bgboy089\"",

For a model touted as being the new SOTA model that blows away the competition, I have been underwhelmed. I was never much of a 4o user, as I opted for o4-mini for my day to day quick information searches and then o3 to go into more depth on a subject without going into full Deep Research. I disliked the happy-go-lucky over-the-top tone of 4o. The o-series models gave me the depth of knowledge I wanted while still providing a professional yet engaging tone.</p> <p>My problems started with my first prompt to GPT-5. I asked it to take a video URL and extract the recipe from the video. I made no mention of the content of the video other than that it was a recipe and then I provided a TikTok link which are notoriously difficult for AI to work with. I was just testing the waters with how much it could do ",
