Here\u2019s what I remember: \u2022 View/Style: Side-scrolling (not single-screen) platform/shooter. \u2022 Setting: Flying in the sky, possibly over clouds or a fantasy landscape. \u2022 Main Gimmick: The player\u2019s character sat astride an old-style bagged vacuum cleaner (like a witch on a broom) and used it to fly around. \u2022 Music: The soundtrack (or possibly the intro music) used the exact same orchestral string section as in Fatboy Slim\u2019s \u201cRight Here, Right Now\u201d \u2014 which comes from The James Gang \u2013 \u201cAshes, the Rain &amp; I.\u201d \u2022 Platform: Commodore Amiga (500 era). \u2022 Timeframe: I played it circa 1987\u201388, though it could be from slightly later. \u2022 Extra note: It might have been a cracked version with an intro (\u201ccracktro\u201d) before the game.</p> <p>It\u2019s not Drol, Magic Pockets, Wizkid, or Tumble Pop.
