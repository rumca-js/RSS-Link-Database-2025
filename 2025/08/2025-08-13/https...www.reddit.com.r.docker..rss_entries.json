That said, a few of them do need to communicate with virtual machines on my regular LAN, and I also have one container that needs to establish a WireGuard VPN connection (with a killswitch) to a provider.</p> <p>My current idea: run everything on a dedicated Docker network and have one container act as a firewall/router/VPN gateway for the rest. Does something like this already exist on Docker Hub, or would I need to piece it together from multiple containers?</p> <p>Thanks in advance \u2014 really curious to hear how you\u2019ve solved this in your own networks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JamonA",
