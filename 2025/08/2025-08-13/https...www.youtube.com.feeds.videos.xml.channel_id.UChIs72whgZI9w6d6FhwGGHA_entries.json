This, sadly, includes Anandtech fully shutting down (including archived articles). There's also a new AMD RX 9060 non-XT and rumors of a dual-X3D AMD CPU. And Crocs.\n\nSUPPORT OUR BLACK MARKET GPU MOVIE: https://store.gamersnexus.net/black-market-gpu-backers (launches August 15 to YouTube)\n\nSources doc: https://www.one-tab.com/page/TgdIyt9NS_CG9MAvjFPCrg\n\nLike our content?
