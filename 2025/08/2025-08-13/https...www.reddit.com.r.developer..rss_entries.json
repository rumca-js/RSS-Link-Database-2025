Each state (idle, move, attack, etc.) has its own SO, the logic is encapsulated, and transitions are controlled by a lightweight controller. The result is minimal coupling, testability, and code that reads a month later as if it were written by a sane person rather than you.</p> <p>At the same time, I started looking for a way to avoid rewriting the same template ten times for states, managers, and base classes.

A couple of years ago, AI took a good place in the scene and started to be everywhere, at the same time, the developer experience imho is not that fancy. It\u2019s a simple chat section that take control of the codebase and start auto-generating code and ends with a summary of what have been done, which is good. But, it\u2019s not enough, i think that something is missing, the agentic goal is not to make ai behave like human but the inverse, make human in control of what ai is doing without being lost and blind trust the process. Chat based experience must be enhanced from a UX pov.</p> <p>What\u2019s your main pain points when it comes to using Cursor, windsurf , claude code , copilot or any ai chatbot for dev ? </p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",
