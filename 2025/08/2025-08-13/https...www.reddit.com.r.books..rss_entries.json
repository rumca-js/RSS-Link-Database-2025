I love her way of writing and I&#39;m a huge fan of her detailed descriptions and her character&#39;s long monologues and dialogues on philosophical themes. I love some of her characters and hate some of them as well. Some of her characters and plots are so unrealistic that it&#39;s hilarious, but still, I can&#39;t help but love it as a whole.</p> <p>I hated Rowan as a person, but her character was well constructed and her actions and decisions made sense considering her personality. I mean some of her decisions made sense... She was supposedly an extremely smart, driven woman, very career-oriented, a brilliant neurosurgeon, with no interest in long-term relationships with men, just hook-ups.

I started the book by listening to the audiobook while in my car. There was a great quote somewhere before chapter four but since I was driving I couldn\u2019t jot it down. I tried to find it by skimming the book but I\u2019m not sure what caught my attention now. Does anyone have any idea what it could\u2019ve been?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Good-Win4068\"> /u/Good-Win4068 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1movrkf/quotes_from_demon_copperhead/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1movrkf/quotes_from_demon_copperhead/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I liked the first part too, I was trying to peice the woman&#39;s character and motives. However, the third part felt a bit exaggerated to me, it felt like it was too direct and didn&#39;t feel like a continuation of the first part. As a result, I still can&#39;t understand the character and motive of the woman. I would like to know what everyone else thought about her.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ArmAutomatic7576\"> /u/ArmAutomatic7576 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1mov7qv/just_finished_reading_small_boat_dont_know_how_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1mov7qv/just_finished_reading_small_boat_dont_know_how_i/\">[comments]</a></span>",
