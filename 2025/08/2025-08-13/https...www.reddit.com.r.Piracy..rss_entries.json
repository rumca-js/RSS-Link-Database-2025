Would opening them in the legit version of Harmony 24 fuck things up on either end?

My friend knows that it is not possible to simply permanently download from Apple Music. My friend wants to own all of their music and not be at the will of Apple to take down any songs.</p> <p>They also want to have a backup in case Apple makes Apple Music an even shittier service/adds on tiers like Spotify.</p> <p>The issue is that my friend has so many songs that manually torrenting each song and album would be a painstakingly slow process.
