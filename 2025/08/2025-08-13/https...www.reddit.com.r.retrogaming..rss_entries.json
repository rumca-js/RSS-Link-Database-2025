I have a boxed N64 with controllers and various cool games, a boxed Sega Mega Drive with a boxed Mega CD with Lethal Enforcers and two Justifier light guns plus controllers. Plus a boxed Xbox. Now all this stuff takes up a lot of room, there have been complaints, especially as I mostly play on PlayStation these days or MiYoo Mini so all that stuff realistically is purely for collectors value at this point. </p> <p>But I\u2019m wondering if the market for vintage gaming consoles is going to constitute to rise yoy, or will it plateau and maybe even peak as the nostalgia value slowly dies off? Or will there always be a place for stuff that\u2019s kept in great condition? </p> <p>I ask because I\u2019ve been particularly struck lately at the sometimes bizarre price movements/ manipulations of various games that are suddenly \u201chot\u201d (eg Alien Trilogy on Ps1 was very expensive at one point)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",

I&#39;d like to play Zelda LttP, and I wanted to ask you guys if you had any advice on how to get the best experience if I&#39;m playing it on PC. I know there&#39;s the original SNES and GBA port, with the SNES port definitely looking better but does the GBA port add anything new of significance?</p> <p>Interestingly, I found a LttP Recompile on GitHub, but I keep running into this error that I can&#39;t figure out how to fix because I&#39;m trying to do this on Linux and there&#39;s a call to CMD, which is a Windows terminal, that I can&#39;t figure out how to bypass. If this is considered &quot;the best&quot; way to play LttP, I can keep digging for a solution, but I wanted to ask you guys of any other ways to play before wasting all that time into repairing this before ultimately just playing a rom on RetroArch.</p> <p>Any input is appreciated.
