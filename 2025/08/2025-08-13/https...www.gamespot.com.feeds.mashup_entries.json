Overall, the performance of Storm Ruler will be increased, even when the attack power isn't charged with the storm. However, those upgrades come with a tweak that removes the bug that allowed players to use Storm Ruler without burning through FP.</p><p>The update also includes a number of other bug fixes, including one that addresses slowdown for other players when using too many Sorceries and Incantations.
