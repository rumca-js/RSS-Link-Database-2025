But they do not allow users to interact with the content.</p> <p>Existing attempts like MDX, web components, and embedding html/jss directly in markdown are compile time only, non-portable, and security risks.</p> <p>This is why I created Markdown UI, an open MIT standard for easily embedding UI in markdown. The UI widgets are just simple JSON objects inside the markdown and are parsed into web component XML tags. Then any renderer (React/Svelte/Vue/Swift etc.) can render the component into actual UI on the platform and emit standardised {id, value} events to the application for capturing and processing.</p> <p>The standard is designed to be minimal, extensible, and secure.</p> <p>Here is the live demo: <a href=\"http://markdown-ui.com\">markdown-ui.com</a></p> <p>Here is the GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/BlueprintDesignLab/markd",
