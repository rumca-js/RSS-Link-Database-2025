Now, the mouse gets detected in the software inside Windows, not inside Linux when the program is ran through Wine. Now, this isnt that much of a big issue for me at all, as I see these softwares as bloatware, but actually, it is purely out of curiosity. My main question is, why is it essentially capable of getting detected in Windows perfectly, yet not at all in Linux?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019m in a bit of a tech dilemma and could really use some advice. I have a Windows 10 PC with 24 gigs of ram and an i7-7700T paired with a GTX 1070</p> <p>The problem is, my CPU isn\u2019t officially supported for Windows 11. I know I can bypass the system check and install it anyway, but I\u2019m worried about performance since my pc is already a bit on the older side.</p> <p>The other option I\u2019ve been considering is switching to Linux (maybe something like Elementary OS), which I know would run lighter and probably make my pc feel faster. But the big issue with Linux for me is that a lot of Windows-only apps (especially games) don\u2019t run natively. You can use things like Wine or Proton, but that usually means some performance loss or potential bugs.</p> <p>The main thing I care about is being able to play games like Roblox &amp; roblox studio, or forza without major issues. I\u2019m not sure if Roblox/studio runs well on Linux or if I should jus",
