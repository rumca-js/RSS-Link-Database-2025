His target wasn't jewels, or fossils, or the Declaration of Independence. It was bird skins. It took just over a year for authorities to track him down, largely because the authorities couldn't imagine what a thief would want with hundreds of skinned birds. So let's talk about what museums do with these skins, why Rist wanted them, and the researcher who found himself in the middle of this story. \n\nThanks to Richard Prum for appearing in this video!\n\nHosted by: Stefan Chin (he/him)\n\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon supporters for help",
