The design that we showed off back in March were\npreliminary designs. We\u2019ve been able to tweak and improve the\nindustrial design quite a bit since then. I think it\u2019s turned out\nfantastically well! I even have a working albeit early engineering\nsample on my wrist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These look good. Fundamentally Pebble-y but with smaller-than-ever (for Pebble) screen bezels.</p>\n\n<p>I stand by <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/repebble-watches\">what I wrote back in March</a>, though. They should make just one new watch, not two. In March I suggested making",
