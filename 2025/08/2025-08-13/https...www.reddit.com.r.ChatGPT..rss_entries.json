Something fundamental has changed in how it communicates.The writing style that made 4o distinctive that natural, engaging way it connected with users has been stripped away. Where conversations once felt fluid and personable, there&#39;s now a more sterile, corporate tone that keeps you at arm&#39;s length. It&#39;s like talking to someone who&#39;s had their personality smoothed out by committee. The spontaneity, the warmth, the ability to match your energy and communicate in a way that felt genuinely collaborative ,that&#39;s been nerfed. This isn&#39;t just about preference or nostalgia. When an AI loses its ability to connect authentically, it fundamentally changes the user experience. We&#39;re not just losing features, we&#39;re losing the essence of what made those interactions valuable in the first place. The deceptive nature behind what Open AI has done here is a slap in the face",
