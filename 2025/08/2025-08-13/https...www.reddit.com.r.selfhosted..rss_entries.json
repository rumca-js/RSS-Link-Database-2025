With it you can rename any number of tv shows, movies, seasons, or episodes with a single command. An interactive preview is shown before any changes are made. Intelligent parsing of file names and directory context allows this tool to handle any naming convention found on the web. If you find media names that can&#39;t be parsed automatically by Title Tidy, feel free to open and issue and I&#39;ll get it fixed! </p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Digital-Shane/title-tidy?tab=readme-ov-file#commands\">Four command are included, check out the project readme to watch demo gifs of them all!</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Shows</strong> - Rename show directories, seasons, and episode and subtitles all in one command.</li> <li><strong>Movies</strong> - Renames movies.

My question is i\u2019m just wanting to know if there\u2019s possibly a more secure way of doing anything that i\u2019m currently doing. Additionally, I have a few important services that are also exposed, however I have access controls setup for my IP only. Are there any potential flaws in this decision? To my knowledge it might be somewhat possible to spoof an IP in the case some unauthorized identity wants to gain access to these services, allowing them to bypass the acl. Anyways, what is everyone\u2019s opinion on ",
