It toppled a minor kingdom, forced displaced people into rival territories, and sparked a religious reform movement decades later.

Jeff Hayes is incredibly talented and listening to the Dcc books has been better than reading them. I have about 1.5 books in the series before I\u2019m caught up. </p> <p>Historically listening to books has been my least favorite way of consuming them. I\u2019m curious if there are other book series that are better listening than reading, either due to the narrator or the way the book is written. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/aquadog13\"> /u/aquadog13 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mopvvs/audible_recommendations/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mopvvs/audible_recommendations/\">[comments]</a></span>",
