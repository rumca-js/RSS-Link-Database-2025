Heck I came across a one hour long video on YouTube giving advice, telling the history, explaining ways to transitioning and the culture around transitioning from MtF or transfemme. I could barely find any for trans men or transmasc. I also came across a lot of trans women, transfemme, or at the minimum femboy content than I did the opposite, even meme videos leaned far more towards transfemme which was a little disheartening. This is not to say that there is anything wrong with trans women or transfemme content, it just sucks to not have much to work with. There&#39;s little transmasc representation even in media.</p> <p>S",

And I\u2019ve eaten her out roughly the same. We have had 3 sessions alone. </p> <p>She said she has no desire or feelings when it happens but says when she is bored she will let me practice using my tongue to give me experience and to learn. </p> <p>I\u2019m not sure what to make of this. Is this normal? Is she secretly bisexual or a person who is hypersexual and will use anyone to satisfy herself? ",
