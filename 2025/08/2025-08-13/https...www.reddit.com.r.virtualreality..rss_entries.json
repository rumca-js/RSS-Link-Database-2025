I have a mid tier gaming pc I\u2019m looking to link to so, I have a couple questions. 1. Does the MQ3 come with a PC link cable? 2. The official link cable is around $70.00 from the Meta website so if I order a cheaper one from a 3rd party manufacturer will I get the same visual quality? And if not, should I be on the lookout for a specific brand?
