Went through a step-by-step guide to get it up and running, both locally and in the cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP). The cloud deploys in minutes, while local gives more control\u2014curious how you&#39;d weigh those trade-offs in your workflow.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the guide I referenced (just in case anyone\u2019s interested): <a href=\"https://www.techlatest.net/support/parrotos_linux/\">https://www.techlatest.net/support/parrotos_linux/</a></p> <p>Would love to hear: Your setup : cloud marketplaces vs running locally via VMs or containers? Speed vs control: cloud is quick, but do you lose customization or security visibility? Use cases: what\u2019s your go-to when you&#39;re hunting, reverse engineering, or doing privacy-first tasks?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",
