The technical challenge seemed straightforward, I would combine web scraping, LLM reasoning, and email automation into one system that would self-improve over time.</p> <p>But when I started building it, I noticed a huge flaw. The agent could utilize various services on my behalf, but there was no way to give it the specific, bounded permissions it needed to operate safely.

And never to anyone at these competitors, and definitely not to anyone in my personal contacts.&quot;</p> <p>Sure, you could build custom constraints into each tool.
