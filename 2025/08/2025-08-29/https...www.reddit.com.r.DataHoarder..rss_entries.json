I tried mounting one on pop!os (ubuntu) with a card reader, and the exfat filesystem wasn&#39;t recognized, so I tried the internet-suggested fixes without immediate results. It&#39;s really a pop!os group question, but since I&#39;m going to copy to mirrored drives in a dual USB bay, the motivation fits here, and maybe someone has tackled this. Aside from effort to fix exfat+linux, I wonder if dd would be faster on i/o, and maybe I&#39;ll never need to parse the filesystems anyway. (Macos won&#39;t mount the SD&#39;s either, but for one I put in a camera, the download program showed the photos ok.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/phobrain\"> /u/phobrain </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1n32qy2/exfat_sd_cards_on_ubuntu_get_exfat_working_or_dd/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>",

If either disk in a RAID 0 pair dies, a full logical drive dies (1 of 6). This means you would need three 10TB drives to die, or one/both of the 5TB drives in a single ",
