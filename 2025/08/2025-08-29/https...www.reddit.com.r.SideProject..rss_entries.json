Here\u2019s the problem: notes apps are great for capturing ideas, but terrible for finding them later. Your best thoughts just get buried. Digital Memory fixes that. Every time you save something, the app automatically gives it a clear title and tags so you can rediscover it later. The magic is in the search. It\u2019s semantic \u2014 meaning it understands what you mean, not just the exact words you used. Example: I once saved \u201cremind me to look into credit cards with good travel points.\u201d A week later, I typed \u201cshow me that thing about free flights\u201d and it instantly pulled it up. It\u2019s free, simple, and already feels essential. If you\u2019ve ever lost your own ideas in a sea of notes, this might be the fix.
