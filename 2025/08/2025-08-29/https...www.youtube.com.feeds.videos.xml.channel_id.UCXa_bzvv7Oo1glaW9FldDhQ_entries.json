        "description": "NBA 2K26 signals a significant leap forward for the basketball simulation series, with Visual Concept layering numerous gameplay changes on top of last year\u2019s foundation. \n\nThis video outlines 15 big differences present in this year\u2019s iteration when compared to 2K25, including an upgraded ProPLAY Motion Engine which provides smoother dribbling and more dynamic plays, while new skill-based features like Quick Protect and custom layups put greater creativity in players\u2019 hands.\n\nDefense has been overhauled with smarter AI, while more physical contests emerge across the entire court. Offensive AI now replicates real-world strategy via expanded playbooks and attacking intelligence. In-game presentation receives an upgrade too, with enhanced player fidelity and crowd atmosphere capturing the energy of a real NBA game. Finally, the monumental NBA-WNBA crossover stakes a claim for 2K26 being a franchise reset.",
