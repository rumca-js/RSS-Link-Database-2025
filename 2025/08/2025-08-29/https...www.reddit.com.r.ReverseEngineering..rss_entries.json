It helps understand how the application works, what&#39;s the flow, architecture etc.</p> <p>While Reverse Engineering can be used in many areas, I&#39;m focusing on learning aspect. I extract Algorithms, Data structures and other core concepts that are used in the app. </p> <p>Finally it enable learning by breaking the project into series of mini projects that users can code themselves and learn. I&#39;ve got around 30 beta users now. Planning to add things like What-if scenarios to let users change the code and see the impact.</p> <p>Curious to know what this group thinks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bills2go\"> /u/bills2go </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.revibe.codes\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comm",
