        "description": "What a feat of engineering. The Tower of All Hallows Staining has seen a lot during the 700 years it\u2019s been standing in the heart of London \u2014 but surely nothing quite like this \ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f\n\nThanks to the development of the 36-storey Fifty Fenchurch, a new scheme designed by Eric Parry Architects, the Grade I-listed tower now finds itself balancing on stilts above a bustling construction site while new below-ground foundation and basement works are completed beneath it.\n\nPassers-by at street-level might not notice the landmark's precarious position, but take a look at the site from above and the jeopardy is all too clear. \n\nThe historic tower was first constructed in 1320 and is now all that\u2019s left of the original church it was attached to, which collapsed during the Great Fire of London in 1666.",
