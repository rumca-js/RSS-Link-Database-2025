This guy&#39;s been through some serious shit.. some people may remember me running Windows 11 on it. Some might remember running Arch virtual machine without hardware acceleration inside of windows 11 and then running DOOM on it. But now as a Linux guy i decided that Arch is the was on this boy so I did it. Process is pretty straightforward and easy to anyone who has ever installed Arch and messed with Android phones internals. I got it working in a couple of hours. What works: *Wifi/Bluetooth *Touchscreen,120hz panel *Audio *GPU (Adreno 640) and CPU, obviously *Dualboot with Android system *USB for data transfer What does not: *Charging (weird, may fix in the future)</p> <p>Well, I haven&#39;t done much with it yet bc I&#39;ve just finished everything but I&#39;m definitely going to make touchscreen work properly ",

Recently I scored a nice laptop from my company, as a laptop for mail, videos and low level productivity i think it will be perfect. It is a gen 1 Thinkpad L15, I was wondering from your experience who has this laptop, what you&#39;d suggest to be the best running distro? On my old 2014 macbook air I still use Mint, it runs perfectly fine and fast and i am very familiar with it, however I have used many other distros and I am open for something light and new. Please be advised that I am not a pro, simply a enthusiast.

This isn&#39;t about just getting paid, but about transparency and showing exactly where the time goes on a project. I spend most of my time on Linux machines, so compatibility is important to me.</p> <p>My current system of self-logging is so prone to errors and doesn&#39;t always provide the kind of detailed reports some clients want. I am tempted to try Monitask for screenshot monitoring and app/website tracking which I think could technically provide proof for clients, but I&#39;m not entirely sold on a closed-source solution for the long run, and it felt a bit heavy for what I actually need.</p> <p>What are fellow Linux users in the freelance or small agency world doing for efficient project time tracking? Are there FOSS options you swear by that pro",
