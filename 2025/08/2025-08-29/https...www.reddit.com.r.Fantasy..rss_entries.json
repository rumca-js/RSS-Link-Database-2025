Even though other works <em>can</em> use them, and even if SW/Naruto/etc aren\u2019t the actual \u201coriginal\u201d, it seems like later works using those, even generically (eg generic laser sword works differently from lightsabers), draw (negative) comparisons to the \u201coriginal.\u201d</p> <p>We have the term Tolkienesque which can apply to things like \u201cTolkien races.\u201d I think this term is (now) used naturally, not that a person is \u201cripping off Tolkien\u201d.

Why do you read fantasy over sci-fi (I don&#39;t mean exclusively, just why you prefer fantasy over sci-fi)?</p> <p>Really want to deep-dive on this question. So please, tell me: What does fantasy do for you that no other genre can replicate? Is it magic? Is it weird and wonderful creatures? The way it conveys a fundamental love of adventure? The feeling of being plopped into a fictional world that has been 100% designed from scratch in every conceivable detail?</p> <p>Something else, perhaps? Do you feel as if it&#39;s something on the verge of the mystical, that fantasy has the power to show you the imagination is not a factory of make-believe, but in some deeply ineffable way, is really an organ of perception? Somewhere, somehow, those places are <em>real?</em></p> <p>Tell me what is it. I&#39;m compiling and writing",

One of the things I liked about it was the way the empire was depicted. It has many flaws, sure, but there are people working to fix these flaws and ultimately, the empire&#39;s depicted as a good thing. </p> <p>It&#39;s honestly pretty refreshing. Most of the fantasy novels I&#39;ve read lately generally have the opposite going. Point to the king/emperor/most powerful character in the book (not including the protagonist ofc) and odds are, he&#39;s the big bad villain of the series,.</p> <p>Are there any books that defy this trend?
