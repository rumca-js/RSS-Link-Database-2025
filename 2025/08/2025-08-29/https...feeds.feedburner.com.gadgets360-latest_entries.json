Using its infrared vision, Webb detected crystalline silicates, large dust grains, and carbon-rich PAH molecules within the nebula\u2019s dusty torus. These discoveries reveal how dying stars recycle minerals and organic compounds, spreading raw materials that seed new stars, planets, and potentially life itself. Reported in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, the findings highlight planetary nebulae as vital factories for planet-building ingredients.",
