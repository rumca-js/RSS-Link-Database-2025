        "description": "Mitochondria are cellular organelles that play an important role in making ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the molecular fuel that powers most cellular functions. These organelles originated over a billion years ago when a primitive archaeal cell entered into a symbiotic relationship with an ancestral bacterium. Over time, mitochondria became essential for metabolism and energy production, while transferring most of their genes to the host. As a result, they now rely on the host cell to supply most of their proteins, which are synthesized by ribosomes outside the organelle and must be properly delivered to mitochondria.",

One star weighs about 93 times the mass of our sun, while its companion tips the scales at roughly 70 solar masses. Together, they represent one of the most massive binary systems ever discovered in our galaxy.",

        "description": "Solid as they are, rocks are not static materials with constant properties. Even small loads are enough to alter their mechanical properties; their reaction to being deformed is a loss of stiffness. Rocks which have been damaged in such a way are then less able to withstand loads, such as gravity or tectonic stresses. This phenomenon is therefore of relevance for understanding the occurrence of material failure, as in landslides or earthquakes.",

That's because that crystal is much easier to split into uniform, easily measurable samples. But in 2024, researchers found a way to grow good crystals that are very similar to the highest temperature superconductor.",
