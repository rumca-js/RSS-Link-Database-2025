        "description": "The German prosecutor investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann 18 years ago has told the BBC that his chief suspect - the convicted rapist Christian Brueckner - will be released from jail in less than three weeks time. \n\nPolice in Germany don't believe they have enough evidence to bring charges against him over Madeleine's disappearance, even though he's still considered to be dangerous. \n\nMr Brueckner, who used to live near to where Madeleine McCann disappeared, is a convicted child sex offender, who has denied any involvement. He\u2019s currently in jail in Germany serving a 7-year sentence for raping a pensioner.\n\nBen Brown presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Phil Mackie.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

        "description": "Today, Adam Fleming discusses the US Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook suing President Donald Trump after he attempted to fire her.\n\nPresident Trump claims she made false statements on her mortgage, and says he has the authority to remove her. Cook has said there is \"no cause exists under the law\" to sack her. At the same time Trump is in another public dispute with the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. How will both battles end? Adam speaks to BBC chief presenter Caitriona Perry in Washington.\n\nAdam is also joined by Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats who is boycotting President Trump\u2019s UK state banquet in protest of Trump and Keir Starmer\u2019s position on the escalating situation in Gaza.\n\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.
