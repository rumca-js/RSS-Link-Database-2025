        "description": "OpenAI recently released its first open-weights model since GPT-2, entering a field led by DeepSeek and Alibaba's Qwen.\n\nYC's Ankit Gupta breaks down everything you need to know about these top OSS models, including what sets them apart under the hood. He\u2019ll compare their approaches to mixture-of-experts, long-context training, and post-training techniques that shape reasoning and alignment\u2014and explore how different design choices lead to surprisingly similar performance.\n\nApply to Y Combinator: https://www.ycombinator.com/apply\nWork at a startup: https://www.ycombinator.com/jobs\n\n00:00 \u2013 OpenAI OSS Launch\n01:00 \u2013 Comparing Open Source LLM Architectures\n01:46 \u2013 GPT OSS Overview\n02:37 \u2013 Under The Hood of GPT OSS\n03:25 \u2013 Qwen-3 Architecture\n04:17 \u2013 Qwen-3 Training\n05:12 \u2013 Qwen-3 Post-Training\n06:08 \u2013 Qwen-3 Reasoning & RL Innovations\n06:52 \u2013 DeepSeek V3 Overview\n07:40 \u2013 DeepSeek V3.1 Updates\n08:39 \u2013 Attention Mechanism (MLA)\n09:39 \u2013 Comparing Model Sizes\n10:35 \u2013 Long Context Strategies\n",
