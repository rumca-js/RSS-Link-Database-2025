Stripped of their physical forms, they endure endless psychological and physical torment, with one survivor, Ted, narrating their desperate struggle against AM&#39;s sadistic control. </p> <p>Ellison\u2019s vivid, poetic prose delivers a relentless assault of psychological and physical horrors, making every page claustrophobic and visceral, that too with amazing word economy. The story\u2019s exploration of human resilience, existential dread, and technology\u2019s dark potential feels unsettling and just around the corner in 2025. </p> <p>This the most bleak and full of hate text that I have ever read, that ",
