I&#39;ve only recently (with the looming threat of palantir and the fact that I&#39;m an American) begun taking privacy seriously. I&#39;ve heard the term GDPR used in a legal context. More specifically, as a law to be invoked when asking discord to delete all messages. But I&#39;ve heard it can be used in many other contexts. How could I go about using this law with Google? Or with Reddit? Would that be possible at all? I&#39;m afraid Google already has my ID (cut me some slack, I was naive), so I&#39;m pretty worried now.
