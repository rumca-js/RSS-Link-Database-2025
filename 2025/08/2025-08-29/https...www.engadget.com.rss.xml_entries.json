The show also attracts thousands of public attendees, which gives the show a fairground twist in places. This year, Netflix dominated one of the halls with a faux <em>One Piece</em> ship, sports stadium, a <em>Wednesday</em>-themed cafe and a <em>Stranger Things</em> ice cream stall.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, while Nintendo didn\u2019t have anything new to show, it had plenty of Switch 2 consoles to convince the not-yet-convinced \u2014 and some of them had <em>Silksong</em>. Microsoft, too, had a substantial presence, revealing an October 16 launch date for its Xbox Ally duo of handheld gaming PCs. No price, though.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While you can",
