        "description": "Schluter pipe seal tips\u2026I apply ALL-SET with a 3-inch joint compound knife and KERDI trowel. Then I embed the 3/4-inch pipe seal, there are also 1/2-inch versions. I make that flat and remove excess thin-set mortar. This makes a watertight seal against the brass nipple which is for the handheld shower wand.
