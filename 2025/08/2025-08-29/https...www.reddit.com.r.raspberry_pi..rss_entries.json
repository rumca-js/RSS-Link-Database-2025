They also had firewire as IO for getting video to and from tape. Problem with that is getting video on and off tape is a linear task that has to be done in real time, no drag and dropping videos off an SD Card. Sony came up with this device to solve that problem. <a href=\"https://www.sony-asia.com/microsite/professional/hdv/pdf/HVR-DR60_MRC1K.pdf\">HVR-DR60_MRC1K</a>. It directly captures the firewire stream to a hard disk.</p> <p>These were introduced in 2008 and no longer made, so they fetch a handsome price on ebay. With the mechanical tape drives in these devices failing with no replacement parts, I decided to start tackling making a new one using a Raspberry Pi 5 to introduce a new supply of similar devices.</p> <p>Last weekend I got myself some hardware.
