All last school year, she\u2019s had a crush on this girl in her class, BB. They became friends, and over the summer got really close. Last week, Kai came to her mom and me and asked if she could take BB out to dinner. We would all go together, but she and BB would sit at a separate table. I thought it was the cutest idea ever, as did my wife. Before we went, my wife texted with BB\u2019s parents to make sure it was okay, and we were given permission to take her. We didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be any issues because BB had told Kai that her parents are supportive of her queerness and liked Kai. </p> <p>Yesterday was the dinner. Both girls had the idea to wear dresses with Doc Marten boots. BB had won Kai a stuffed animal at the arcade the night before, and Kai brought BB flowers. I went to the door with Kai to get BB, and met her mom. I explained what restaurant we were goin",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi I 22 FtM, have a fear of men and dislike a majority of cis men and even hate myself for being a man I have a complicated relationship with my identity I don&#39;t want to be a man or am trying to be a man I just am a man, I ran from it tried to identify any which way that wasn&#39;t a trans man until ultimately I accepted I am a man I go by he him and had a double mastectomy that helps alleviate dysphoria. For this reason I have to live in an all male group home and I HATE it. These men don&#39;t wash their hands after going to the bathroom leave the toilet seat covered in pubes and piss, eat my food I pay for with my money. I&#39;ve never been able to fully relax around cis men. I feel so alone like there&#39;s no other trans men like this out there. Is there anyone out there who feels this way I also have sexual trauma with male perpetrators stemming back to when I was 4. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",
