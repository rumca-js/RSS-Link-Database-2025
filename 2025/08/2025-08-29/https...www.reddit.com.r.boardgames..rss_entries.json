Should I be concerned that they will say it&#39;s been over 30 day if they don&#39;t respond soon?

The gameplay seems fun at first, however we&#39;ve never actually been able to win in four games. In a desperate bid to see if we were all just too <em>selfish</em> to survive this game, I tried playing literally by myself to see if I could make it back to the ship alive without worrying about other players-- and I died anyway!</p> <p>This is even after we nerfed the game&#39;s difficulty. The rules say that you die if at any point you don&#39;t have Oxygen in your hand, but we changed it to dying if you end your turn without Oxygen to give everyone one last chance to draw an oxygen card or something.</p> <p>The game can only be won by reaching the space station alive. Even if you are the last player standing, you have to cross six spaces (often more, since there&#39;s a chance of landing on a space that sends you backward) to win. Every turn you draw one car",
