        "description": "I long to meet you, in a charming little town.\nRounding street corners, climbing treetops, zipping through alleys.\nHiding on shelves for a secret peek, weaving between the feet of passersby, swishing my tail to the music, brushing past with a swagger.\nWaves lap lazily at the shore as sunset cautiously nestles onto the rooftops. The time on the wall ticks audibly, from dawn till dusk.\nWaiting for you to turn around, waiting to meet your gaze.\nThe moment we meet, sundered bonds will be mended anew.\nThe eighty-one Planes all shine for you.",
