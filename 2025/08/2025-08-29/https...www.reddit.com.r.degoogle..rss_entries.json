I\u2019ve been curious about how these changes will be implemented. For example on Samsung phones purchased in the EU, we can disable almost all apps from the settings, including Google Play Services. This is mandated by EU law, and there\u2019s no way this feature will be removed. This has led me to a thought: since Google will enforce the sideloading blocks, we might be able to bypass them. The EU law requires phone manufacturers to allow us to disable or delete apps like Google Play Services. If the sideloading feature is implemented through these services, it would essentially be possible to bypass it. However, I\u2019m not certain about all of this, so please correct me if I\u2019m wrong. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/netriz314\"> /u/netriz314 </a> ",

It might not seem like a huge deal at first, but it really affects how much control we have over our devices.</p> <p>Custom Android ROMs used to get around these limitations, giving users the freedom to experiment, try new apps, and truly take control of their phones. If we want that back, it\u2019s worth exploring alternatives like Android forks.</p> <p>Convenience is nice, but protecting user choice, privacy, and innovation is even more important.

But i don&#39;t think that hosting a second PC rig just for storage is energy-efficient.</p> <p>About PC its much clear variant for me. Because i can buy a motherboard with like 10 NVME slots / or SATA 3. And make RAID 0 (i think?). That will save data on both drives to prevent data loss if one of the drives fails.</p> <p>If making a raid, wnd installing the drive is not an issue. There is another problem. What software do I use to host cloud storage? I&#39;m considering Linux software, because i eill use Windows VM after i buy all hardware stuff (i hate windows, but i don&#39;t like linux either).</p> <p>Of course there is a thing about port forward, and i used AnyDesk and Parsec before.
