It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BP94J8VD/\">$549.99 right now on Amazon</a> (half its launch price of $1,099.99).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF is a 34-inch ultrawide curved design, using the semi-standard 3440\u00d71440 resolution. That means this is basically a 27-inch monitor stretched out to the cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio. On top of that gorgeous OLED panel with its near-perfect contrast, it\u2019s packing a 165Hz refresh rate. While that isn\u2019t as fast as some more recent OLED gaming monitors, it should be enough to make your desktop PC sweat with newer 3D games ",
