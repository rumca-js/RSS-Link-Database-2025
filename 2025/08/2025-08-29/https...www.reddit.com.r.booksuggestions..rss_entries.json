I liked the fast pace and, surprisingly to me, the inconclusive ending. Can anyone suggest something similar? </p> <p>I know Stephen King has a few other novellas but all the ones that show up on Google are ones of which I&#39;ve seen the film (The Mist, The Body, Shawshank, etc). I&#39;d prefer no spoilers.</p> <p>Stephen King or not, anyone have any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PyroPrirate\"> /u/PyroPrirate </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1n3igrh/books_like_elevation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1n3igrh/books_like_elevation/\">[comments]</a></span>",

With that in mind, I\u2019m looking for a few titles that are a bit more upbeat WITHOUT being saccharine or sappy or toothless. Maybe the better word for what I\u2019m looking for is \u201cgentle\u201d while avoiding \u201cwholesome.\u201d</p> <p>An example of what I\u2019m looking for is Yeonnam-Dong\u2019s Smiley Laundromat by Kim Jiyun. It navigates heavy themes and issues without becoming dark, but doesn\u2019t put such a positive twist on it that I\u2019d roll my eyes. </p> <p>I love YA, mysteries, contemporary fiction, and speculative fiction.

I love this club and I joined it to switch up from what I usually read. They need something that will grab their attention and keep their attention. I don\u2019t really care for smut but if there\u2019s some sprinkled in I wouldn\u2019t mind it. I like a little comedy sprinkled in as well. As long as the characters are fleshed out and the author isn\u2019t too wordy with out too many plot holes, my club will love it.

Not even for my GCSE English literature haha. </p> <p>Recently, Iv had this weird, like impulse or \u201ccraving\u201d to read a book. I love soppy, romantic stories. Friends or enemies to lovers tropes, anything of the sort to make me bawl my eyes at the end. </p> <p>If not romantic novels, I loved the hunger games movies so maybe something dystopian or such! </p> <p>As I\u2019m clearly not a big reader, I\u2019d prefer a nice easy-read.</p> <p>Any recommendations for me?
