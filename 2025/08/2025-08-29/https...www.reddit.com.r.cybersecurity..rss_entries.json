We find the dashboards really poor and limited on what you can do. With the vulnerabilities we have 60 days before they are reported to upper management but sometimes they slip through because we don\u2019t notice them on the reports or dashboards we have, so I\u2019m wondering how other people have this set up and maybe better solution to what we do. Is there anyway to link R7 to Jira to raise tickets. Very interested on other people\u2019s views and thoughts.
