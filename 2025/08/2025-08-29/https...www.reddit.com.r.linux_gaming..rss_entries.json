I have started and enabled the service in systemctl (&quot;systemctl --user start gamemoded&quot; and &quot;systemctl --user enable gamemoded&quot;). Yet when I run gamemoded -s, it always states its inactive. systemctl also reports that it&#39;s active, but also deactivated:</p> <blockquote> <p>[priest@HOMEONE ~]$ systemctl --user status gamemoded<br/> \u25cf gamemoded.service - gamemoded<br/> Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/user/gamemoded.ser",

After the most recent windows update, which was I forced to install, was reportedly bricking sdd&#39;s it was the final straw. Install was smooth, I tried to install steam via the terminal, which didn&#39;t work, it said some binaries were missing. So I tried the package manager, no dice. Considering I hadn&#39;t actually done anything yet and the install was very quick I decided to just reinstall the whole OS, and then download steam from the package manager, which did work. I had some other small issues getting openRGB and Mangohud to work, but other than that it&#39;s been very smooth.

So, similar to the issue I was having in <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mwxbwc/borderlands_3_screen_going_black/\">Borderlands 3</a>, Bright Memory is also cutting out at very inopportune times and making the game pretty much unplayable. This time, however, adding <code>PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 %command%</code> to launch options does not solve the problem and in fact may even make it worse. Again, I&#39;ve tried different screen resolutions, different versions of Proton. I&#39;m actually stuck using GE-Proton9-27 due to some graphical issues I have with newer versions. Coloured test patterns where there should be graphics. The game gives you different versions of DirectX to launch with and I&#39;ve tried them all to no avail.</p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions? Again, I&#39;m running CachyOS KDE. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Huecuva\"> /u/Huecuva </a> <br/",
