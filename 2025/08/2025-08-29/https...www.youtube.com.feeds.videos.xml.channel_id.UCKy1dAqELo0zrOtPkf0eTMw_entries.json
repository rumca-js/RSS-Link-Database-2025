        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nA fresh batch of PlayStation 6 rumors claim that the next Sony console will be a family of devices, including a handheld and an 'S' version of the console, similar to the Xbox Series S. The PS6 has not been announced, but Sony has teased they're working on the console. The PS6 handheld will reportedly be dockable and be cheaper than the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally X handheld (which does not yet have a price). In other news, Cyberpunk 2077's Switch 2 edition is selling well, and maybe unsurprisingly 75% of sales are of the game's physical release. The full base game and the Phantom Liberty DLC are included on the 64GB cartridge, unlike some Switch 2 game key carts that only provide a license for the game which still needs to be downloaded from the eShop. And finally, Elden Ring Nightreign's ultra-hard Deep of Night mode has an official release date of September 11.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PlayStation",

There's not much going on in the black-and-white photo\u2014just star Ryan Gosling and costar FLynn Gray hanging out on what looks like a landspeeder\u2014as production has only recently gotten underway. It's directed by Deadpool & Wolverine's Shawn Levy, and will be out in 2027. In other news, Crystal Dynamics has let go of an unknown number of workers following the cancelation of Perfect Dark. The game was in development hell for years, but showed signs of life last year with a new gameplay video, until Microsoft ultimately decided to pull the plug. And finally, PlayStation Plus is getting an Xbox game, with Psychonauts 2 leading the pack of new games coming to the service. The game was developed by Microsoft-owned Doublefine Studios.\n\n#ign",
