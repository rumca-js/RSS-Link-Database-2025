When selecting the resolution scale, wouldn\u2019t I want the 1.0 ratio (meaning 1 to 1)? Why wouldn\u2019t it be set to 1 to 1 scale by default? Do I match my quest 3 HZ to the pc app I\u2019m using (virtual desktop, Steam VR, Quest Link) HZ or higher? My PC isn\u2019t top of the line but also isn\u2019t the worst and I\u2019ll be playing wireless PCVR mostly. I know about the having your PC wired to the router for best experience.

The BSB 2 + additionals are just simply too much outside of my budget.</p> <p>The small form factor have always been attractive to me but I have a very small playspace ",

The cold old house seems to stand right in front of you, with dark stairs and creaking wooden doors all around. Compared to a TV, VR amplifies that sense of oppression several times over. For instance, in the &quot;hide-and-seek clap&quot; scene, in VR, I could clearly hear the clapping from the dark corner, as if the hand would reach my shoulder in the next second. This immersive experience no longer makes me just a viewer but one of the characters in the film. </p> <p>The true soul of a horror movie is actually the sound.

I\u2019ll mainly be using it for video calls, long meetings, and focus time, but I\u2019d also like decent performance if I step outside or work in a coffee shop.</p> <p>Has anyone here used either (or both)?
