Part of the monstersaur lineage, Bolg reveals that multiple large lizards coexisted with dinosaurs, suggesting a thriving ecosystem. Its discovery in long-stored fossils underscores how museums hold hidden scientific gems.",

A newly discovered fossil, astonishingly well-preserved, reveals Kostensuchus atrox, a powerful 3.5-meter-long apex predator with crushing jaws and sharp teeth capable of devouring medium-sized dinosaurs. As one of the largest hunters of its time and the first of its kind found in the Chorrillo Formation, this find offers rare insight into the prehistoric ecosystem at the close of the Cretaceous.",
