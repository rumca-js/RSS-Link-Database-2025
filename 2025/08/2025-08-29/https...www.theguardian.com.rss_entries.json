Both have been caught in the meat grinder of Uefa\u2019s endless European qualifiers.

I definitely knew what this drink would look like long before I developed it, because I found myself leaning towards green flavours that have a great affinity with a smoky, vegetal mezcal.

Clare Carlisle found hers in a&nbsp;cave halfway up a mountain.</p><p>It happened 20 years ago: walking on a&nbsp;Himalayan path, she met a holy man who lived in a cave nearby. Not your stereotypical sadhu, he didn\u2019t have matted hair and wasn\u2019t semi-naked but wore nice trousers and an acrylic pullover. Nor did he have any obvious wisdom to impart; at the last of their three meetings, he and Carlisle mainly got stoned and giggled about the chicken-like patterns on a cushion she had brought him as a gift. Yet, after leaving, she felt a \u201cyearning\u201d for something that they had shared: a&nbsp;sense that there could be a more \u201cnoble\u201d&nbsp;way of living, or that we could experience \u201ctranscendence\u201d, a higher perspective on life.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/29/transcend",
