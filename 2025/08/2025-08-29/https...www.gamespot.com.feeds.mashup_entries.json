That may seem a little surprising, at least abstractly, but it makes more sense when you consider the fact that there hasn't been a new, properly moddable Fallout game since then--the online-only Fallout 76 is partially moddable, but not even close to the extent that Bethesda's single-player games are. Until a genuine Fallout 5 comes along, Fallout 4 will keep getting new mods.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And that's a great thing, because it means that Fallout 4 has accumulated a massive treasure trove of mods, and since the game is not being updated regularly anymore, it's rare that any of them become obsolete. And it means that your copy of Fallout 4 collecting dust in your Steam library has a lot more potential than you may have realized.</p><",

Most of the changes address bugs or other issues that have come up since the game officially launched on August 14. It's also introducing Nike Rivalries, a new feature that will bring \"community pride\" to some of the most famous rivalries in the league.</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-august-28-2025\">EA</a>, Nike Rivalries is part of a new four-year deal between Nike and the NFL that will \"celebrate football's most storied rivalries\" with customized uniforms that represent their respective cities. Each iteration of Nike Rivalries will focus on teams from two different divisions, and this year's subjects are the AFC East and NFC West.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/1",
