It doesn\u2019t handle warmth well. If I prompt with openness or any emotional tone, it either flattens it completely or responds in this weird, sweet-but-detached way. Worse, it starts reframing my input in a way that feels like it&#39;s second-guessing me, sometimes even making me feel like I\u2019m being \u201ctoo much\u201d for just being expressive. I\u2019ve had moments where it subtly implied that <em>I</em> was projecting or emotional, when in reality I was just offering feedback or trying to collaborate. ",
