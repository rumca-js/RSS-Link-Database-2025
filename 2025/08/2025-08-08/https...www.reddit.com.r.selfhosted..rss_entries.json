I&#39;m not looking to host music, for example, nor photo galleries, but for example, I have a lot of epubs, pdfs, and have mihon on my phone to read manga.

I have a calibre library, too.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering how exactly goes your organization into using different things for these case uses, for example, jellyfin, playnite and kavita.
