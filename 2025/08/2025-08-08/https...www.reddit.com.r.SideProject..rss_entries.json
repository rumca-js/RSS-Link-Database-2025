Yeah, that was basically my entire existance until a few months ago.</p> <p>I kept burning weekends on projects that should&#39;ve taken a couple hours.

Don&#39;t get me wrong - I love learning, but my productivity was absolutely shot. I tried everything from Notion templates to fancy note-taking apps, but nothing really solved the core problem of turning all that research into actual deliverables. So I decided to build my own solution.</p> <p>What I ended up creating is basically an AI-powered research workflow that scans through tons of sources instantly and pulls together coherant summaries and document",
