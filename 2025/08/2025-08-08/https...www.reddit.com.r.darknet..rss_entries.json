It\u2019s just something I\u2019ve been interested in since high school and nothing sparks my interest like a good noggin scratching digital crime.</p> <p>Is this even a viable career path and how should I go about exploring this while I grind at the firm? Maybe I could pick up a related pro bono case every now and then? Is this only a boutique type practice? I\u2019d love some career advice and pointers.</p> <p>I\u2019ll be starting in biglaw this fall after clerking at a state court. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LifeCrow6997\"> /u/LifeCrow6997 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/1ml0o0n/i_want_to_defend_accused_internet_criminals_as_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/dar",
