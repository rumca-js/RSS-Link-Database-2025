I know, right? You'd think a sport that appeals mainly to AWFL virtue signalers wouldn't be so uptight about things. Instead, there have been arrests and cries that no one is taking the WNBA seriously. Though if anything about this is not funny, it's that the Green Dildo Bros have exposed themselves, and they sound like they suck.</p><p>To recap, there has been an epidemic of neon green dildos being tossed onto the court during WNBA games. More people were betting on the dildos than anything related to the games.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https:/",
