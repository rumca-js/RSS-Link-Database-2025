I recently swapped off of Spotify (don&#39;t like the CEO and already had paid for Youtube Premium which comes with Youtube Music) and so far it&#39;s been great but I miss some of the social features Spotify has like creating blends with friends, shared playlists, and listening together.</p> <p>I am curious if anyone knows of any services that support cross-platform music social experiences. If not, I just might have to build the damn thing myself and open source it! Could also be great to include some features which help folks migrate all their data from one platform to another (or even better, to MP3).</p> <p>Please let me know of any services that sound like they are able to do this! Would be great to not have to build it myself, but so help me, I might have to!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gavin_shaka\"> /u/gavin_shaka </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comme",
