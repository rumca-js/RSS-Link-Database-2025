The British prime minister, Abigail Dalton, played by Suranne Jones, faces her husband, Alex Anderson (Ashley Thomas), being kidnapped. Their marriage is well drawn \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s happy, it\u2019s assured, they\u2019re supportive of each other,\u201d Jones says. As we chat in Netflix\u2019s central London offices, she\u2019s always saying five things at once, only one of them out loud. Here, the subtext (I\u2019ve decided) is: it\u2019s actually pretty skilled work, creating a not-schmaltzy, passionate but familiar love match in which all the audience\u2019s hopes and prayers are with the abducted spouse. That\u2019s why normally when fictional politicians are the victims of a family kidnapping, it\u2019s one of their kid",

But, as Bernard MacMahon\u2019s terrific, archive-stuffed documentary reveals, Led Zeppelin had a more roundabout gestation. Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones were in-demand session players in 60s London, while singer Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham were jobbing musicians in Birmingham. It wasn\u2019t until Page joined the Yardbirds that he realised his dream of a no-singles group with a heavy, improvisational edge. Featuring interviews with the surviving members, rare audio of Bonham and big chunks of gig footage, it\u2019s a fascinating slice of rock history. <em><br>\n  Saturday 9 August, Sky Documentarie",

But that changed the day she heard a scream from the forest.</p><p>Chailert was 16 when she heard the terrible noise. She scrambled through the trees until she found the source: a bull elephant scrabbling in the mud as it tried and failed to drag a log out of a ditch.
