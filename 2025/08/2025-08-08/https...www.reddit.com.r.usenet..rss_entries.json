        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I live in China and have been heading down a self hosting rabbit hole since I&#39;m finding it increasingly difficult to stream media here from all the normal providers (VPNs are unreliable and always seem to stop working just as I sit down to watch something). I would like to incorporate Radarr and Sonarr into my setup and this has led me to Usenet. I was wondering if anyone has any experience with it from behind the Great Firewall. Is it even accessible without using a vpn? What are download speeds like? I&#39;ve seen Frugal Usenet has a server in Asia but haven&#39;t found anything suggesting this will improve speeds in China specifically. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/potherb85\"> /u/potherb85 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1mkz4jm/usenet_in_china/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usen",
