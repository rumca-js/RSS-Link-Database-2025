Currently running into an issue where I&#39;m running a very simple &quot;Hello!&quot; statement scrolling past the screen and it looks awful... I ran through a setup/initialization program and there was no change in display. I&#39;m curious if the bonnet i have is junk/corrupt. The bonnet is not touching any other pins, but Adafruit does advertise a riser for the bigger Pi&#39;s. </p> <p>I come from PLC&#39;s and other industry controls (aka this is my first Pi project, so don&#39;t be afraid to talk to me like a 2nd grader) ... so please be gentle.. ha, cheers!</p> <p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1mkgiv5/video/ly6q0eausohf1/player\">https://reddit.com/link/1mkgiv5/video/ly6q0eausohf1/player</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Both-School1016\"> /u/Both-Schoo",
