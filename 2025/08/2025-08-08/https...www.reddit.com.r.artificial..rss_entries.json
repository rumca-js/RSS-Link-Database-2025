AI is going to increase this rapidly and I think we are going to see an explosion of people identifying as AI, robots, AGI, computers and things of that sort. I think this has actually already begun. What do you think?</p> <p>People will no longer identify as human they will identify as these things and they will seek to become one with AI. They will identify themselves as being AI. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/razanesno\"> /u/razanesno </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ml3f0q/prediction_very_soon_people_will_start/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www",

They either focus too much on the engineering / math (Data scientists), too much on the empirical (psychologists), or too much on the practical (politicians). I want to find people who can view the mind, consciousness, AI development and the relation to cognition and the consequences on society as a whole. Also particularly interested in AGI, the potential for its development in the coming years and the meaning that is for society and life choices. Finding people who view this from a systematic, objective and curious perspective is extremely rare hence why I believe we need to form a community online so we don&#39;t have to rely on our thoughts alone.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PianistWinter8293\"> /u/PianistWinter8293 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1mkx8o",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been wondering whether there&#39;s some kind of LLM designed to teach you stuff, as an alternative to traditional &quot;static&quot; tutorials. Essentially creating personalised lessons and practical tasks as you advance through learning a new skill.</p> <p>In particular, I want to learn coding in a new language I never used. Most traditional tutorials fail to keep my attention, because they&#39;re not quite suited to the level of my IT knowledge and focus on basics too much, or I get stuck on something too advanced I don&#39;t understand and need to practice more.</p> <p>I found some tools that are great for a simple short lesson, but not a continued study of the subject. Any recommendations? Thank you :)</p> <p>(And yes, before anyone says it, I know coding is a dead job :D It&#39;s just for fun and personal projects :))</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Character-Carpet7988\"> /u/Characte",
