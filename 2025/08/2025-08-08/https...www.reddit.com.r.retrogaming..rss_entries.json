I&#39;m hoping to find time for it this weekend because when I stop playing a game for too long, it gets hard for me to pick it up again. So I&#39;m really really hoping to at least spend even 30 mins so that I won&#39;t lose too much momentum.</p> <p>What about you guys? What are you planning to play this weekend and why?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LabRat2329\"> /u/LabRat2329 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1mkxbqg/what_retro_games_are_you_playing_this_weekend_aug/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1mkxbqg/what_retro_games_are_you_playing_this_weekend_aug/\">[comments]</a></span>",
