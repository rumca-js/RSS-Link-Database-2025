For the unfamiliar, Seaman was a game released for the Sega Dreamcast (1999 in Japan, 2000 in NA and EU) and was later ported to the PS2. The game was a virtual pet game where the player had to raise a fish-like creature that had a human face and made use of a microphone accessory so that the player could have a simulated conversation with Seaman who would talk back. AFAIK, Seaman could only say a few thousand different things so it&#39;s not like the AI of today. This makes me wonder what a game like that could like if made today. </p> <p>Obviously, AI is mostly limited to either text, still images and sometimes videos, but completely interactive video games that make use of this type AI don&#39;t seem exist.

What exactly is the difference between an AI Engineer and an ML Engineer? I can\u2019t imagine companies hiring people to build entire LLMs from scratch \u2014 that would require insane amounts of compute, time, and money.

Precis: Software is changing, yet again! From the days of writing code to build systems (\u201cSoftware 1.0\u201d), to training neural networks (\u201cSoftware 2.0\u201d), we have now arrived at a transformational moment in the ways we work with software \u2013 to what Ai scientist Andrej Karpathy calls \u201cSoftware 3.0\u201d. This is the explosion of Generative Ai (GenAi) and the use cases it has spewed. Ai has now moved from the domain of narrow specializations to becoming a general-purpose tool.</p> <p>These advances are being underwritten by new protocols and architectures that promise to revolutionise how Ai systems interact with data and with each other.
