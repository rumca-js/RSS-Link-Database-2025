French researchers discovered that tweaking these cells in mice not only impacts metabolism but can also restore cognitive abilities impaired by obesity, such as relearning tasks. This breakthrough highlights astrocytes as powerful players in brain function and energy control, opening fresh possibilities for targeted obesity treatments.",

By combining tiny healing messengers called vesicles with a special hydrogel, scientists have created a dressing that restores blood flow and helps wounds close much faster. In tests, the treatment healed diabetic wounds far quicker than normal, while also encouraging the growth of new blood vessels. Researchers believe this innovation could one day help millions of people with slow-healing wounds caused by diabetes and possibly other conditions.",
