I have some experience in embedded systems and feel somewhat comfortable in that field. However, as I\u2019m getting closer to graduation, I\u2019m not entirely sure which path I should focus on.</p> <p>Lately, I\u2019ve been very interested in large language models (LLMs) and the AI field in general. But embedded systems feel more familiar to me given my background and projects.</p> <p>Since I\u2019m still early in my career, I feel like I should make a decision and commit to one path so I don\u2019t regret it later.</p> <p>In your opinion, which field currently has a brighter future and better job opportunities \u2014 embedded systems or LLM/AI? Or is there a way to combine both?</p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate advice from those who have experience in either area.</p> <p>Thanks a lot!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Both",
