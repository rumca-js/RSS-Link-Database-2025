With the Fast Geometry Streaming Plugin (Experimental), you can have a greater amount of immutable static geometry in your worlds that will load faster with constant frame rates. Additionally, all projects will benefit from further improvements over content streaming such as asynchronous physics state creation and destruction.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine 5.6 here: www.unrealengine.com/news/unreal-engine-5-6-is-now-available\n\n#TheWitcher4, #TechDemo, #Streaming, #FastGeometryStreamingPlugin, #UE5.6, #GameDevelopment, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestOrlando",
