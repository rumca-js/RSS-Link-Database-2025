Really enjoyed it, great game mechanically, tho sadly felt the overall plot was just ok aside from one interesting element: the dynamic between the godlike evil alchemist and the equally godlike benevolent one. </p> <p>Specifically, I liked how these two characters still clearly deeply cared for one another, despite trying to defeat the others\u2019 plans over many years and multiple timelines. I also liked the implication that they could likely have killed one another by now, especially since in Reshan\u2019s case, doing so would have ended the suffering of countless worlds/mortal lives, but he can\u2019t bring himself to. </p> <p>Basically, felt like big divorce energy and they\u2019re making it the whole universe\u2019s problem, including the game\u2019s protagonists, who are kinda also just pawns, even if one of them purportedly cares a bit more about their suffering. </p> <p>Might be too specific, but does anyone know any books",

The plot seems different but there are a lot of similarities between the main two characters of the series. Same with the magic system.

Decided to jump right in with some Brandon Sanderson. Mistborn was the first true fantasy series I\u2019ve really invested my time in as an adult, I read them back to back over the last few weeks. I definitely pushed through some chunks of reading, set myself landmarks, and believed the hype/the \u201cpayoff\u201d but I wasn\u2019t actually ready for the emotional high and then comedown waiting for me. I didn\u2019t even really know why I started crying but as all those last puzzle pieces slotted together through the last chapter I couldn\u2019t stop. I feel like I actually get it now that I\u2019ve seen and felt and snotted my way through the payoff. <",

Imo, the best mysteries/thrillers are the ones in which the reader has a fighting chance at figuring it out. This book was not that, it felt like Muir was using the confusion to hide a subpar novel.</p> <p>Should I read Nona the ninth?
