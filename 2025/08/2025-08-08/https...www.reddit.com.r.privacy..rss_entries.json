I&#39;ve been using Spotify for years and have enjoyed it, but the privacy concerns have made me reconsider. I recently watched a video by Louis Rossmann, which pointed out that Spotify may not be the best choice for those who prioritize privacy.</p> <p>I&#39;m interested in alternatives that allow me to stream music and podcasts without needing to download them. I also have concerns about services like Amazon Music and Apple Music, as I believe they may not be much better in terms of privacy.</p> <p>What about platforms like Deezer, Tidal, or Napster? Does anyone have experience with these services or recommendations for other options?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Komplexkonjugiert\"> /u/Komplexkonjugiert </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1mknkjl/a_real_spotify_alternative/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <",
