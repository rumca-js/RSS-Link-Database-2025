Also available on \u00a0Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.\n\n\"Mafia: The Old Country is an effective return to the linear and tightly story-driven format of the original Mafia and Mafia II. It doesn\u2019t reinvent stealth, and there\u2019s nothing especially remarkable about its typical third-person cover shooting \u2013 but with great writing, excellent vocal performances, and a wonderful eye and ear for detail, The Old Country is a potent and immersive time machine to a rarely explored era. This may be the Sicilian cuisine talking, as I\u2019ve never played anything with quite as much Italian fruit and food on show, but I think the Mafia games might have established themselves as the arancini balls of the business. That is, crusty on the outside, but on the inside they\u2019re dense, tasty, and a little cheesy \u2013 and, if you keep bringing them out, I\u2019m going to keep going back to the buffet until the kitchen runs dry.\"\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
