I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that the design and artwork are absolutely incredible. super wholesome and beautiful. But somehow, that was the only thing the game really gave me. After just two plays, I already felt a bit bored, and I haven\u2019t had the motivation to bring it back to the table since.</p> <p>It feels like you quickly get to know the cards, and then it\u2019s either going for the farm/Harvester cards or just grabbing random synergies.

I constantly checked suppliers for stock, signed up for email notifications, etc., and when I finally saw it in stock somewhere I pulled the trigger on it.</p> <p>However, the box is now too large to transport.

With the help of reading and searching this community we now have the following:</p> <p>Catan: Got us into board games. We play the original game with 2 player rules found on here and it is fun. Easy to teach.</p> <p>Azul: Gets the most playtime right now. Not as combative. </p> <p>Carcassonne: I like it but wife feels unsure about the strategy behind it. Seems a little boring to her. Might just need to play more.</p> <p>Jaipur: Fun and easy game. Newer to us but will get more playtime.</p> <p>7 Wonders Duel: Only played it once so far and it took 2 hours, referencing back to the rule book. Need to put more time into it. Nothing heavier than this for now.</p> <p>We were thinking of picking up TTR Europe, Castles of Burgundy, Quest for El Dorado, or Cascadia next. Nothing that\u2019s too head-to-hea",

I&#39;ve come down to Reforest and Birdscaping but cannot decide on which. On a bgg thread the designer of Birdscaping said it could go up to 4 players if you use two sets of the game (and I imagine it could scale up even more like that too) so both will be able to do 1 to 4 players at least. I plan to pnp the game so availability and cost isn&#39;t much of a concern here either.
