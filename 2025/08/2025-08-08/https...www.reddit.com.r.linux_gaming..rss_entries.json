I recently tried playing Nice Day for Fishin&#39; from VLDL, and I really struggled with the timing aspect of it. I ended up purchasing the game on Switch and I didn&#39;t have anywhere near the same problems.</p> <p>Has anyone else encountered this? That in games that require specific timing (think Dark Souls style parry mechanics) where you just can&#39;t seem to get it right? Does anyone know if this is just due to extra latency occurring because of Proton acting between your inputs and the game?</p> <p>I had struggled with Grounded a while ago not being able to parry very well, but I just thought that I sucked on the game. After my experience with Nice Day for Fishin&#39;, I feel that it may be something else.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",
