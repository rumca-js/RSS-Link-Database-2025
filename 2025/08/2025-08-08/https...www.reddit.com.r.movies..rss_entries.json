Representatives from the kingdom seek the assistance of the wizard Ulrich (Ralph Richardson) to defeat the dragon immediately -- Urland has been delivering virgins to appease the dragon, and their princess (Chloe Salaman) has rigged the lottery system they use in order to sacrifice herself next. But when Ulrich is killed, the task to confront the dragon falls to the wizard&#39;s apprentice, Galen (Peter MacNicol). I really enjoyed the film it\u2019s so much fun, Peter MacNicol as Galen is enjoyable in the role. The sets capture the medieval time really well. The practical effect of the dragon still hold up to this day.
