However I have been told that not all active encoders take requests, which is why I&#39;m making this post...I&#39;m trying to find encoders that actively take requests cause I&#39;d really love to see some titles that haven&#39;t been encoded before (at least to my personal preference), any help is appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnnyDC04\"> /u/JohnnyDC04 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comment",

And still be able to stream media from big torrents directly (high quality movies and shows).</p> <p>I see there are some seedboxes where you can run qBittorrent and then stream the completed files through Jellyfin or Plex right from the same box. That sounds kind of like what I need but they&#39;re not free (or cheap) if used just for that. </p> <p>The cheapest one I can find with all these apps included is from <a href=\"https://www.appbox.co/\">https://www.appbox.co/</a>, and 7$ every month will add up fast. Better than paying streaming apps ofc but could be cheaper (like free or one time purchase).</p> <p>So please ",
