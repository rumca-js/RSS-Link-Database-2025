        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m running a little jupyter server (specifically quay.io/jupyter/scipy-notebook) in a container (long story short there is a python library I need that can&#39;t run on windows so I run the jupyter kernel in docker and then VS-code on windows links to that kernel to execute code). The scipy-notebook image includes a bunch of useful libraries, but there are a few additional ones I need for my application. Currently I set up the container with docker run, then attach a shell, then manually execute the apt get install... and pip install... commands until I&#39;m ready to go. I&#39;d love it if I could run one command that set up the scipy-notebook container and grabbed the packages I&#39;m currently installing manually. What&#39;s the right way to do this? Is there some way to bake it into the docker run command? Do I setup a dockerfile that references scipy-notebook as it&#39;s base? Something else?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",

I&#39;m doing the simplest of tasks but I&#39;m laughing at how hard and fruitless this has been so far.</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to find a file. I&#39;ll give my specific example:<br/> I&#39;ve got a qBittorrent container (lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent) running on a debian-based host. Today I thought, I wonder where that login logo image is stored. Simple question turned into a learning experience...</p> <p>I&#39;ve searched the entire root filesystem for the filename, part of the filename, and even just the file extension and I couldn&#39;t find it. I&#39;m baffled. The login page is so basic. I can&#39;t find the page, the .js file, the .css file, or the one that I was looking for, the file in the &quot;images&quot; folder that I can&#39;t track down (/images/qbittorrent-tray.svg).</p> <p>What on earth am I doing wrong?
