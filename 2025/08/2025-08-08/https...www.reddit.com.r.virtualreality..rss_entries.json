        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m waiting on a BSB2, which will be my first headset to use Lighthouse tracking. In olden Vive times, conventional wisdom was that 2 Lighthouses were sufficient, but I&#39;ve heard from a couple sources that the BSB2&#39;s small size makes tracking occlusion more likely. From what angles can the BSB2 catch the Lighthouse signal? For room-scale VR in a 13ft x 12ft / 4m x 3.5m space, would 2 Lighthouses be enough to guarantee solid tracking? If not, then how flexible is the placement in a 3-Lighthouse setup? Would it work to have 1 in the center of my typical front side and 2 others in the rear corners for when I turn to either side? Or is there an advantage to having 2 across the front side?</p> <p>Thanks for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thegammaray\"> /u/thegammaray </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ml8zvy/lighthouse_placement_for_bigscre",

Audiences needed to see a character walk out a door and into the next shot \u2014 otherwise they\u2019d get lost. Slowly, filmmakers discovered the \u201cgrammar\u201d of film: closeups, montage, tracking shots\u2026 things theatre couldn\u2019t do.</p> <p>I wonder if VR is still in that pre-grammar stage. Many experiences feel like films or games we already know \u2014 just with head-tracking. Impressive, yes, but not yet native to the medium.</p> <p>When I work in VR, I\u2019m interested in worlds where <em>presence</em> is the mechanic. Spaces that remember you, mirror you, or quietly ignore you until you notice. It\u2019s not about winning or losing \u2014 it\u2019s about what happens when the world responds to your awareness.</p> <p>In our own ongoing VR experiment \u2014 a 32-episode \u201cmeta-theatre\u201d series filmed in a bare room, then rebuilt in Blender \u2014 we\u2019ve been trying to find those VR equivalents of the first closeu",

I don&#39;t have a high end PC (currently using RX 6700XT) and I don&#39;t want to break the bank, so it seems that my best option is to buy a used Pico Neo 3 link or pro - but I don&#39;t really understand the difference between the models and have found conflicting information on that matter. My hope is that you good people will be able to help me with the following:</p> <p>1) Can I use both the link and pro models with a display port cable to get uncompressed image? Is any of them better at it, or are they the same after I buy a DP cable to use with the pro version?</p> <p>2) Are there any other major differences between the models that I should be aware of?</p> <p>3) What is the &quot;enterprise edition&quot; exactly?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jednopalcy\"> /u/jednopalcy ",

I\u2019m quite sure I don\u2019t need the newest tech, so most bang for my buck is what I\u2019m looking for. </p> <p>I\u2019ve also heard there are some good VR-games. I have a PC with Nvidia 4070 TI, if that makes for a good experience with a VR-headset, then I\u2019m willing to spend a little extra to add a gaming component to the VR experience. </p> <p>Please share your advice on what googles would suit my needs :) </p> <p>What is the most fun VR experiences you had?

As of right now, I am Lagging, HORRENDOUSLY, whenever I open up my SteamVR Desktop overlay, and click on whatever application I\u2019m playing. It just freezes for a second, then proceeds to move at 3FPS. I had thought it was an issue with my SteamVR, for a WHILE. However, I finally found out the issue. It\u2019s my resolution.</p> <p>Whenever I turn my resolution down, the lagging stops. And when I say turn my resolution down, I mean WAY down, to 20%. Other wise, it just consistently lags. My question is- Why did this just come out of nowhere? I\u2019ve never had issues before, and I could have my resolution all the way up to 150%.</p> <p>Would anyone possibly know of a solution? Or a fix? I\u2019m desperate to get one, atp. If it helps, I\u2019ll list updates, drivers and such that have change",
