Pascat. I love the angst and tension and the pull to each other despite hating each other. I\u2019m honestly not for or against spice but I don\u2019t like when they get together halfway through the first book. I lovvve the tension of when they can\u2019t get caught. Not so much forbidden of student and teacher but more like there\u2019s he\u2019s a prison guard and she\u2019s the prisoner. Also I prefer fantasy and I like there to be a plot with the romance.

My cousin wanted to start a small book club with some spicy books and we read Insatiable by Leigh Rivers (hope I remembered her name right) I\u2019m currently on the second book (Voracious) and hopefully will get the third one before the week is over. Anyways, I\u2019m really enjoying it BUT it was my pick and my cousin doesn\u2019t really like it. She was hoping for some lighter content. The book comes with a lot of trigger warnings which is fine for me but not for her. So for our next book I was hoping to get some recommendations on some lighter smutty stuff. She said she likes a bad boy with a sweet side and nothing super crazy in bed. I\u2019m guessing she just wants like a sweet story with a little drama. Any books that will have that but also the plot is super good? Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ayowhotookmyson\"> /",

I prefer books that promote things like self-love, acceptance, and emotional intelligence (I&#39;m a social worker/therapist). Where I&#39;m having trouble is finding things that seem most appropriate for me to get her - I&#39;m white, and my niece is mixed race/half black. It feels like books specifically related to her race (black history books, books embracing her skin color/hair texture, etc) might be better coming from someone besides me.</p> <p>I might just be overthinking it, but do you have any suggestions that fit the vibe I&#39;m going for? Bonus points if they are written by women and/or BIPOC.

On the bright side, it did not in fact have sex in the first book...and we did have several laughs over how often MC&#39;s nipples peaked from sexual awareness \ud83d\ude02 but needless to say that was still a failure on my part.</p> <p>So I&#39;m trying to do better this time! I had the brilliant idea of Legends &amp; Lattes but my friend has already read the series. She does love it though, so something along that theme would be great!
