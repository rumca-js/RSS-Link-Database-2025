But night still brings unique challenges: fewer people around, limited visibility, and more opportunity for intruders to move unseen. If your security camera can\u2019t see clearly after dark, you\u2019re missing protection when you might need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Night vision lets security cameras capture what the human eye can\u2019t see in the dark. Some cameras shine invisible infrared light to illuminate a scene, while others rely on light-sensitive sensors to amplify what little light is already there. More advanced models can maintain color, adapt to changing light, or light up the scene with built-in spotlights. And there are the many camera/floodlight combos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following sections break down the most common types of ",
