After dealing with an itch to read all the way through a great book for a while, prowling used bookstores and trying to find something in which I can will myself to get past 50, I stumbled across an unassuming little book called THE SEASON TO BE WARY, a 1968 collection of three novellas by Rod Serling, the creator of The Twilight Zone, and an artist I&#39;ve always admired, although I never knew he wrote any fiction. Turns out, this was the only original fiction he ever wrote, and it was wonderful: cynical and angry yet deeply humanistic, characters that ring true in every word and action, skillful but unpretentious prose. It reminded me why I&#39;ve always loved reading, and I&#39;ve read over twenty more books since. Anyone else have a book like this that holds that special place in their heart? </p>",

I read a short story of his years ago in college and thought it was kinda interested and resolved to read more of his stuff eventually. Picked out <em>Norwegian Wood</em> at a bookstore about three months ago. What a fucking slog. Sad boy gets laid a bunch but is pining for someone else he can&#39;t really have. Also takes the time to tell us what damn near every single meal he has consists of. I swear the book would be at least ten pages shorter had he spared us the details of his breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also so glad I was halfway through this book when a girl I was hanging out with decided to kick me to the curb. I finished the last page and said, &quot;Fucking whatever!&quot;. And immediately tossed it back onto my bookshelf. It&#39;s going in a little free library so I can curse someone else with a waste of time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/oft",
