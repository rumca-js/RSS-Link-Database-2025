        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was thinking today about how large language models like ChatGPT or Claude essentially just calculate probabilities to produce an answer. They have no emotions, no body, and no sensory perceptions \u2013 even if they can process text, images, or audio.</p> <p>For humans, it\u2019s completely different. Our responses often depend on how we feel and what stimuli we\u2019re experiencing in the moment. If I\u2019m tired, have a stomachache, am listening to music, or feeling stressed, it can significantly affect my thinking. Even small things like temperature, noise level, or lighting can influence it.</p> <p>This made me wonder: what if we constantly fed LLMs with sensor data from their surroundings? For example, temperature, noise level, light, or movement in the room. This data could be added to the context of every response, so the model would react differently depending on its \u201cenvironment.\u201d We could even introduce virtual parameters like \u201cstress level\u201d or \u201cenergy level",
