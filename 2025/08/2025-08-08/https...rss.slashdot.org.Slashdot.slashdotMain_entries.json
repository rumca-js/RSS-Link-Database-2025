        "description": "Jim Lovell, the legendary NASA astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 \"successful failure\" mission, has died at age 97. From a report: Lovell was already well-known among NASA astronauts, having flown to space on the Gemini 7, Gemini 12 and Apollo 8 missions, before he was selected to command Apollo 13, which would have marked the third successful crewed moon landing for NASA. But during the ill-fated mission -- which carried Lovell as well as astronauts John Swigert Jr. and Fred Haise Jr. on board -- an oxygen tank located on the crew's service module exploded when they were about 200,000 miles (322,000 kilometers) away from Earth.\n \nLovell delivered the news to mission control, saying \"Houston, we've had a problem.\" With the damage effectively taking out the crew's power source and other life support supplies, the Apollo 13 crew had to abruptly abandon their trek to the lunar surface and use several engine burns to swing around the far side of the moon and put themselves on a course ",

They've warned that a single lawsuit raised by three authors over Anthropic's AI training now threatens to \"financially ruin\" the entire AI industry if up to 7 million claimants end up joining the litigation and forcing a settlement. Last week, Anthropic petitioned (PDF) to appeal the class certification, urging the court to weigh questions that the district court judge, William Alsup, seemingly did not. Alsup allegedly failed to conduct a \"rigorous analysis\" of the potential class and instead based his judgment on his \"50 years\" of experience, Anthropic said.\n \nIf the appeals court denies the petition, Anthropic argued, the emerging company may be doomed. As Anthropic argued, it now \"faces hundreds of billions of dollars in potential damages liability at trial in four months\" based on a class certification r",

The firm invested in SMIC, China's largest chip manufacturer, where Tan served as board director for at least 18 years until the Commerce Department restricted the company in 2020. Walden also backed Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment, now worth $17 billion and a leader in China's chip-manufacturing sector. \n\nDuring Tan's tenure as Cadence CEO from 2009-2021, the company sold banned technology to a Chinese university conducting military simulations, resulting in a 2025 guilty plea and $140 million settlement.

His analysis of six long-term studies covering more than 180,000 adults and 2,500 children found frequent nightmares predict early death more strongly than smoking, obesity, poor diet, or physical inactivity. \n\nAmong 174 people who died prematurely, 31 experienced at least weekly nightmares. Otaiku's research shows chromosomes of nightmare-prone individuals display accelerated aging patterns linked to stress hormones, accounting for roughly 40% of their increased mortality risk.

The team's approach to the shortest-path problem -- finding optimal routes from one point to all others in a network -- runs faster than Dijkstra's 1956 algorithm and its improvements by avoiding the sorting process that created the decades-old computational barrier. \n\nLed by Ran Duan at Tsinghua, the researchers combined clustering techniques with selective application of the Bellman-Ford algorithm to identify influential nodes without sorting all paths by distance. The algorithm divides graphs into layers and uses Bellman-Ford to locate key intersection points before calculating paths to other nodes. The technique works on both directed and undirected graphs with arbitrary weights, solving a problem that stymied researchers after partial breakthroughs in the late 1990s and early 2000s applied on",

Delta, American, Southwest, and United all operated their passenger services at a loss in 2024 while generating $14 billion in combined operating profits from credit card partnerships. \n\nDelta received $2.1 billion from American Express in Q2 2025 -- exactly matching its total operating profit -- while the airline's passenger operations alone would have posted a loss. These loyalty programs command valuations in the tens of billions, sometimes exceeding the airlines' total equity value, with Delta reporting 1% of U.S. GDP flows through its co-branded cards.

[...] Hill told The Register that he had wanted to make more ThinkPads with butterfly keyboards and had tried at least three times to make it happen -- in one case there was a prototype where only half of the keyboard moved -- but was never able to get there. Eventually, screens became big enough that there was no need to have a keyboard that expanded. However, Hill said, he thought about putting a butterfly keyboard on a netbook when they were a viable product category in the late aughts.

However, the train's engineers have wrestled with the problem of the shock waves which occur as the train exits the mouth of a tunnel. When a high-speed train enters an enclosed space such as a tunnel, air in front is compressed, like in a piston. The resulting fluctuations in air pressure coalesce at the tunnel mouth, generating low-frequency shock waves. These are colloquially known as a \"tunnel boom\" -- a related, albeit different phenomenon to the \"sonic boom\" heard as aircraft pass the speed of sound. Tunnel booms pose serious challenges to operational safety, as the shock waves can disturb humans and animals nearby, as well as causing structural damage.\n \nNow, however, researchers have discovered that placing innovative soundproofing buffers at tunnel mouths can reduce shock waves by up to 96%.
