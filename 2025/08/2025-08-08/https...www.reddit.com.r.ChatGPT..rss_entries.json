FaceSeek basically helps you track down similar faces across the internet (like a visual search engine). I was wondering if pairing that with GPT could make something like an automated \u201cfind &amp; verify\u201d assistant. Example: you upload an image \u2192 GPT gives context/background \u2192 FaceSeek finds matches online \u2192 GPT helps sort and analyze results.

Now it\u2019s all polished, clipped, and weirdly impersonal, like every other AI out there.</p> <p>I get that some people want hyper-efficient coding or business tools, but not all of us used ChatGPT for that. Some of us relied on it for creativity, comfort, or just a little human-like connection. GPT-4o wasn\u2019t perfect, but it felt alive. Now?
