My business partner and I noticed that a lot of small businesses and startups don&#39;t have the budget or team to handle customer support 24/7, but they still get a lot of common questions.</p> <p>To solve this, we built a really simple AI chatbot that can be installed on any website in minutes. It&#39;s designed to automatically answer repetitive customer questions, so the business owner can focus on other things.</p> <p>I&#39;m posting here because I&#39;d love to hear from this community. Is this a pain point you&#39;ve experienced? What kind of features would be most helpful to you in a tool like this?</p> <p>Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
