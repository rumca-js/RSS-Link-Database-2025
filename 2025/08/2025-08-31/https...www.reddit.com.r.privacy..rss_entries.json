I use Linux and to set up a proxy here is what I do step-by-step:</p> <ol> <li>Search up a proxy list </li> <li>Choose a server I like </li> <li>Open settings</li> <li>Pick the correct proxy type in the settings matching the server one (socks, https, http) </li> <li>Insert the server ip in the ip box and the server port in the port box </li> <li>Save and exit </li> </ol> <p>Pretty simple, right? The problem is that when I open my browser (brave) and try to access any website, they load for a long time before telling me that they could not be loaded.

Opting out seems like a very moot point - if you are crossing the border, you already have a government-issued ID with a recent photograph (taken within the last 4-10 years, in case of US license or passport) that you have to present to the official (TSA / border patrol). </p> <p>I understand not wanting facial (and gait) recognition on security cameras.
