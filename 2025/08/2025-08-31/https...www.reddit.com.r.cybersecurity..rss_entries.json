In parts of China, crews reportedly put SMS \u201cblasters\u201d in cars and pay drivers to loop through neighborhoods and shopping areas.

I feel like I&#39;m stuck in my career trajectory and would like to transition into the product side (ideally cyber-related) or management roles. I&#39;ve always had a narrow view of MBA programs, limiting them to traditional marketing/finance/consulting tracks. But as I&#39;m seriously considering B-school, I&#39;m realizing there might be more diverse opportunities. What career paths could open up for me? Also, I am aware of CISSP, but I\u2019ve read and have been told that I\u2019ll need a bit more experience for that Certification. I have other certifications such as CRTO, CRTP but they are more offensive security related.<br/> I&#39;m not sure if organizations prefer a MBA more or a CISSP.. any thoughts on this, would be great!</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Security analyst looking to break into product/management roles via MBA. What career paths am I not seeing?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",

No more confusion about what to learn next or where to find trustworthy resources.</p> <p>The roadmap is organized into clear phases that guide you step by step. It begins with the foundations (core IT knowledge and security basics), then progresses into technical skills like networking, operating systems, scripting, and essential tools. After that, learners can choose specialization paths such as pentesting, blue team, forensics, or others, and eventually explore advanced areas like security research.</p> <p>I also added professional development advice, certification guidance, and community recommendations to help learners build both skills and careers.</p> <p>On top of that,",
