What did Mauro&#39;s grandfather say to drive Uncle Louie away from the woman he loved and back to New Jersey? </p> <p>Was Uncle Louie threatened, beaten, paid off or fired and told he would never get permission to marry Claudia? If Uncle Louie really loved her why didn&#39;t he sneak back and get her to run away? </p> <p>Towards the end of the book Jess goes to visit Googs at the prison. She refused to wear a wire for the FBI and then proceeded to ask Googs a lot of questions about how the illegal business. That would have been the perfect time for Jess to ask Googs if Uncle Louie had ever mentioned why he left the beautiful Italian woman. Men talk. I really thought the prison visit was going to wrap up the missing detail.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Canadasaver",

A year ago, I realized my life had too many video games and too much social media. I decided to make reading my primary form of entertainment. I have to admit, I did not expect to &quot;catch the bug&quot; as hard as I have, and I did not expect the multitude of positive changes the mere first year of heavy reading hath wrought.</p> <p>I read voraciously when I was a kid, and then fell out of the habit after discovering weed, girls, and so on. I still made time to read two or three non-fiction novels annually (I&#39;m a great lover of history and politics), but fiction escaped me for almost two decades. But I&#39;m back, and back with passion.</p> <p>I believe now that literature is the storage container for humanity&#39;s greatest wisdom. Math and science, for us as a species, were critical, yes. But for individuals? I don&#39;t personally use calculus in my life. Neither does",
