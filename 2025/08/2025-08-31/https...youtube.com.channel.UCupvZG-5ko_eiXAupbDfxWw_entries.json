The tariffs are expected to increase inflation and potentially weaken the economy, which could in turn reduce federal revenue. (The CBO\u2019s analysis did not take the economic impact into account.)\n\nCNN's Jake Tapper speaks with University of Michigan professor of economics and public policy Justin Wolfers and Jeremy Lande, CEO of Fontana Forni USA, which imports pizza ovens from Italy to the US. #CNN #News",
