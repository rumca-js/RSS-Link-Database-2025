Then it dropped and everyone got spoiled and used to it. And we all became very aware of its limitations especially hallucinations. </p> <p>Over the next two years there was steady incremental progress and improvement with specialized modes like 3o. These could seem downright magical at certain tasks.</p> <p>GPT 5 feels like another big leap to me. I have now become an almost constant user and it guides me in basically every moderate to big decision in work and personal life. And astonishingly it seems to not really hallucinate (at least not nearly as much). In fact I can\u2019t recall having caught it in a hallucination yet. Occasionally it will tell me something that I think is a hallucination and then when I dig into it I realize I\u2019m the one who is mistaken.</p> <p>If it had built in multi modality it would feel straight up agi me.

The truck turns on an air pump for 60 seconds to blow extra oxygen to the catalytic converter to get it hot enough for EPA stuff.</p> <p>Due to having to rebuild two trucks and maintain old stuff, we have a Tech 2 scanner. This is the same type of scanner mechanics use to troubleshoot a car. Unlike a normal scanner, you can tell the engine to do things with it to test very specific items. In this case, to figure out if it was the relay, pump, etc., we needed to tell the system to turn it on and off.</p> <h1>Yesterday&#39;s Experience:</h1> <p>Because we almost never touch the Tech 2, I ended up having to pull out my phone.
