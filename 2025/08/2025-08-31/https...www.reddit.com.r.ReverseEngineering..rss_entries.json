This CPU is part of a specialized unit called the Media Engine, which we&#39;ve never really been able to exploit to its full potential.</p> <p>This second CPU is a MIPS Allegrex running at 333MHz just like the main one, close to an R4000 arch with its CP0 and an FPU as CP1. But there&#39;s also a DSP alongside it! With few dedicated opcodes.</p> <p>On this specialized unit, PSP 1000 has 2MB of local eDRAM, and newer ones have 4MB. And this unit also has access to the main RAM.</p> <p>There are also ping pong buffers linked to the main local DMA. These are 24bit buffers with a size of around 64KB segmented in 8KB.</p> <p>In mid 2005, a homebrewer called crazyc has done crucial work, which included getting code running over there.</p> <p>After him, the scene more or less settled on using the Media Engine, mainly its CPU, by relying on the reverse engineering of the code that gi",
