But for me, it\u2019s exactly what I was looking for, even though I hesitated at first and questioned everything about it.</p> <p>This is the kind of game that absolutely requires more than one play before forming a real opinion probably several, in fact. I\u2019ve heard people say you\u2019re limited by the cards you draw and that a bad hand means you\u2019re doomed. Not true. Maybe in your first game or two it feels that way, but once you get a sense of the nuances, you realize there are always other paths to success. That\u2019s why sticking with it for a few plays makes such a difference.</p> <p>My first game? I got crushed. Absolutely destroyed. It was brutal.

Each person is given maybe 10 cards (I forget the total amount of cards but it&#39;s around there). Both sets of cards are basically the same except different colors (I think blue and red). Each card has a numerical value(1,2,3...) and corresponding card art where the art were either soldiers or weapons used in the old military (kinda like soldiers in the Renaissance area with the hats with feathers). Gameplay is that you play 4 cards in ascending order face down. Then a &quot;reveal&quot; card is shown that tells me what cards to reveal. For example if I played cards 1,5,7,10 and the reveal cards has 5,6,7,8 then I must reveal cards 5 and 7 , and 1 and 10 stay face down. Then depending on the cards we score points and move the tower based on the points scored I think. How exactly we score points I don&#39;t really remember but I think we have to guess what the facedown cards are. Each card",

I was wondering if anyone had an online copy or a list of the cards for each expansion (surgeons at sea and witchcraft and wizardry), so that we could make our own? The base game is great but when you play between 6-7 people, the cure cards get very same-same after a while.

So far so good but today we came across a question we couldn\u2018t figure out.</p> <p>So\u2026. If a location gets run over by zombies the survivor with the lowest influence dies and the zombie that overrun the location doesn\u2018t get placed. But what happens to the other Zombies do they just stay at the Location (so its full of Zombies and if you want to Go There you Need to kill a shitload of Zombies) or do they \u201edespawn\u201c so the Place is empty again and no Zombies Are left at the location?</p> <p>The rulebook is Not 100% clear on that in the german Version and i couldn\u2018t find an answer online. </p> <p>Sorry of the question is stupid but we Are on our First playthroughs and the game seems hella difficult.</p> <p>I\u2018m more leaning torwards they stay but I still want to make sure we dont make a fatal mistake there haha </p> <p>(I have read a lot of tips and misunderstandings of the Game in this sub but that on",
