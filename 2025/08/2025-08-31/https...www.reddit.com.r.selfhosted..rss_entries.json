I&#39;ve found a lot of the links and bookmarks I&#39;ve saved over the years (blog posts, Reddiit threads, YouTube videos, etc) are disappearing, so I&#39;d like to start collecting things locally.</p> <p>Is it best to download these as .zim files and put them in the Kiwix library? Or is there a better solution? Endgame, I&#39;d like to have a searchable system so I can find things easily.

Where do their data come from and how do they manage to generate those appealing animated maps?</p> <p>From what I understood, the base is always numerical weather models, like GFS or ECMWF, which provide forecasts in scientific files (GRIB or NetCDF). These files contain huge amounts of numerical data, arranged in time grids (hours/days).</p> <p>The \u201ctrick\u201d to turning these numbers into interactive maps is some intermediate processing. For that, I created a script that downloads raw files from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts - ECMWF (link in comments) and converts them into WebP. Then, I played with particle and raster layers in DeckGL with MapLibre to create this wind animation based on the generated WebP.</p> <p>To celebrate one month of barcos.geoglify.com (and see if 4\u20ac/month is still worth it), I put an online preview.
