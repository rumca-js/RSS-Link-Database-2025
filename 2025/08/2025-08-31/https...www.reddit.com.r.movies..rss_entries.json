This was finally rectified!</p> <p>Overall, I&#39;ll say that the movie very much lives up to its reputation as an all-time crime classic . It really feels like the most Scorsese movie ever - of course there&#39;s the fixation on the dark temptations of the criminal life and the bad boys that inhabit it, but also a lot of classic Scorsese stylistic touches like the voiceover narration, freeze frames, long takes and perfect musical needle drops. </p> <p>Henry Hill is a <em>relatively</em> more sympathetic protagonist than the likes of Jake Lamotta, Travis Bickle or Jordan Belfort, which actually works to make his inevitable descent into paranoia and losing it all feel bleaker and more impactful.",
