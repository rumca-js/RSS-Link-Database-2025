In August of 2025, a woman collapsed after winning a beautiful dress owned by Princess Diana at an auction for $520,000. In 2018, the excitement was too much to handle for Clara Sosa from Paraguay, and she fainted on stage after winning Miss Grand International. Inside Edition Digital's Andrea Swindall has more.",

The room was transformed with the colors of the college she is starting this fall. It's part of a trend called \"bed parties.\" Haley's parents spent around $3000 to throw her bed party and hired an event planner.
