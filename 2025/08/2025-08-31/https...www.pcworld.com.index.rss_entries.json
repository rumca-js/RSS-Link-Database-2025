It was on the very first PC I recall using, literally on my father\u2019s knee. But I don\u2019t need it anymore. That\u2019s a weird thing to say as a writer for a site named PCWorld. But it\u2019s been a long time coming, a slow mix of broad tech trends, feeling betrayed by multiple brands, and a little bit of intention on my part.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, I still <em>use </em>Windows. It\u2019s what I\u2019m using right now to type this, <a href=\"https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/109/642/844/995/072/330/original/4edd35721a3337a3.jpg\">on a beefy gaming desktop</a> I assembled myself, with triple monitors and all sorts of googaws attached. But I don\u2019t <em>need </em>all that anymore, and for the first time in my adult life, I can see myself transitioning to an entirely different operating system.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s",
