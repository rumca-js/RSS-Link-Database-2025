It turned out to be a pretty gripping sci-fi thriller! The story follows Sophie Gannon, a scientist who discovers that DNA can hide encrypted secrets, which pulls her into a dangerous project called <em>Project Helix</em>. Between a ruthless geneticist (Crowe), a mysterious figure known as the Observer, and some wild revelations about Sophie\u2019s own DNA, it felt like a mix of Michael Crichton\u2019s science-driven suspense and Dan Brown\u2019s puzzle-like conspiracies.</p> <p>What hooked me most was how it blends real genetics with thriller pacing, while also raising questions about identity, ethics, and whether science can (or should) rewrite humanity. It was fast, intense, and surprisingly thought-provoking.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m hooked and would love to read more in this vein.<br/> Do you have any recommendations for books similar to t",

Anything to do with seas and oceans or anything underwater, I love.

The ones that are evocative, full of metaphors and descriptions to signify love, heartbreak, longing, and what have you. For instance, using the metaphor of an empty room to describe loneliness in Hope Leaves. Hope what I wrote makes sense and helps you suggest me a few books to read for the next few months.

The series follows Victor and Lysandra, two orphans who undergo their &quot;First Awakening,&quot; a pivotal ritual that reveals their unique classes and destinies in a game-like world. Victor awakens as an Arcane Weaver, a rare and powerful class, while Lysandra is a formidable Shadow Walker. Their journey starts with a seemingly simple quest but quickly spirals into a war against a cosmic conspiracy.<br/> What makes this series stand out is how the characters evolve. They don&#39;t just gain power; they learn and grow, confronting their fears and insecurities head-on. Victor, for example, is forced to become a strategist and a scholar when a magical debuff leaves him temporarily powerless. Similarly, Lysandra, a natural fighter, is pushed t",

I&#39;m currently rewatching Scream Queens, Euphoria, and Gossip Girl, three of my favorite shows, and I was wondering if there are any books that have the same vibe as those? I just got out of a 10-year reading slump, and I&#39;m trying to get back into reading. I feel like I should start with books that have the vibes I like (YA, glamorous, fashion, dark, messy, horror/slasher, etc). I know Gossip Girl is based on Cecily von Ziegesar books, but I can&#39;t find any bookstore near me that sells any of the GG books (probably because it has been 20+ years since it was first published).

I like it when the characters have powers, but I\u2019m not looking for out of this world fantasy. I want something more grounded but with lots of adventure and mystery. Also something more modern too. Could be YA or mature. Anyone know of any hooking good book series like this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Professional-One2810\"> /u/Professional-One2810 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1n4jwa0/looking_for_a_contemporary_fiction_book_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1n4jwa0/looking_for_a_contemporary_fiction_book_with/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The reason the genre says \u2018other\u2019 is because, to be honest, I\u2019m not sure what genre dystopian falls into. I have only dipped my toe into this kind of book with Shatter Me and The Hunger Games but that\u2019s all. </p> <p>Now to get into stuff I would like in a book. I know I want the same concept as Shatter Me (I loved that series, but the world building/plot wasn\u2019t super strong). I Specifically want the stuff like with the Reestablishment. I really liked Tahereh Mafi\u2019s idea with that, so I want a book that has something similar but with more details. Also, to add onto that, I like the idea of it being political with the different leaders like Shatter Me had. I hope I\u2019m not getting too specific with the kind of book I want to read with this, but I would like some romance (doesn\u2019t have to be the main focus). It does not have to have magic like Shatter Me has, I would be fine with o",
