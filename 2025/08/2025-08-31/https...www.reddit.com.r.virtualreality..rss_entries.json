Every time I take it out the game frame rate drops like to 10fps making it unusable, I tried lowering the graphics settings but nothing changed. In all the other sections of the game it runs smoothly. Has anyone encountered the same problem?

I walked 5 seconds to the stairs and already was feeling the motion lol. I stopped and just looked around for a couple minutes before walking slowly to the table with the gun. I wasn&#39;t using any comfort settings. My thought is that you just have to get accustomed to it. Did the weapons training and played with the guns without moving the character. </p> <p>After training I was walking really slow lol. Full speed was a little disorienting. I continued to move slow and turn with my whole body instead of the controller. Played for about 20 minutes and stopped for an hour. Since I was moving slow I was just a little uncomfortable but not crazy. After an hour I was fully recovered and was able to play for around 45 minutes. This was a mixture of walking slow and normal speed. I was still using my whole body to turn. The first zombie was a t",

Hells yes! </p> <p>I really want to share this because it&#39;s the result of the latest updates bringing VR optimizations. It&#39;s also a really big deal because most VR games are either very specific in the experience they offer (VTOL only offers flying) due to the small consumer base, or aren&#39;t optimised for VR like Skyrim (15 year old textures), and some games like subnautica require a regular controller or keyboard + mouse to work which kinda sucks.</p> <p>Some of the best games ever made like GTA will never get a VR release, if you try and play cyber punk for example, you don&#39;t get full controller support and they require beastly machines to get running.</p> <p>I run an economy PC, the 3070 is relatively new to me, and it&#39;s a big deal because being able to simple play and more so enjoy the NMS experience means that a lot of people out there can",
