Oh and also, do you need an antivirus? For fitgirl and in general for other sites? It may seem like an obvious question to you but I saw people downloading from fitgirl without an antivirus and their computer suffering no negative effects, so I wanted to ask since it seems strange to me, even something widely used without any worry like TLauncher reportedly installs spyware on your machine.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Oderikk\"> /u/Oderikk </a> <br/> <",

After 2 hours the download just cancels. Normally there is a way of downloading multiple parts to probably avoid this issue, but i havent found a website where this option is available. I ran the download 3 times now and lost a lot of hours and im about to lose my mind. ChatGPT said i should use a download manager, which also didnt work. Im not an experienced pirate so torrenting isnt an option for me rn, especially because its very risky in my country. Does somebody know a solution to my problem?

I personally would rather be safe than sorry so I use one anyways which is binded to my qibitorrent client. The only problem is that I dont get my full 1GB download and upload speeds. So the other day i turned off my VPN for a few minutes to test the differences and find out where the bottle neck is. I had my VPN off for about 10 minutes.
