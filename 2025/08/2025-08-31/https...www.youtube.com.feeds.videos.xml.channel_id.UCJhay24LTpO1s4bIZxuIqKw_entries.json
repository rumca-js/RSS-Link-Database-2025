Josuttis - ACCU 2025\n---\n\nThe C++ chrono library has to solve a surprising number of real-world issues. For example:\n- How many seconds has a year?\n- Is February 29 a valid day?\n- What is right format to specify and print a date?\n- How to invite to a video call between people in Chicago, Cuba, and China?\n\nIntroduced in two steps (basics with C++11 and several extensions in C++20), the chrono library now has approaches to deal with these question in a flexible, powerful, safe, and efficient way.\n\nIn this talk we will look at durations, time zones, date formats, calendars, clocks, weekdays, leap years, leap seconds, and how to deal with them right using the C++ standard chrono library.\n\nI promise surprises both about the real world as well as the design and use of this library.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJoin think-cell as a C++ D",
