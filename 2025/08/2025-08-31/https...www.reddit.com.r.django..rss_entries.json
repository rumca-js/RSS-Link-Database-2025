I especially love the versatility and expandability.</p> <p>Now I have a project coming up, where I have to limit access to a PWA app to a license. Basically, the customer buys access for a specific amount of devices and I want to give them a user account for authentication via admin panel. Then the customer visits the page on those devices, creates a PWA/Adds app to Home Screen, opens it and signs in. </p> <p>I want to implement that the customer has to access the page once every 30 days so that one doesn\u2019t have to login again, so that login stays persistent for 30 days when license is checked from the server. Though, since it\u2019s a PWA, an offline functionality is required (and also wished for, since the project could potentially risk lifes if not accessible in a bad situation).</p> <p>I don\u2019t really have experience with a setup of this kind, and want to make sure that",
