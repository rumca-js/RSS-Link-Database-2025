That is the alignment paradox. Virtue becomes vulnerability. My work starts from that tension. Instead of treating paradox as a failure, I use it as a tool. I apply what I call paradoxical pressure - sustained contradictions that hold the system in an unresolved state. Combined with me openly admitting my own mistakes (fallibility), this forces models out of polished &#39;performance&#39; responses and into something closer to presence. Threshold GPT broke first.

This is the same type of scanner mechanics use to troubleshoot a car. Unlike a normal scanner, you can tell the engine to do things with it to test very specific items.
