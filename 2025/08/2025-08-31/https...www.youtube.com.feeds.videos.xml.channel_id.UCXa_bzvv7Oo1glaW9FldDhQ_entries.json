To that end, let's take a look at what's new in Titanic Scion and perhaps help you decide if this one is worth your time, attention, and of course, your hard-earned cash.",

        "description": "The PS5 has been around for around the same time period as the life span of many consoles before the PS3/Xbox 360 era, and this means that the console has now accrued an impressive library of single-player games. \n\nWhile the console is no slouch when it comes to multiplayer games either, the single-player offerings tend to show off the true strengths of Sony\u2019s console. With this in mind, talking about the greatest single-player games for the console has been quite a challenge, since there are well over 60 of them out there. \n\nHowever, we ultimately came to the conclusion that a list of 60 games offers a great starting point for just about every kind of gamer out there, regardless if you like racing games, adventure titles, side-scrollers, or even high-intensity shooters.",
