When i accepted it, it was like i could finally relax, and it all makes sense. But i did spend many years trying and failing to date and had many long conversations with my mom about dating. </p> <p>My mom and i are very close, and she has always been my biggest supporter and rock in life. So of course i told her about my sexuality. It was met with some hesitation. Given that we have been talking about dating problems and stuff for years, i can understand why she was confused. And it didnt seem like she quite believed me. I told her to keep it a secret, so i could tell other people on my own time. </p> <p>I told my grandparents, and they were like &quot;we love you either way&quot; and end of story. I told my sister, and she was confused but accepting. I",

My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years but I lied to them about her. I told my parents that we were just \u201cfriends\u201d and we like each other but have boundaries. They told me to limit how often we see each other and to end things because it isn\u2019t normal. They basically told me that we\u2019re both going to end up with men. I told my girlfriend about this and we just agreed that I should just lie about my whereabouts for now. It\u2019s really tough because my parents don\u2019t understand that I\u2019m actively denying myself to save their reputation in the church. It also doesn\u2019t help that my dad is insanely involved in the church. Does it get any better? I need some hope to hold on to. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Flounder6771\"> /u/Ok-Flounder6771 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1n4uj",

I imagine myself as a woman, but still presenting masculine, more on the \u201cstud\u201d side. Part of me feels like that defeats the purpose of being trans, but idk. Has anyone else felt this way? Can you be trans and still want to present masc instead of feminine? I still would like to present feminine sometimes of course, but yeah idk. Just trying to figure stuff out. I got my hair braided and have already been mistaken for a stud a couple times so yeah.

No matter the topic, no matter the intention, sooner or later someone ends up going everything to the sexual side. It&#39;s as if there&#39;s a silent expectation that we&#39;re all horny all the time\u2014as if it&#39;s an obligation to live in this constant state of desire.</p> <p>What&#39;s most disturbing is that, even when there&#39;s no openness or invitation to do so, many guys seem to see only one opportunity to reduce the other person to a body, trying to see their dick or ass. It&#39;s exhausting to realize that almost no one can sustain even the slightest bit of conversation; it&#39;s exhausting to have a real human exchange.
