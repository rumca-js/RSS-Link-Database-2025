The summer months have seen a bit of a slowdown in my reading as I&#39;ve been travelling for both work and for pleasure. Still, I&#39;ve managed to find time for a few things and I&#39;m up to 15 squares completed to date.</p> <p>Up until now, I&#39;ve been able to pick and choose books from my sizeable TBR stack and find items that pretty easily fit one of the Bingo squares. But this phase of my Bingo effort may be coming to an end. Looking ahead, most of the remaining squares don&#39;t really seem to match up with anything I already have on hand. This was always my concern with attempting a Bingo read - I worry about reading &quot;for the assignment&quot; keeping me away from things I know I really want to dig into. I&#39;m going to try to look for relatively shorter books to fill the remainder. We&#39;ll see how that goes.</p> <p>Anyway, here&#39;s what I was up to this summer:</p> <p><stro",

Some of these things the author answered directly, but then some of them were still a mystery at the end.
