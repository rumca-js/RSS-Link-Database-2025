Lot of effort to rework the course materials but super happy with result. RISC-V is wonderful for teaching and the SBC we chose (Mango Pi MQ-Pro AllWinner D1) has been a great fit for our needs, big success!</p> <p>However, our course is in now in tough spot due to supply of MQ-Pro totally drying up. One supplier said there are fewer than 20 boards avail all of China right now. No one seems to know if shortage is temporary or permanent never-to-be-produced again. This would be death knell for the course, what a huge bummer.</p> <p>If you have info/advice/connections on how we might stockpile a supply that could keep our course going, please reach out. We would really appreciate the help.</p> <p>P.S. Is &quot;CS107E&quot; silk-screened on bottom of your board? We didn&#39;t ask for it, guess manu",

They tried to crowd fund it but couldn&#39;t reach to the expected goal back then so project slowly died. What happened to that Open-V chip and <a href=\"https://github.com/onchipuis/mriscv\">mRISCV</a> core? Looking into their GitHub they look abandoned. It looks promising even today given that current RV32 MCUs in the market are also around same MHz range. They taped it out and made a devboard for it but nothing came after. Do you know any backstories/rumors? Do you know any other early attempts like this from 2010s?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ShockleyTransistor\"> /u/ShockleyTransistor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1n4vo3l/what_happened_to_openv_and_other_early_open/\">[link]</a></s",
