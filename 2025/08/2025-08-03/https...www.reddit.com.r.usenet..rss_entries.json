I went to log in and it tells me there&#39;s no account with those credentials. They&#39;re definitely the same ones I signed up with because I saved the info and password in the browser. I contacted support via email and their Web form 3 times and I&#39;ve gotten no reply yet despite them claiming 24h responses. If I file a chargeback, I&#39;ll be locked out of my account for 2 weeks while the new card arrives. Anyone got any other ideas to get ahold of them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/icyorca123\"> /u/icyorca123 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1mgpcdz/vipernews_took_payment_without_making_an_account/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1mgpcdz/vipernews_took_payment_without_making_an_account/\">[co",
