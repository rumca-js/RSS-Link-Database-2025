Ever stumbled in a videogame that you played and really enjoyed, before or after hearing bad things about it, or getting a bad average reviews?</p> <p>Back to PS2, for me it was Breath of Fire V: Dragon Quarter. The game is technically excellent, epic soundtrack, very unique, challenging and filled with extra contents for great replayability.</p> <p>What went wrong: the fans of the series disliked it because it was too much different from the previous chapters, featuring a whole different gameplay (it&#39;s a bit similar to Vagrant Story, the composer is also the same) and style. And probably because the difficulty was more punishing than average.<br/> After that, the series pretty much derailed and no actual new chapters came out (BoF VI doesn&#39;t really count).</p> <p>So, what about you?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently decided to give SWTOR a try and...man, It&#39;s actually a super fun game. I&#39;m playing as a commando trooper and I absolutely love it. The story is impressive for an MMO and the world is alive and fleshed out. I&#39;m actually enjoying it far more than WoW simply because I can actually keep up with what&#39;s going on and what I should be doing rather than trying to do a million daily quests, seasonal content, and so many side quests that you forget what you were supposed to be doing to begin with. All this said, there&#39;s no denying it&#39;s an older game and that has me worried. I want to keep playing for years to come and I&#39;m afraid it may fizzle out before I can get the full experience. For veterans of the game, what do you think the future of SWTOR looks like? Think it&#39;ll press on or be shut down like so many before it? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ImpressFederal4",

I was just sitting in the social hub area, chilling out right at the docks just watching the ships come and go when suddenly I see this exotic ship style I&#39;ve never seen before fly in and dock just a few pads over from my own ship. The pilot jumps out, makes a beeline straight for me, dumps a literal king&#39;s bounty of high-end crafting materials and loot into my inventory, turns around, runs back to his ship and leaves the space station.</p> <p>He never said a word during any of it. I never got a message or a friend request from the guy, no idea if he&#39;s even still flying around the systems of No Man&#39;s Sky or not.</p> <p>But I will never forget that name lol. Godspeed, buttery_gluten.
