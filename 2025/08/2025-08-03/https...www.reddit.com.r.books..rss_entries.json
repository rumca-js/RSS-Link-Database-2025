I am aware that translations can often make or break a text for some, and the appeal of certain translations is subjective, but I am now curious to know what is considered to be the objectively best translation. From what I have read the Muir translations are the best but I have begun to wonder if they are antiquated or accurately translate Kafka. I have heard Corngold took his translation to seriously and didn&#39;t do an accurate job at portraying Kafka&#39;s humor, and I have heard good things about Neugroschel even though it has been minimal.

Walked around the Barnes&#39;s and Noble and every new book seems to have the same style cover; a generic, hyper-colorful cover that means nothing. They all look the same and to me are all uninteresting after a few minutes of seeing it repeated over and over. I&#39;m not saying &quot;They used to have great covers back in my day&quot; because there were plenty of crappy boring book covers in the past. What I don&#39;t understand is, with the technology we have today, with all the forms and styles of art available, why aren&#39;t book covers a bit more varied and interesting and cooler. Yes this is subjective, my artistic tastes are different than yours are different than theirs etc. But why not a variety?
