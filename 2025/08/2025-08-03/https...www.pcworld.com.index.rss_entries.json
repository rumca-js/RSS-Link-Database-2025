But I haven\u2019t bought one yet. Initially, it was because I couldn\u2019t really justify the purchase, at least if the amount of time I\u2019ve used my original Nintendo Switch in portable mode is anything to go by. But lately I have a new reason: I\u2019m scared.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, I could definitely convince myself that getting one makes sense. I work for PCWorld, it\u2019s not as if buying a portable gaming PC would piss off my (imaginary) accountant. But since I\u2019m looking at a $500 purchase, probably closer to $1,000 if I get <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck\">an OLED model and a couple of upgrades</a>, it\u2019s way outside of impulse buy territory. So I want to make sure it\u2019s a good purchase, if not necessarily a wise one.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-steam-deck-is-getting-older\">The Steam De",
