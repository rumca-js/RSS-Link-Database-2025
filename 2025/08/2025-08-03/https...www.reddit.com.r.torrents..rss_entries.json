I am in Thailand, and from some googling it seems that the chance of any legal stuff affecting me is slim. I have downloaded a few files over the past few days and have been fine.</p> <p>I am more worried about safety though. Much like VPNs I also cannot afford a paid antivirus and is at risk if any virus actually gets on my device. Currently I&#39;m only torrenting videos from 1337x, which I think are pretty safe, and I make sure to not run any unknown executable files(haven&#39;t seen any yet though). Is doing this enough to keep me safe? Or am I still at risk?</p> <p>Also, this concern had led me to not seed at all after leeching in order to keep the time that I&#39;m connected as short as possible. I know it&#39;s not ethical to do this but I have read that seeders are easier to &quot;catch&quot; especially with no VPN like me.</p> </div><!-- SC",
