However, a deeper look reveals that many performance issues stem from redundant or value-less requests upstream. This talk explores how combining the Theory of Constraints with the concept of Failure Demand can help us see and improve. We can enhance system efficiency, improve user satisfaction, and drive genuine business value, while having fun doing it.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJoin think-cell as a C++ Developer and work on cutting-edge challenges with a focus on code excellence, innovation, and working alongside an international team of experts \u2014 apply now to be part of a team shaping the future of business presentations.
