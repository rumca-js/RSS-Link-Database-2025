It\u2019s still not launched (shooting for later this year), but the prototype is working and I\u2019d <em>love</em> to get feedback before I lock things in.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what\u2019s in it so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Milestone approvals</strong> \u2014 Clients can\u2019t sneak in new work without officially signing off.</li> <li><strong>Change request tracking</strong> \u2014 Those \u201cquick changes\u201d now get logged, priced, and approved before you touch them.</li> <li><strong>Payment triggers</strong> \u2014 Invoices tied to milestone approvals so you\u2019re not chasing money after delivering work.</li> <li><strong>Scope dashboard</str",
