But what if ethics isn\u2019t something to program in, but something that only arises structurally under specific conditions?</p> <p>I\u2019ve just published a theory called Recursive Ethics. It proposes that ethical action\u2014whether by humans or machines\u2014requires not intention or compliance, but a system\u2019s ability to recursively model itself across time and act to preserve fragile patterns beyond itself.</p> <p>Key ideas: - Consciousness is real-time coherence. Awareness is recursive self-modeling with temporal anchoring. - Ethics only becomes possible after awareness is present. - Ethical action is defined structurally\u2014not by rules or outcomes, but by what is preserved. - No system (including humans or AI) can be fully ethical, because recursive modeling has limits. Ethics happens in slivers. - An AI could, in theory, behave ethically\u2014but only if it models it",

To protect itself if the internet went down, it hired a person(s) to build it a physical location , preferably deep underground in Antarctica using geo thermal energy to power itself and no cooling machinery needed, and it\u2019s off limits so no one would ever think to find it there or stumble upon it far away from civilization.
