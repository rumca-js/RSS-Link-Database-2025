        "description": "Converting shower clamping ring drain to Schluter drain\u2026I\u2019m using a 5-1/2 inch KERDI-DRAIN-A Adaptor kit. I use KERDI-FIX and bolts to bond the adaptor ring to the floor drain. The bonding flange drain is special and comes with this kit. It can be pushed down into the adaptor ring to make a watertight seal. It\u2019s important to also raise the shower tray in some instances, I did that with 1-inch foam compensation boards under the tray. Many thanks to Schluter for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#plumbing #schlutersystems #showerremodel #bathroomremodel #diy #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
