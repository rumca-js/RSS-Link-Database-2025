We applied for a marriage visa so she could immigrate to Korea, but as soon as she received the visa, she secretly entered Korea and disappeared. (Her sole purpose was to enter Korea; she never had any intention of marriage from the beginning.)</p> <p>The money, time, and emotions I spent in Vietnam to marry her have all been wasted, and my life has completely fallen apart. I have already filed a criminal fraud complaint against her with the Korean police, and I was told that if she is punished, she can be forcibly deported.</p> <p>However, to punish her, the police need to summon her, and since she is in hiding, this cannot be done. The only information I have about her is her Gmail address, her passport number, and her national ID number. I believe she is using an Android-based phone in Korea.</p> <p>I want to know her location, and if possible, I would like to",
