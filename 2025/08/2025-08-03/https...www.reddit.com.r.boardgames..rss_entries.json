There are obviously online adaptations of most games, but those just never hit the same, and scalpers/opportunists but I refuse to give money to those assholes, and that&#39;s it.

We are eager to try another game soon, with the disclaimer that it can not be too complex, and has to be able to be learned by her, who gets distracted very easily.

It&#39;s very different from the other two versions I have - Universal Monsters and American Monsters. I was nervous since people said they get worse with every version, but here&#39;s my take on the new one:</p> <ul> <li><p>The use of a D20 dice is very interesting! Your character has different abilities depending on their dice roll, and they get better the closer to 20 you get. This adds a bit more fun randomness to the game which I love! The Beholder monster will have a different effect on you depending what you roll as well, getting worse with a roll closer to 20, the spaces on the board are numbered 1-20, and sometimes you (or the displacer beast) will have to move to a different space during the monster phase depending on your D20 roll.",

It aims to make every attack skill based by using flicks, and it is extremely in-depth with status effects, different sized characters, and different attack styles like ranged and melee.

However, the boss levels are just extremely unfair. We&#39;ve only used the first two bosses, and the first boss has a stupid shield ability that gives him a free flick for no reason and then he can block attacks from an entire direction. He&#39;s beatable, but still difficult and annoying. The second boss, however, has tons of enemies that stun, and can summon more every turn. He&#39;s just able to summon enemies around him to block and the rest are just there to protect him. And on top of that he has 8 health.

Been in the hobby for about five years and just haven\u2019t had the chance to experience Scythe. My group got it to the table this evening (they had all played it before but I hadn\u2019t), and I have to say that I was quite pleased with the game play experience. I didn\u2019t go in with any astronomical expectations; I knew it was at least a decent game and was curious to get an idea of why it\u2019s so highly regarded. And to be honest, it didn\u2019t disappoint. I didn\u2019t win, but that doesn\u2019t really matter to me. I loved it. This isn\u2019t a review, but only wanted to share my excitement about finally getting to play what I think is fair to call a modern classic.</p> <p>What do others think of Scythe? Are you a fan?

I don&#39;t see a higher purpose, i don&#39;t sense the full weight of having to harvest the most important substance IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. It captures well the hostility of the environment but it just feels like the Harkonens came to the planet just for the sport of killing.</p> <p>It doesnt sit well with me as well the fact that the Harkonens have more dice than the Fremen. The Fremen are much more numerous in Arrakis, they should have more troops, easier deployment and movement (besides the sandriding), they should be the numerous, almost invisible army that can be anywhere, attack and retreat rapidly while the Harkonens should have less dice but much",
