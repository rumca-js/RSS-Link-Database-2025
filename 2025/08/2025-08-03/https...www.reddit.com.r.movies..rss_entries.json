This is one of my favorite kind of films. A simple story that all takes in a matter of hours and just has a certain energy to the pacing that makes it one of the shortest 2 hours film I&#39;ve ever watched.</p> <p>When they say no one knows how to shoot LA like Michael Mann, they really aren&#39;t kidding imo. So many amazing of the city landscape throughout this film.</p> <p>Michael Mann&#39;s directing style is just absolutely brilliant and one of the most unique out there that gives this film a unique identity as well.</p> <p>Tom Cruise as this move&#39;s villain is very well maybe my favorite role he&#39;s ever done as well. It&#39;s nice to see an actor who&#39;s constantly playing the hero play the villain once and boy Cruise do that well here.</p> <p>Of course, there are times where some realism and law",
