Because Apple&#39;s \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitch ass made it to where you have to have a damn subscription to be able to view lyrics when listening to a song on the app. And even more disgusting and \ud83c\udd71\ufe0fitch made enough, even when you purchase a song on the iTunes store and play it in the apple music app you STILL can&#39;t see the lyrics when you play the song even though you actually bought it (unless I have missed something or am doing something wrong). Now mind you, via a Spotify bot I got one song that actually, crazy enough has the lyrics in there and I CAN in fact view them when the song is playing in the Apple Music app, so THAT alone should be proof enough that this stuff is possible. I don&#39;t know, ",

I already know of Kemono, but most artists sell them on Ko-fi, Payhip or other sites that are not compatible with Kemono. </p> <p>If you like this sort of thing, you can also mesage me and we could possibly exchange assets, bases and files! Or gather more fellow leakers to share with each other privately and anonymously. I didnt find any post about this so I decided to make one. :)</p> <p>A lot of them are for furries / furry anthro characters but there\u2019s a bunch for human / anime-like characters too. </p> <p>Don\u2019t comment saying I should \u201cjust buy them\u201d they\u2019re locked behind subscriptions or general paywalls and I don\u2019t have the funds to do so.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Uruzumaki\"> /u/Uruzumaki </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1mgj07v/about_paid_art_assets_bases_linearts_psd_raw_files/\">[",
