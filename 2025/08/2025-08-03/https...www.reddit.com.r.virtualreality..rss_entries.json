Upon recent reflection and an itch to join another jam, we realized the reason we stopped was that no one was hosting game jams that encouraged, or sometimes even allowed, VR games. So\u2026 we decided to remedy this and are hosting a VR only game jam: <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/reality-jam-2025\">Reality++ Game Jam</a></p> <p>There are 4 prizes you can win: 1st ($100), 2nd ($50), 3rd ($25), and community winner ($25).
