The last one that works is 2.1.1 (did not check 2.1.2), with the 6.6.63 kernel. Everything after this point stays with black screen after showing the initial bianbu logo. No SSH access either.</p> <p>Checked the armbian image for the bananapi f3, that used to work in the past(at least for SSH), they dont work either now.</p> <p>Seems that something changed in the spacemit kernel some time ago and no one even reported it or cared about it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shivansps\"> /u/shivansps </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1mgn29v/lichee_pi_3a_not_longer_works_since_bianbu_os_22/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1mgn29v/lichee_pi_3a_not_longer_works_since_bianbu_os_22/\">[co",
