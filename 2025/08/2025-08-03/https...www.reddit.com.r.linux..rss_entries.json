I code on my machine usually C++ and java or some Android dev stuff, and currently thinking about web3.</p> <p>Now I have multiple questions- Please Answer them</p> <p>1) I am thinking of dual booting the linux os, as I have windows lifetime subscription so don&#39;t want to loose that, and just for switching between the them, is that good or will it affect my system performance (i5-12 HX) (16 GB) (1 TB SSD)??</p> <p>2) Which distribution will be the best for me, personally I liked fedora because of its gui, but I want something on which I can learn more about the fun",
