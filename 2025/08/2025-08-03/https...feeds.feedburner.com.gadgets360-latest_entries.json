        "description": "China successfully launched Pakistan\u2019s first dedicated remote sensing satellite, PRSS-01, aboard a Kuaizhou-1A rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan. The satellite entered its planned orbit and will provide high-resolution imaging for civilian and governmental uses, including urban planning, land surveys, environmental monitoring, and rapid disaster response. Engineers from both countries collaborated closely on the mission, reflecting deepening China-Pakistan technological ties. The launch highlights Pakistan\u2019s growing ambitions in space and the importance of satellite-based data in modern infrastructure and emergency planning. It also strengthens China\u2019s position as a global provider of commercial launch services and supports its broader Belt and Road Initiative by fostering regional cooperation in advanced space technologies.",

        "description": "Astronomers have long speculated about a hidden planet\u2014Planet Nine\u2014lurking beyond Neptune. First proposed in 2016, the theory explains the strange orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects through the gravitational pull of a massive, unseen world. Caltech researchers remain confident, while others suggest alternatives like debris rings or even a black hole. Recent discoveries such as 2023 KQ14 deepen the mystery. Despite limited data, the search continues with advanced telescopes, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge of the solar system\u2019s remote edges.",
