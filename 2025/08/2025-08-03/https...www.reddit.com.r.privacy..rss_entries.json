I suspect that I was possibly hacked and theyre using my card on their uber as im still being charged.</p> <p>This has never happened before and im really scared on what could happen. What steps should I take to make sure all my accounts and data are safe?</p> <p>Thank you. (I want to note I really am not well versed in any types of methods for security.
