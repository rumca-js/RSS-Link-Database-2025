However, I am feeling like taking a small break before I tackle the next one, and I would love a fantasy palate cleanser. Something wholesome, unproblematic, which will have be smiling and kicking my feet lol. I loved &quot;The Goblin Emperor&quot; when I read it, and that would be the perfect sort of thing, other than the fact that it was lacking a wholesome romance plot. In short, I&#39;m looking for a standalone, preferably medieval, wholesome fantasy, with nice characters, maybe slice of life? and hopefully with a nice romance to boot!
