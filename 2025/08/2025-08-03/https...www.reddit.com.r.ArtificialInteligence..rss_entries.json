Yes, it is likely that there will be a better understanding of mental illnesses by 2033, primarily due to advancements in AI, data analysis, and brain imaging technologies. Currently, AI is already used to analyze brain data patterns (e.g., fMRI, EEG) and identify biomarkers for mental disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. For example, studies use machine learning to detect brain activity patterns associated with specific disorders. By 2033, with advancements in high-resolution neuroimaging and more advanced AI, we will likely develop more accurate models of the biological and psychological mechanisms of mental illnesses. This understanding will also improve due to large-scale studies combining genetic, environmental, and social data. For instance, projects like the Human Bra",
