I looked around and thought the Jonsbo N4 would be a good case for that purpose, but that + all the components I would need to acquire make it quite expensive for something that won&#39;t actually improve anything by much. For instance I couldn&#39;t find many mATX motherboards with 8 SATA ports, the MSI i found is already another $100. Do I really need 8 ports? I have 5 HDDs, am planning for the 6th one, and that does not account for the SSDs that I may want to use too... With a dedicated build I could also reuse my old drives under 6Tb I guess.</p> <p>I could keep my current Zalman Z12 case for storage, and stick to ATX instead of mATX for that build, that may make things a bit cheaper though bigger footprint and uglier.
