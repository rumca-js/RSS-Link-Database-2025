I knew I wouldn\u2019t ever switch to windows 11 for my gaming pc but kinda expected I\u2019d switch to steamOS but that hasn\u2019t manifested (nvidia gpu). The problem is I always run my gpu with an undervolt (rtx 3080). Not undervolted I can see power usage up to around 300 watts while undervolted with a slight overclock (from base) it\u2019s under 200. So we\u2019re talking between the undervolt overclock around 2/3 the power usage for the same performance and less noise. Point is I really am looking around for a good utility to undervolt a nvidia gpu in Linux and I haven\u2019t found anything.</p> <p>Here Aka what do you use to undervolt nvidia gpus on Linux? Are there good options right now or are we in between stuff because nvidia recently changed something? Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",

However, the Ultra graphic settings don&#39;t look like Ultra settings ingame. </p> <p>As an example, I recently finished Uncharted 4, all graphic settings are maxed out but everything like textures, render distances, artifacts etc. look worse than what it looks like on the PS4 version when I look at gameplay videos on YT. It could be a bad port from Playstation to PC but I&#39;ve noticed it with a lot of other games that are similarly old. Like, for example, when a game from 2014 gets played on a PC with the best GPU that was available at that time on Ultra settings, it looks better than when I play it with my GPU that is more powerful on Ultra settings.
