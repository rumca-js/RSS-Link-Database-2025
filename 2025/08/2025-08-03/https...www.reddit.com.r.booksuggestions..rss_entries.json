On her most recent birthday, she received the book &quot;A Ration Book Daughter&quot; by Jean Fullerton, which she raved about enjoying for its romance and wartime narrative (as she&#39;s an Englishwoman born in 1933, she remembers many of the events mentioned). As her days for the past few years after my grandfather passed has been little other than puzzles and maintaining the house, I thought this might be the time to push her back into reading - riding the momentum of a book she enjoyed. </p> <p>I&#39;m aware that she&#39;s enjoyed a few books from Agatha Christie a long time back (so mystery seems on the table), and that she doesn&#39;t mind history (fact or fiction).

I\u2019m looking for an overall crowd pleasing book for work. I\u2019m going to use music as an example. When I have a party, I don\u2019t play music that only I enjoy; I try to pick music EVERYONE enjoys (like Queen or The Beatles). I\u2019m looking for a book series in the same sense as party music. I practice language immersion to teach English and by doing so, I read books on a live stream for a social platform dedicated to learning new languages and so, I\u2019ve been reading the Harry Potter series in English. However, I only have two and a half Harry Potter books left to read. After I\u2019m done with that, I\u2019ll need new material but I\u2019m not allowed to read or discuss violence and politics (I\u2019m assuming anything of the s*xual natural is off the table as well).

Other books I\u2019ve been loving are the My Brilliant Friend series by Elena Ferrante and Midnight\u2019s Children by Salman Rushdie. I\u2019m also currently reading The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera. Post-war fiction seems to be my niche right now. Anyway!!! Any suggestions?
