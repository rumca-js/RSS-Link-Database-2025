Repeating the same skills slows down the increase, allowing us to get rid of mana, stamina or any other mechanic that would stop you from activating any skill you wish (except for ultimates for balance).</p> <p>The mid-run progression takes inspiration from ARPGs. You do have loot dropping from enemies in a form of runes, which you place in slots granting you new passive bonuses and altering your skill effects.</p> <p>You start from the base, where you equip your gear, and also gather resources too unlock",
