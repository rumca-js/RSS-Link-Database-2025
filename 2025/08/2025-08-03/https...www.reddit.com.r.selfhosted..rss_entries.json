I tried looking for posts where people would have posted for the same situation that I&#39;m in but I didn&#39;t.</p> <p>For about 10 years I rented a dedicated server and it was cool for me. I turned it into a seedbox with swizzin, use plex/plexamp for my media and used it as a VPN when I&#39;m abroad with wireguard.</p> <p>But I started realizing that with the monthly cost, I could have bought a nice setup and own the thing ! I feel like if I build my own thing, I could get a decent setup to transcode my media and expand the storage if I need it. With my server I have to delete stuff every once in a while or I quickly saturate my 2TB and I can&#39;t transcode or the price skyrockets...</p> <p>So as mentioned previously, I want to build a seedbox protected by a VPN and a media server with some other self hosted tools such as VPN and cloud storage primarly.</p>",
