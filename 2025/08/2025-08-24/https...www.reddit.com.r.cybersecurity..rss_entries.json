This is the only way we are going to be able to defend infrastructure. What would such an ai agents look like?? I&#39;m thinking we start with an openbsd core, or maybe a Qubes core, or NixOS core, and we bake an ai with some GPU for muscle?? Would we start with a claud llm? Or go rhr MoE route?? Recently I saw that someone built an AI which essentially navigate and uses your website or platform, and then builds documentation and serves as first level support for users and staff. That&#39;s a brilliant use of AI, so would we train this Jarvis on the various open source tools available, after it graduates from IT school of course.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hiveminer\"> /u/hiveminer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1mylko9/cybersecurity_jarvis/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a h",
