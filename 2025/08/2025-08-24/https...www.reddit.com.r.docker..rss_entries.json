I want to do this with using one of my 4 network interfaces on the server.</p> <p>What I have read is that WSL2 uses some kind of Hyper-V network wrapper and with standard-settings the network interfaces are not available in WSL2. So I set network mirroring and now my interfaces are also visible in WSL2 / Ubuntu and they also have the same IP like in Windows. So the mapping seems to work.</p> <p>Now I enter the following command (in Windows and Ubuntu I get the same error):</p> <p><code>docker network create -d ipvlan --subnet 192.168.2.0/24 --gateway 192.168.2.1 -o parent=eth3 ipvlan2</code></p> <p>I get this error:</p> <p><code>Error response from daemon: invalid subinterface vlan name eth3, example formatting is eth0",
