The other day we had a MTF trans person try to go in and one of my coworkers asked her if they were male because they were confused as to why they were trying to go in when presenting as female and she said yes but I checked the ID that she gave to us and it had female listed on it. She presented as female and identified as female. I brought this up and informed her about our male-only policy. She got very upset about it and showed me another ID that had Male on it but I told her that our decision was final. She clearly identifies as female and our policy states only male presenting, male identifying individuals are allowed in. She even called me transphobic at one point. We have had FTM trans men inside so trans men are very much accepted to go inside. What do you think should have happened? Both IDs were licenses from the same state. I\u2019m assumin",
