The resulting data leak means that users of Google services\u2014including Gmail and Google Cloud\u2014are now at risk of falling victim to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2584026/4-exotic-phishing-scams-are-surging-heres-how-to-catch-them-in-the-act.html\">phishing attempts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-produ",
