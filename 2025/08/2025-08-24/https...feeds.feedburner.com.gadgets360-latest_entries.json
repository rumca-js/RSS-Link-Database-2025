The meteor appeared at 11:08 p.m. local time, glowing green-blue with flashes so bright they rivaled the moon before bursting into orange-red fragments above the Pacific Ocean. Security and dashcam cameras captured the dazzling display, while some residents reported feeling shockwaves as it passed. Experts say the fireball was likely caused by a small asteroid fragment burning up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Though it coincided with the Perseid meteor shower, astronomers note it may have been a sporadic event.",

But new simulations suggest it may instead be a compact star cluster bound by black holes and neutron stars. Located 30,000 light-years away, Ursa Major III contains just ~60 visible stars yet shows puzzlingly high stellar velocities. The new analysis explains this without invoking dark matter, challenging assumptions about tiny galaxies. If correct, it reduces the Milky Way\u2019s dwarf count and may reveal an entirely new class of faint stellar systems.",
