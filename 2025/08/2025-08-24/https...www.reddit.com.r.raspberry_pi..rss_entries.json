I&#39;d like to command it all over ssh and use a basic x11 or wayland shell with no login manager or desktop environment. just basic enough to display a fullscreen app. I&#39;d like to avoid remote desktop software too.</p> <p>right now, that pi has ubuntu server installed and doing nothing. This is probably more of a simple linux question but I&#39;ma ask here just in case someone has done something simular and want to share a build log. :)</p> <p>I don&#39;t know what programs to use that would enable me to remotely control it with shell commands and/or something to watch a directory for images.</p> <p>suggestions?</p> <p>this might inspire the creation of a pi powered picture frame maybe.</p> </",
