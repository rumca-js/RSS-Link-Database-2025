I\u2019m Daemon Hatfield and I\u2019m joined by Max Scoville and Jada Griffin from Podcast Beyond. And there\u2019s been a lot of news this week as it relates to this very show. We have the release date for the Xbox ROG Ally X handheld. It\u2019s less than two months away but they haven\u2019t revealed the price, yet. Not a good sign. There is apparently consensus among developers here at gamescom that they have to start making games faster. Music to my ears. But let\u2019s start with some PlayStation news this week. PlayStation isn\u2019t here at gamescom but it did have an announcement to make.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #gamescom2025",
