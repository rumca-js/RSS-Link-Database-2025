Along with all the IDEs and other configurations, I would like for the VM to have some level of privacy through encryption of some sort.</p> <p>Before I start, please know that although I am a dev (full-stack .NET mostly), I also am a complete Linux noob. I reached my breaking point with Windows and their anti-privacy policy, but I have to say, switching from Windows to Ubuntu has NOT been a breeze. No 2 applications with the same installation process, the same configuration requirements, tons of crashes, zero user friendliness, no GUI, etc...</p> <p>Anyway...</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried LUKS, but after 20 hours of work to set it up, it turns out that it has the downside of filling the virtual disk all the way to the maximum set at configuration.

Truly, I haven&#39;t liked Windows in ages..since Vista. Yeah it&#39;s easier to use but I am up for the challenge and it seems Ubuntu is the option that will fit my needs. HOWEVER my cpu cooler is an NZXT Kraken Elite which seems isn&#39;t supported on Linux. There&#39;s a workaround, but has anyone had luck with these coolers while using linux? Mine has an LCD screen which is the biggest part I&#39;m referring to.</p> <p>Feel free to drop any advice or suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beneficial_Dealer340\"> /u/Beneficial_Dealer340 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1myka76/nzxt_and_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1myka76/nzxt_and_linux/\">[",

No status bar, exif data, menu etc.</li> <li>I&#39;ve found a few viewers that do the above, what I&#39;m having trouble with is <strong>being able to zoom and pan with the mouse without switching to a discrete zoom value.

Holding down mouse2 does the same, except at a higher zoom factor (300% or whatever).</strong> And again, releasing it returns to the default &quot;fit to screen&quot;.</li> </ul> <p>I haven",
