Can anyone recommend me the best ones to use with this? For context currently I use real debrid and torbox essentials so wondering if also by upgrading to torbox pro and getting some usenet indexers I could maybe drop real debrid? I watch movies and series so this is what it is for. Thanks for any information you guys can provide as I am really new to usenet</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Joshmswfc\"> /u/Joshmswfc </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1mzayda/new_to_usenet/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1mzayda/new_to_usenet/\">[comments]</a></span>",
