My rig\u2019s an RTX 2070 + AMD 5600X \u2014 should be fine for most PCVR games, right?</p> <p>Here\u2019s my main question: for rhythm games like <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened</em>, <em>Beat Saber</em>, and <em>Maestro</em> \u2014 is it better to run them on PCVR or just stick with standalone? I heard <em>Maestro</em>\u2019s hand tracking is actually less accurate on PCVR, so I grabbed the standalone version.</p> <p>I know PCVR = better graphics and framerate, but since it\u2019s wireless I\u2019m worried about tiny audio delays. And as you all know, timing is everything in rhythm games.</p> <p>So which makes more sense?</p> <ol> <li>Stick with standalone + QGO for better visuals/framerate, zero latency.</li> <li>Go PCVR \u2014 latency isn\u2019t noticeable anyway, enjoy max graphics + smoothness.</li> </ol> <p>What do you guys think?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It seems in recent times the industry is trending towards the direction where the PSVR2 isn\u2019t receiving as much devs support as Quest and PCVR, going from what we see in the recent VR Games Showcase. When devs have multi-platform releases for their VR titles, it\u2019s PSVR2 that gets excluded or late release. Like Glassbreakers Champion of Moss, Hidden Memories of the Garden, of Lies and Rain, EXOShock etc. on the other end of the spectrum, practically all of the PSVR2 games are also coming to Quest and/or PC</p> <p>One other thing that\u2019s rather noticeable to me however, is that the PSVR2 is severely lacking 3rd party racing sim games , even for racing games that has VR on PC. Like Assetto Corsa EVO, F1 24, WRC etc</p> <p>The latest example is Project Motor Racing, where the devs recently said they are putting PSVR2 support into the backburner, but the VR support for PC remains. Not a hard \u201cno\u201d but rather close. </p> <p><a href=\"https://traxion.gg/project",
