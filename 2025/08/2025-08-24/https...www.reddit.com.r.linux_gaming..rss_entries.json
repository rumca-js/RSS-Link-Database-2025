Specially the early times of WINE that got us where we are now. like the complexity and scope of the project is insane when you think about it that would discourage even the most talented developers. When you think about it WINE is pretty much a crowd-sourced clone of Windows\u2019 userland. And the insane part not everything or little API quirks are documented from Microsoft and WINE developers had to reverse engineer a lot of those quirks and code them in the implementation.</p> <p>I mean WINE developers have done such a good job that genuinely you would have a better time running an older game or software on WINE than on modern day&#39;s Windows 11.</p> <p>I know I haven&#39;t talked about Valve more and they really gave WINE that little push it needed, but without the early effort of WINE I don&#39;t think Valve would&#39;ve considered Linux ever ",

I have a concept for a new anti-cheat system that focuses on player reputation rather than technical detection. The goal is to make cheating so costly and inconvenient that cheaters are isolated from the main player base.</p> <p>The idea is a <strong>&quot;Trust Score&quot;</strong> system tied to a game and its platform (e.g., Steam). Here&#39;s how it would work:</p> <h1>1. Building Your Trust Profile</h1> <ul> <li>Your Trust Score starts low on a new account.</li> <li>You gain trust points by linking and verifying your digital footprint.</li> <li><strong>Essential:</strong> A simple &quot;yes/no&quot; verification from a platform like Steam that an active, non-fraudulent payment method (like a credit card or PayPal) is linked to the account. This doesn&#39;t share any financial data, just confirms legitimacy.</li> <li><strong>Bonus Points:</stro",
