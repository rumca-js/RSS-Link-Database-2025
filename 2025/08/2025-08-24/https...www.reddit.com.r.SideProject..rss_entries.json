It became a sophisticated habitat tracker app which is in internal testing phase and I&#39;m quite happy with it (some improvments still need to be done).</p> <p>Now comes the bummer.. I just discovered I need 12 different testers testing my app for 14 consecutive days! Omg. How do others get them?

Honestly, AI has given me a massive productivity boost, taught me tons of new things, and yeah\u2026 sometimes it\u2019s been a real headache too \ud83d\ude05</p> <p>I thought I\u2019d share some lessons from my own experience.

The output is usually messy and inconsistent. Break it down into small steps and validate each one.</li> <li><strong>You still have to lead.</strong> AI is creative, but you\u2019re the developer. Use your experience to guide the direction.</li> <li><strong>Ask for a spec first.</strong> Instead of \u201cjust code it,\u201d I often start by having AI write a short feature spec. Saves a lot of mistakes later.</li> </ul",

Pocket money is a great starting point, but I noticed there wasn\u2019t really an app that was both <strong>family-friendly</strong> and <strong>easy to use</strong> without hidden costs. That\u2019s why I decided to build my own app, called <strong>Allowance Tracker Family</strong>.</p> <p>The app started as something just for my daughter, but I realized it could also be useful for other families. It\u2019s completely free to use and designed with simplicity in mind. You can:</p> <ul> <li>Add multiple children or family members</li> <li>Create transactions for each person (like pocket money, gifts, or expenses)</li> <li>Easily keep track of balances so kids see how much they have left</li> </ul> <p>My goal is to make it a tool that parents and kids can use together to learn about money management.

It\u2019s a simple AI voice generator where you can type text and instantly get natural-sounding voices. You can try it free.</p> <p>Right now it supports:</p> <ul> <li>7 US male + 5 US female voices</li> <li>4 UK male + 8 UK female voices</li> <li>5 Indian regional voices (Hindi, Tamil, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi)</li> </ul> <p>I built this because I felt existing tools had complicated pricing, and they don\u2019t really support Indian regional accents. So I wanted something simpler and more creator-friendly.</p> <p>I\u2019d love your feedback on:</p> <ul> <li>What other voices/languages should I add?</li> <li>Would you actually use this for projects (YouTube, TikTok, teaching, etc.)?</li> </ul> <p>Still very rough, but works improving it every week. Suggestions and criticism welcome.</p> <p>",

Most sleep apps I tried felt bloated or locked sounds behind paywalls, so I built CalmNest as a side project to learn Android dev. It\u2019s a free, offline app with ~20 sounds (rain, ocean, white/pink/brown noise, etc.), a sleep timer, and mixable tracks with volume controls. All sounds are free to use.</p> <p>It\u2019s got some light ads to keep it free, but I tried to make them non-intrusive. Curious what sounds or features help you sleep, or what makes a sleep app stick around for you? If you want to try it, it\u2019s on the Play Store: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sam.calmnest.sleeprelax.\">Calmnest : Sleep &amp; Relax</a> No pressure \u2013 just looking for feedback or your sleep hacks. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Se",
