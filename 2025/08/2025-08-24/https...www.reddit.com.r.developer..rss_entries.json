I\u2019d love to eventually build something similar (maybe a smaller MVP first), but I\u2019m not sure where to start in terms of knowledge and skills.</p> <p>So far, I know the basics of web development (Laravel / <a href=\"http://ASP.NET\">ASP.NET</a> / Node.js), but I realize that building a workflow automation SaaS is on another level. Before diving in, I want to understand what <strong>core concepts and technologies</strong> I should learn or master.</p> <p>Some things I <em>think</em> I need to look into:</p> <ul> <li>Message queues like <strong>RabbitMQ</strong> or <strong>Kafka</strong> for handling jobs/events</li> <li><strong>Webhooks</strong> and API integrations</li> <li><strong>OAuth2 / API authentication</st",

I think it actually turned out pretty good in my opinion, but I can\u2019t seem to get any upvotes.<br/> Basically, it\u2019s a SaaS that lets couples create a page where they can store their memories. It came out quite beautiful and minimalistic, but I don\u2019t understand why it has 0 upvotes on Product Hunt\u2014even though I even created an extra account and upvoted my own product.</p> <p>If anyone has suggestions about what could be wrong or can support, I\u2019d really appreciate it.<br/> <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/darling?utm_source=other&amp;utm_medium=social\">https://www.producthunt.com/posts/darling?utm_source=other&amp;utm_medium=social</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/f_azendeiro\"> /u/f_azendeiro </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1myujru/is_my_project_good/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=",
