Pilot Tycoon is a career sim-RPG about the parts of being an airline pilot that flight sims never show you.</p> <p>You&#39;ll start where every pilot does - dead last on the seniority list, bidding for whatever scraps of a schedule the senior pilots didn&#39;t want. Four-day trips through small cities for barely-livable wages? Welcome to year one. But nail those quick-time events during emergencies, keep your stress in check, and slowly watch those four stripes materialize on your shoulders.</p> <p><strong>No need for a flight stick or 500-page manual here.</strong> This isn&#39;t about hand-flying across",
