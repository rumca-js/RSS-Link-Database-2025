The problem is waking it back up.</p> <p>I want to use a raspberry pi as a proxy between the NAS and any device accessing it. To access a file, an SMB request will be sent to the raspberry pi. If the NAS is online, the proxy will forward the request. If it is in sleep mode, the proxy will send a WoL packet to the NAS, wait a few seconds, and then forward the traffic to the NAS.</p> <p>Is there a program out there that can do this for me?

I&#39;m really excited about this feature, and hope it helps make managing self hosted infrastructure easier than ever.</p> <p>Additionally, the Build process now supports <strong>pushing to multiple docker registries</strong>.
