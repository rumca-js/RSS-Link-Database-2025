If the AI model says something is cancer and the trainer says it isn\u2019t, then (right or wrong), the AI says it isn\u2019t. </p> <p>So how does the AI then get credit for being better at the doctor who effectively trained the AI?</p> <p>Caveats:</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear if this is the case, but it\u2019s possible that, once trained, the AI is tested against some really bad doctors who couldn\u2019t recognize cancer in an X ray if their life depended on it\u2026. If so, it\u2019s good to know who the quacks are but it\u2019s ",
