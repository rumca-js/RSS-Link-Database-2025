Some said if one drive currupts it also destroys the other one, but if one drive fails the other one is safe. So I want to setup a Nas to store data so how do I A setup a Nas and B implement a storage solution. And is it worth it to buy another HDD for cold storage for important data?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impressive_Oil_2828\"> /u/Impressive_Oil_2828 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1mysjer/how_do_you_actually_handle_backup_solutions/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoard",

I&#39;ve seen a couple new enterprise drives listing for that insane $15.6/TB and so many shuckables for even less. The &quot;best&quot; pricing I calculated was 24TB at $330 which is $13.7/TB... that&#39;s nuts. I vividly remember some SATA options being something around $7.9/TB (most weren&#39;t above $9/TB). Also this is the pricing before import taxes and shipping, for me it probably reaches $18/TB after those everything. Insane.</p> <p>I personally went to shucking since the shipping to SPD(/others) was expensive &am",

I know ssd drives can\u2019t be left unpowered for as long as hdd can. But does their life degrade quicker if powered on 24/7 without reading or writing to them?</p> <p>If ssd nas is no good, I was thinking of a 1 bay nas for my portable. The space I need is 24tb total.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic_Bookkeeper\"> /u/Fantastic_Bookkeeper </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1myjf09/which_ssd_nas/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1myjf09/which_ssd_nas/\">[comments]</a></span>",
