Using package managers such as Conan allows easy retrieval of dependencies, including binaries, avoiding continuous and expensive rebuilds from source.\n\nWhile this work easily for third party dependencies, when dependencies are very stable, quick evolution in a large dependency graph when there are different developers working concurrently in different packages, can be more challenging.\n\nWith Conan 2 new tools it is possible to implement an efficient Continuous Integration process for large scale projects, computing what packages need to be built, and in what specific order and parallelism.\n\nThe concept of \"products pipeline\" will be introduced as an scalable ",
