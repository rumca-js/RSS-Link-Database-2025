Thanks to all the musicians who have been sending in videos - many more arrived after I'd recorded this - I will watch, we will reply and we will cover more, so keep them coming. \nThe email address to send them to is on the home page.\nLinks to all of the videos featured here will follow later tonight.....so please check back. \n**Please note - we're not monetising this video - any revenue from ads will go to the bands featured** \n\nTo come and see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again ",
