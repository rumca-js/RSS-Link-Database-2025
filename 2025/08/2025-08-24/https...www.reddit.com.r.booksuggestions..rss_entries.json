There should just be loads of scenes where they truly get to know and trust each other, and where their relationship is explored in depth. The first kiss should take place at the earliest around the 70% mark. I tend to get bored when the couple gets together. I really like shy girl \u00d7 popular guy or grumpy/sunshine.

I loved how Acomaf made me feel, but I also was a high schooler who loved romantasy and was desperate to read SOMETHING that grabbed my attention. I loved it, but of course noticed a ton of flaws with the writing style and things that did turn me off throughout the book and rest of series. I\u2019m looking to get back into books that give me the same feeling. I love a solid believable magic system and fantasy/military themes that are still somewhat grounded(logical, and characters that are not overpowered, etc). I\u2019d love to read something that gives me similar satisfaction to acomaf, but now that I\u2019m 20 years old, I want something a bit more polished than the acotar series. I LOVE authors like Samantha Shannon (I love priory of the orange tree) and Brandon Sanderson (great world building and magic, but I\u2019d prefer smth less YA) any recs? I\u2019m leaning towards more high fantasy/ romance fantasy concepts Note: p",

Something along history, anthropology, or sociology. I wouldn\u2019t mind whether or not it\u2019s fiction. As long as I feel more educated and can fact drop interesting statements with friends. Also nothing too long as Im still new to reading and dont want to get bored. </p> <p>P.S not Sapiens as I\u2019ve heard lots of people criticize it and I lost interest in giving it a shot.</p> <p>I literally feel like I\u2019ve been wasting my brain\u2019s capacity on TikTok and would rather fill it up with something more beneficial. </p> <p>thanksss</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/boutafall\"> /u/boutafall <",
