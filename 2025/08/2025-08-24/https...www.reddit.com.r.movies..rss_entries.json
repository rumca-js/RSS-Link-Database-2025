This is a normal way to process emotions, most adults do this but the problem is he is only 4. Most of the sad movies out there are not appropriate for kids and most kids movies aren&#39;t really sad, or at least sad for kids. The opening scene in &#39;UP&#39; breaks my heart every time but it doesn&#39;t really register for a kid. </p> <p>We often use &#39;Song of the Sea&#39;. It&#39;s great animated movie but we need something new.

There are a lot of subtle details to add to the story or just there for comedic value. The script is filled with short narrations or one liners that have little to do with the characters or plot but provide hilarious comedic moments.

I nonchalantly said I\u2019d pass and wanted to see something more current. TBH I did not have the cojones to admit that this movie freaked me the f**k out when I first watched it-this was after released to video! If I recall it\u2019s \u201cloosely\u201d based on a true story? I lived in LA during this time and \u201cknew of\u201d the \u201ccharacter types\u201d to a distant extent. I don\u2019t want to give too much away but I do remember the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the kid brother I think it was and the shocking outcome. This movie completely shook me to my core! To this day I remember being sooo distraught and disturbed I cannot bring myself to watch again almost 20 years later. I\u2019m in my feelings composing this post. Did this movie affect anyone else this way? Is there another movie that affected you in this manner?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Low_Insurance_1603\"> /u/Lo",

I remember watching it for the first time not knowing anything about the plot, and when the twist finally hit\u2014that Bruce Willis\u2019 character was dead the whole time\u2014it honestly flipped my brain. I sat in silence for a good five minutes just replaying the whole movie in my head. Suddenly, all those little details made sense, and I realized how carefully the film was crafted to hide the truth in plain sight.</p> <p>What I really appreciate is how the twist doesn\u2019t feel cheap. Some movies throw in a random reveal at the end just for shock value, but The Sixth Sense actually becomes a richer film after you know the ending. Rewatching it feels like a completely different experience, almost like you\u2019re seeing it from another perspective.</p> <p>Another one that stuck with me was Fight Club.

Considered one of, if not the, first mainstream movies to &quot;deconstruct&quot; the western, it was labeled &quot;down right Un-American&quot; by John Wayne due to it&#39;s plot regarding a town that refused to help the hero.

Stylistically, the film emphasizes reflection, not just memory, but self-reflection in a world that defines Black children before they can define themselves. And literal reflections. Elwood sees reflections everywhere: in MLK on TV, in people around him, in windows and glass, confronting himself and the world s",

It\u2019s interesting to see the Predator communicate verbally and to have what appears to be a young face, apparently it\u2019s the Predators first hunt and it chose the most hostile place to do it. Not sure about the female companion with no legs that he is seen wearing in a backpack but maybe she\u2019s a badass and can provide some vintage comic relief like Jesse Ventura in the originals.
