On the other hand, I am hearing lots of good things about Mistborn, and want to get the trilogy box set and get immersed in &quot;Sandersonia&quot;.

Not after anything too high-brow, groundbreaking or heartbreaking - think along the lines of Brandon Sanderson books but with more compelling romance than his. Also no more than 3 (completed) books please! For a great example, I adored Chakraborty&#39;s City of Brass series for it&#39;s interesting setting and premise with the not-too-spicy romance. I&#39;ve found &quot;romantasy&quot; recs like Maas&#39;s ACOTAR feel (to me) like the romance/spice gets in the way of the actual story progression so I think I&#39;m primarily looking for Fantasy with a romance subplot.
