        "description": "Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region is on the frontline of the military and diplomatic battle over the country\u2019s future.   It\u2019s rich in natural resources and has been fought over since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, at huge cost to both sides.  \n\nRussia already controls most of Donetsk.  Now President Putin is demanding that Ukraine hands over the rest of it,  as part of the price of any peace agreement. \n\nMeanwhile the fighting continues, with Russian troops making slow but steady advances.   Towns and villages lie in ruins, drones circle overhead searching for targets and the remaining civilians are forced to flee for their lives. \n\nA BBC team has travelled into Donetsk, to the frontline town of Dobropillia, which is under daily Russian attack and with its water supplies cut off.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
