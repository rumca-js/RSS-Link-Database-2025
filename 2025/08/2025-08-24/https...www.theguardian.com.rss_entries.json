Instead, the Englishman had to see off the burden of recent history. Fleetwood prevailed, taking his maiden PGA Tour title on his 164th start. Sometimes the good guys win. East Lake delivered one of the most heartwarming tales of the sporting year, a victory for persistence and proof that a relatable golfer can be a triumphant one.</p><p>Fleetwood displayed magnificent mental strength to brush aside scar tissue caused by falling short, agonisingly so, twice since late June. The most remarkable thing about this success was how unremarkable it all looked. Fleetwood\u2019s closing 68 was so blissfully simple.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/24/tommy-fleetwood-wins-tour-championship",

This August\u2019s season-opening matches were supposed to be the start, when he could be properly judged. Instead, he is already nine months into the job that enveloped five predecessors. Initial positive signs gave way to the muddle United closed last season within, casting a hungover shadow over attempts at a full reboot.</p><p>After Rodrigo Muniz\u2019s own-goal, claimed by Leny Yoro, Craven Cottage became that nine months in microcosm, Amorim\u2019s team incapable of putting their opponent away. Bruno Fernandes\u2019s uncharacteristic first-half penalty miss was redolent of a team full of psychological as well as tactical and personnel problems.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/24/fulham-manchest",

But he did kick all six of his shots at goal</p><p>Handr\u00e9 Pollard doesn\u2019t simply point to the poles. The South African metronome, his face stuck in a perpetual scowl, thrusts a meaty finger towards the uprights as if he owns them. \u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he growls, with the promise that in just a few short seconds an oval ball will be spiralling through them courtesy of his swinging right boot.</p><p>If there\u2019s such a thing as a Test match animal then it is Pollard, the only fly-half present at the final whistle of two victorious World Cup campaigns. And Test match animals win Test matches. Whatever transpires across 80 minutes is almost immaterial. All that matters is the result.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/aug/24/south-africa-australia-wallabies-handre-pollard-",

Plump and penguin-like, the great auk had survived for hundreds of thousands of years until humans discovered the utility of its soft down feathers, eggs and meat. Great auks mate for life, and it was on Eldey island in Iceland where the final pair on Earth met their fate at the hands of three fishermen who fell upon them.</p><p>\u201cI took him by the neck and he flapped his wings.
