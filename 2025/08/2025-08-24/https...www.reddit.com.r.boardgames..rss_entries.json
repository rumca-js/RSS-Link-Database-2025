I live in Qu\u00e9bec, a french speaking province of Canada. I love the game Codenames and bought a Qu\u00e9bec edition full of local slang and cultural references. I enjoy this edition more because of that. I was wondering if other local editions existed? And what is your experience with them? I looked on wikipedia (english and french) and found no mentions, even of the Qu\u00e9bec edition.</p> <p>On the same topic, do you know games that have local editions that are more fun than the original?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kingpin1905\"> /u/kingpin1905 </a> <br/> <span",

I&#39;m getting beat at Gaia Project, Concordia, and Ezra &amp; Nehemiah. In most cases I&#39;m losing by about 30%.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I hate it when I&#39;m not in the running. If I lose by a little, I know that I was at least on the right track. One turn could be the deciding factor. But when I get beat by 25% or more, I feel like a clueless idiot. The game of Concordia I lost this week had four players, two of whom were relative non-gamers that I was teaching the game to for the first time. They came in first and second. My wife was a respectable third.
