        "description": "Unlike many other rogue-lites, The Rogue Prince of Persia feels like it's geared more towards its conclusion. Which isn't a bad thing, but it does hinder the replay value in comparison. \n\nIt's still an incredibly crafted, gorgeous title that delivers one of the strongest combinations of movement and traversal, even with its hang-ups. Here's hoping that just like with Dead Cells, Evil Empire puts in the time to transform it from quite good to something truly legendary. \n\nThe Prince would certainly settle for nothing less.",

        "description": "With Borderlands 4 right around the corner, we could not help but revisit a title that is not only our favorite in the franchise, but among our favorite looter shooters of all time. Borderlands 2 was the perfect amalgamation of everything that made the franchise the behemoth that it is today.\n\nIts story and world building were so on point, they made the first game pale in comparison. Its cast of characters were both memorable and relatable, with Handsome Jack managing to steal the spotlight away from other characters every time he took the stage. \n\nThe expanded loot system made everything about the first game all the more special and improved on the experience by a mile. It's no wonder, then, that Borderlands 2 has earned this tribute.",

        "description": "As the final part of our series covering the origins of important characters in Metal Gear Solid 3, the Cobra Unit and its members bring interesting backstories and a unique set of skills to the table. As supersoldiers who utilised their time with The Boss to fine tune a wide array of battle tactics to form a deadly tactical unit, each member of this elite team is a fascinating addition to the story of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.\n\nAside from their fascinating motivations, their characters reveal strengths and weaknesses, knowledge of which could mean the difference between victory and defeat for Naked Snake as he encounters them during his efforts to stop Colonel Volgin.",
