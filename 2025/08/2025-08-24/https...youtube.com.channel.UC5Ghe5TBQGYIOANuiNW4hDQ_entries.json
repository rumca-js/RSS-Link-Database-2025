        "description": "The economy is made up of real resources and the people who produce and own them. Money is different. Money is supposed to represent these real things and the relations between them, but it often fails to. Focusing too much on money \u2013 and interest rates and monetary policy \u2013 blinds us to how the economy actually works. Gary explains why this is so important if we want to change anything.\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nSpecial message: I've been meeting MPs, lords, political influencers, TV and radio presenters and heads of think tanks every week to convince them to tax wealth not work. Momentum is seriously growing behind wealth taxes as we head towards the autumn Budget. We need your help to keep making videos every week, growing our team and building the movement to tax wealth not work.
