I remember it featured many Japanese wrestlers.</p> <p>The most unique feature was the body part damage system. It displayed the damage to specific body parts (like head, arms, legs) as a <strong>percentage</strong>, and I believe it also had an <strong>X-ray display</strong>. When a move was performed, it would show the percentage of damage dealt to that specific body part.</p> <p>I&#39;ve searched for many games but haven&#39;t found a match. Do you happen to know which game this might be?
