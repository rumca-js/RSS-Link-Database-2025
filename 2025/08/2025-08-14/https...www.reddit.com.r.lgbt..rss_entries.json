And while I was crying at night, I realized I used my cat to hurt myself. I would purposefully make her mad so she can attack me. I guess I thought it was easier than a knife or a razor (also for clarification, I stopped this behavior and my cat is okay, she loves me still). But everything is bombarded at me at the same time, and I&#39;m only 15. I just wanna be who I want to be, I dont wanna be someone else. I miss when I was happy with who Iam, accepting myself as a lesbian (I still do, but the things I deal with is making it hard), loving myself and all, I dont wanna cry thinking why my family didnt accept me and gave me this trauma. Im doing a lot affirmations, its been 3 days since I started the affirmations, but I would be so happy if you support me and give advice, thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",

This doctrine is passed onto the states by the 14th amendment. All anti-LGBTQ laws are blatantly based upon religion. Many state Sodomy laws directly quoted the Bible, and bigots use the argument \u201cprotecting (the biblical version of) marriage\u201d to justify Same sex marriage bans. Even if there is also the free exercise clause: \u201cor prohibit the free exercise thereof\u201d, these laws not existing does not prohibit the exercise of one\u2019s religion. Bigots will also argue that the founding fathers wouldn\u2019t have interpreted it that way. Good lord, Thomas Jefferson wrote about \u201call men are created equal\u201d while holding slaves and overreached presidential power as president. I hardly think we can really use the founding fathers as our basis.
