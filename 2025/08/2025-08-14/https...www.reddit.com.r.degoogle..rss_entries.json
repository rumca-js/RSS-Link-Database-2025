I&#39;ve browsed various forums for unlocking the bootloader and uploading a custom OS on the said phone. I&#39;ve come to no success at finding an answer so this is my final cry for help. </p> <p>Is there a way i could run a custom OS on my phone? Meaning Lineage OS, Graphene OS (their site says it doesn&#39;t support this phone, I&#39;ll still ask tho) or any other de-googled mobile OS.</p> <p>If not, do you kind people have any tips on what I could do excluding buying another mobile phone?

So on desktop I can mitigate some of my Google dependence. Also switching to firefox with ublock and adblock installed... is it worth creating a firefox account just to install arkenfox&#39;s user.js?

Its abandonment is kinda shameful on Mozilla s&#39; part it had unique functionality, particularly the ability to search for text within a collection of screenshots. The app&#39;s demise leaves a gap for a dedicated, open-source tool that combines screenshot management with powerful text-from-image copying, a feature that could have served as a strong alternative to the text-from-picture functionality of other platforms like Gemini. While other OCR and scanning apps exist, I feel like ScreenshotGo was a unique and well integrated solution that will be missed by those who relied on its specific features. We can still download it in the usual places but i just wanted to bring it up as a great alternative to gemini for these features.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",
