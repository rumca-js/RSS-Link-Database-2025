For a band like <a href=\"https://supertramp.com/\"><em>Supertramp</em></a>, that could mean the breezy optimism of <em>Dreamer</em> or the razor-sharp wit of <em>The Logical Song</em>. I already knew and liked both great songs; they were part of the soundtrack of my life, but one day, sitting in my uncle\u2019s living room, with his huge wooden stereo console and an LP spinning lazily, I heard something different from them. <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/geekatune/p/fools-overture?r=4t98ga&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;showWelcomeOnShare=false\">Read more...</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dofthings\"> /u/dofthings </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1mq3omk/fools_overture_the_day_supertramp_blew_my_mind/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/com",

They were massive in Europe, including 18 UK Top 40 hits, and they were obviously big in their home country norway same in Ireland, Germany, france etc etc. So it&#39;s pretty much illogical to call them a one hit wonder especially when in the UK The Sun Always Shines On TV actually charted higher than Take On Me. Mostly its some Americans not knowing what they&#39;re talking about, but ive even seen British people say it which is again mind boggling</p> <p>Obviously take on me is their biggest hit and is the one that is most remembered today but it doesn&#39;t limit them to being a &quot;one-hit wonder&quot; Sun always shines on tv did quite well in America peaking at #20 on the hot 100 which is a decent hit for America. And again they were massive elsewhere. So I always ask myself -",
