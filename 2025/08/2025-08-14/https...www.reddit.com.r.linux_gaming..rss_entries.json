This becomes very noticeable on camera rotation.</p> <p>My setup: Asus Rog Strix laptop with Nvidia 2070 Fedora 42 Nvidia drivers: 575.64.05 Monitor 240hz</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried running with Lutris, with Steam, different wine versions, different proton versions..

But Minecraft, the game that should benefit the most, runs poorly.</p> <p>With Sodium, it goes from 30 fps to 400 fps on Linux, but on Windows I get around 900 fps with Sodium and 200 fps without. Using VulkanMod, which switches to Vulkan, I see ~1500 fps on Linux versus ~1000 fps on Windows.</p> <p>400 fps isn\u2019t bad, but with shaders it\u2019s still worse than Windows.
