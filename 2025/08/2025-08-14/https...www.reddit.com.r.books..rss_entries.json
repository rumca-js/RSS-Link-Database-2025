However, I was blown away by The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking) by Katie Mack and had to share it with someone. If you\u2019re in the mood for a good science book that balances being informative with being entertaining, this could be the book for you. This could also be the book for you if, like me, when you\u2019re feeling down you get some sick sort of enjoyment learning about how existence might end \ud83d\ude02. </p> <p>The outline of the book is simple: it briefly explores five different ways the universe could end. This is not some dull science book, though. The author does a great job of explaining the hard science when necessary, but in a very accessible and even fun way. In fact, the book is downright funny sometimes! Especially the footnotes. (If you\u2019re a fan of funny footnotes, please consider this book. I\u2019ve read comedy books that didn\u2019t use funny footnotes as well as this book do",

I have read classics before, by Jane Austen, Oscar Wilde, etc but this one felt so distantly ancient and out of touch that I just finished skimming through the book just to finish it. I felt like I need to be in London to read the book, know its ways and streets. The style seemed like it could only be understood by people who are used to that dialect. I could have understood each line if I put in effort to search every line/phrase/slang on the internet, but after some point I was exhausted.
