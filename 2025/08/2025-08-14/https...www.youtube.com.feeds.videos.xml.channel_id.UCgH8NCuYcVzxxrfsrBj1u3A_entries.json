        "description": "Bad Omens have released \"Specter\" - an 'epic' new single and video - so I thought I'd take a look. It was impressive, but I didn't understand. It also led me to speculate about how much could be achieved without all the architecture - so if you've made a music video and you want me to take a look, please send it to me. I'll be reviewing some of them.  The email link is in my home page. \n\n**For those triggered by long introductions, the review starts at 6'35, which might be a record**\n\nBad Omens, the full video: https://youtu.be/EUe9UhcUtEI?si=c-wJPokjNevUx3vi\n\nTo come and see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from The Man Behind JHRA,  join my Patreon: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & ",
