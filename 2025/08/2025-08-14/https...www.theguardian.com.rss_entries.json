United won 4-2; they were 4-0 up after 80 minutes before taking their foot off Arsenal\u2019s throat, and shinbone, and head. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019ve been concentrating too much on passing and technique,\u201d lamented Don Howe, Arsenal\u2019s head coach and assistant <em>to </em>the manager, Terry Neill. \u201cAgainst United we went out to strike the ball about instead of putting some meat into the game.\u201d In 1980s English football, there was no place for veganism. Things have changed since the days when ABH was a bookable offence, and only then after the first 10 minutes, but English football still has a pretty noxious meat footprint.</",

McCombs\u2019 career stretches back to the early 00s, and this unassuming 47-year-old has steadily walked the valley floor of US indie ever since, often overlooked compared to his hyped peers, but perhaps with a longer career for it.
