I was thinking some like...</p> <p>*.mydomain.tld (Anything External facing)</p> <p>*.int.mydomain.tld (any internal services ONLY)</p> <p>*.lan.mydomain.tld or *.device.mydomain.tld (clients, phones, PCs, etc inside my LAN). </p> <p>Is there a best practice to doing this? I currently am just planning on mapping the *.int and *.lan stuff to my local DNS so I don&#39;t need them to resolve externally. Do I need to even generate a wildcard cert for *.lan or *.device?

Does anyone know of anything like this?</p> <p>I&#39;m a video editor, and work with a lot of different clients, who all require their own specific fonts to be used. Using the built in Windows Font Manager at this scale is impossible, because I have to be able to keep fonts organised in different sets. It seems that every third party font manager is cloud based now, because of reasons. I&#39;ve been using Extensis Connect from Monotype for the last few years, but it&#39;s just becoming increasingly unusable.

I&#39;m running it in Docker on my Windows PC and using a Cloudflare Tunnel because I don&#39;t have a public IP. My setup works great in a web browser using Google for login. But the mobile app is a pain. First, the Google login gives an error: &quot;Access blocked.&quot; To get around this, I&#39;ve been using the one-time code option, but now that&#39;s broken too. Here&#39;s what happens: I go to log in, start typing my email for the code, and a few seconds later, Home Assistant says &quot;You&#39;re disconnected.&quot; When I hit &quot;Retry,&quot; it just sends me back to the Cloudflare login screen. I&#39;m stuck in a loop. Is there a way to bypass Cloudflare&#39;s login just for the mobile app? Any help would be awesome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VikaLover\"> /u/VikaLover </a> <br/> <span><a href",

I have looked into boutique providers like theserverhost, but they seem kinda expensive for the specs they offer.</p> <p>Are there any better options out there? (preferrably eu based) or is using something like hetzner and doing ip unblock and proper configs a better option?</p> <p>Please no comments about how selfhosting email is bad and not worth it, im trying to learn here, going to be following the ISPmail guides.</p> <p>It is kinda an experiment, but if found reliable enough will think about switching (although far in the future)</p> <p>Thank you very much for your replies, Have an awesome day Cheers ;)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jerkyjolt\"> /u/jerkyjolt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https:",

I&#39;ve recently made a lot of modifications on my homelab setup, and one of those was deploying technitium for local DOT and upstream DOH.</p> <p>I played with ansible and certificates a lot to have basically a full end to end encrypted communication (DNS, proxy_internal-apps communication, ldaps, anything). I know this isn&#39;t that useful in a home environment but whatever, everything is encrypted and cert renewal are automated with ansible (except apps that i expose, but there certbot do it&#39;s job with let&#39;s encrypt).</p> <p>Now comes the weird thing. I basically struggled setting up DOT between my machines and my local DNS (yeah, i had issues) and automated the deployment on all my container and VMs. My Steam Deck (running bazzite) wasn&#39;t part of this.</p> <p>I just powered it on for some checks before i go on a trip. Now what do i see ?</p> <p>***@megudeck:~$ resolvectl status</",
