        "description": "Four years after Bob Odenkirk surprisingly proved he could kill onscreen bad guys in a ruthless manner that would make 1980s-era Schwarzenegger and Stallone pause, the Better Call Saul star returns as Hutch Mansell in Nobody 2. While not quite as strong as the first film, this is ultimately an example of a sequel that offers the-same-but-different in a suitably satisfying and crowdpleasing way.\n\nSharon Stone as a scenery-chewing villain with Colin Hanks and a bad haircut in tow, add to the carnival like atmosphere of the action-comedy sequel that makes everything just a little goofier. With a new director behind the camera and some added visual flair, can Nobody 2 surprise us like the first one did?",
