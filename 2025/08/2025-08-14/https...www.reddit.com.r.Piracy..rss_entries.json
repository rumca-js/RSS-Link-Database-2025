I once had this old phone that kept deleting my downloaded episodes of shows, so I invested in a newer phone purely for podcasts. It seemed to work. Over the year I got about 100 GB of stuff, with well over 100 GB of storage left. Then suddenly while I&#39;m listening to Legends of Avantrius, it stops. I check and EVERYTHING has been deleted. This phone had no SD card, all internal. Only ever connected to WiFi to download new episodes, then shut off. I was halfway through the episode when it happened, offline.</p> <p>So now I am seeking either some Spotify version that doesn&#39;t have this weird glitch, or some site/app that can download Spotify episodes directly as a separate mp3 from Spotify. I have no idea how this stuff works, only that I hate the idea of EVERYTHING being gone in a single moment because the app decided it needed to clear space or something. Figured this place would be my best bet.</p> </di",

But, some points on the new laws (and source, in Greek, at the end): - The laws cover everything from songs &amp; software to ready-made devices for illegal streaming etc - Checks &amp; prosecutions can be made either after a legal complaint or ex officio. - The authorities involved and empowered are: Tax Authority, Economic Crime Unit, Market Control Unit, Police Force &amp; Customs. - The immediate payment of fines results in no prosecution but - When the \u201ccrime\u201d is great then the fine doubles and must be paid to not be prosecuted, but - the fine does not absolve you from copyright damages where you are prosecuted in civil court - Personal devices can be seized and audited temporarily</p> <h2>Source: <a href=\"https://www.lawspot.gr/node/280521\">https://www.lawspot.gr/node/280521</a></h2> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/West_Pos",
