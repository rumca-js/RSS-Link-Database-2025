Fortunately, these days you can get one with a built-in retractable cable, like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZWXBLJB/\">this Baseus EnerGeek that\u2019s now $62.99 on Amazon</a> (was $100).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you\u2019re constantly working on your laptop or it\u2019s been a few years and it just doesn\u2019t hold its charge as well as it used to, there\u2019s nothing worse than seeing that red \u201clow battery\u201d ping when you\u2019re far from home. This Baseus EnerGeek has a 20,000mAh capacity, enough to fully recharge your laptop and maybe have a little extra leftover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The built-in retractable USB-C cable supports up to 100W of charging, is compatible with",
