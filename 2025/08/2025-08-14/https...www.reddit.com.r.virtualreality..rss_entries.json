You can raise your hand to aim, peek left and right, and even open the door yourself. But there are obvious issues. The controls are kind of wonky, the gestures aren&#39;t very intuitive, and you have to keep adjusting to pull off some moves.

I want something that is either more comfortable to use for long periods and/or has better visuals. I already have 4 2.0 basestations and index controllers, so I&#39;m looking for a HMD upgrade that can use the lighthouses. Text clarity is a big bonus as the vive pro is borderline unreadable sometimes, and the mic doesn&#39;t have to be good as I can mount a modmic to the headset. Money is not really an issue, but the cheaper the better obviously..

I develop a lot of prototype Unity3D projects and have experience working with both the Meta SDK and OpenXR, though the latter not so much. One of the tools I typically use is the Meta Quest Pro, mostly because of its eye tracking capabilities.</p> <p>I&#39;m hoping to expand by adopting a PCVR setup, and the Bigscreen Beyond 2E caught my attention. The main reason for its appeal is its form factor and weight. However, cursory searches online haven&#39;t yielded any mention of Unity + OpenXR builds with the Beyond 2E. I&#39;ve always used the Meta Quest Pro + Meta SDK&#39;s setup for eye tracking prototypes, so I&#39;m kind of entering new territory for myself.</p> <p>Has anyone had any experience working with the Beyond 2E&#39;s eye tracking functions with Unity? Or generally have any recommendations for where to start for PCVR-based eye tracking?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/starminers",
