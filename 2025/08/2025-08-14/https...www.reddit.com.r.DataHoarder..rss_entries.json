This is what I have: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tecmojo-Mount-Enclosed-Network-Server/dp/B0D93WDMFB\">https://www.amazon.com/Tecmojo-Mount-Enclosed-Network-Server/dp/B0D93WDMFB</a></p> <p>Now the problem I&#39;m running into is that most storage server cases are more like 21&quot; or 22&quot; deep, designed for a much deeper rack. The obvious answer is to return the rack I bought and get something that is maybe potentially open air and can fit those larger form factors, however, I have no idea how I would pack the dang thing to return it now that it&#39;s all assembled. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been struggling to find a case that will fit, I did stumble across Sliger: <a href=\"https://www.sliger.com/products/rackmount/storage/cx37",

Starting around six months ago, it would download the wrong audio track for auto-dubbed videos making it useless for any auto-dubbed video. Auto-dubbing is becoming more popular by the day slowly rendering the WinX downloader useless.</p> <p>I contacted their customer support in early June and they said it&#39;s difficult to find the right audio track but they planned to fix it in the future.</p> <p>Well the future is today. They put out a major release that claim to have fixed three things including the audio track problem. The problem is that it still doesn&#39;t work.</p> <p>Can anyone recommend an alternative that has a decent following that is likely virus free etc.?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dsgregg\"> /u/dsgregg </a> <br/> <span><a href",
