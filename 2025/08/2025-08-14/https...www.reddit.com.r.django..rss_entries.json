The idea is, whenever I learn a new Django concept or backend in general, it always needs to be <strong>integrated</strong> with something else to work in real production level. For example, Django it self connects to DRF, DRF should include JWT or other type of auth system, Django again connects with Postgres or other type of DB, or if you want to make something different like a real-time communication app, you should be aware of different middlewares to perform auth, etc. This adding with the &#39;shiny object syndrome&#39; it ends up with frustration (especially at the beginning). I know Django makes this kind of stuff a lot easier compared to other frameworks. What was your approach for this kind of process in your learning and dev journey, should I skip these parts for later and only focus on one solid concept, or should proceed integrating things that I don&#39;t ",
