I think a lot of those criticisms are definitely valid, but I&#39;ve been so pleasantly surprised by how much fun I&#39;ve had exploring the interesting world they&#39;ve built up and discovering leads on my own accord.</p> <p>The visuals are nice, but more importantly being set entirely in northern England lets it have a really consistently unique atmosphere. There isn&#39;t a crazy amount of variety in the landscapes that you explore, but I think it all works because it has the uniqueness of an unapologetically British environment going for it---from the personalities of the people you encounter to the weird ass town names.</p> <p>And maybe ",

Skyrim won&#39;t count coz leveling skills/classes is the leveling up and have played it plenty already.</p> <p>Looking for more games in similar vein. Prefer non-soulslike as I recently finished Bloodborne and with skills fading with age need a break from soulslike.
