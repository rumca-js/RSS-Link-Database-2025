After I managed to destroy my Fedora KDE setup few times on my own fault, I thought it is a good time to change and give a fair try to another style of distro and DE. So after a little research and Debian 13 coming out I decided to try slower release distro with Gnome. After 5 days I am starting to get used to the way Gnome works and even though I liked how much I was able to customize KDE I can really appreciate the great job Gnome team has done with their DE. It is hard to decide on which I will stay after I have tested this or if I need some testing periods for other DEs too.
