Julia Chan shines in the part of Hedda\u2019s old school friend, Taya, who has left her controlling husband and is in the throes of a love affair with the alcoholic academic Jasper (Tom Austen, all earnestness here). He is Hedda\u2019s former lover who sparks her destructive jealousy, which leads to the play\u2019s explosive ending.</p><p>The setting is a cool, Scandi-style living room with long billowing curtains, beautifully designed by Anna Fleischle.
