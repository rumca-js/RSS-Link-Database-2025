The accuracy was uncanny.</p> <p>I\u2019m curious: what kind of reverse-engineering approach would you use to figure out how this thing works? Is it about neural nets, hashing, facial landmarks, or something more arcane like embedding vectors?</p> <p>Would be awesome to see how someone in this community would start unraveling it\u2014especially around real-world errors like aging, lighting shifts, or low-res inputs. Anyone tried poking at similar face matching tools?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Warm-Accountant5715\"> /u/Warm-Accountant5715 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http://Faceseek.com\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1mq45gq/what_might_faceseek_do_under_the_hood_to_match/\">[comments]</a></",
