When this didn&#39;t work, I with the help of Ai, broke it into different steps. It worked though but was of no use. Didn&#39;t know anything about accounting logic. I used Visual Studio Code with python with different extensions like cutom Ktinter, pyinstaller, matbolip(something like that for graph). </p> <p>So i came at this conclusion that either I am really bad at giving prompts or Ai is just over hyped.
