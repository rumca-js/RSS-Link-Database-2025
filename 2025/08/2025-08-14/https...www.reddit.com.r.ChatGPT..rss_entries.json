And I mean extremely.</p> <p>5 is just incapable of understanding my instructions which before it was perfectly capable of. My own custom GPTs who were pretty autonomous now need extreme hand holding and QC from me. Its not catching the dumbest shit like missing my prime directive, more hallucinations and missing things like an absent period, something a fucking local Llama can do.</p> <p>Not only that, the usage limit is suddenly infintesimal now. I used it for less than 2 hours for work and hit the cap. I had days where I used it for 5 hours and didnt hit anything. I built entire programs in one session over 4 hours with no issues. A shit load of back and forth. Today I only did 2 files and hit the cap, when I&#39;ve done",
