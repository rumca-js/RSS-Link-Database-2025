A surviving fragment smashed through the roof of a McDonough home, denting the wooden floor 14 feet below. Scientists at the University of Georgia analyzed about 23 grams of this ancient rock, determining it to be a 4.56-billion-year-old L-type ordinary chondrite \u2014 older than Earth by nearly 20 million years. Likely originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, it may have been dislodged by a colossal collision 470 million years ago. Dubbed the McDonough Meteorite, it offers rare clues to the early solar system\u2019s history and asteroid risks.",

These features, created by ancient crustal stretching, split the terrain into raised horsts and sunken grabens. Valley floors reveal smooth surfaces carved by slow-moving, ice-rich rock glaciers, forming rounded knobs and mesas. Scientists believe these structures date back 3.7 billion years, during Mars\u2019s most geologically active era. The presence of rock glaciers hints at ancient ice ages, suggesting the Red Planet once had climatic cycles capable of supporting frozen water flow over vast periods, reshaping its landscape.",
