A book I\u2019ve read and liked is The Lights of Prague by Nicole Jarvis, something similar to that maybe? Some of my favorite authors are RF Kuang, Robert Jackson Bennett, Rebecca Roanhorse, Sabaa Tahir, Brandon Sanderson, and Chloe Gong.

I have read quite a few lists but I can&#39;t make up my mind. I&#39;m looking for something with great world building and decent characters. If it&#39;s action focused even better. I will say that an overly complex writing style might not be for me. I have tried several times to read lord of the rings but the language just doesn&#39;t stick.
