Picking up &#39;setting&#39; or &#39;lore&#39; books, or straight up novels from these franchises is always a treat to see how well they&#39;re able to balance all the competing interests. The setting books in particular are the purest examples of world-building that I&#39;ve come across. And the effort it takes to keep these worlds consistent over dozens of hired writers is really something else.</p> <p>Arguably D&amp;D doesn&#39;t do this all that well with Forgotten Realms, even though it&#39;s incredibly popular because the iconic characters of the franchise are so popular and powerful that players in the universe just feel like sidekicks at best",
