Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help safeguard your data and keep intrusive trackers at bay. Plus, they allow you to get around region blocks on streaming services and avoid ISP throttling. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense might not be an option. That\u2019s where a free VPN can come in handy, providing you with much needed security for no cost at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I advise that you opt for a premium VPN, such as those in our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best VPNs</a>, I understand that sometimes ",

But the Chinese manufacturer has definitely gotten a boost from the new craze for PC-powered handhelds, and the new GPD Win 5 is its most ambitious design yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a 7-inch screen, a chassis that looks a PSP with gigantism, and AMD\u2019s top-of-the-line laptop/workstation Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip inside, it can turn heads all on its own.

My area is an internet dead zone where you might get a bit of 4G on a nearby hill, but that\u2019s about it. No cellular for phone calls, and the best I can hope from a landline connection is 3 Mbps. As a modern man with a modern family full of modern devices, I need fast internet\u2014so I readied Starlink even before my kids\u2019 beds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked pretty well, too. At first I heard a bunch of buzzing noises that I was <em>not</em> expecting, but that sort of coil whine is apparently pretty typical. A few minutes later, I was online!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Having Starlink isn\u2019t like having fiber internet, and I ran into several surprises along the way. Here are all the things I wish I\u2019d known before getting Starlink at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class",
