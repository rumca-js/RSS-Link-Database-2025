I love this movie. It&#39;s very of the time but what&#39;s really great is that there really isn&#39;t that usual trope of Jocks vs Nerds at Vince Lombardi High --- rather... you have Todd who IS a jock but not cool at all! You have Engelbauer who is very nerdy, but he&#39;s basically running the school. There is ONE &quot;nerd&quot; but someone needs to be the foil for all the students. It&#39;s really about kids versus adults (with the exception of Mr. McGree)... rather than ramble on about this.

Not just streaming it on discord but like a place where you are inviting a group over to hyperbeam with a link.<br/> I was looking on disboard and I found one server but thats about it. The others were fairly inactive or only had a handful of attendees. I&#39;m surprised such a place doesnt exist or is so hard to find tbh.</p> <p>Watching movies alone is nice but it&#39;d be nice to share what I like with others and see their reactions.
