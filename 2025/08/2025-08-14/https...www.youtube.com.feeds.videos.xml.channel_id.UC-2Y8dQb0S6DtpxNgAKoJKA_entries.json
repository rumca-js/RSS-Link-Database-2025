The game is set in a lovingly haunting visual aesthetic, reminiscent of Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas.\n\nThere\u2019s no gore or jump scares, just an enchanting, haunting atmosphere and a whimsical tale of forbidden companionship that will tug at your undead heartstrings.\n\n#ps5 #ps5games",
