And, honestly, I should have known better. This gem from Toukana Interactive is easily one of my favourite &ndash; and I might even go as far as to suggest <em>best</em> &ndash; strategic puzzlers from the last five years. It's also one of the most soothingly, hypnotically compelling, so as I prepare to alert you to its new arrival on Xbox and PlayStation, consider yourself warned.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-and-xbox-players-can-now-vanish-into-the-beautiful-bucolic-world-of-dorfromantik-one-of-the-best-puzzlers-of-the-last-few-years\">Read more</a></p>",

I think there's potentially a lot of strategy in this moment, a lot of gamesmanship. But Nintendo's latest multiplayer confection is new and quite nuanced and so the entire playerbase is currently getting to grips with it too. I am genuinely fascinated to see, in a week or so, how it's all playing out.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/an-afternoon-with-drag-x-drive-reveals-a-game-with-a-lovely-bloodthirsty-edge-and-a-disappointing-irony-to-accessibility-representation\">Read more</a></p>",

The artists and programmers at <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13\">Hangar 13</a> have crafted an evocative and unflinching rendering of Sicily at the turn of the twentieth century: dappled lemon groves; vineyards snaking down steep hills; mines filled with indentured slaves, every face and fruit bowl lit with the exquisite, high-drama flair of a Caravaggio painting. The scriptwriters and narrative designers have kept up their end of the bargain, producing an ebbing, flowing mob story which puts as much emphasis on quietness as cracking skulls. Place and pacing are symbiotic: it's through languorous car drives and trotting horse rides that we come to appreciate the setting. In almost every chapter, the volc",

Regardless, it's a milestone moment. AOL opened the doors of the internet for millions of people; its name was synonymous with it. And yes, I know that most of those people were Americans, the acronym AOL standing for America Online after all, but AOL did operate in the UK. I vividly remember having an AOL promo disk in a cardboard sleeve. I think it came attached to a newspaper - things like that happened back in the 90s. I remember trying to use it once, too, and being whisked away to an AOL-themed portal of bite-sized internet games and fledgling news services, and beautifully ugly 90s websites. The internet back then was a proper mood (<a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/h",
