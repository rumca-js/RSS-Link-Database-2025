These bacteria make important contributions to their hosts' nutrition, digestion, detoxification, reproduction and defense. Due to their close coexistence with insects, symbionts often lose genes for metabolic products that are also provided by their hosts over the course of their coevolution. One such example is the symbionts of reed beetles, which retain a very small genome containing only genes important for beetle development.",

However, there has been a noticeable decline in these overwintering populations over the last few decades. This decline has been thought to be at least partially caused by habitat loss, a decline in milkweed availability, and a parasite called Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE), which is known to increase monarch mortality by weakening migrants' ability to fly.",
