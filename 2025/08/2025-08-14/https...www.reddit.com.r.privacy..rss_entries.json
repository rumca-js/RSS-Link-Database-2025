The \u201copen early engagement\u201d for a potential \u201cBiometric Remote Enrolment Trial\u201d will <strong>explore the technologies available for capturing fingerprint biometrics and binding them to an individual\u2019s identity through a smartphone application</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Travel authorisation is obviously one application, but given the Online Safety Act that just landed I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see some project expansion.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/snakeoildriller\"> /u/snakeoildriller </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/987e8bf",
