Something which was started as a casual fun timepass turned into some serious exploration. </p> <p>I have a group of 4 close friends, we sit and chill in silent, peaceful places (like chai kaapi - Mhow) and have our own good spots like that all over Indore. Usually drinking tea, smoking ciggs and discussing ideologies, businesses, current events, random stuff and all. </p> <p>One day we were discussing about &quot;business board game&quot;. (If you&#39;ve played in childhood you know, that shit is crazy) In our next meet-up, i bought it randomly and we played and man it was fun and refreshing. Now we have 2 more card (monopoly deals &amp; cluedo) games and every week we buy/try something new &amp; intresting. </p> <p>Asking: if anyone has any board/card games suggestions please comment and if you&#39;re looking to sell like catan, scotland yard etc or know a good sh",

My fianc\u00e9e and I just launched Wizards of Wisteria, a cozy tile\u2011laying board game for 1\u20114 players where you compete to become the next Wizard of Wisteria. We love games that are fun and magical without pages of rules, so we designed this to be quick to learn and full of charm. There are two distinct game modes, magical allies to recruit, and a world full of surprises.</p> <p>Note, this Kickstarter is to help raise funds for the artwork and to order a sample of the game. Thank you.</p> <p>We\u2019d love your feedback and support!

My game group fell apart because multiple people were immune compromised so we wanted everyone safe. Anyways then I had a kid and had no time. But it seems that my group is ready to get things going again and we&#39;re all excited to maybe try a couple new games. We recently picked up slay the spire and spirit Island and they are honestly the only co ops I&#39;ve ever liked lol. Recently we&#39;ve played calico, cascadia, slay the spire, spirit Island and liked them all. We prefer games that are under or around an hour playtime for 3 to 4 people. (Slay the Spire has a save game function that&#39;s great for this) We loved quacks of quendlonburg too. What are some of the best games from the last 5 years we missed out on? Some of our favorite old games were Castles of mad king Ludwig, flip city, five tribes, archeology, and mystic vale. Hope this is more of a discussion of where the ",

An archaeology theme where you&#39;re literally digging tiles out of a box? Something that plays in 20 minutes? By designer Phil Walker-Harding? When I heard favourable comparisons being made with Jaipur, a long-time favourite in my household, I didn&#39;t need any more convincing.</p> <p>Another positive credential of this game is that it&#39;s part of the Gryphon Games Bookshelf series, which I&#39;ve long been a fan of. These games are billed as being easy to learn, fun to play, and yet offer more in the way of decisions than your typical luck-fest. In ot",

I thoroughly enjoyed this. You arrange 3 transparent cards in a certain order to achieve scoring goals. The top of the cards have picture elements that when finally assembled create a picture. Also in the middle are text boxes that add a narrative element to the picture. As cool as those things are they don&#39;t score anything, it&#39;s just artistic flavor. My wife started making pictures first then realized that she has to score also. Then she tried to score AND tell a picture story. It is a card game, so you have to deal with the draw. It&#39;s a very relaxing chill game. It&#39;s 1-5 players and I can see it being a tad more competitive with ",
