None of the system prompts talk about the internal architecture either. Sure it tells the system that it is GPT-5 or GPT-4o but none of the training data or system prompts could include internal architecture or any other information about the internal workings. Fundamentally the models are input output transformers so it&#39;s like asking a plus sign how it functions.</p> <p>It seems like all it would do is a) Hallucinate some crap b) Base it on whatever the top search results are, which won&#39;t ",
