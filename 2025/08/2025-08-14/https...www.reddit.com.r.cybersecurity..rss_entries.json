Am I able to use Okta for this purpose or do I need an external service to achieve it? Thanks in advance.</p> <",

Ideally, I would like to use an agent-based solution to search my system landscape for existing key material (symmetric such as AES and asymmetric &quot;classic&quot; certificates) and then inventory it accordingly, including lifecycle management (e.g., automated reminders of expiry dates, etc.). Perhaps someone here has already gained experience in this area and can give me a few pointers on possible manufacturers/tools. So far, I have come across Keyfactor, and at least the classic summary looks good at first glance.
