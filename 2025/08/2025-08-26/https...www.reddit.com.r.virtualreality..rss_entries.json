I bought two Ubisoft games, Watch Dogs Legion and Star Wars Outlaws. Watch Dogs Legion is the first Watch Dogs game I&#39;ve played and I like it very much. The frame rate is great, everything seems solid, the colors are good, the head tracking is nice, and so on. I like the environment and voice acting, the gameplay is pretty snappy. I&#39;m generally hot and cold about Ubisoft games, but this one seems like it may be worth investing some hours in.</p> <p>On the other hand, Star Wars Outlaws with the mod is a jittery mess where lighting seems to flicker a lot even though it shouldn&#39;t be, textures go from high res to low res and back, and sometimes disappear altogether.

I have a quest 2 so adjusting to a sweet spot I couldn\u2019t really care about. Now what I need to know is function over fashion. Which is more stable in operating function via software, which one tracks better or if they track the same and lastly which one take a better flogging. I also don\u2019t give a shit about a cable and honestly prefer it so i can keep it directly tethered to my rig, and I know both do it. Once the criteria of function stability, tracking and flogging have been met. Which will be the deciding factor.

I understood that this headset has very good FOV as well as picture quality. My main concern however is, can I run for example LMU with my PC and actually get any benefit from the high-end headset. I don\u2019t enjoy the idea of wasting money on features out of my reach, but i was also thinking of possibly upgrading to 5090 if the prices come a bit down at some point</p> <p>My PC has asus prime rtx 5070ti 16gt oc, ryzen 7 9800x3d and 32gb ddr5 6000mhz cl30. Am i overreaching getting the Pimax Crystal Super with this setup? </p> <p>Have never used vr before if that makes any difference.

Everything generally works wonderfully, but when I open a 3D video in VD, the hand controllers stop working. They&#39;re fine for navigating Windows normally, and working fine in other apps and games. But the moment I&#39;m in a 3D video, they stop. And that seems to be both a video from a browser, and from DeoVR. Any clues how to fix it anyone? I&#39;m sure there is a simple setting I have overlooked somewhere. It seems to have started after upgrading to Windows 11.

And most of the VR games titles on the market are indie games. We rarely see AAA titles like Alyx.</p> <p>I do sim racing and while quest 2 offers the immersion, it certainly does not do well in graphics. It&#39;s just too blurry. I&#39;d rather give up on the immserion part and go for ultimate clarity on my 4k 240hz oled monitor.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of getting a PCVR like one of those pimax product. But I&#39;m not sure if the Super really worth double the price of Light. I&#39;m not even sure if Light is worth double the price of Q3 too.</p> <p>I&#39;m a bit intersted in Q3 colored pass through, but I can&#39;t think of any use case.</p> <p>I love room-scale VR games but the current titles just aren&#39;t worth my time and effort.</p> <p>BUT, with a better headset, I might revisit those games I guess..? idk.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#",

The explore window, for example, crashes every time my controller touches it. I&#39;ve downloaded some free things and Virtual Desktop. All of it says that there will be no updates for apps after download. Meta stopped security updates last year. Sideloading is something I haven&#39;t done yet to be safe.</p> <p>Anyways, I&#39;m curious if anyone has advice on what to use it for.

As a fan of implementing UI elements into the physical game world to increase immersion, I want to create a system that would work for the slots and have an expandable menu or a separate menu that opens into a full inventory. The game has an industrial-revolution type feel to it, so there\u2019s gears and shafts and belts (basically just create mod) to fit with that aesthetic. Anyways, I would love help from anybody or come up with ideas for the inventory. I don\u2019t want something attached to the player\u2019s body for accessibility reasons, especially not a ui panel on their arm. I would prefer something that would be attached to the arm, and expand into a full hotbar, then you could expand that into a full inventory.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I saw this game talked about on youtube and wanted to play it but it&#39;s not on steam anymore, tried the meta quest link store and it wasn&#39;t there either, searched on google and found it was on the meta store website so I bought it. Game starts and then says &quot;connection interrupted&quot;, after doing some research it seems they added a DRM that needs to check with a server but then they abandoned the game so the DRM can&#39;t connect to anything and the game is unplayable.. on steam forums people said you could download an older version of the game before they added the DRM but that&#39;s only for people who bought it on steam before it got delisted.</p> <p>So anybody know a way to play this game ? Any community patch that makes it playable or something ? It looks so good.. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bWvLI4rbNhk?t=34\">https://youtu.be/bWvLI4rbNhk?t=34</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",
