        "description": "We test ane review Bambu Lab's newest 3D printer: the H2S single nozzle version of the H2D flagship. In many ways, this is the follow up to the X1C that we were expecting: a high-speed Core XY printer with a much larger build volume--even bigger than that of the dual nozzle H2D. What we didn't expect was the price!\n\nFind the Bambu Lab H2S here: https://www.matterhackers.com/store/c/3d-printers/bambu-lab-3d-printers?aff=7553\nDisclosure: This product was sent to us by the manufacturer for purposes of review and is not sponsored. \n\nShot by Josh Self and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nAbout Tested: https://www.tested.com/about\nMeet Adam in",
