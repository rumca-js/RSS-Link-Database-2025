Since I don\u2019t want to start another 3-6 book series and never finish these.</p> <p>Looking for something a bit more light hearted. Maybe even without any action and more focus on building a business, inventing, healing, teaching etc. An example would be \u2018Ascendance Of A Bookworm\u2019 manga.
