I can understand that\u2014the quality of the storytelling can be inconsistent in parts (especially in the third book). However, I still enjoyed it and would recommend reading it if you\u2019re the kind of person who likes Faulker\u2019s writing style. </p> <p>One of the things I liked most about this trilogy is the three-narrator format. It makes the story just a little bit disjointed and you have to do some work to piece it together. </p> <p>Also, over the course of three books, you feel like you REALLY get to know the narrators and the other people in their lives. I don\u2019t know about you all, but I came to pity Gavin. He got so trapped in Eula\u2019s gravitational pull that he couldn\u2019t even escape her daughter, let alone his memory of Eula.
