You\u2019d be surprised by how much extra space you can reclaim just by doing that! But with ultrawide monitors, that\u2019s easier said than done. Ultrawides are much larger, after all, and that means much heavier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter the Vivo Heavy Duty Ultrawide Monitor Tension Arm, specially designed to handle extra-large monitors up to 49 inches and up to 44 pounds. And right now, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F87G2YZD/\">it\u2019s on sale for just $64 on Amazon</a> (was $90) with a limited-time price drop plus an on-page coupon for an extra 20% off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This beast of a monitor arm can handle some of the largest monitors around, including the Samsung Odyssey G9, the Asus ROG Strix XG49VQ, the Innocn 49-inch ultrawide, and honestly",

Thanks to them, once ponderous boot times now border on instantaneous, programs and games are far more responsive, and the frustratingly long waits to load large files are largely a thing of a past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\u2026 if you\u2019re not yet using an SSD, what are you waiting for? If you already have an older SSD, you might consider upgrading it for the even headier performance offered by cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 designs. If your PC sports those technologies, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, a premium drive may not deliver any more real-world performance than a bargain drive. Mainstream software, including Windows has yet to implement the numerous performance tricks, such as multiple queues, that NVMe SSDs offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ppl_wrap\"><div class=\"top_",
