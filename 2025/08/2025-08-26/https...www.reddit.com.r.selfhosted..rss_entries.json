There are some great videos and guides out there, but they all result in the same issue. Internal server error when trying to access ERPNext again, logs tell me \u201cModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;hrms&#39;\u201d </p> <p>I\u2019ve learnt a lot but I can\u2019t get my head around custom apps. Is there a docker .yml file out there I can use that\u2019s already set up to include all the Frappe apps from the get go? I can currently get ERPNext working with no issues, but as soon as I try to add apps it gets broken. Any help would be appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sensible__\"> /u/sensible__ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n0atih/erpnext_yml_with_all_frappe_apps_included/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/c",

Specifically: could Authentik (or something similar) be used for basic physical access control?</p> <p>Example: opening my garage door with an NFC tag hooked up to an ESP32. The thought was\u2014since Authentik already decides whether a user can access something like my NAS, why couldn\u2019t it also authorize an NFC credential for something like a door or gate?</p> <p>Is the main blocker simply that Authentik wasn\u2019t built for this type of use case, or is there a practical reason it wouldn\u2019t work well? Curious if anyone here has tried to extend SSO tools into the physical world.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chkdsk_com\"> /u/chkdsk_com </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1n08quu/using_authentik_for_physical_a",
