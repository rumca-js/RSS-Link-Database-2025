        "description": "Gears of War: Reloaded is a nostalgic trip down memory lane for franchise veterans while offering newcomers a chance to be a part of the story that set off one of modern gaming's biggest franchises. The Coalition, Sumo Digital, and Disbelief have done well to bring the title to a new generation of players, modernizing it to make it as appealing as they can for players on new consoles. \n\nWhile we think it deserved more, this is a title that is sure to find many takers and generate a lot of excitement for the eventual release of Gears of War: E-Day. Reloaded is a lot of fun, and can keep its players entertained for a long time to come with multiplayer options that transcend the invisible boundaries of differing platforms, uniting a number of COG veterans against the Locusts in the process.",

        "description": "Konami certainly has a lot of options when it comes to future remakes of Metal Gear Solid titles. But each of those options comes with challenges that the studio will be hard pressed to navigate without Hideo Kojima guiding the effort. \n\nBut there are a few titles that could be logical choices that allow the franchise to make the most of current-gen hardware, adding value to both the narrative and gameplay of future releases from the studio. Solid Snake's relevance and popularity are sure to be factors in those plans, but can the character usher in a new era of glory for the franchise given the age of his past appearances?",
