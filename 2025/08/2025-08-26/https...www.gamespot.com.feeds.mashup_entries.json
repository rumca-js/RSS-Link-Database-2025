Fortunately, Fortnite is always introducing new ways of being absurd and over-the-top, and this week's update is proof of that, as it added two very silly new vehicles: the Roly-Poly bug, and Hammerhead Choppas.</p><p>The Roly-Polys are extremely easy to find since they're just lying on the ground all over the place. If you see bugs running around, then there are some Roly-Polys, too. There are enough of those for everybody, more or less.
