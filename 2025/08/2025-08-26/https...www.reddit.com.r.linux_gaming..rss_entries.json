The only issue is that I cannot get the game running. I have tried using the MSCLoader experimental Linux port on Steam which also makes the game run natively (to an extent) on Linux, though using this causes the game to crash without even opening. While using the Windows version of the game under proton crashes the game at the main menu. My display server is Wayland, though playing the game on Xorg has not solved this issue. </p> <p>Any help is appreciated greatly! I will be happy to reply with any necessary information/logs that could help diagnose the problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/draketr06\"> /u/draketr06 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1n10ewz/my_summer_car_crashes_at_startup/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><",

For example, RetroArch with the paraLLEl core runs like a dream on my RX 580 (something I had trouble with on Windows).</p> <p>However, the one thing I really miss is AMD&#39;s Virtual Super Resolution (VSR). I made a Gamescope script to use with the Heroic Games Launcher to downsample from 4K to 1080p. I can confirm it&#39;s working by checking the resolution in MangoHud, but the results aren&#39;t as great as they were on Windows. I can still see a lot of jagged edges in the same games that looked perfect when using VSR.</p> <p>Am I missing a specific Gamescope flag, or is there a better filter/scaler to use for downsampling to get a smoother, less aliased image?</p> <p>Here is the script I&#39;m using, which is launched from Heroic&#39;s &quot;Wrapper command&quot; field:</p> <p><code>#!/bin/bash</code> </p> <p><code># --- CONFIGURATION ---</code> </p> <p",

So I&#39;m playing Minecraft on Garuda Linux KDE lite with the Prominince 2 modpack Fabric and I run it with shaders, which is quite heavy, but I have Ryzen 7 5800x, RX 6900XT and 32 gigs of ram, I&#39;m using the prism launcher. My issue looks like this - My fps can be smooth 150-200 as it run okay on one session, but usually I play, it&#39;s not smooth and then fps drops to 30-80, until I get out of fullscreen, then it can happen again not in fullscreen. Same thing happens without shaders. I tried installing different javas like GraalVM, Adaptium and such with different versions (17,21) and it didn&#39;t help, I disabled the compositor but that also didn&#39;t help, I tried running the prism launcher with gamescope but that just breaks my game completely, I really don&#39;t know what to do about this. Did anyone have similar issues?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TadiXII\"> /u/TadiXII </a",
