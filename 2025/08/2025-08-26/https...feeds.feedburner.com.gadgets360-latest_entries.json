Congressman Miguel Luis Villafuerte came up with the idea for the bill, which says that the government must buy 10,000 BTC over five years and hold it for 20 years, only using it to pay off debt. It comes after the US launched its reserves, while the UK and South Korea turned it down, and India is still thinking about it.",
