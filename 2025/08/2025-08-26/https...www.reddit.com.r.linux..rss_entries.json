The problem is i CANT install the os in uefi, or with the /efi folder yk. The USB is flashed with rufus with GPT and UEFI (non CSM), i tried .iso, dd and both same result (except with .iso i only have Linpus Lite). I have a legion 5i pro, went into bios several times, secure boot off, cant find anything uefi related if not the boot order. Im 7 hours behind this, i dont know why i cant install it. I dont know if its the correct place to ask, but its a start i guess, and any help is truly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Xamelindo\"> /u/Xamelindo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1n0y3lp/cant_download_in_uefi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

How easy where they to fix? Here&#39;s some examples of a few issues I have come across:</p> <p>- OBS hotkeys don&#39;t work if the window is not active.
