What was once free web browsing had to become monetized with advertising so that web publishers and search engines could fund their infrastructure costs. Since the realm of computing and the internet is changing to a new format, LLMs, it&#39;s really inevitable that these LLMs must also monetize in a similar way</p> <p>Since the future is multi-model, and developers rely on AI model routers to build, I figured it must be necessary to bundle AI routing with ads monetization in a single API.
