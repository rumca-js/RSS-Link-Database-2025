At this point, I\u2019m out of ideas on what else to test or adjust.</p> <p>I created a multi-page interactive PDF report in InDesign that\u2019s meant to be viewed as spreads. I uploaded it to my WordPress media library, but when someone views it in Safari, it only shows half the spread (just the right-hand page).</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried different export settings in InDesign, I\u2019ve messed around with Safari\u2019s view settings, but nothing fixes it. What\u2019s strange is that my previous report (set up and exported the same way) displays spreads just fine in Safari.</p> <p>At this point, I don\u2019t know if this is an InDesign issue, a WordPress issue, or a Safari issue. Has anyone run into this before or know a workaround?</p> <p>EDIT: It works on ALL other browsers. Just not Safari. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Respect-1069\"> /u/Ok-Respect-1069 </a> <br/> <span><a",
