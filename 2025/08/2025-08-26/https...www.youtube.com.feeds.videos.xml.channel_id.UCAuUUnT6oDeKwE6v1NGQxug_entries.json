        "description": "Clean energy visionary Lei Zhang loves the Gobi Desert \u2014 the most Mars-like place on Earth. Why? Because of the promise it holds to provide the free, abundant solar and wind energy to fuel humanity\u2019s next leap forward. Sharing the story behind one of the world\u2019s largest green hydrogen projects, Zhang shows how Earth\u2019s harshest landscapes could unlock more energy reserves than the world consumes today, and encourages us all to get a little more creative in how we think about the future.
