What we know on day 1,280  </p><p>The illegally appointed head of the partly Russian-held Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine has said a <strong>water crisis that is forcing people to queue at tanker trucks</strong> can only be fixed if Russia takes full control of the region and a vital canal. Built in the 1950s, the 83-mile (135km) canal, which connects two rivers, starts about 12 miles north-east of Sloviansk, which is held by Ukrainian forces, and finishes near Donetsk city in an area controlled by Russian forces.</p><p>Denis Pushilin, the Russian official imposed by Vladimir Putin as head of the region, accused Ukraine of \u201ca water blockade\u201d but Ukrainian officials say <strong>parts of the canal have been damaged in the war</strong> and other parts are located in frontline areas. Residents have embarrassed Pushilin and put pressure on the Donetsk oc",

We must address maternal burnout \u2013 not simply medicate our way through it</p><p>I haven\u2019t slept for seven-and-a-half years \u2013 at least, it feels that way. The TV, rotating between Bluey, The Wiggles and K-pop Demon Hunters (when the toddler is napping), has been on for days as we battle yet another winter lurgy that drains me yet barely touches the surface of my two daughters, who vomit on the carpet one minute then ask for ice-cream the next. My seven-year-old makes cameo appearances at school, only to catch the next illness and bring it home to the family, our toddler demonstrating what a fine job she\u2019s doing at developing her immune system with fevers, snot, vomit and a bout of conjunctivitis that never seems to end. The house is covered in crumbs and yoghurt splodges, there are no clean clothes and the gastro I got on my birthday set off my chronic illness into the worst flare since being diagnosed in 2021.</p><p>I am running on",
