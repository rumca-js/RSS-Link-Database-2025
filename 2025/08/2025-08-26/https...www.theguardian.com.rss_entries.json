Often mistaken for part of the plant, the scales look like tiny brown discs attached to stems and leaf joints. They feed by sucking sap, weakening your plant over time. The sticky substance you see is honeydew, their waste product, which can attract mould or ants if left untreated. These pests are slow-moving but persistent, and it\u2019s not uncommon for infestations to spread quietly between plants, as you\u2019ve noticed with your collection.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifea",
