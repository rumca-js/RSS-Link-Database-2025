Those HDR images can be instantly reviewed on the new 3.6-inch OLED touchscreen at up to 1,400 nits of peak brightness, which Hasselblad says is 75 percent brighter than the original X2D 100C. Other notable upgrades include using LiDAR to assist with autofocus, a 10-stop in-body stabilization system, an additional customizable button, and a new joystick for controlling camera functions instead of using touchscreen commands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-",
