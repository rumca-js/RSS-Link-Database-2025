Very appealing for sure, and it made me think it&#39;s the new &quot;norm&quot; today, I haven&#39;t used one in like 6 years.</p> <p>But I still find providers with 1Gbps plans, people seem to keep using them AND they&#39;re all cheaper. So it&#39;s not a &quot;minimum&quot;, at least not for every provider.</p> <p>So what do YOU think is or should be the norm? And for ratio building, is 1Gbps already &quot;too slow&quot; these days or is it still fine? Do you actually feel the advantage of 10Gbps instead of just going with the cheapest plan possible? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

Here&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand: I add the desired file, I throw on a few public trackers as I private torrent, I send her the magnet link, and she can only see the metadata of the file. No file transfer occurs... I can see her IP as a peer, but nothing happens. Port forwarding&#39;s been done, firewall rules written, I&#39;m just not sure how to do this, let alone Web Torrent.
