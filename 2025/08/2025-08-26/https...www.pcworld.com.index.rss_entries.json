The first model it offered is still popular for exactly that reason, and today you can get that ultrawide OLED gaming monitor at a deep discount. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BP94J8VD/\">$549.99 right now on Amazon</a> (half its launch price of $1,099.99).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Alienware AW3423DWF is a 34-inch ultrawide curved design, using the semi-standard 3440\u00d71440 resolution. That means this is basically a 27-inch monitor stretched out to the cinematic 21:9 aspect ratio. On top of that gorgeous OLED panel with its near-perfect contrast, it\u2019s packing a 165Hz refresh rate. While that isn\u2019t as fast as some more recent OLED gaming monitors, it should be enough to make your desktop PC sweat with newer 3D games ",

Or waited way too long for results? You\u2019re not alone. Many users find Windows Search frustrating and it really boils down to its default settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, Windows only indexes certain locations like the desktop and the Documents, Pictures, and Music libraries under \u201cMy Documents.\u201d If you organize your files differently, you might be left waiting or not finding anything at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another quirk of Windows is that search results can vary depending on where you start the search. Whether you\u2019re using the Start menu, File Explorer, or the taskbar, each one can produce different results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this guide, we\u2019ll show you how to adjust Windows\u2019 built-in search settings so you can quickly find what you\u2019re actually looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"how-to-perfec",
