It would be basically like instead of trying to remove the needle from the haystack it would be constantly adding more and more hay until finding the needle isn&#39;t worthwhile in the slightest. Has anyone tried this? Has ideas of how this could be created? Is my explanation logical or not? I believe by creating false information and at the same time limiting our own we could circumvent parts of the entire internet privacy system collapsing on itself.

So I fell into the rabbit hole last night, and, to be frank, it&#39;s a <em>lot</em> to parse through. At least, for me.
