It&#39;s inspired by FastAPI, has great support for OpenAPI, and integrates nicely with Django.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/pmdevita/django-shinobi\">Django Shinobi</a> is a fork of Django Ninja, meant to be focused on community-desired features and bug fixes. I originally forked it and announced it <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1ion5cz/announcing_django_shinobi_a_fork_of_django_ninja/\">here 6 months ago</a>. It&#39;s taken quite a while to get everything into a state I feel confident in, but I&#39;m happy to finally announce its first proper release! This release is based on Django Ninja 1.4.3 and includes additional features and bug fixes. </p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/pmdevita/django-shinobi/releases/tag/v1.4.0\">https://github.com/pmdevita/django-shinobi/releases",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am currently developing a web application with React and Django REST framework. I knew that django-allauth was a good package so I went with it for authentication. I saw that there is headless mode specifically for REST and started implementing. I had to decide what kind of authentication to use. I went with the default(sessions). I am currently super confused because almost every tutorial uses JWT with CORS. From the Allauth react example I can see that react and Django are served through a proxy and this way sessions should be handled by Django using cookies securely. But at the same time there is an implementation of sending CSRF and X-Session-Token in every request. I don&#39;t get the X-Session-Token. Shouldn&#39;t this be handled by Django.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DanielB1748\"> /u/DanielB1748 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1n0mgce/confused_about_",
