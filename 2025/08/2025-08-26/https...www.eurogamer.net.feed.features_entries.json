I'm well aware that some regard it as a GameCube classic, but I'm not one of them. When a sequel, Kirby Air Riders, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced\">closed out the big Switch 2 blow-out Nintendo Direct</a>, my reaction was rather apathetic. A sequel to <em>that</em> is their grand finale?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-is-a-blazing-assault-on-the-senses-where-once-you-lock-in-the-magic-cuts-through-hands-on\">Read more</a></p>",

Despite the changes to the video game landscape in recent years, that sentence still makes me react similarly to how I would if someone said \"you can now drink coffee with a fork\". My brain's immediate reaction is to dismiss it as nonsense. It's not. We've seen plenty of Xbox games on PlayStation already, but there are some games that bleed <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox\">Xbox</a>. Gears of War is one of them.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-take-the-gears-out-of-the-xbox-but-you-cant-take-the-xbox-out-of-the-gears\">Read more</a></p>",
