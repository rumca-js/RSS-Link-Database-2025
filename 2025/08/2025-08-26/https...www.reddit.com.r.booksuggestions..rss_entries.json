Does anyone know of any books that have a similar theme to John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost? As in, the Garden of Eden, morality, etc. \u2014 stuff like that. I\u2019m really interested in theology and specifically Genesis, in a \u201creading the Bible as literature\u201d type way. So if there happens to be a book someone is able to recommend to someone interested in this topic, that\u2019d be awesome! I\u2019m specifically looking for a novel \u2014 not a drama or poetry or something of the sort :) I\u2019d also gladly take recommendations on non-fiction books about things like the morality of religion, if someone happens to have any.

I was immediately hooked. The prose was fluent to read, at time thick, but overall great. I loved all the metaphors. It had the right amount of fantasy, romance and politics for me. Some situations felt too forced just so the story could proceed, but since then i tried 15 books and couldn&#39;t find anything even remotely similar.</p> <p>I read in english, though its not my first language.

A vibe fun for the reader, but is extremely inconvenient for the character. It doesn\u2019t have to be like that exactly that scenario, I don\u2019t mind fantasy, or most other genres.

I would like some sex scenes, but I want some plot too, something that is compelling and really interests you beyond just the main relationship.

Even when I picked up something that I thought would be interesting, it turned into torture. My attention span is wrecked, I feel lazy all the time, and I know a big part of it comes from rotting my brain on social media.</p> <p>The weird thing is\u2026 I want to change that. Starting today. I know it\u2019s going to be hard to rewire my brain, but I don\u2019t want to be that guy who can\u2019t focus on anything deeper than a 10-second clip.</p> <p>So I wanted to ask: Why should I start reading? Not in the obvious \u201cbooks are good\u201d way, but in a real way \u2014 personal experiences, life changes, interesting facts about what reading does to you, things that might actually motivate me to start and keep going. </p> <p>Also, you can convice me to read a particular book. So don\u2019t forget to drop your favorites.</p> <p>Much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
