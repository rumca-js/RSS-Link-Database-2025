        "description": "When The Roots drummer and film director Ahmir Thompson, better known as Questlove, began shooting his documentary on pop star Sly Stone, he sensed something more than making a movie was taking place. \u201cAs I\u2019m dissecting Sly\u2019s life story and success, I also started my own parallel journey,\u201d he tells Amplify host Lara Downes. And that journey was not always easy, even after winning an Academy Award. \u201cMaybe seven or eight months later, I was actually praying for it to all stop,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause there\u2019s a level of guilt you feel every time you get an accolade.\u201d Lara and Questlove discuss the pitfalls of fame and how documenting America\u2019s music tells us a lot about our history.\n\nHost: Lara Downes\nProducers: Nickolai Hammar/NPR, Tom Huizenga/NPR",

        "description": "Suraya Mohamed | August 26, 2025\nThe inflatable flowers scattered across Anderson Park on the campus of the Aspen Ideas Festival were part of a zero waste initiative. Created by the Australian artist Cj Hendry, Bloom is a cross-section of Hendry\u2019s ongoing exploration of botanicals and inflatables. Whimsical and naturally beautiful, this landscape is the perfect compliment to the brilliant Afro-Cuban singer Daym\u00e9 Arocena. A dynamic performer con carisma y fuerza, her ebullient personality and performance shines brightly even under the hot Aspen sun.\n\nEmbellished by vocalists Ayme Canto and Hilaria Cacao, who takes a tenacious trombone solo in the first tune, their ensemble is exquisite despite. Arocena then performs three powerful solo arrangements, including two passionate blues compositions: \u201cMean,\u201d written when she was just 15 years old, followed by \u201cCoda\u201d written earlier this year. \n\nSET LIST \n\u201cAmerican Boy\u201d\n\u201cAmor de Invierno\u201d\n\u201cMean\u201d\n\u201cCoda\u201d\n\nMUSICIANS \nDaym\u00e9 Arocena: vocals, keys\nA",
