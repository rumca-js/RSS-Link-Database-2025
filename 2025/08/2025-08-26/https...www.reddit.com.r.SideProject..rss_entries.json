I just wanted to solve a personal pain I\u2019ve experienced with my own meal prepping and grocery shopping habits and wondered if others might be experiencing it as well. Anyway, here\u2019s a basic rundown of what the app does currently:</p> <ul> <li>You can add multiple URLs in one go for people who like to meal prep.</li> <li>You can change the serving size and it will automatically adjust the quantity of the grocery list items to match </li> <li>Similar items from different recipes are grouped together for a more simple viewing experience</li> <li>Recipes are automatically saved for easier referencing in the future </li> <li>Grocery lists can be copied if you have a more general shopping list </li> </ul> <p>Hoping to get some feedback!
