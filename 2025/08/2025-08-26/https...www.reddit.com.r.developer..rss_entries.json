Hackathons push you out of your comfort zone, force you to solve real problems under time pressure, and give you hands-on experience that no tutorial or course can fully replicate.</p> <p>Working in a team during a hackathon also teaches collaboration, version control, and problem-solving in ways that solo projects can\u2019t. Even if your project isn\u2019t perfect or doesn\u2019t win, the experience, portfolio piece, and connections you gain are invaluable.</p> <p>For anyone looking to level up fast, I\u2019d say: pick a hackathon, build something, fail, iterate, and learn. That\u2019s how you grow from beginner to developer in a practical, meaningful way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SmartContractKid\"> /u/SmartContractKid </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1n0oj1q/the_best_way_to_become_a_develope",
