I fired up BigBox and did a little browsing. Clicked on the NES and there it was still on Mike Tyson\u2019s Punch-Out!! from last time. I thought okay I\u2019ll just play this a while and then try out something else. I sink a couple of hours into it (again). </p> <p>My plan was to try out Evolution 2 on Dreamcast because I loved Evolution 1 and I\u2019ve been meaning to play 2. Instead I fire up 1 (again) because I kinda miss it.</p> <p>My point is that every time I get some time to play some games I rarely branch out. ActRaiser, Super Castlevania IV, Punch-Out!!, Streets of Rage 1&amp;2, Truxton, a few minutes of Sonic. I\u2019ve got more games than I could finish in a lifetime but I keep going back to the same old titles. </p> <p>Is this normal behavior?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Str",
