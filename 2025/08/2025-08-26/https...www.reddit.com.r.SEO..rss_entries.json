I learned a lot from it, but it&#39;s only theoretical knowledge. I&#39;m very interested in SEO and I would like to develop my skills in it, but unfortunately my resume isn&#39;t getting any responses. So I decided to gain some practical experience on my own, and I&#39;d like to ask you for some advice. </p> <p>What is the best way to gain such experience on my own? I don&#39;t want to take on clients as a freelancer without experience. I would like to create my own project that will be able to generate some income.</p> <p>I was thinking about a blog - it seems like the simplest option, but can it be monetized?</p> <p>I was thinking most about an online store. Can you recommend any niches, perhaps from your country, that don&#39;t have as much competition as, for example, insurance, and would be good for practice at the beginning? I was thinking about a birthday gift store ",
