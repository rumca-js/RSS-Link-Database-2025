For me, I buy based on whether I think my crowd would like, whether the theme is cool, the art &quot;feel&quot; (yeah, I know), and whether the gameplay seems up my alley. Also based on the reviews, I pay attention to the build quality.</p> <p>Whether it stays in rotation seems to be different, though. Gameplay is first of course. I love love love well-thought-out organization of the parts, especially when I don&#39;t need to buy or print an organizer to get stuff to put away just right. I also love quality construction, like cards and tokens that feel good, boards that are not just a cardboard paste-up job, etc.</p> <p>The rulebook is important at first, or if teaching to others, or if complex and need clarification I guess.</p> <p>How weird am I?

I never made a playthrough video. I\u2019ve playtested the game a ton with friends and family, but I don\u2019t have a video that actually shows how it feels to play, turn by turn.</p> <p>What makes a playthrough video <em>watchable and useful</em> for you? Do you prefer a highly polished, edited video or just a straightforward overhead camera with commentary? Should it focus more on teaching rules, or on showing the flow and fun of a match? Are shorter highlight reels better than one fulllength playthrough, or is it worth doing both?</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts. My goal is to make the game as easy to understand and inviting as possible for a youtube video.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any wisdom you can share!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",

Conspiracy lost very badly and we were unsure if we played any of the rules wrong. 1. Are we allowed to say what number contributions we can make towards disarming traps? Or can this be too obvious/incriminating for exposing who makes negative contributions? Should we be just staying to general statements? 2. When giving in supply cards towards disarming a trap, how much of this should be hidden and how much should be known information? Should the amount of cards each person contributes be known among the table?</p> <p>Also open to any tips for the game that will makes thing more balanced.
