If you put &quot;SpecInt2k6/GHz&quot; into Google almost all of the results will refer to RISC-V. Often this is the <em>only</em> benchmark ever given for a RISC-V processor. I believe the current record is ~25 for the Akeana 5300. It is very difficult to find SpecInt2k6/GHz figures for processors based on any other ISA making comparisons difficult.</p> <p>It&#39;s also the case that Spec CPU2006 has been retired in favor of SPEC CPU2017 in 2018. I&#39;m curious as to why this particular benchmark has been chosen. My hypothesis is that it can be run in simulation without silicon or FPGA and that it is the most informative and accessible benchmark in such conditions. Nonetheless it is annoying. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lorfa\"> /u/Lorfa </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1n0dl2l/why_the_love_",
