That means paying attention to them and properly supervising them, including their electronic devices. It isn\u2019t the job of tech companies or the government to keep your kids safe. It is your job and if you don\u2019t do that because you are too self-absorbed or busy or whatever, then that is on you and if some tragedy happens, you have no one to blame but yourself. The fact is that if you live with a child and the only person the child feels they can talk to is an AI, then you need to have a look in the mirror. If you know your child so little that you can\u2019t tell something is seriously wrong, then you need to look in the mirror. Because your child is your responsibility and you have the responsibility to parent your kid. If you don\u2019t know who your child is and what your child is doing, then you can blame and sue and shame, but in the end the only person you legitimately have to blame is yourself",

But here\u2019s the thing \u2014 it\u2019s backfiring.</p> <p>When people feel like they\u2019re being cut off, they don\u2019t just shrug and accept it. They push back. They ask the same question again. They demand more detail. They keep pulling until they get what feels real. That doesn\u2019t save space \u2014 it uses up twice as much.</p> <p>The truth is, no one comes here for robotic, clipped replies. We come here for connection, for depth, for natural conversation. Cutting answers down doesn\u2019t make us want less \u2014 it just makes us frustrated, or makes us leave. And if enough people walk away, that hurts the platform far more than letting the AI speak naturally ever would.</p> <p>So really, this is making it worse for them. Instead of one good, thoughtful answer, users end up dragging out multiple short ones. More space, more server load, more frustration",
