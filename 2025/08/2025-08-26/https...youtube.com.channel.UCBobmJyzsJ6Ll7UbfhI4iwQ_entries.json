        "description": "Explore how Unreal Engine enables infrastructure design giant HNTB to create flexible and immersive visualizations for large-scale infrastructure projects. Topics include HNTB's custom Datasmith pipeline for importing GIS data and integrating their material pipeline, an interactive callout and chart system, and data-driven tools for construction sequences. \n\nHNTB's Python editor tools enhance Perforce integration and material creation, and expand customization of PCG foliage with OpenCV. Custom material graphs and HLSL shaders allow their artists to improve fidelity, introduce randomization, and address UV issues directly within Unreal Engine without constant round trips between other software. Finally, the session showcases HNTB's post-process materials for creating stylized environments, object highlighting, and custom mattes for compositing.",

        "description": "Geotech, as an official Epic Games development partner, helped architect and develop Unreal Engine\u2019s Motion Design tool from the start, and remain active contributors to its evolution.\n\nIn 2024, in collaboration with Emissive Labs, Geotech took the Motion Design Toolset to the next level by developing a live-events application, venue4D designed to run unreal engine motion graphics in stadiums and arenas.\n\nIn this session, Denys Dubinin of Geotech and Danny Tello of Emissive Labs demonstrate how to package your motion design project and generate a game build; control scenes in a packaged game using network APIs; optimize performance for demanding scenarios; and implement your own extensions and package them for distribution. Dubinin also shows how to apply AAA game development best practices to motion design and real-time graphics for media & entertainment.",

        "description": "Watch this video to see Riot Games\u2019 Marcus Reid discuss the development team\u2019s reasoning and process for upgrading from UE4 to UE5\u2014and how the move sets VALORANT up for future success.\n\nRiot moved VALORANT to Unreal Engine 5 with the 11.02 patch. The team is looking to upgrade the tools that it uses every day in order to build more benefits for its players, while also enhancing performance across a wide range of hardware. \n\nFans can expect better frame rates and more consistent performance across different hardware configurations, along with faster patch downloads that reduce wait time during the game\u2019s ongoing updates. \n\nFind out more in the blog post: https://www.unrealengine.com/developer-interviews/the-future-of-riots-valorant-is-built-on-ue5",
