        "description": "The UK political party Reform UK has set out a five-year plan to detain and deport all migrants who arrive in the UK without permission and suggested 600,000 people could be sent back over five years.\n\nUnder the plan, named Operation Restoring Justice, Reform UK would bar anyone who comes to the UK on small boats from claiming asylum, and strike deals with countries to return those people. The proposals could face legal challenges and political opposition, with Labour branding it unworkable and the Conservatives accusing Reform UK of recycling their ideas.\n\nAdam is joined by Tom Symonds, BBC News correspondent and Dr Alice Donald, Associate Professor of Human Rights Law, Middlesex University.\n\nWe also heard Adam\u2019s interview with the Deputy Leader of Reform Richard Tice on 5 Live.\n\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.
