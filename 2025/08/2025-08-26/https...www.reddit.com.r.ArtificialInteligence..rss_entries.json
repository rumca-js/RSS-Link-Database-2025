        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Firstly this is just an opinion. I am so tired of some people simply dismissing anything that is &quot;Ai&quot;. Ai actually made the human condition much more clearer. At first when GPT 4o was around so many people complained because it was being &quot;too friendly&quot;. They made GPT 5 less friendly and everyone bashes it simply because they were so attached to the friendly GPT 4o. Now I also see these 1986 Ai videos from TikTok where someone from that era tells us to come back to that time. The truth is, people were full of complains even back then. This is just for the views. Also these videos won&#39;t be possible without Ai lol. The tech we have now is what those in 1986 dreamed of. So the biggest fear is not Ai. It is Ai in the hands of shitty people!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DPJesus69\"> /u/DPJesus69 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/",

This seems doable to me if there\u2019s political will. And if there\u2019s no political will, then we simply vote for a candidate that is pro-truth.

The reason there\u2019s so much misinformation and deception around on socials today is because no scrubbing is required. My cat, here in Zimbabwe, could pull it off with no repercussions whatsoever.
