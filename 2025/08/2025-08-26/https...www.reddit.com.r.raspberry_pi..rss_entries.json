One I run home assistant and the other I use for some node apps and a mongodb instance.</p> <p>My main concern is the lifespan of the cards for read/writing. Not concerned about the HA instance as that\u2019s I assume is minimal although I haven\u2019t really looked into it but the node instance would have a fair bit or reading and writing. I\u2019m thinking I could flash my WD passport and run the node instance from there or maybe boot from the card and use the external for the db where that\u2019s where most of the writing is happening. </p> <p>Thoughts or experiences to share?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Subject_Night2422\"> /u/Subject_Night2422 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1n0yjgr/sd_cards_or_external_hdd/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1n0yjgr/sd_car",
