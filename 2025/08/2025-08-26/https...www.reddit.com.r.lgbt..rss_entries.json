The only thing that\u2019s really bothering me is the lack of intimacy.</p> <p>She doesn\u2019t kiss or hug me unless I initiate it. She rarely initiates sex either \u2014 it\u2019s always on me to make the first move. Even when I try to kiss her in casual moments (like when we\u2019re in the car), she\u2019ll usually say \u201clater.\u201d She\u2019s told me she would work on it, but it hasn\u2019t really changed.</p> <p>It makes me feel like the sexual chemistry just isn\u2019t there. I feel kind of guilty making a post about sex because there\u2019s so much more to a relationship, but for me intimacy is part of what I want in addition to everything else she offers.</p> <p>For context: I\u2019m a lesbian.</p> <p>So my question is: what would y\u2019all do in my shoes?
