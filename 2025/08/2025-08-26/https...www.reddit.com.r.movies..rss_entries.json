The bit where he hits the &#39;sky&#39;, finds the door, and Christof is talking to him... it&#39;s just perfect filmmaking. The whole concept of the movie is incredible and feels more relevant now than it did back then.</p> <p>But it&#39;s that final moment that always hits me. He doesn&#39;t have a big angry speech. He just smiles and says &quot;In case I don&#39;t see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!&quot; and then takes a bow and leaves.</p> <p>There&#39;s just something so hopeful and terrifying and brilliant about it. It\u2019s one of those scenes that\u2019s just permanently burned into my brain.</p> <p>What are some other movie endings or single scenes that have that effect on you? The kind that you think about for days after you watch it.</p> </div><!-",
