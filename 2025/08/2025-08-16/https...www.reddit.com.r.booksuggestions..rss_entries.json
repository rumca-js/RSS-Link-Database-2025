Does anyone have similar recommendations?

Select competitive exams demand exceptional reading comprehension and vocabulary to crack them (for me, it&#39;s CLAT) and it has been pretty frustrating and awfully boring for me to even take a moment to read those novels, predominantly due to the fact that I don&#39;t get half the content written in them - I&#39;ve got to re-read and that just sucks away the enjoyment of reading altogether.</p> <p>How should I begin with reading - should I jump onto classical novels and force myself into reading them, or should I begin from somewhere else?</p> <p>And how",

So when it comes down to fiction book with that tone would be great for me. Honestly, the more weird the better type deal. I am also pretty interested in Japanese culture as well, and I have heard Japanese fiction is pretty fun.</p> <p>For any non-fiction I would definitely like to learn more about the justice system, specifically any history of gangs which is pretty interesting to me. This could also relate a bit to fiction as well. I am big into learning about the mind and body as well, along with anything to do with personal growth which is always nice to learn about.</p> <p>I hope this helps!

Picking up hitchhikers, working odd jobs, customizing and repairing your car, and mapping your route across the country. It has a very grunge vibe and an amazing soundtrack of real rock/indie/punk songs that you can collect. I am looking for a book that exudes this energy. Whether its an actual road trip book or just an independent punk coming of age story, I don&#39;t care. I like unexpected friendships, punk politics, Slice of Life genre, Historical fiction (even if its just set a few years back), MLM romance.

I\u2019m hoping someone can help me here. She described it as a couple who couldn\u2019t get pregnant, so had IVF therapy and had a child but found out the dad was not the father.
