The mission carried Metop-SGA1, an 8,900-pound next-generation polar-orbiting weather satellite operated by EUMETSAT. Placed into an 800 km polar orbit 64 minutes after liftoff, Metop-SGA1 will deliver high-resolution global observations of temperature, precipitation, clouds, winds, sea ice, aerosols, and pollution. Built by ArianeGroup for the European Space Agency, Ariane 6 is Europe\u2019s successor to the Ariane 5.
