Linux Format was my favorite and while I didn&#39;t subscribe I bought a few each year if they had articles I wanted or contents on the included disc. So it was a bad feeling when my local magazine place didn&#39;t have a copy lately. So I looked at the LF website to see that they are folding their tent. I just want to say my thanks to some good people I don&#39;t know and I will certainly miss the magazine.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lost4name\"> /u/Lost4name </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ms64yx/linux_format_gone/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ms64yx/linux_format_gone/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Been reading up Linux for a long time and it looks very appealing. The only thing I&#39;m intimidated by is how huge of a learning curve it is. Microsoft is ofc like many big companies often get into controversy and not learn from mistakes. Not to mention how limited the closed source nature of it being limited. I love the user friendly aspect of Microsoft but loathe the corporate thing. Any tips or user friendly builds you can recommend for beginner ex windows users?

The only way I could get it working was by booting into my Windows partition, which makes it clear that Vodafone is deliberately blocking Linux browsers.</p> <p>This is extremely frustrating, because Vodafone advertises the service as accessible \u201cfrom any device via browser\u201d without ever disclosing that Linux is excluded. At the same time, the company\u2019s own hardware and infrastructure are heavily based on Linux, from routers to Android TV boxes, making this restriction feel hypocritical and arbitrary.</p> <p>It is also unfair and discriminatory.
