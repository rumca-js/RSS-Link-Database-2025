The problem is that HP has stopped production of these heads. Additionally, each replacement triggers a massive purge of binder, which wastes a lot of consumables.</p> <p>We have found compatible heads (e.g. AliExpress), but they only work one print before being considered \u201cto be replaced\u201d by the machine, while they are still new.</p> <p>I am therefore looking for people interested in hardware hacking / reverse engineering in order to: \u2022 understand the print head validation mechanism, \u2022 possibly disable or bypass the software check that forces the replacement, \u2022 extend the lifespan of equipment (objective: limit obsolescence and waste).</p> <p>Have you ever heard of similar projects (EEPROM reset, chip emulation, firmware patch) on this type of machine? Or do you know of active communities in this area?</p> <p>Thank you in advance for your advice, sugg",
