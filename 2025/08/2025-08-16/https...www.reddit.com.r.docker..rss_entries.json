TL;DR: running publicly exposed services on the same Docker host as internal DNS, yay or nay?</p> <p>I am currently running Home Assistant OS on a VM in Proxmox. I want to set up a Docker VM where I will run the *arrs, Bookstack for documentation and Pi-hole. I work in SMB IT where we have plenty of resource overhead so most applications run in their own VMs and we don\u2019t use Docker for anything. I\u2019m not so fortunate at home so I need to slim this down but without compromising security. </p> <p>Knowing that Docker containers share kernel with the Docker host, is there risk to having publicly exposed web services, like Bookstack, on the same Docker host as internal services like Pi-hole? If my Bookstack instance was compromised, an attacker gaining access to my internal DNS server could be pretty nasty. My gut feeling is to host anything publicly accessible on a separate Docker host to all",
