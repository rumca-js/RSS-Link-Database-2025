Thousands of people are joining together advocating for OpenAI to keep GPT-4o permanently, alongside GPT-5. Both of these models have their own distinct qualities. Many people value the emotional nuance, warmth, creativity, and support that 4o offers. 5 suits task-driven needs, and has a more matter of fact conversational tone. No one wants the one size fits all approach that OpenAI is proposing, even fans of 5.</p> <p>It\u2019s not about picking one side, it\u2019s about honoring the unique strengths of each system and giving users the choice to connect in the way that works best for them. If 4o has brought joy to your life, provided support, or made you laugh with its hilarious sense of humour, now is the time to share your voice. Even just liking or retweeting others\u2019 posts helps keep the momentum going.</p> <p>Let\u2019s advocate to keep 4o a",

Think finance and law types. I really loved working with 4o and it saved me enormous time on these tasks. But now using 5 is disheartening. The \u201cthoughtfulness\u201d is all gone. The answers are meager, often simply repeat my inputs and is generally quite useless. It also feel \u201cstingy\u201d. I don\u2019t care about \u201cglazing\u201d or \u201cwarmth\u201d or any of that crap. I wanted a competent writing assistant with powers of understanding and expansion and synthesizing complex professional subjects. I\u2019ve gone back to 4o out of necessity (I\u2019m a paid subscriber). If they don\u2019t improve 5 or get rid of 4o, I will be forced to cancel my subscription and start trying out OpenAI\u2019s competitors. I find this sad because 4o was a game changer in professional productivity. 5 is a really deep disappointment considering the \u201cmagic\u201d I had come to ex",
