Everything from Portal to TF Classic, and of course the Half Life franchise. When I got my new PC a couple weeks ago I was definitely very excited for all the cool games I got to play, one being HL Alyx, however my PC has over the minimum specs it\u2019s not at the recommend.</p> <p>That\u2019s when I found out about HL2 VR and how it\u2019s a mod that\u2019s easy to access and play, for free. I immediately rushed to Steam and downloaded it. </p> <p>I played up until Father Gregori\u2019s entrance today and I gotta say, this is the best way to play HL2. The game offers manual interactions with weapons, props, and ragdolls, along with first person vehicle controls and more, along with the full and lively environments present in the original. It also has a workshop where you can get some texture mods if the game looks a bit too blurry and muddy for you, like I have done. The animations for the reloads are from HL",
