It was especially fun on trips \u2014 one time 12 of us travelled together for 5 days, played nonstop, and had a blast. That was 7 years ago.</p> <p>Now I\u2019ve turned it into a Slack game because I thought it\u2019d be a great way for teams to build organic relationships and improve bonding. It\u2019s live on the Slack marketplace \u2014 I haven\u2019t added payments yet, so I\u2019m giving away the <strong>Scaleup plan</strong> to 10 people until the end of the year. My only ask is feedback.</p> <p>How much fun you\u2019ll have honestly depends on your team, but I think it\u2019s fun! If you\u2019d like to try it out, just install the app and DM me so I can upgrade your plan for free. If more than 10 people reach out, I\u2019ll still try to help. And if not, there\u2019s always the free plan, whi",

They don\u2019t care that they could\u2019ve found it cheaper. What they <em>do</em> care about is convenience. They saw it on eBay, clicked \u201cbuy now,\u201d and got it delivered fast. If they ever want to return it, I just send them the Amazon QR code and it\u2019s handled.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019ve scaled up to around 10,000 listings and consistently clear $1k\u2013$3k profit per month.
