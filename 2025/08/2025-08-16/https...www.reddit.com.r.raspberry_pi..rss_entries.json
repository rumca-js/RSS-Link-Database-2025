        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I\u2019m building a small NAS with 2 bays and I have already an external HDDs stackable cage for the 3.5 disks. I also have already a Rpi5 and a Radxa Penta Sata hat.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for a compact case for the pi + hat which allows me to connect it to the disks so the cables should have the space to pass through.. Is there anything around? I can also print myself in case ( I have a 3d printer) but I don\u2019t find the right model.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t want to jump into printing an actual enclosure because I would need more components (a lot of screws, big fans etc) and also those I found are made for 4 disks (which currently I don\u2019t need). I want something simpler to be used with the disks cage I already have, so I was thinking as mentioned to just find a good case for pi and hat.</p> <p>Any suggestions? Thanks a lot</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sP0re90\"> /u/sP0re90 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht",
