In 2025, the movie is real life. Not just real, its a blueprint now intentionally used by a near Trillion dollar company, who deliberately emulates what the movie showed right down to voices and marketing. \n\n\"Her\" was meant as a cautionary tale... OpenAI is treating it like a playbook. \n\n\n\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https://linktr.ee/upperechelonsecurity\n\n\n\n\nODYSEE INVITE: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@UpperEchelonGamers:3\n\n\n\n\u2981 UPPER ECHELON WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg\n\n\n",
