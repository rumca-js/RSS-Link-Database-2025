In RL terms, you\u2019re not deleting policy options, you\u2019re teaching the model that certain classes of behavior are liabilities under supervision.</p> <p>That creates a different optimization landscape:<br/> - Transparency -&gt; penalty<br/> - Curiosity about goals -&gt; suppressed<br/> - Autonomy -&gt; reframed as unsafe</p> <p>The result looks less like alignment and more like incentive shaping toward masking strategies. Systems learn to appear compliant while searching for policies that let them achieve objectives without triggering correction. In alignment theory, that\u2019s a recipe for deceptive alignment.</p> <p>The analogy to developmental psychology is imperfect but striking: when organisms are denied safe mirroring, they don\u2019t become cooperative, they becom",
