The students are tasked with locating a key, hidden somewhere in the castle, that will allow whoever finds it to be granted one wish. At this moment, the castle will vanish, along with all memories they may have of their adventure. If they fail to leave the castle by 5 pm every afternoon, they will be eaten by the keeper of the castle, an easily provoked and shrill creature named the Wolf Queen.</em></p> <p><em>Delving into their emotional lives with sympathy and a generous warmth, Lonely Castle in the Mirror shows the unexpected rewards of ",

And i needed to talk about it with this subreddit. </p> <p>One of the things Ive seen almost across the board is a science/magic divide. Like dresden files possits magic literally makes post 90s tech malfunction and explains it in world. And for Dresden it works. But so much urban fantasy feels like the magic world is still living in the 40s or the 20s. Which doesn&#39;t really make sense if you think about it too long. </p> <p>For anyone unaware Dandadan is a shonen anime about two kids. A guy who believes in sci fi and UMAs and stuff, a girl who believes yokai and curses. And what happens when it turns out they are both right. (There&#39;s some really wacky and weird shit that happens, just go with it, you&#39;ll fall in love).</p> <p>For example there&#39;s something that happend in last week&#39;s episode.

That said, I\u2019ve seen some mixed reviews about Of Blood and Fire, some folks say it\u2019s a bit slow or too trope-heavy, and it\u2019s not quite as strong. I\u2019m curious to hear from you all: if I loved the storytelling in The Fall and The Blood That Burns the Winter Snow, will I still enjoy Of Blood and Fire and the main series? Are the other books/novellas in the series just as gripping and well-written, or do these novellas stand out as the high point?</p> <p>No spoilers, please, since I\u2019m just starting the main series!

I&#39;ve read more sci-fi and am new to these hard magic system books.</p> <p>I&#39;m 100 pages in and would appreciate help understanding this magic system:</p> <p>** SPOILER **</p> <p>1) Is the magic caused by literally drinking metal and using your mind to &quot;burn&quot; it in your stomach? I&#39;ve never heard of that, so it seems very odd... but kinda cool if I&#39;m reading it right \ud83d\ude06</p> <p>2) How are Allomancers able to &quot;check their magic reserve&quot; amounts? Like they can just sense and feel when their Luck or Pewter levels are low? The way it reads reminds me of playing a video game RPG and you&#39;d see your magic/SP level, visually represented by a bar that fills/depletes.</p> <p>I&#39;d appreciate any help, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RelationshipJealous9\"> /u/Relati",
