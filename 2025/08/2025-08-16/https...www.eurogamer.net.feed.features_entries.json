Despite some <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls\">wonky controls</a>, it's a game that still stands up today. No wonder Nintendo hasn't attempted to better it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/i-need-wave-race-blue-storm-and-its-cheesy-cool-to-return-to-the-switch-2s-gamecube-classics-collection\">Read more</a></p>",

Hunched over, Ork-like and sallow, I used to balance my laptop on one of those nesting coffee tables that was a tiny bit too small, a squeaky little bluetooth travel mouse on the even smaller one beside it. It got so uncomfortable at one point I had to give up on the luxury of my squishy wrist-pad mouse mat, and just wedge a whole cushion under my arm instead. All that for another few minutes running my army around the corners of the map, looking for the final building to demolish, any straggling xenos I'd yet to expunge.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/oh-dawn-of-war-how-ive-missed-you\">Read more</a></p>",

This week, we're making a slight change in an effort to get you a wider view of what the team - the entire team - has been playing. Expect to read more opinions on what we've been playing, but slightly shorter entries so we can fit them all in.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-weve-made-a-change-but-dont-panic\">Read more</a></p>",
