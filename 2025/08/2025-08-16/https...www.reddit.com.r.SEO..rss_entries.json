Currently, each practice area has its own main page, each of which links to subpages and relevant articles. But it is a hodge podge. Not ideal for a user, and I am sure not the best for SEO, either. I am thinking about doing a blog section or blog site for at least one of the practice areas, maybe even two separate ones. </p> <p>I have long owned keyword rich domain names that I have never used, such as \u201cNY_____ [practice area].\u201d I have read that these types of URL\u2019s are not helpful for SEO.. But I believe that they might be useful as a sign of credibility for users. Regardless, should the blogs be separate, stand-alone sites from my law firm site?
