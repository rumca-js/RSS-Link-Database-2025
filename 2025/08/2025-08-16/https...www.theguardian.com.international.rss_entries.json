Formally registered a little after 10.30 on Saturday morning, Barcelona\u2019s economic obstacles overcome, he was introduced just after 9pm with 22 minutes left of a sticky and ultimately successful night in Mallorca. By the time he pulled on his shirt and stepped up the line, one of three subs brought on, the temperature had dropped a little, if still not enough, the game was already won, he was up against just nine men, and he got 10 touches. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was a start.</p><p>Earlier than expected, too: Rashford had insisted he was confident but the doubts over him being registered were not resolved until the morning of the match. And so, on 68 minutes, there he was waiting to come on.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/16/real-mallorca-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",
