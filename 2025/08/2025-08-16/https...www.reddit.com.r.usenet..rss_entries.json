I did find a 12-year-old youtube video about preparation. But I am not a window user rather I use a mac. It would be nice to complete the task in my native operating. system. As far as I can tell there are no mac versions of Winrar, Quickpar, and Quicksfv. I did find a T1. Conversion Chart site but I really do not know how to use it.<br/> Is there a wiki or manual that can guide me through the steps and provide info on the necessary software (preferably free) that will work on a mac. And if I must use a virtual machine of docker apps, what the might be called an how to use them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Gur_1091\"> /u/No_Gur_1091 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ms9re1/uploading_files_to_a_usenet_group/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=",
