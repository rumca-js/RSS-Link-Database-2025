I have a few key questions and would love some advice from people with experience in startups or AI development:</p> <ol> <li>Since my target users are in Australia, all <strong>data must be stored locally in Australia</strong> to satisfy compliance requirements. What\u2019s the best way to approach this (e.g., AWS Sydney servers, Azure Australia, etc.)?</li> <li>My budget is limited, so I cannot afford to hire an expensive AI software agency. What\u2019s the most cost-effective way to start (freelancers, students, no-code/low-code tools, etc.)?</li> <li>More broadly, what is the <strong>general logic and process</strong> to start an AI platform/software project \u2014 from idea validation to prototype to scaling?</li> </ol> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate practical suggestions, especially from anyone who has AI startup experience.</p> <p>Thanks in ",
