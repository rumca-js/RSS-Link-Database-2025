        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Many of us have been gaming for a long time, and new responsibility and sheer seen-it-done-that creeps in after a while. But it feels like games generally are getting to be more... time-consuming. Although what I really mean is energy consuming. Maybe it&#39;s the mechanics of the games I play, but it always feels like there are so many more steps before the actual fun reveals itself. Materials to grind, guides to read, corpses to run - I&#39;m no stranger to punishing games, but does it seem to anyone else that games are sapping your personal reserves more than they used to? It used to be that I played to unwind: now I go for a walk to climb down from a stressful raid! I have a theory that this is partly showing up in statistics that indicate people are spending less time gaming, even though consumer spending on game purchases and subscriptions keeps going up.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CptJ",

For example, if a quest asks to gain information from an NPC, you would navigate through the conversation choices and try to pick the right combinations that make the NPC give you what you want. What if the dev codes the NPC with prompt like &quot;this npc is wary of strangers, but will be willing to give out the password if someone chat her up with a topic related to cheese.&quot; Then the player can have a free text chat with the NPC (chatgpt style) to try to get the password our from the npc. The hint for the cheese topic can be in the game world, like notes in the npc&#39;s house.</p> <p>Would this be fun? Gamey? Too cliche? Any other uses of LLM would be cool?
