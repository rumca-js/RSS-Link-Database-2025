The dark theme palette is poorly chosen, the text area is unnecessarily small, and to read anything comfortably you constantly need to zoom in. And seriously - who thought it was a good idea to make the font color gray?</p> <p>The content itself might be fine, but the reading experience is frustrating enough that I couldn&#39;t spend more than an hour with it.
