I just now started trying to play through it and as the title says, it crashes upon completing a stage. Specifically, the game fades to black and stays stuck there. It does this every time, and I can use the level select code to go to further levels so it&#39;s just level completion that seems to cause an issue. Cleaning the contacts got me past it once but it just crashed after beating the next level. I&#39;m a relative novice when it comes to repairs but I was wondering if there&#39;s anything I can do to save this cartridge or if I&#39;m just out of luck and need to get another copy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CrazyCaps01\"> /u/CrazyCaps01 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1mrsepf/genesis_game_crashes_upon_level_completion/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I remember playing this game quite a long time ago (at least 8 years ago). It was a 2D fighting game. The main feature of the game was that when you hit your opponent, small balls would fall from them, and you could collect these balls to gain power and transform into a larger and more powerful version of yourself with various abilities. This suggests that the game had two stages: regular and enhanced. Additionally, the characters in the game were not human. Instead, they were like animals, perhaps resembling Pok\u00e9mon. I loved playing this game in kindergarten, but for some reason the others didn&#39;t like it). I will be grateful if you know the answer.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PATIGUSYA\"> /u/PATIGUSYA </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1mrjcin/hey_guys_can_you_help_me_find_a_fighting_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",
