        "description": "In St. Charles, Missouri, a secret company has proposed building a massive data center on a 440-acre piece of farmland.\n\nIt could drive up utility rates and affect water quality\u2014but an NDA means residents have no idea who\u2019s behind it.\n\nWe were on the ground to investigate.\n\n-----\n\nMore Perfect Union is an Emmy-winning, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to build power for working people.

        "description": "The Biden administration sued RealPage and six of the country's largest landlords for anticompetitive rent-setting practices. Now Greystar\u2014which owns 950,000 apartments\u2014has settled with the DOJ and agreed to stop using RealPage or any anticompetitive algorithm that relies on competitors' data to set rents.\n\nIn addition to the DOJ, several state Attorneys General have filed lawsuits against RealPage, and in June, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb secured $1 million from a major landlord who allegedly used RealPage to inflate rents at 9,000 apartments in the district.\n\nBut there's still a catch. This should help moving forward, but people are still paying the inflated rents that the scheme pushed.",
