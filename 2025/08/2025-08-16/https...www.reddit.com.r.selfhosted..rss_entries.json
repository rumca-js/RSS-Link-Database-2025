In particular: 1. how big a threat is VM escape? I do not plan to host my own software but rather libre and thus audited software 2. would I need a different NIC to fully allocate to the VM? similar concerns as of 1 3. other things I haven&#39;t thought of???</p> <p>The plan would be to have simple firewall rules between internet and vm, vm and rest of the pc with pinholes for the services that I need I&#39;m well aware that physical segregation would be best, I&#39;m just wondering whether this would be a feasible solution (or not) and why; in case it is not",

On one host it was pretty simple, especially while using web application exposed ports to the host. Then I approached to the next step: use multiple hosts in Nomad cluster and Consul cluster. After this I deployed web app on one host and NGINX on another and tried to make it work together. I am trying to not to expose web app ports to the host and use internal docker communication, like using overlay network in Swarm. Currently we created cni/ipvlan netw",

The idea came from a problem I\u2019ve often seen: most tools for communication or data transfer are tied to centralized services. You don\u2019t really control how your data is transmitted, where it\u2019s stored, or who might have access to it. </p> <p>Cluddy takes a different approach. It\u2019s not a messenger, it\u2019s a framework that lets you run your own infrastructure for secure, peer-to-peer data exchange. Each participant can spin up their own server (Cluddy Host) and connect through a tunnel where keys are generated dynamically and never leave their devices. The goal is simple: users stay in full control. </p> <p>What\u2019s already available:<br/> 1. Cluddy Client. Can run autonomously; fully functional when connected to a host, but you can try it standalone.<br/> 2. Cluddy KeyGen. Generates RSA keys locally, works completely on its own.<br/> 3.

I really wanted to have \u201cmylastname.something\u201d, but of course the .com .net etc variants of that had been taken long ago. Then I stumbled on \u201cmylastname.co\u201d, which sounded like a great option. So I registered it and started using it for email.

Fortunately the owner of the .com domain was nice enough to forward any mail he got that seemed to be intended for me. But he even got emails from my doctor, which was kind of crossing a line for me, so I decided to switch to \u201cmylastname.info\u201d instead, to prevent this issues in the futu",

I know I must be missing something obvious, but I don&#39;t know what it is.</p> <p>First, let me make sure I understand. Is the following correct? Pangolin runs on a VPS, a VPS that is the resolution of example.com. It handles connections from the internet to example.com, acting as a reverse proxy. Each site inside Pangolin is secured with Wireguard. That means that Wireguard secures the traffic from the VPS to a specific container/port on my home server.</p> <p>I have a home server and a VPS. A domain points to the VPS. I just installed Pangolin and tried setting up a site. The default option is to use Wireguard for the connection. If each site uses this, what&#39;s th",

The idea is pretty simple: <strong>a self-hosted analytics tool where you decide exactly what gets tracked</strong>. Want to count page views? Fine.

Nothing else gets collected unless you explicitly tell it to.</p> <p>It\u2019s designed to be lightweight, easy to set up (upload, quick install page, drop in a script), and fully yours since it runs on your own server.
