GPT5 has real strengths, especially around task orientation. The way 5-thinking handles deduction and logic genuinely surprised me, especially when prompted the right way. It made me realize: back in the pre-GPT5 era, I would sometimes manually force 4o into a more \u201ccold and rational\u201d mode just to solve specific problems. (And back then, o3 was still around to help fill in gaps too.)</p> <p>This act of forcing 4o into a purely logical state and trying to make 5 more emotional, it mirrors the way humans toggle between rationality and emotion.

Predictably hitting an even bigger wall, they eventually opened legacy models to all users\u2014first web-only, now with some models available by default.
