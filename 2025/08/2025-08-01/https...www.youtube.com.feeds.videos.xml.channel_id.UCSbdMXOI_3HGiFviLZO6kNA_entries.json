Just the past month, Meta has published multiple, relatively groundbreaking papers detailing their progress on multiple fronts of VR: Ultra wide Field of view, Extremely small form factor holographic displays that solve fundamental issues in VR like the Vergence Accomodation Conflict, and Hyperrealistic VR headsets. Now.. whether this stuff ends up coming to the Quest 3 plus or Quest 4.. i doubt it.. but what I can say, is that VR in 2035 is going to be bonkers.  \n\nJOIN MY DISCORD SERVER:\nhttps://discord.gg/Thrill\n\nSUPPORT MY CHANNEL:\nhttps://patreon.com/thrillseeker\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \n00:00 - Intro\n00:50 - Surfshark Sponsor\n02:30 - TASTE VR\n04:35 - FEEL CATGIRL EARS \n05:48 - EXTREMELY WIDE FOV\n08:50 - WAVEGUIDE HOLOGRAPHIC VR\n14:36 - I HAVE BIG NEWS",
