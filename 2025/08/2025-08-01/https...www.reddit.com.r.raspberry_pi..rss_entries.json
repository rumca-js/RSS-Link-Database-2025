Most exciting of all, however, is the fact that Artificial Intelligence is now being used to enhance and extend the ViewTouch software which is available at GitHub. From this point on there will be many improvements in the software which will result from AI analysis of the code and from AI generated code contributions. I began the ViewTouch project began in 1980 and is still under my guidance and sponsorship today in 2025. Many new announcements will be made at the ViewTouch web site and at GitHub in the coming months, many of them dealing with the impact of AI on the code.</p> <p>For those not familiar with ViewTouch it is written in C++, and the user interface is built with X Window System primitives.

I adjusted the focus using:</p> <pre><code>rpicam-vid -t 0 -n --width 1920 --height 1080 --framerate 30 --codec h264 --inline --listen -o tcp://0.0.0.0:5000 </code></pre> <p>Everything worked perfectly.</p> <p>But the next day, hell broke loose.</p> <p>I got stuck in a nasty loop trying to install <code>libcamera</code>, and in the end, I found out that it wouldn&#39;t work on 32-bit Bookworm.<br/> ChatGPT led me down a rabbit hole \u2014 honestly, I didn\u2019t pay much attention \u2014 including recompiling <code>libcamera</code>, etc.<br/> E",
