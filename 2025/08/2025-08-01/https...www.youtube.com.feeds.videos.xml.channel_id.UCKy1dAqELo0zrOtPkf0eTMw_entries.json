All models of the Switch 1, including the OLED and Lite models, will go up in price from around $30-$50. Switch 1 accessories like extra Joy-Con and the Alarmo clock are also going up in price. Select Switch 2 accessories will also see a hike, but the Switch 2 system and games so far are holding steady. In related news, Nintendo's latest financial report shows a promising start to the Switch 2, selling around 6 million units worldwide since launch. Nintendo's goal of 15 million Switch 2's sold by the end of March 2026 looks to be in sight. And if you own a Switch 2, but were hoping for a port of Battlefield 6, you might be waiting a long time. Battlefield boss Vince Zampella has said in an interview that there's currently no plans to release the upcoming shooter on Switch 2.",
