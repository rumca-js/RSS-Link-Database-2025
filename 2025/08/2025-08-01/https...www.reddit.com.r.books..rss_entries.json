I\u2019ve struggled with a lot of anxiety regarding death lately, specifically the idea of being dead. While reading LD, I went from very much being aware of my own anxieties when Sean O\u2019Brien died, to being a lot more at peace with the idea of dying when Gus passed (don\u2019t get me wrong, I was definitely bawling when reading that scene).</p> <p>Anyway, this got me thinking about how McMurtry deals with death in this book, and how we get to see the characters come to terms with their own inevitable endings (I\u2019m mainly thinking about Wilbarger, Jake, Deets and Gus). I think for someone who can get a bit obsessed with death and dying, being confronted with it in this way (rather than trying to just not think about it) can almost be a bit healing. Especially the scene with Gus",
