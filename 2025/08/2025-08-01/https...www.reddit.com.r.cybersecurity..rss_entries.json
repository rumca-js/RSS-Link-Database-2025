Within the AWS architecture, we&#39;ve found that a sampling of the ec2&#39;s showed they have 2+ kernels (depending on their age, our ec2&#39;s are ephemeral and replaced quite frequently); one of the kernels is the current in-use and the other is a legacy, prior version that is not active. Inspector(2) doesn&#39;t flag any of these prior kernels as vulnerabilities.<br/> For our on-prem though, our higher org utilizes Rapid7 nexpose, and this is where the issue arises. I can&#39;t tune out the legacy kernels, but R7 nexpose DOES flag them for vulnerabilities despite not being the active kernel and this contributes to the risk score and makes analysis burdensome. </p> <p>I&#39;m wondering what others are doing in terms of legacy kernel retention for operational resilience.
