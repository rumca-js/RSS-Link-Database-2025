        "description": "The Problem: Enterprise AI faces a critical fragmentation crisis. When organizations deploy agents from different vendors\u2014LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI\u2014they can't communicate or collaborate. \"You can't have a singular agent solve for larger goals,\" explains Vijoy Pandey from Cisco's Outshift. \"We're moving from deterministic to probabilistic computing, requiring subject matter expert agents that must collaborate.\"\nCisco's Solution: AGNTCY emerged from Cisco's Outshift incubator to solve this exact problem\u2014creating standardized protocols for agent discovery, identity, messaging, and observability. Think \"Internet of Agents\" where any AI agent can find, authenticate with, and securely communicate with any other agent, regardless of framework or vendor.\nWhy Linux Foundation Governance: Cisco donated AGNTCY to Linux Foundation for neutral governance and industry-wide adoption. With founding members including Dell, Google Cloud, Oracle, and Red Hat, plus 75+ contributors, AGNTCY is positioned",

        "description": "At Open Source Summit in Denver, David Nalley (Director of Developer Experience, AWS) and Antje Barth (Principal Developer Advocate, AWS) join Swapnil Bhartiya to discuss the future of agentic AI and how open standards are accelerating innovation. The conversation covers AWS\u2019s contributions to the Agent2Agent (A2A) project under the Linux Foundation, the launch of the Strands Agents SDK for building agentic systems, and major updates in the Valkey project\u2014including the new Valkey Bundle. They also dive into how AWS measures open source health through Pony Factor and Elephant Factor.\nLearn more: https://aws.amazon.com\nRead full story on: https://www.TFiR.io\nWatch the full interview to understand where AI agents are headed next.\nHashtags:\n#AgenticAI #OpenSource #AWS #Valkey #StrandsAgents #A2Aprotocol #LinuxFoundation #AIagents #DeveloperTools",
