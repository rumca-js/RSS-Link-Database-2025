I am seeing all this crap about what Google has been doing lately (AI age verification, it is NOT just Youtube, but Google, too!) and have decided it&#39;s about time I switch all of my personal accounts to a different service that isn&#39;t acting up as much. I was wondering what email service would be best to make the move to.</p> <p>I also store a lot of personal writing on google docs, as I, despite being an adult, live in an unsafe household where I cannot trust that my writing will not be seen by my family if I save it directly onto my devices.
