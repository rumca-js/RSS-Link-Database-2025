        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019ve been working on an image sonification program called <strong>sonifyCPP</strong>. Image sonification refers to converting images into audio signals by using properties such as pixel distribution, intensity, hue etc.</p> <p>Project link: <a href=\"https://github.com/dheerajshenoy/sonifycpp\">https://github.com/dheerajshenoy/sonifycpp</a></p> <p>This project started as a Python prototype for a NASA hackathon, and I\u2019ve since reimplemented it in C++. At the moment, it supports basic sonification by mapping either pixel intensity or hue (from the HSV color space) to sound, and supports different image traversals (or scanning), which basically defines in what way should the program analyse the images in (left to right, right to left, top to bottom etc.)</p> <p>Looking ahead, I plan to add support for user-defined mappings via scripting. I initially experimented with Lua, but have since switched to TOML for its simplicity.</p> <p>Sin",
