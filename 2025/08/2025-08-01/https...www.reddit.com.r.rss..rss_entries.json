However, I get increasingly frustrated that Google show me so many sources I don&#39;t recognise/trust</p> <p>So last weekend, I had a bit of time and built a news aggregator called <a href=\"http://100.news/\">100.news</a> where you can completely control the news you&#39;re reading.</p> <p>You simply:</p> <ol> <li>Select the sources you trust (I have only managed to add 70 sources for now but want to add more)</li> <li>Choose your topics of interest - can be anything from AI to Harry Styles</li> </ol> <p>You will receive a real-time feed which doesn&#39;t rely on big news corps showing you articles with most clicks/engagement.</p> <p>Still early days with this idea so v much open to criticism. Please let me know what you think</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HolidayWhich6289\"> /u/Holiday",
