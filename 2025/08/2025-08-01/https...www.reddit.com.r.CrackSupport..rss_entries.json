But, on Spider-Man Remastered I get perfectly 30fps with fps lock with very high preset, 30fps on Miles Morales with Medium to High settings. But for me, Spider-Man 2 doesn\u2019t even start properly. I get in 5fps with 720p resolution, everything on Very Low, Upscale set to Ultra Performance. This is certainly a problem with the game itsfel, not my components. It is impossible to get 5fps with those settings, I can\u2019t get to SANDMAN cuz of the insane stutters I get. I tried the FirtGirl repack version and the one on Steam.rip. I\u2019ve tried different drivers and there is no hope.
