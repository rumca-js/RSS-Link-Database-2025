        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>Thought I&#39;d share a tool I&#39;ve been working on to be able to stream content from Usenet and build an infinite plex library.</p> <p>It&#39;s essentially a webdav server that can mount and stream content from Nzb files. It also exposes a SABnzbd api so it can integrate with radarr and sonarr.</p> <p>I built it because my tiny VPS was easily running out of storage, but now my library takes no storage at all. Hope you like it!</p> <h1>Key Features</h1> <ul> <li>\ud83d\udcc1 <strong>WebDAV Server</strong> - <em>Provides a WebDAV server for seamless integration.</em></li> <li>\u2601\ufe0f <strong>Mount NZB Documents</strong> - <em>Mount and browse NZB documents as a virtual file system without downloading.</em></li> <li>\ud83d\udcfd\ufe0f <strong>Full Streaming and Seeking Abilities</strong> - <em>Jump ahead to any point in your video streams.</em></li> <li>\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f <strong>Automatic Unrar</strong> - <em>View, stream, and seek content within RAR archives</em></li> <li>\ud83e\udde9",
