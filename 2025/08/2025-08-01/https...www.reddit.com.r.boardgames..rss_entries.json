Does anyone have experience doing either?</p> <p>I ask because I just got a carrom board for super cheap, it\u2019s not perfect and I do like it, but the wood is raw/unfinished. It needs to be slick/faster, and I want to protect it. Just hoping someone has tried one of these, I could maybe get some scrap plywood of a similar finish and test both but I don\u2019t know if it will 1-1 transfer and the biggest thing is I don\u2019t want to mess up my board.

I am the senior boardgamer there and introduced them to Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion which they loved which led us to go for the original Gloomhaven. </p> <p>As many of you may experience it is hard to keep such a campaign going at a good pace for us to keep remembering where we were the plotline and so on, it is too much to keep track of. This should be ok if we would be able to meet once week, and it is not the case! Sometimes we spend more the month without playing.</p> <p>So long story short, any recommendations for a small size campaign, I feel that Jaws of the Lion is perfectly sized without the being too simple or too dull, it is very good, with a nice character progression.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fdsnda\"> /u/Fdsnda </a> <br",
