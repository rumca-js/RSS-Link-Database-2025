Say, I have a Windows binary (file.dll) and the matching symbols file for it (file.pdb) that I want to statically analyze in Ghidra. </p> <p>My steps for loading it in Ghidra are as follows: - I place both file.DLL and file.pdb in the same folder. - I then drag file.DLL into - hmm, idk what it\u2019s called, a small Ghidra window with the list of binaries in my project. - I then let Ghidra recognize it as a binary file and do some of its juju. - then double click file.dll in that list to open it in the main Ghidra window - it then asks me if I want to analyze it. I click yes and go with default options. - then after some waiting when the analysis is done - in Ghidra\u2019s main window, I go to File -&gt; Load PDB file and pick the PDB. - then again in the main Ghidra window I go to Analysis -&gt; Auto Analyze \u201cfile.dll\u201d - and wait again for the analysis to finish. </p> <p>Is that how you open a binary with ",

It uses libraries like Goblin and Wasmparser to create a CLI that allows you to:</p> <p>- Analyze binaries<br/> - Diff binaries<br/> - Scan binaries for CVEs (Still improving this)<br/> - Create signed attestations for binaries (License required)<br/> - Chat with your binary analysis (Essentially runs the analysis function, and then uses an LLM to chat with output, required license) </p> <p>I&#39;m looking to get feedback on both the OSS components of Nabla, and the premium components which I&#39;m happy to mint a free 30-day (Or longer idk) license for if you&#39;re willing to share a statement I can use on the marketing page. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tiny_Ocelot4286\"> /u/",
