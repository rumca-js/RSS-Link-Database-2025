I have an old HP ProLiant server in my basement running the latest LTS Ubuntu Server OS, which is itself running Docker. My first containers were just pre-rolled Minecraft and SQL Server containers and using those has been great so far. However, I am now trying to deploy a website to my server through using Docker and having trouble. </p> <p>End goal: route traffic to and from the website via a subdomain on a domain name representing my server so that friends can access this site. </p> <p>Where I am at right now: When running fresh containers on both my development desktop and the server, it doesnt seem like the website is accessible at all. Docker Desktop shows no ports listed on the container built from my Dockerfile. However, I have another container running on my development desktop that seems to be left over in Docker Desktop from running my project in VS2022 in debug mod",
