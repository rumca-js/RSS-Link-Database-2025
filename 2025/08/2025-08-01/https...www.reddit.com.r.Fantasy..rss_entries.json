Now that I&#39;m a little older I realise how creepy his way of talking about women is.</p> <p>Just so you get an idea, one of the Xanth books is called &quot;the colour of her panties&quot;. He objectifies his female characters (which by the way, are usually minors), and when describing them, its usually only a weird physical description, which is a pity as I actually enjoy the books, but unfortunately, its so awkward reading him that I havent been able to re-read Xanth #4 Centaur Aisle.</p> <p>Just like I\u2019ve judged his way of writing women, I must give credit to other things like his puns. There&#39;s sick wordplay, and lighthearted but great character archs. I would love to know what you think about his books, specially Xanth as they&#39;re his most relevant series.</p> </div><!",

My favourite book out of the 5 is The Black Cauldron, with Castle of Llyr as a close 2nd.</p> <p>Dialogue is sick, specially the way Eilonwy speaks, her way of talking is so different to anything I had ever read, I could recognize a sentence she&#39;s said anywhere. Same for Gurgi. </p> <p>The series also has moral lessons that arent lectured, but subtly shown through characters&#39;s actions. Sacrifices dont always repay, choices have consequences, understanding your limits, etc. It is all <em>shown.</em> </p> <p>Overall I think Lloyd Alexander is an absolute genius.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Locasoyyooo\"> /u/Locasoyyooo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mejajh/what_do_yall_think_of_chronicles_of_prydain/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"h",

Early on in the book there is a comment made that suggests the emperor of the first book is no longer on the throne, but I don&#39;t remember there being any discussion of that in either of the first two books of this series. Did I miss something somehow? Part of my confusion is that I don&#39;t have a good sense for how much time has passed since the events of the Goblin Emporer though I don&#39;t feel like it has been more than a few years. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OutWithCamera\"> /u/OutWithCamera </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mej3yk/katherine_addison_tomb_of_dragons_confusion/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/commen",
