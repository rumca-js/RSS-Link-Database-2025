They literally already have it! Back then, suddenly some videos on YouTube were unavailable to me unless I submitted photos of my ID into my Google account. Videos with gory moviescenes, swearing, etc. So I did.</p> <p>Now I want to give Google the finger\ud83d\udd95 and delete this data they have on me. Problem is, I have no clue where I can find this data. I vaguely remember a dedicated tab in my chrome settings back then, but it&#39;s not there anymore. I don&#39;t want Google to have my ID anymore. Anyone know how to help me? </p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lol_doge_lol\"> /u/lol_doge_lol </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1mepkk3/need_help_with_finding_and_deleting_my_id_from/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",
