So for this link it may be something like &quot;Trusted Mini Furniture Removal Company in Town&quot;.</p> <p>On the mobile version: I use Elementor&#39;s slider element in order to increase user friendliness, but you cannot link headings. So while the same heading applies to the slide &amp; concept as a whole, I can only link the button where the anchor text will be shorter. For example &quot;Mini Furniture Removals&quot;.</p> <p>Now, the question is which anchor text will take priority when it comes to relevance? Do they carry equal priority? Does the button carry less? Do the priorities differ on mobile &amp",
