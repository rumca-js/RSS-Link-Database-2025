        "description": "Everyone\u2019s obsessed with being happy\u2014but what if that obsession is the very thing making us miserable? In this episode of Solved, Drew and I explore what actually makes us feel good\u2014and why most of us are chasing it in all the wrong ways.\n\nWe unpack what philosophers like Aristotle and the Buddha got right thousands of years ago\u2014and how modern science is just now catching up. We talk about hedonic vs. eudaimonic happiness, why more money and status don\u2019t necessarily move the needle, and why most self-help advice completely misses the point. Happiness isn\u2019t something you get. It\u2019s a side effect of doing the right things for the right reasons.\n\nSo, if you're tired of chasing \"more\" and ready to actually feel a little less miserable, this one\u2019s for you. \n\nWe also put together a free companion guide for this episode with all the takeaways, references, and tools to help you get your sh*t together once and for all.
