It\u2019s not for PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Micron shipped the Micron 9650 SSD, the world\u2019s first PCIe 6.0 SSD, designed for AI training and inference workloads. Unfortunately, those tasks take place in AI data centers, not home PCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Micron will ship the drive in both a PRO (read-intensive) and MAX (write-intensive) configuration, with capacities ranging from 6.4TB to 30.72TB, depending on which flavor a customer buys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, the drives use a PCI Express 6.2 interface, connecting to Micron\u2019s six-plane, ninth-generation (G9) flash memory. The kicker, though, is the performance. The Micron 9650 SSD family performs sequential reads of 28,000 MB/s and sequential writes of 14,000 MB/s (which is",
