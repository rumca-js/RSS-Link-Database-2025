Ok I&#39;m a addict in recovery but I&#39;ve been clean for close to a decade maybe more and I just say that so you understand part of my problem when I try to make a resume there&#39;s years that I never had legit income even before I became a addict I hopped off the porch when I was 13 so after hundreds of applications I realize no one is gonna hire me right now which then made me realize I&#39;m probably gonna need a certificate or degree from get a career and I&#39;ve always thought being one of those computer security firms where people get paid to try and find any holes in the security to make it stronger. So my question is, are there any programs that will teach you how to do that stuff and you get paid while you learn?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BigEvil_300\"> /u/BigEvil_300 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1meu",
