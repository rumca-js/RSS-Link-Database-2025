To back up the recommendation, plenty of VRtuber influencers also had solid feedback about it (yeah I know, most are shills) so I made a hasty decision to give it a try and oh boy... I wish I hadn&#39;t.</p> <p>The hardware is actually pretty good, its solid and well made. The main problem with Truegear is the TERRIBLE GAME SUPPORT. I mean seriously, it sucks, and not only that but the new games getting voted on for support to be added are lame too.</p> <p>Additionally, Truegear use some janky script that completely screws with some VR mods like in Subside.</p> <p>All in all I wish I had spent a little more and got a bhaptics, because the game support there is massive and also supports standalone games from Quest. Lesson learned.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TotalWarspammer\"> /u/TotalWarspammer </a> <br",
