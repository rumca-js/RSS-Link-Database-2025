So I decided to do some testing. But not the camera pointed at a monitor method. You\u2019ve perhaps seen Nvidia\u2019s LDAT that takes a mouse button click and a sensor physically on the monitor to compare the latency between the click and the light coming from an action, usually a muzzle flash. However, that&#39;s expensive to buy so I built my own with an arduino. I would post the code but because I was distro hopping I forgot to backup the sketch and it\u2019s gone. But it\u2019s still on the arduino so I can still use it.</p> <p><strong>How It Works</strong></p> <p>I have an arduino starter kit that comes with a button and a phototransistor. I also have a Logitec",
