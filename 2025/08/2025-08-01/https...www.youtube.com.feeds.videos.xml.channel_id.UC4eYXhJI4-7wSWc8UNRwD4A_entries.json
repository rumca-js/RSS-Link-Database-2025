        "description": "Kara Frame | August 1, 2025\nOn a cold and snowy night this past winter, Sierra Hull and her band brought bluegrass to Washington, D.C. Despite the frigid temperatures outside, barefoot fans danced as if at a summer music festival. Ever since she first picked up the instrument at a young age, the mandolin virtuoso has captivated audiences; it\u2019s no surprise that she still owns the stage two decades later. \n\nAt the Tiny Desk months later, her set features four songs from A Tip Toe High Wire, her latest album. \u201cBoom\u201d and \u201cLord, That\u2019s a Long Way\u201d showcase her incredibly fast, finger-picking abilities. Before performing the third song, Hull tells the audience, \u201cMy granny lived such a crazy life in her 80 years that we got to have her. I didn\u2019t get to play this song for her before she passed, but I did tell her I was writing a song for her called \u2018Spitfire.\u2019 \u201d Hull\u2019s granny experienced the Great Depression in rural Tennessee, was widowed twice and buried a son \u2014 she lived a life of hardship",
