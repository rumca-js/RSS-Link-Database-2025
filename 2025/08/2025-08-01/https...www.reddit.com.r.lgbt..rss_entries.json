I want my voice deeper, I want the genitals, I want it all. Other times, I&#39;m very happy being a woman, I love it. I love how my body feels, how it looks. I already have a slightly deeper voice for a woman, and it&#39;s a bit raspy at times too. I know I&#39;m at least Bi, but something goes deeper it feels. I&#39;ve always been a bit more boy-ish, even in my childhood. I never wore &quot;girly&quot; clothings, hated even being seen in pink (not that pink is a bad thing). Never really wore dresses or skirts. I own a lot more feminine clothing now, but I still sometimes get super uncomfortable in female type clothing. I&#39;m currently with a straight man and I haven&#39;t really told him about all this yet.</p> <p>Maybe I&#39;m just impulsive? Maybe it&#39;s hormonal",

Over the last 3 years I feel like every time I look in the mirror, the person looking back isn&#39;t the real representation of me. In addition, every time I look at a woman, regardless of whether it&#39;s in a movie, a show, a game, a poster, or any other media, all I can think is &quot;Why isn&#39;t that me?&quot;. I&#39;ve done all the research about being MtF, and it genuinely seems like something that I want to be. Part of the reason I say I don&#39;t know what to do about it is that I feel like I&#39;ve already built too much of a life around me being a &quot;guy,&quot; and it&#39;s too late to be who I want to be. Also, my parents always say that they are supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, but I don&#39;t know if they are ready for their &quot;boy&quot; to be a girl.
