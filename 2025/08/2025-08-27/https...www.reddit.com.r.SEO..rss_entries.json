I run a chauffeur service company in India that is a few months old with a very lean budget and less than 500 total impressions on google. From what I&#39;ve learnt so far 1. I need to go keywords with low competition 2. Mobile optimise my website for better reading and speed 3. Link pillars-clusters-blogs and add schema and backlinks 4. Focus on EEAT. A few questions 1. Do I need to invest in a SEO tool like Ahref/SEO Surfer etc or can I do with google keywords for the time being? 2. Is Uber Suggest by Neil Patil good, I find it to be priced resonably compared to other tools. 3. Any tips of suggestions will be very helpful.

Like there was a domain with 5 AS but 52 DR.</p> <p>I noticed that under the AS, Semrush will explicitly say that the domain lacks organic traffic but has a strong backlink profile, is this the reason? If it helps, I saw that the Moz DA was 19 and PA was 41.</p> <p>Also, where does Spam Score come into play for these domains, should I value it as an important indicator? From my research this specific domain looks clean but I&#39;ve also heard that there is an Expired Domain Abuse Penalty from Google so I was wondering if this strategy is still viable as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TrapsAreNotGay69\"> /u/TrapsAreNotGay69 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"htt",
