Microsoft\u2019s Game Pass Core and Standard tiers are more affordable, and there\u2019s good news for subscribers today: Microsoft is making PC and cloud streaming games available to those tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game Pass Core and Standard subscribers will now have access to cloud gaming, both on games that they do and don\u2019t own. Even better, Microsoft is testing giving them access to local versions of select PC titles, widening the Core and Standard tiers \u2014 which were tied to the Xbox console \u2014 and making them accessible to PC and/or handheld players, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this makes sense, as Microsoft has expanded its concept of what an Xbox is to both the PC, handheld, and streaming television platforms. It\u2019s also good news",

My area is an internet dead zone where you might get a bit of 4G on a nearby hill, but that\u2019s about it. No cellular for phone calls, and the best I can hope from a landline connection is 3 Mbps. As a modern man with a modern family full of modern devices, I need fast internet\u2014so I readied Starlink even before my kids\u2019 beds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked pretty well, too. At first I heard a bunch of buzzing noises that I was <em>not</em> expecting, but that sort of coil whine is apparently pretty typical. A few minutes later, I was online!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Having Starlink isn\u2019t like having fiber internet, and I ran into several surprises along the way.
