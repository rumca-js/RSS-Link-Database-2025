        "description": "Lockout (2012) is one of those underrated, popcorn sci-fi action movies that leans hard into B-movie territory but that\u2019s also why it\u2019s so much fun. Produced by Luc Besson, the film stars Guy Pearce as \u201cSnow,\u201d a wise-cracking ex-CIA agent sent to rescue the President\u2019s daughter (Maggie Grace) from a maximum-security prison in space.\n\nThis scene shows Snow reviving Emilie after things go bad a mix of tension and the sarcastic humor that makes Pearce\u2019s character so memorable. It\u2019s definitely not a perfect movie, but for fans of Escape from New York, Fortress, or even Pitch Black, it scratches that pulpy sci-fi action itch.",
