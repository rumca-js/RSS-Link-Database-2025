Two million consoles sold in two months outpaces the orginal Switch's sales during the same two-month launch period back in 2017, by about 75%. The Switch 2 Pro Controller is also the best-selling accessory of the year so far. In other news, Amazon has reportedly set a date for the beginning of filming for its Mass Effect series: Q4 2026. Story details make it seem like the show will adapt at least the first game, so fans can probably expect a straightforward adaptation (unlike what the Halo live-action series got). And finally, Gears of War: Reloaded is having a rough launch on Steam, with many players reporting crashes, and some pre-order bonuses missing.",

        "description": "Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition+ Star-Crossed World reviewed by Tom Marks on Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nKirby and the Forgotten Land is still a great platformer three years later, and the Star-Crossed World DLC that comes as part of its Nintendo Switch 2 Edition adds a few more amusing levels to the mix \u2013 but that\u2019s about it. A couple of cool new enemies, funny Mouthful Mode transformations, and clever ideas put its 12 stages in the top half of the heap overall, but with little beyond that, this comes across less like a proper expansion and more like a DLC level pack to invite you to come back for a weekend. It\u2019s all fun enough that it\u2019s fairly easy to recommend to anyone who has been dying for more Forgotten Land since finishing it, but doesn\u2019t feel like an upgrade that will irresistibly suck you in like one of Kirby\u2019s mouthfuls.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Nintendo",
