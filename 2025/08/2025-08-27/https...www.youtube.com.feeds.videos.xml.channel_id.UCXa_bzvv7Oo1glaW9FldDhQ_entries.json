        "description": "It\u2019s not every day we get a classic anime from the 80s resurrected in video game format, so this is something of a surprise. Space Adventure Cobra is primarily an action platforming game using a fair amount of cutscenes from the anime.\n\nSpace Adventure Cobra: The Awakening is your classic level-based run and gun sidescroller, with some wonderful boss fights and puzzles along the way. Some of the controls are a bit restrictive, leading to jank, but as the review covers, there\u2019s more here than meets the eye.",

        "description": "There\u2019s nothing wrong with going bigger, brighter, and bolder, as was the case with Dying Light 2, but  the series' fans have yearned to return to the series\u2019 survival horror roots for a while now; and that\u2019s precisely what The Beast aims to supply. \n\nWith deadlier nights, a rural wooded locale, and the return of vehicles, this stand-alone title stands in stark contrast to Dying Light 2. It\u2019s still got that DNA - the combat and premise are all there, and the wonderfully detailed and beautiful Chrome engine renders objects and dynamic lights better than ever. \n\nBut this is a different beast to the previous game, and here are 15 ways it does that.",

        "description": "To say that it's been a long wait for a new Metal Gear Solid would be an understatement, and even if it's been several years coming, diving back into the stealth action franchise with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater feels good. \n\nWith advanced access now live on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, the whole world, or at least those who bought the Digital Deluxe Edition, can experience the remake in all its glory. Even with the revamped visuals, at its core, this is still inherently the classic that long-time fans know and love in terms of the story, character and classic voice acting. But what about the gameplay?\n\nKonami has adamantly retained the same fundamentals that made the 2004 classic such a massive hit, but added several new options and features to change things up. How deeply do they affect, or even improve, the gameplay?",
