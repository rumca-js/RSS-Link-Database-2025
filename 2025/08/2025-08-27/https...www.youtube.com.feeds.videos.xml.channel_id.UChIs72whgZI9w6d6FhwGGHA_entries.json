Razer has problems with its Blade laptop's trackpad / touchpad, crashing and BSODs, external display connectivity, and more. Its Synapse software also negatively impacts performance, and its customer support hasn't been very supportive of end users.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
