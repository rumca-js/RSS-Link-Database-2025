Each player had a cat that was loaded into a spring tube and that would clip to the fence. You rolled a D6 with either a 1 2 3 or dog symbol. You moved the number of fence posts rolled but if you rolled the dog watch out! There was a mechanical dog that had a button on it. It would randomly charge at the fence for like 5 seconds and if your cat was hit it would launch off. If your cat was sent flying you started back at the start. First to get all the way around the yard won. WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS GAME???</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/leonk701\"> /u/leonk701 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1n1x3r6/help_me_remember/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1n1x3r6/help_me_remember/\">[comments]",
