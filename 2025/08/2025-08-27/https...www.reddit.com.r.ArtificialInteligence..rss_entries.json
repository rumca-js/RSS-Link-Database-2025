When reworded, accuracy <strong>dropped by 9% to 40%</strong>.</p> <p>That suggests pattern matching, not solid clinical reasoning - which is risky because patients don\u2019t speak in neat exam prose.</p> <p>The takeaway: today\u2019s LLMs are fine as <strong>assistants</strong> (drafting, education), not decision-makers.</p> <p>We need tougher tests (messy language, adversarial paraphrases), more reasoning-focused training, and real-world monitoring before use at the bedside.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Passing board-style questions != safe for real patients.

Community detection in graphs has become a field on its own. Real-world networks, however, tend to describe asymmetric, directed relationships, and community detection methods have not yet reached consensus on how to define and retrieve communities in this setting. This work introduces a framework for the interpretation of directed graph partitions and communities, for which we define the bimodularity index and provide an optimization method to retrieve the embedding and detection of directed communities. The application of our approach to the worm neuronal wiring diagram highlights the importance of directed information that remains hidden from conventional community detection.&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",
