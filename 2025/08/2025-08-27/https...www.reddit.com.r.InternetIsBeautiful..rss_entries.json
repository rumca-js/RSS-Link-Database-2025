The website is a show listing website with a twist. every new show or event gets its own phone extension by default on the front page! The phone number listed takes you to a real phone tree where you can enter your shows extension and hear information about the show. No apps, no scrolling, just a real phone call! Talk about RETRO! Video game sections have been added for streamers! Just click the green plus sign button and try it out for yourself. I will give away free PREMIUM access to some of the first new users after this post as a courtesy. PREMIUM access allows you to write in a CUSTOM show description that will be read by &quot;Alice&quot; after you make your show and it is approved. You can have fun with this and impress your friends. It kind of feels like an underground speak-easy! Are you a streamer for gam",
