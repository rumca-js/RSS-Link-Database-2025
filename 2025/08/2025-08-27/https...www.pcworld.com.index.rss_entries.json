For example, this <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1905777-REG/gigabyte_gaming_a16_cvhi3us894sh_16_gaming_a16_cvh.html\">Gigabyte Gaming A16 laptop is only $1,100 at B&H right now</a>, down from its $1,250 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s a fantastic price for a gaming laptop of this caliber. Just look at the main specs: a 13th-gen Intel Core i7-13620H processor, 16GB of fast DDR5 memory, plus a fast 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD. All together, that\u2019s a speedy machine that\u2019s more than capable of handling your day-to-day tasks with ease\u2014and that includes creative hobbies and gaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because here\u2019s the cherry on top: this Gigabyte Gaming A16 features an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU. Yep, that\u2019s right. One of the la",

A mini PC is far more powerful than a comparably priced laptop and takes up far less space than a full-blown desktop PC. Don\u2019t believe me? Check out this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD7Y4C5Y/\">GMKtec M5 Plus that\u2019s on sale for just $319.96 on Amazon</a>, down from its original $399.98 MSRP. You won\u2019t find a laptop this good at this price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GMKtec M5 Plus runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U CPU and 32GB of RAM, making this a speedy home office computer that can smoothly handle everything from spreadsheets to streaming media to social media and whatever else you need to get done on a normal day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about storage space, you shouldn\u2019t be.
