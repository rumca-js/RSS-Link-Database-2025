        "description": "Adam combines his love of bookbinding and movie props to build a replica of the Necronomicon from The Evil Dead! And who better to help him with this build than Tom Sullivan, the creator of the special makeup effects, special effects, and stop-motion effects for The Evil Dead! Tom brings along one of his molds for the book's fleshy cover, and the two geek out over horror films and practical effects while making this iconic prop!\n\nThanks so much to Tom for spending the day with us for this build!
