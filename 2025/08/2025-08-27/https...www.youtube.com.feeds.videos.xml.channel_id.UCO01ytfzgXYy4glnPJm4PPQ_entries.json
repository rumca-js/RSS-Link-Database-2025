        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, local authorities are planning to charge Shiloh Hendrix with a crime for saying a racial slur. Apparently our free speech rights no longer include mean words. Also, the Trump Administration plans to ship 600 thousand Chinese students into the country. They say that if we don\u2019t bring in all of these Chinese communities, a bunch of universities might go out of business. But why is that a bad thing? And the mayor of Chicago says we can\u2019t solve crime by putting criminals in jail. We solve it by spending more money on housing and education. But how has that strategy panned out? We\u2019ll take a look. Finally, of course, the big news of the week, and the century. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are engaged.\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n\n00:00 - 00:34 Opening\n2:07 - 20:28 Shiloh Hendrix Gets Charged For Saying A Racial Slur.
