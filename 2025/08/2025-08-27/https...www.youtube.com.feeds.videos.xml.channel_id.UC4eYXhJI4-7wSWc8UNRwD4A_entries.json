        "description": "Released 10 years ago, Carly Rae Jepsen's supercharged album, 'Emotion' was a critic's darling out the gate and firmly cemented Jepsen's status as a niche star with a fervent gay fanbase. It's been much dissected and evangelized as pure perfection, and while the majority of the population may only remember Jepsen as the \"Call Me Maybe\" girl, her cultural footprint is far greater than that of a one-hit wonder.\n\nBut the album also contains a particular emotion (*ahem*) often underdiscussed when considering Jepsen's appeal: earnest horniness.

        "description": "Suraya Mohamed | August 27, 2025\nThis stunning, tree-lined sidewalk at the edge of the Aspen Ideas Festival campus was the perfect location for this Field Recording. While it looked great, it was quiet for a very short time. Before the show, our team feared the sprinklers would spray our \u201cstage\u201d like they did during the set up.
