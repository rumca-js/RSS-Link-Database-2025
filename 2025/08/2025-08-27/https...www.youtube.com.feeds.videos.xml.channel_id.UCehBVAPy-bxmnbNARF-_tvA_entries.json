        "description": "Note: workers were interviewed during their off time, in their capacity as union organizers, and do not speak on behalf of the National Parks Service or federal government.\n\nWorkers in Yosemite and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks have voted to unionize\u2014and campaigns are underway at upwards of 100 more.\n\nThe parks have long been chronically understaffed. After losing even more workers, national parks employees are mobilizing to save the parks.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/UnionizeNPS\n-----\n\nMore Perfect Union is an Emmy-winning, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to build power for working people. Here\u2019s what that means: We report on the real struggles and challenges of the working class from a working-class perspective. We attempt to connect those problems to potential solutions. We report on the abuses and wrongdoing of corporate power. And we seek to hold accountable the ultra-rich who have too much power over America\u2019s political and economic systems.\n\n To support our independent journal",
