        "description": "MSNBC is collapsing in real time. Their desperate rebrand to \u201cMS Now\u201d is being sold as \u201cbreaking news,\u201d but it\u2019s really just another marketing ploy to mask a failing business model and a history of state-friendly propaganda. From praising Biden as \u201cthe sharpest tack\u201d to shilling for Big Pharma and global conglomerates, this network has long served elite interests, not the public. Legacy media is dying, and rather than reform, they double down with hollow rebrands. The real insurgency is independent media\u2014where truth isn\u2019t pre-chewed pap spoon-fed by corporations but uncovered, debated, and shared freely.\n[UNPACKED]\n\nGo to http://rumble.com/premium/brand and use code BRAND to save $10 on your annual subscription\n\nWATCH me LIVE Monday - Thursday on Rumble: https://bit.ly/russellbrand-rumble\n\nAll links: https://linktr.ee/RussellBrand",
