So, go to the app-store, search \u201cAdGuard\u201d,download it and enable all permissions. Then,head over to safari and type in one of these two: 24DRAMA - Free movie streaming site AniWatch - Free anime streaming site The free AdGuard plan is more than enough to block all ads,and ive personally used it to stream movies/anime onto my tv using airplay quite easily,and it really saves me tens of dollars yearly.
