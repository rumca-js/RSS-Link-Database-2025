By cleverly turning these poisons into a golden mineral once prized by Renaissance painters, the worm neutralizes the deadly threat and survives in one of Earth\u2019s most hostile habitats. Scientists say this unusual \u201cfighting poison with poison\u201d strategy could change how we think about life\u2019s resilience in extreme environments.",

Unlike traditional systems that rely on bulky moving parts, the Metafiber uses a tiny 3D nanoprinted hologram on a dual-core fiber to steer light by adjusting power between its cores. This enables seamless, continuous focus shifts over microns with excellent beam quality.",

Larger, long-tongued bees seek protein-rich pollen, while smaller, short-tongued species prefer carb- and fat-heavy sources. These dietary preferences shift with the seasons and colony life cycles, helping bees reduce competition, thrive together, and maintain strong colonies.",
