I think the two better options for me are:</p> <ul> <li>Avmatrix VC12-4K, which is an internal PCIe capture card, and it seems to have both official (although sketchy) and unofficial <a href=\"https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/AVMATRIX-VC12-4K-CAPTURE\">linux support</a>. It supports 4K60 for capture and <em>I think</em> 4K60 for passthrough</li> <li>Elgato 4K X. An external USB-C capture card, that supports UVC so I guess it should work fine on Linux.

Today, I&#39;ve been able to solve this problem and would like to make this guide to help people!

So my question is:<br/> what is the best linux distro to work with this GTX 1070 out of the box?<br/> I read a few posts that said that the drivers are not supported anymore and that there are some problems due to the GPU itself no being correctly exploited, i wonder if there is something new that would save me, as it is my working machine i need a distro that recognize my hardware out of the box, so the switch takes me the minimum possible time.<br/> Also, the distro needs to be the more &quot;professional&quot; possible so i can keep updating my softwares without problems.</p> <p>Any ideas ? </p> <p>Thanks,<br/> Paradoks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Paradok",
