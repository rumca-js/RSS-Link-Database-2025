Macedonian writer-director Teona Strugar Mitevska ticks down the days from seven to one and wrings a performance of flayed, hard-bitten intensity from Noomi Rapace, who marches down the corridors with a face full of fury. Rapace is a long way from her breakout role in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo; tonally, though, not so much. If Mother Teresa never goes so far as to set about the sisters with an axe, the sense that she might injects Mitevska\u2019s film with a pleasing dose of danger.</p><p>It is 1948, we\u2019re in the broiling heart of Kolkata and Sister Teresa has tired of her teaching role at the Loreto Entally convent. \u201cI\u2019m a woman in ",

But the line between inspiration and theft can easily become blurred</p><p>Last month, I wrote an article about<em> </em>being adopted by a British couple during the era of China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china-s-one-child-policy\">one-child policy</a>. Three days after the story ran in a <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/magazines/the-times-magazine/article/adopted-baby-china-missing-girls-pfw8wl3pg\">national newspaper</a>, my phone buzzed with a flurry of messages from a friend who had sent me a TikTok post by an influencer telling her life story to camera. Twenty seconds into her video, my jaw plummeted. She had recited entire sections of my article, word for word, to her 20,000 followers. She didn\u2019t even have the courtesy to give me a credit.</p><p>When I wrote that piece, the idea of exposing personal details of my life to scrutiny or criticism was terrifying.

Our experts have some predictions to share. </p><p><strong>Sergi\u00f1o Dest at PSV. </strong>The full-back has not only healed from the ACL injury that cut short his last campaign, but is off to a torrid start to the new Dutch season, with a pair of goals from the back-to-back champions\u2019 first three games. It\u2019s early, sure, but the 24-year-old is rested, confident and on a club where he doesn\u2019t have to do much defending during domestic games. Dest looks entirely capable of turning in another standout season like he did in 2019-20. That prompted Barcelona to buy him from Ajax to form their right flank with Lionel Messi. <strong>LS</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/27/usmnt-abroad-predictions-christian-pulisic-time-weah-gio-reyna-transfers\">Continue reading...</a>",

Manfred, as we\u2019ve learned, enjoys throwing ideas out into the universe to get his sport some easy pop while seeing how the masses will react. Just a few months back, he scrambled the brains of baseball fans with his idea of a \u201cgolden at bat\u201d, which would allow a chosen player to come to the plate, once a game, when it wasn\u2019t their turn to hit. Oh, he got his publicity alright: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/05/baseball-has-much-larger-problems-than-the-farcical-golden-at-bat\">many of us took the bait</a>.
