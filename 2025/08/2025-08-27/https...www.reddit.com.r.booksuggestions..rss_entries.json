This tends to get in the way of me trying to improve my life. I feel extreme remorse about a decision I made about my life, consequence of which is my current state of being. And being in this environment has made me mentally and physically ill. The mental stress has increased so much that I find it very hard to be productive. I will at some point start therapy but until I do that, I\u2019d like to read something that\u2019ll cheer me up and motivate me to go against all odds and achieve success.

The usual young adult reads. </p> <p>I know there&#39;s not a lot there, so I&#39;ll give you some movies I like too: Tron: Legacy, Sinners, The Birdcage (1996), The Fall (2006), Howl&#39;s Moving Castle. </p> <p>I&#39;ve always loved fantasy, so I think that&#39;s probably the best genre to start with.

It doesn&#39;t matter if the main character is a villain as well or on the hero side (or a neutral bystander). Spicy or not doesn&#39;t matter, neither does YA or Adult. Neither does gender (I am queer myself and read everything)</p> <p>My only big nope is that a lot of dark romances tend to have kinks and other scenes that I find triggering (I have nothing against people reading it, no worries, but I personally just can&#39;t) so preferably avoiding any type of abuse or kinks relating to pain or restrictions. No bullying either (though banter? That&#39;s definitely appreciated)</p> <p>Some books that I have already read are the Touch of Darkness series and Curse of the Thorn King.

I\u2019m absolutely in love with the world of psychology and with understanding more about behaviors, defense mechanisms, human reactions, and others along those lines.</p> <p>I usually just read articles about these topics or listen to podcasts, but now I want to read something interesting, written by someone who actually has real knowledge of the subject. One little thing though, english isn\u2019t my first language, and even though I\u2019ve read books in English before, it does take me longer, and probably with this type of subject, I\u2019ll probably take my sweet time as well.</p> <p>So, for my very first time starting out with this, I need some recommendations that are more beginner-friendly, something that doesn\u2019t use too many complicated terms. I\u2019m just re-starting to read now, ",

By the time i was in the 9th grade I completed all the Percy Jackson series as well. Then came my 10th boards and I lost my habit of reading all together. I tried a few self help books in the past few years but they were too boring for me to develop the habit of reading again. I think I should start with some fictional books again.

Her favorites are Six of Crows and The Cruel Prince so anything similar to these books (and age-appropriate) will be fantastic. She also loves science fiction, but well-written ones are a bit harder to find within her age group so YA sci-fi novel recommendations will also be greatly appreciated.</p> <p>When I talked with her, she seems to love stories with very emotional (somewhat sad, therefore memorable to her) themes, on top of the plots and characters found in novels like Six of Crows and The Cruel Prince. Please suggest anything and everything within this range that is also age-appropriate for a 16-year-old.
