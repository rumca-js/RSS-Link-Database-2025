        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Joined a private tracker service a month ago and has been going great but my stuff seeds extremely slow. After a quick search it makes sense, less people using private so less people leeching and I&#39;m competing with other people&#39;s seedboxes too. My question is, is there anyway at all the make it go any faster at all? I don&#39;t mind seeding my stuff for months but I want it to actually be doing something (had multiple torrents take over a week just to 1gb) and what would happen if I decide to delete the media for a torrent that hasn&#39;t done it&#39;s seeding yet? Will I be getting messaged by the Private Tracker service to keep my seeding going? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HotboxxHarold\"> /u/HotboxxHarold </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1n1vo3f/private_tracker_seeding_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torr",
