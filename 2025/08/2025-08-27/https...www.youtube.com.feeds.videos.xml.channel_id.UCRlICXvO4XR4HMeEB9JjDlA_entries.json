        "description": "A single black hole can outshine thousands of galaxies, yes, really. That glowing ring? Its accretion disk, slinging matter at nearly half the speed of light. Imagine a planet orbiting just beyond the event horizon \u2014 time there crawls tens of thousands of times slower than on Earth. In Interstellar, an hour on Miller\u2019s World was seven years back home. Considering life on Earth took 500 million years to appear, this unlucky exoplanet probably hasn\u2019t had a chance to evolve anything\u2026 yet. Black holes, time dilation, and cosmic oddities \u2014 mind-bending stuff, isn\u2019t it?",
