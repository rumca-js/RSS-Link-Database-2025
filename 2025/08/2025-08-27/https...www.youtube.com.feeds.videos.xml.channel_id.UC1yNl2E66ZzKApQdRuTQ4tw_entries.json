It is a quantum phenomenon that can exist only under certain circumstances. But a group of physicists recently published a study claiming they\u2019ve created the effects of entanglement without actually entangling the particles. Get your headache medicine ready, because we\u2019re about to take a look.\n\nPaper: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adr1794\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to refer",
