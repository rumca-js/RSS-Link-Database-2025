We&#39;re being acquired to become a major pillar in their portfolio, and there is practically no overlap anywhere. I was hired just earlier this year and worry about my job security. It will take nearly a year for everything to settle, but should I expect layoffs or job risks? It took me months to find my current job and now I worry I have to look again for a new one.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I advise reading this Google Threat Intelligence Group advisory on UNC6395 who is able to obtain OAUTH tokens for Salesloft Drift and then pivot using them to Salesforce instances and extract aws keys, passwords, snowflake access tokens, etc, which are stored on these corporate instances. Salesloft boasts 5000+ customers including names like Citrix, Shopify, 3M, IBM, and Stripe</p> <p>So basically the primary risk is for companies who use Salesloft and they should check whether they had unusual activity on Salesforce associated with their Drift connection. The advisory explains how to investigate.</p> <p>The secondary risk is that once UNC6395 obtains access tokens from customers of Salesloft, they can pivot to major data thefts. UNC6395 is unattributed but judging by the method I would assume they relate to Shiny Hunters / Scattered Spider which means they&#39;re very serious unfortunately. </p> <p>Advisory - <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/to",

I&#39;ve been studying cybersecurity for a while and I&#39;m kind of struggling as to which path I should choose. I got TryHackMe premium less than a month ago to learn SOC and I can&#39;t lie, it&#39;s genuinely the most boring thing ever. You&#39;re basically doing the same thing over and over again with Zeek, Brim, Snort, Wireshark, etc. I get that its for practice but its not very interesting to me. I&#39;ve also read about people getting &#39;alert fatigue&#39; and quitting due to stress and the effort it takes to be an SOC(probably higher than tier 1). I&#39;ve also studied pen testing and THM also has a &#39;path&#39; on that. But I don&#39;t know if I want to make the switch. Is SOC harder/more technical than pen testing? Also, if there&#39;s any working SOC or pen tester here, please can you tell me about what you do on a day to day basis? Doesn&#39;t have to",
