We used to have this old, super simple video chat app we loved back in the day. No frills, no corporate accounts, just a link and you were in. It felt like <em>our</em> private little corner of the internet.</p> <p>That app shut down years ago. Ever since, we&#39;ve been bouncing between Zoom (feels like a business meeting), Discord (too much going on), and FaceTime (one of us is on Android). Everything felt so bloated and impersonal.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, I had a crazy thought: &quot;What if I just... build our own?&quot;</p> <p>The only problem? <strong>I don&#39;t know how to code.</strong> Not really. My entire &quot;skillset&quot; is what I call &quot;vibe coding&quot; \u2013 basically, telling an AI editor like <strong>Cursor</strong> what I want and praying it understands me.</p> <p><strong>Phase 1: The Wall of Pain</strong></p>",

Either I\u2019m cursed, doing it wrong, or both - but it doesn\u2019t matter anymore.</p> <p>And you know what? It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve seen worse. But this hustle culture where you plan, build, market, and maintain everything alone? That\u2019s just too much. Screw it.</p> <p>Next time I build, I won\u2019t do it solo. I\u2019ll find a marketing partner and grind together.</p> <p>For those still pushing - I hope you get results. It didn\u2019t work for me, but it might for you. Love ya all:) </p> <p>As for me, I\u2019ll stick to what I do best: building. I know how, I love it,",

Yet, when you create a new dashboard you are given 300 free tokens that should be plenty to see all the features available for free.</p> <p>With this project, I wanted to address a fundamental problem with personal finance apps - the requirement to trust companies with your most sensitive financial data.

The result was insane.
