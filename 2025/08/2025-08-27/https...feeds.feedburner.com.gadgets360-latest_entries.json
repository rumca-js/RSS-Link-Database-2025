Researchers digitized old telescope records, finding the signal was about four times stronger than first thought, peaking at 250 Janskys. The recalculations also refined its frequency and sky location, ruling out man-made interference. While the true source remains uncertain, dense hydrogen clouds emitting natural maser signals are now leading candidates. Nearly 50 years later, the Wow! signal continues to puzzle astronomers worldwide.",

        "description": "Astronomers have achieved a major breakthrough by capturing the sharpest images of a solar flare ever recorded, using the National Science Foundation\u2019s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). Observed at the hydrogen-alpha wavelength during the decay of an X1.3-class solar flare, the images unveiled hundreds of ultra-fine coronal loops averaging just 48 kilometers wide, with some as narrow as 21 kilometers. Published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters, the findings suggest these slender loops may be the fundamental structures behind magnetic reconnection, the process that drives solar flares. The discovery not only advances understanding of solar physics but also holds promise for better predicting space weather events that can impact satellites, communications, and power systems on Earth.",
