        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A short while ago I published the latest iteration of Hound, an agent-based framework that tries to emulate human reasoning to find logic bugs in source code. This is the latest version that has been tested rudimentary. It is built mostly with smart contract analysis in mind, but is language agnostic - that said, it will probably not work well with large codebases yet (come sampling is not well-tested).</p> <p>Last year, an earlier version of this found a medium-risk bug in a project listed on Immunefi that paid $15k which was more than enough to pay for API costs! It also found 1/3 of the bugs in a Code4rena contest codebase.</p> <p>It does not come close to a human expert yet, but it&#39;s definitely an improvement from just copy/pasting the code into ChatGPT.</p> <p>Note that this is a research prototype so no guarantees that it works well across the board.</p> <p>Links</p> <p>- <a href=\"https://github.com/muellerberndt/hound\">Github repo</a></p> <",

See it restricts us from opening many of the needed urls ( not even AI agents are accessable) , Games are also blocked ( sometimes even steam doesnt work ) . I first thought of using a VPN but firewall blocks it , we just get a connection for few Seconds and disconnected, same happens when used proxies from network manager . Stealth VPNs work ( but i was thinking to make solution more elegant ). Also browser extension VPNs work somehow ( like turbo vpn on chromium ). If anyone can help then it will be amazing.</p> <p>operating system is Linux ( but open to solutions related to other OS).</p> <p>Also VPNs work on mobiles.</p> <p>edit:- On mobiles too only turbo vpn works. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheOnlyWoolly\"> /u/TheOnlyWoolly </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1n1ef61/bypass_dpi_on_dorms_wifi/\">[link]</a></spa",
