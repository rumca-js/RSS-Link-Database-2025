I&#39;m excited (and a little nervous!) to share the first version of <strong>Moose Reader</strong> with you all.</p> <p>The idea was to build an elegant, three-pane desktop reader that focuses purely on the reading experience without requiring any online accounts. All your feeds, articles, and settings are stored locally on your machine.</p> <p>Some of the features I&#39;ve built so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong>100% Local:</strong> No sign-up required. All your data stays with you.</li> <li><strong>Feed Management:</strong> Organize your feeds into collapsible folders.</li> <li><strong>Fetch Full Article:</strong> An integrated &quot;Fetch Full Article&quot; mode to clean up webpages, and the ability to save articles (with images) for offline reading.</li> <li><st",
