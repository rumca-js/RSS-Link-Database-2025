We built the first version in three days.</p> <p>Then reality hit: Windows-1252 encoding, European date formats, embedded newlines, phone numbers in five different formats.</p> <p>We rebuilt that importer multiples over the next six months. Our onboarding completion rate dropped 40% at the import step because users couldn&#39;t fix errors without starting over.</p> <p>The real problem isn&#39;t parsing (PapaParse is excellent). It&#39;s everything after: mapping &quot;Customer Email&quot; to your &quot;email&quot; field, validating business rules, and letting users fix errors inline.</p> <p>Flatfile and OneSchema solve this but won&#39;t show pricing publicly.
