If Celtic have deep regrets over misfires in Kazakhstan, Rangers endured a night of near-historic shame in Belgium, utterly incapable of recovering from the first\u2011leg performance. By contrast to this horror show, that night of blunder was a creditable showing. Russell Martin\u2019s team made it so simple for an admittedly high-class Brugge side.</p><p>On Martin the jury is out, his winless start to the domestic season followed by this nightmare. The former Southampton manager\u2019s stewardship is in grave danger after 10 games in charge. The response of the club\u2019s new 49ers ownership, for whom Martin was the first managerial appointment, is keenly awaited. The depths to which Rangers plunged, particularly in the first half, made a mockery of his continued self-belief, his proclamations that his is the only way forward.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/27/club-brugge-rangers-champions-league-playoff-second-",

All&nbsp;property is held in common and centrally rationed in \u201ca constantly recalibrating state of voluntary poverty\u201d; collectivity is so rigidly enforced that even the family unit is considered a potential threat, with youngsters periodically rehoused in different families. Women (\u201csisters\u201d) are assigned dowdy dresses in order to repress desire, and merely humming a tune is a guilty pleasure. This bleak way of life is rendered in a series of episodic dispatches, and the title character\u2019s inner life is imparted in a free indirect third person as she grapples with doubt, shame and boredom.</p><p>Ruth is knock-kneed and clumsy, prone to malingering an",

        "description": "<p>Enjoy Indian home cooking at its best with this vibrant curry and comforting spiced rice</p><p>Tomatoes are a staple in Indian cooking, bringing vibrant colour, tanginess, a little sweetness and depth to countless recipes. Their sheer versatility often helps bring a dish together, while their natural acidity balances spices beautifully. Firm ripe tomatoes are essential in cooking, because they hold their texture better, release only just enough juice without turning mushy, and also provide that crucial balance between sweet and sour. Today\u2019s two dishes are prime examples of Indian home cooking and comfort food at its best.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/27/romy-gills-recipes-for-indian-style-tomatoes\">Continue reading...</a>",
