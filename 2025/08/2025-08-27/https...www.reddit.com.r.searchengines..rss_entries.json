It lets you instantly see results from Reddit, TikTok, and LLMs, side-by-side, so you get different perspectives and actual user opinions, not just SEO-optimized sites and ads.<br/> It\u2019s been a serious time-saver, especially for things like product research or figuring out trending topics. One catch: after talking with the team, it sounds like Navo will be moving to a paid model because they\u2019re running things with LLMs, similar to Perplexity but focused more on media/social content.<br/> Has anyone else tried it? I\u2019m also curious, what other tools or workflows are people using to surface community answers and avoid the usual junk sites or endless affiliate blogs?<br/> Would love other suggestions (free or paid).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Waste_System_7116\"> /u/Waste_System_7116 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
