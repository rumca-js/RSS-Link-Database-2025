So we have to talk about it. Will Smith is faking his audience. Zohran Mamdani is promising New Yorkers free stuff if they only elect him. Problem is plenty of places have already tried that, and it has failed miserably. A Cuban-born businessman, Joseph Hernandez, decided to run against Mamdani. Hernandez knows the dangers of a socialist government and doesn\u2019t want to see it happen in America. But, is it really a surprise when American celebrities and politicians alike have been propping Cuba up as an example of socialism?</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"rumble\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://rumble.com/embed/v6vy9zk/?pub=4430ut\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div><p><strong>BREAKING: MINNEAPOLIS CHURCH SHOOTING</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://web.archive.",
