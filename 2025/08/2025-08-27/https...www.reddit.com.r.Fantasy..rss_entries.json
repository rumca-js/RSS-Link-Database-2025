I\u2019ve also been back and forth on like The Martian and Children of Time or Ender\u2019s Game. Also maybe \u201cHave Space Suit Will Travel?

More chaotic and piled up, but that sort of vibe. If I had a bazillion bucks to make a show that will certainly go way over budget and have a tiny audience that would be it.</p> <p>I love the idea of a shared worlds and authors writing in them. It creates a really interesting mosaic and the short story format is great because I don&#39;t have to commit to a 12 volume epic fantasy (or more) with a cast of thousands. I don&#39;t have time for that these days.</p> <p>I also loved the Wild Card&#39;s series when I was younger as well.</p> <p>Are there any other times that authors have created similar anthologies, in any genre really using a similar format that are worth reading?

I&#39;ve noticed the fewer the reviews, the more likely it is to have a higher average rating. And I got to wondering if people tend to give more favorable reviews when it&#39;s a less known title, are more likely to DNF and thus not rate it, etc. This skepticism of minimal-review ratings hit its peak with a book I struggled to get through having a 4+ rating (with ~250 ratings on goodreads). I then started thinking about how my personal rating values have evolved over time and how it varies compared to others I&#39;ve seen explain their rating systems.</p> <p>So...</p> <ul> <li><strong>What is your thought process when deciding on a rating?</strong></li> <li><strong>Do you break it down into categories beyond an overall rating? (IE - 5/5 plot, 4/5 writing = 4.5 overall)</strong></li> <li><strong>Do you have a fairly rigid scale?",

Maybe evil has already significantly triumphed. Maybe the whole place is cynical and there\u2019s only different shades of muddy gray. But the story isn\u2019t about that, it\u2019s about the persistence of hope in a better world or better piece of it, in carving out a space for decency and goodness. Critically, for me, this has to not be about the nobility of the futile struggle or as an object of scorn or cynicism. Successful or not, but ideally successful, the struggle has to be potentially fruitful, not doomed and futile from the outset. The Second Apocalypse examines this, but the answer is a resounding no. </p> <p>There are lots of save-the-world variants, from Kelsier and company in Mistborn before it gets complicated",
