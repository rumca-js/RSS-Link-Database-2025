Applications are well-organized, the system settings are beginner-friendly, and the out-of-the-box software selection makes it easy to get started without much setup.</p> <p>That said, privacy concerns are something I can\u2019t ignore. Deepin has previously faced criticism regarding data collection and telemetry, and while improvements have been made over the years, some users still remain cautious. For someone who just wants a beautiful, easy-to-use Linux system, it\u2019s a great choice. But for those who value transparency and absolute control over privacy, it might not be the best option for a primary operating system.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rjkush17\"> /u/rjkush17 </a> <b",
