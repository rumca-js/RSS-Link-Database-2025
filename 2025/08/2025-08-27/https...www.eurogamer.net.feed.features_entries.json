It's a cross-platform live service game to its core, and it drops you into a shared open-world map with up to 150 other skaters. And, as you might expect from all these things being name-checked, my first half hour with the game involved trying to understand a muddle of regular unlocks, an in-game currency, a levelling system, a fast travel system and various other bits of UI shenanigans.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-2025-interview\">Read more</a></p>",

It's the whole foundation, the beating heart of the music that underpins everything else the song has to offer. That slick riff that comes in before the chorus wouldn't land as well without some nice syncopated bass notes to make it soar. The drum fills wouldn't feel as at home in the transitions without the bass to glue them to the rest of the beat. Even vocal melodies, when orchestrated properly, are elevated by a nice, recognisable and reliable bass line.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/15-years-later-scott-pilgrim-ex-proves-that-torontos-most-problematic-bass-player-has-what-it-takes-to-become-beat-em-up-royalty-in-2025\">Read more</a></p>",

It's the hard strikes and the proximity to magic, sure, but it's also something else. A ninja moves with a particular lightness. No need for a foley artist to mix in footsteps, because when these characters move it's as is icing sugar is being dusted over the soft earth. So there's a lovely contradiction at the heart of it. Cor, it hurts when one of these people kicks you through a wall, but cor, they're so nimble and and deft and precise - so gentle - you kind of have to forgive them for everything.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/with-shinobi-art-of-vengeance-lizardcube-gives-that-pixel-perfect-16-bit-streets-of-rage-4-treatment-to-another-sega-classic\">Read more</a></p>",
