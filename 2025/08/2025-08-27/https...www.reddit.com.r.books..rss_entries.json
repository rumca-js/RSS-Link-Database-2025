I don&#39;t remember the book being referenced, I only registered it because I had just read The Road, and I noticed the author didn&#39;t use them. *I know The Road is an older book. </p> <p>I haven&#39;t taken an English or writing course since college.

I have what they call aphantasia and I always suspected this is why I hated reading. This and that I do not have an internal monologue. As it turns out as much as having those things would make reading nice I realized I just needed to find a different way to connect to these books. Emotional connection. I may not be able to imagine the characters or narrate in my head like others but I do have a strong ability to connect to books on another level.

The story is cute and charming, and it features my current favorite theme of a dark, almost uncaring world with caring people trying to use kindness to make a difference.

It&#39;s not just the small cute New England towns in Hallmark Christmas specials, and shows a lot of the current struggles from a kids perspective pretty well.

I never hear any male friends talk about books with sex and I can\u2019t even remember reading any myself with a hardcore sex scene in my whole adult life. - ASOIA",
