The highway scene is one for the books. </p> <p>Steve Martin&#39;s writing gives us plenty of zingers that are genuinely funny, Heather Grahame is likably dumb as an aspiring actress willing to do anything to get ahead, Christine Baranski is hilarious as an aging actress who can&#39;t wait to get into Kit&#39;s pants and Robert Downey Jr in a small but instantly cameo as a movie executive. </p> <p>I don&#39;t know this isn&#39;t referenced just as much as Tropic of Thunder.

Here is one of them. I want to see wondrous sights not available in the real world, in stories where myth and dreams are set free to play. Animation opens that possibility, because it is freed from gravity and the chains of the possible. Realistic films show the physical world; animation shows its essence. Animated films are not copies of &#39;real movies,&#39; are not shadows of reality, but create a new existence in their own right.&quot;</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",

Matthew Libatique, Aronofsky\u2019s constant and brilliant cinematographer, makes the city glittery bright outside and the look is vibrant even in the dingy bar. Caught Stealing is an anomaly, a dark soap bubble of an entertainment.
