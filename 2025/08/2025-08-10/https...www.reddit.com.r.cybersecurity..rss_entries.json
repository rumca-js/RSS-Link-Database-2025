How do 1811 cyber-focused jobs compare to 2210 positions regarding cybersecurity responsibilities? What types of jobs exist under each classification? Are there any firsthand accounts from people working these roles that describe their typical day? How much real cybersecurity work do FBI special agent roles include compared to 2210 jobs?
