If I have a docker server running a few containers, mostly internal services like PiHole or HA etc, but also a couple of services like Emby that have external access into the service (ie family can log into my Emby server to watch stuff).</p> <p>Just to note the Emby container here is setup as per Emby\u2019s official guide, no custom 3rd party Emby container.</p> <p>What is the likelihood of someone accessing Emby remotely being able to break out of that container and get exposed to either the raw server my stack is on or other containers.
