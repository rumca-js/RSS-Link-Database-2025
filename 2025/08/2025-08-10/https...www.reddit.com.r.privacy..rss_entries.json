How much do I need to worry about my personal/professional data being harvested from emails I send to others when they are using personal AI assistants to manage their inbox? I don&#39;t use any such applications myself, and have been forever cautious about any digital communication containing sensitive data. Only recently, with more and more people using personal AI assistants, have I become concerned that my data privacy is only as secure as the email recipients&#39;.</p> <p>Sorry if I am late to the party for this specific concern.

Trading212 and Moneybox and Monzo seem to work out of the box, but I was irked by the verification process of recording myself while saying a phrase for verification. Natwest occasionally requires my face when sending payments to new individuals.

From the very beginning she found odd things happening around her little duplex. For starters when she turns on her bathroom exhaust fan during certain times at night she can hear music. The same time every single night. Even when no one was living next door. Then, when she moved in, they came in and moved the smoke detector from above the door to the corner of the room right next to her bed. She spoke with a neighbor and they did that in their unit as well. That was a major red flag for her so she took the smoke detector off the wall and took it down to the police station but the only way they could tell if it was bugged was if they broke it open. She didn&#39;t want to have to explain why it needed replaced to the senior facility so she just put it back up and left it alone. At first I thought she was just being paranoid as this is",

The cobalt qube for example. Quick to set up web server, commerce platform, email, forums, etc.... all ready to go in one little box.</p> <p>I personally self host a number of things to get away from the cloud and the software for them has gotten easier and more powerful year by year. Immich, nextcloud, vaultwarden, etc.....</p> <p>I&#39;m curious if anyone is aware of any work to produce a turnkey system ready to go for less technical person who&#39;s interested in moving their data back &quot;in house&quot;? Something that integrates all those things into one box you sit on your desk that contains the bulk of your online presence? Something that provides a federation node for the fediverse plus image and document hosting, passwords, etc?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",
