I\u2019ve always liked when a romance was a subplot to a novel, but I never went out of my way to read a full-blown romance story.</p> <p>But I took a dive into the genre, and I am liking some of the books I\u2019ve read (which is not many).</p> <p>My thing is that I don\u2019t want a lot of smut \u2014 not that I mind smut, but I love slow burn romances, yearning, and overall buildup/development. Not the kind of plots where it\u2019s right off the bat physicality.</p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions for a newbie that\u2019s still getting her toes wet in the romance genre?

So basically they\u2019re about finding your way through life,forming friendships, relationships usually unhealthy, feeling lost about what you want to do,letting go of things and basically real life struggles and the stories are mostly bittersweet if not downright sad( i dont mind reading happy endings infact i\u2019d love it). Also in the story we get to know the flaws of characters and how they get through with them.

I am not an avid fiction reader, though I do read non fiction (mostly academics and also some self help) extensively. But after getting to know the various perks of reading fiction over non fiction (which I believe are true by the little experience I have), I have decided to get into fiction finally.<br/> So to start, I think it would be better for me to read something that can teach me topics like politics, strategy, economics, diplomacy and/or psychology with a good story and character-building. It would be ideal if a book contains a blend of more than two or three of these topics. But I would highly appreciate any combination.<br/> I have recently started Crime and Punishment (due to Dostoevsky&#39;s insight into the human mind). And I was wondering if people here can recommend me something that matches my taste. I like books that inspire great ideas, or even trivial ideas in an impactful way. Than",

I currently have a client on the older end of the age range who loves murder mysteries and books like Caraval and The Guest List. I want to make a book list for her for books she should try reading. She really struggles with relating to people and she and I got to know each other through talking about books so I thought this would be a really nice thing to give her. Please recommend some good books! Doesn\u2019t have to be just murder mysteries it can be anything you think she should try!
