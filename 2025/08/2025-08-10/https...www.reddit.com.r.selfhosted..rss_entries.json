This means going through each account in your vault and changing the password and any stored 2FA seed after the migration is complete.</p> <p>The reason is simple. If your old encrypted vault was ever copied or accessed on the cloud service, anyone with that copy could try to crack it offline. Even if the encryption is strong, a weak or reused master password increases the risk. By rotating credentials after you have moved them into your self-hosted vault, you make any old copy of the vault useless.</p> <p>This is a lot of work and for many people it might make sense to start with the most important accounts such as email, financial accounts, cloud services and anything that could be used to pivot into other logins.

This new version brings some powerful new ways to organize and process your audio.</p> <p>The highlight of this release is a new Advanced Tagging System. You can now create tags (e.g. <code>meeting</code>, <code>lecture</code>, <code>personal-note</code>) and assign them to your recordings. The cool thing is that each tag can have its own custom summary prompt or language and speaker settings. So a &#39;meeting&#39; tag can be configured to create a summary based on action items, while a &#39;lecture&#39; tag can create study notes. You can also stack multiple tags for example for meetings with Company A or Company B.</p> <p>To make this more useful, you can now <strong>export your summaries and notes directly to a .docx Word file</strong>,",
