It\u2019s easy to overcommit and feel pressured to constantly produce content, but this can lead to exhaustion. One approach that has worked for me is setting clear boundaries on my work hours and sticking to a schedule. Tools like Waffilo can help in planning your content ahead of time, allowing for breaks without sacrificing visibility. I also find it beneficial to prioritize quality over quantity; focusing on fewer, well-thought-out posts can be more impactful. Remember to engage with your audience authentically, even if it\u2019s less frequent. How do you manage your engagement without stretching yourself too thin? What strategies have you found helpful for maintaining a good work-life balance on your projects?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/waffilo\"> /u/waffilo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

This is a story from a few years ago about one of my old side projects. No ChatGPT was used writing this post :p</p> <p>About four years ago I had an idea. A website where players could complete tasks and get Roblox rewards in return. Simple in theory. Sites like AdGate and AyeTstudios already had &quot;offer walls&quot; where users do something for a reward. Download an app and reach level 20 in 3 days, for example. The app gets a player, AdGate takes a cut, we take a cut, and the user gets a payout. In our case, the payout was robux.</p> <p>Now robux is the Roblox currency and there is a whole black market for it. We could buy it for 3 to 5 dollars per 1000 robux, while Roblox sells it for 10 dollars per 1000. Users completing offers earned us about 30 dollers per 1000 robux we paid out. Meaning we were making 25 dollars in profit per 1000 robux earned.</p> <p>There was no public ",
