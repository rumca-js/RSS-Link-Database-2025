Arch has a healthy number of spinoffs like EndeavourOS, Manjaro and Garuda. Fedora on the other hand barely has any true forks. Outside of niche projects like Qubes OS, Berry Linux and NST, most variants are just official Spins or remixes.</p> <p>The main reasons seem to be the short lifecycle of Fedora releases, which only get about 13 months of support, the fast pace of change where new technologies like systemd defaults, filesystem changes and SELinux enforcement land early, and the fact that Fedora serves as Red Hat\u2019s upstream testing ground. People who want a Fedora-like experience but with long-term stability usually go to RHEL clones like Rocky or Alma instead. Many desktop or niche needs are already covered by Fedora\u2019s own Spins and Labs, and Red Hat\u2019s trademark rules add extra work for anyone making a true fork.</p> <p>Debian moves slowly and ",

This guy didn\u2019t just create Linux \u2013 he built an open-source ecosystem that revolutionized software, empowered countless developers, and paved the way for the internet to be as open as it is today.</p> <p>We all take for granted how easily we can run software, contribute to code, or access platforms that rely on Linux, like servers, Android devices, and more. But just imagine a world without Linus\u2019 vision. We might still be stuck in proprietary systems, with less flexibility, fewer opportunities for innovation, and much more centralized power in the hands of tech giants.</p> <p>Linus might not be as public-facing as other tech figures, but his contribution to the world of open-source development has been absolutely massive. I really think we should feel lucky to have experienced the growth of Linux firsthand. Who else feels the same?<",

Is it for better and more precise CPU handling?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sangaricus\"> /u/Sangaricus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1mm7axl/amd_pstate_cpu_frequency_changes_in_the_kernel/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1mm7axl/amd_pstate_cpu_frequency_changes_in_the_kernel/\">[comments]</a></span>",
