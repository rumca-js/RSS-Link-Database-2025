They\u2019re also free, and maintaining a browser isn\u2019t exactly cheap, I think. Is it purely about funding sources and transparency, or do they just have better PR? Are they truly better at protecting data, or is it just a perception thing?</p> <p>I used Chrome for years, then switched to Edge after it kept my favorite extensions alive. Now I\u2019m rethinking privacy and even considering switching search engines (suggestions are welcome). I like Brave on my phone, but I\u2019m still not sure. <",

I notice that whenever Firefox has a new update and you continue to use the older one, it becomes complete crap. I know how apps become unstable when you disregard updates. I have been on the net for 25 years. However, with FF, it breaks to the point where you can not click links, scroll up and down, or even close it through normal means.</p> <p>No other browser does this. I&#39;ve been through 7 CPUs since the 90&#39;s and countless others from various people&#39;s, some even having day one explorer, Samsung browsers, and they function fine.
