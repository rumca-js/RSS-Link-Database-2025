        "description": "\"Woodeneye\" is the first single to be released from the long-awaited Cardiacs album, LSD - which is out next month. It's built on the work of the late Tim Smith, who died in 2020. Cardiacs will always hold a special place for me - they helped me navigate a difficult time. So I was interested to see how they finished this - their final album and what Tim had started so long ago..\n\nTo come and see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #musicreview #cardiacs",
