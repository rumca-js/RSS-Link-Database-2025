But it tends to give constant false positives when scanning ports or IPs when they&#39;re external (on the general WAN; due to how the VM&#39;s hypervisor handles traffic). So what&#39;s the standard then? You have to use Bridge if you want accuracy, right? And then you isolate through SSH or VPN to VPS, and maybe even a USB network adapter passthrough directly to the VM? </p> <p>So NAT isn&#39;t really viable for real scenarios, is that it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FewOffice1998\"> /u/FewOffice1998 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1mmq5zf/nat_on_vms/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1mmq5zf/nat_on_vms/\">[comments]</a></span>",
