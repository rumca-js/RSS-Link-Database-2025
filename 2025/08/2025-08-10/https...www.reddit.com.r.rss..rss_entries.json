The issue is I&#39;m unsure how to configure it. Ideally, I&#39;d like the app to send me notifications for every new One Piece chapter, and discovering an RSS feed that alerts me to every UFC event would be fantastic. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. I use Feeder; it&#39;s the only one that delivers instant notifications.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gust-01\"> /u/gust-01 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1mm6si5/i_dont_know_how_to_use_rss/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1mm6si5/i_dont_know_how_to_use_rss/\">[comments]</a></span>",
