But I&#39;ve been thinking or wondering about this for years now and never actualy tried asking anyone else.</p> <p>So, the 3 private trackers im a member of all have something in the rules regarding how many IP addresses can be used under account at one time or something similar. They also have strict rules about sharing the .torrent files to anyone else other than the registered account user. All that makes sense. It wouldnt be much of a private anything if eeryone shared .torrents to everyone and would place us in the same boat as shady trackers and distribution sites. </p> <p>Now I&#39;ve always assumed that they can track this-not the tracking as in the download and <em>tracker</em> stuff... Im talking about tracking the .torrent file as in who downloaded it and where it came from and so on (if possible). I dont know exactly how they do it but given the rules I assume they must be able to do it somehow. ",

So, I want to preserve as many blu ray releases of Indian movies as possible, given that the blu rays themselves are no longer available and with the google drive storage limit a few years back, all the available torrents seem to have dies out. I&#39;m currently at a loss for sites as well. Ive tried all the usual sites but no luck. The only movies i got in full remux quality were Kaithi, Bahubali and Mankatha, if you know the names. These production houses do not care about preserving their movies and i would like to keep a copy of the movies as i have pretty fond childhood memories of them. </p> <p>A lot of these movies are not available in streaming services anymore and a lot of them are actually self -censored due to the growing censorship in the indian subcontinent and the original version is only present in the dvd or the blu ray releases. I know Japan has some blu ray releases but they will also dry out due to limited quantity production. S",
