I came back from Gen Con with the Essential Starter so I'll talk about that, and of course I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made ANOTHER game! Check out Reign in Iron - miniatures-agnostic robot vs. demon skirmish combat at http://www.reigninirongame.com\n\nI'm a member of The Army Painter Factory Team - and I'm passing the savings on to you!
