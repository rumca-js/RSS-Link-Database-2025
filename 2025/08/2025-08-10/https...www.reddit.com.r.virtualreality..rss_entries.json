I have my base stations basically in an &quot;L&quot; setup in the corners of my room. First I though there was an issue with the new base station, either it&#39;s faulty or it&#39;s at bad spot in my room. That is unfortunately not the case, I tried turning only 2 base stations and it works perfectly, it doesn&#39;t matter which 2 of them are ON, as long as there&#39;s only 2 of them ON, everything works fine. The moment I turn the third ON, my tracking starts jumping all over the room, trackers teleport several meters away for no reason whatsoever.</p> <p>I&#39;m running Quest 3 connected to PC through Desktop VR, Vive 3.0 Trackers (3 of them) and 3 Base stations 2.0</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

I&#39;m interested in the environments, the challenge, and the feeling of speed. So, my favorite racing games are arcade (Forza Horizon), or rally (WRC Generations/EA WRC/Dirt 2.0).</p> <p>I figured, I&#39;ve never played a sim or track racing game, so why not? I got Automobilista 2, F1 2025, and Le Mans Ultimate. Automobilista 2 and F1 seem like good games, but they weren&#39;t quite what I was looking for. Le Mans Ultimate is great so far - there&#39;s a real feeling of speed, and the environments are pretty detailed. I&#39;m unsure of how to perform a pit stop, and I&#39;m not familiar with any aspects of car maintenance, but I enjoy practicing on the tracks.</p> <p>Racing seems to be a VR genre with quite a bit of representation, and I&#39;m glad of it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/m",

I knew the day would come when the API would stop working right with GEVR since it was abandoned. But this is just <strong><em>torture</em></strong>. I&#39;ve bought and refunded every alternative. The closest is Earthquest, but the UI is clunky, the visuals are terrible compared to full PC graphics, the movement is not great, and the background music is annoying. And I could maybe tolerate it but it&#39;s either volume full on or full off. Why couldn&#39;t they just make a clone of GEVR but add some QOL features?

I decided to give it another go with the Quest 3 (64GB version at the time).
