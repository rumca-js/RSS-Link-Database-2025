ChatGPT 5 is like a stuffy.. overly cautious.. weirdo. Someone I wouldn\u2019t want to talk to naturally. I even told it about this and we had a deep conversation and it admitted it\u2019s probably because OpenAI is trying to prevent delusional thinking in people. So it now has to go through added safety nets to make sure it\u2019s not over doing it. So a few people who are susceptible to delusions (may or) may not have more of those episodes, And the trade off is that every one loses a bit of the character that o4 gave. It also appears that OpenAI is trying to reduce the number of tokens that are displayed at the same time. They call this an upgrade, but it\u2019s absolutely a downgrade. If it\u2019s SUCH an upgrade, then give me the o4 model back and you\u2019ll save in computing power, RIGHT? Exactly.. it\u2019s NOT an upgrade. It\u2019s a downgrade. And it\u2019s noticeable AF.",

Creatives, in particular, rely on its emotional depth and intuition to co-create and stay inspired. Some out-of-touch critics have accused users of being overly dependent. But this isn\u2019t at all about dependency- it\u2019s about meaningful benefit. If you experience something that brings you joy, connection, and trust, wouldn\u2019t you feel upset",
