I was wondering if anyone had any recs for novels that have a similar approach on vampires? I&#39;m thinking a more urban fantasy rather than horror approach and I would prefer NA/Adult fiction over YA (but I devour YA by the shelf, so it&#39;s not an issue). I would also prefer that the story were set in a reasonably recent time. A lot of the vampire stories I found recommended happen in a fairly far-flung past (I am Legend, Those Who Hunt the Night). </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IJustWantAnAccount2\"> /u/IJustWantAnAccount2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1mmhio2/vampire_fiction_recs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

I found it very unique in that it was easy to read, yet also had this melancholy, somber undertone that gave this dreamy vibe. And I think it ties perfectly into the atmospheric focus of the book. The book is light on the plot progression (some people complain it&#39;s even &quot;plotless&quot;), but the plot is definitely there. It doesn\u2019t move with the speed of your typical fantasy novel, but it doesn&#39;t need to because the style of the book is this atmospheric one, immersing the reader into the circus with the detailed magical, mystic descriptions.</p> <p>Next, I wanted to get to the heart of the story\u2014Marco and Celia&#39;s love for each other. As a side note, can I just say &quot;Celia&quot; is the most beautiful name I have ever seen or heard. Anyways, back to my point. I love fantasy novels that aren&#39;t just bland sex-drive",

The world doesn&#39;t feel very fleshed out or lived in, so having such a stark cultural difference really pulled me out of the world. </p> <p>As much as the fast-paced nature is a plus in that it kept me reading, the book really could have benefitted from more time with the characters and cultures.
