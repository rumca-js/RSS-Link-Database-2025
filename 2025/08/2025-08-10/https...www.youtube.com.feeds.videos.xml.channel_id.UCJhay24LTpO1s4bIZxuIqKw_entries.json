Google uses a mono-repo because once you have solved the hurdles it makes you massively more efficient. However, you first have to use an appropriate build system. A build system that is programmed in a reasonable language (let's call it \"limited\" Python) as opposed to incomprehensive text manipulation (autotools, cmake).\n\nBut more importantly, Bazel allows you to reproduce all your build - and - Bazel allows you to cache you builds. Generally, Bazel will result in massive compilation time speedups, not only for C++, but for all the stuff you do. All this is done with incredible amount of flexibility and correctness, after all it's kind of Python.\n\nYou just have to get started.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJoin think-cell as a C++ Developer and work on cutting-edge challenges with a focus on code excellence, innovation, and working a",
