        "description": "A visionary plan proposes sending a paperclip-sized spacecraft, powered by Earth-based lasers, to a nearby black hole within a century. Led by astrophysicist Cosimo Bambi, the mission would test the limits of general relativity and explore the mysteries of event horizons. While current technology can t yet achieve it, advancements in nanocraft design, laser propulsion, and black hole detection could make the journey possible within decades, potentially rewriting the laws of physics as we know them.",
