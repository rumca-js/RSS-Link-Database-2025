        "description": "It's been a rather wild year when it comes to video game pricing. Nintendo, of all companies, took the plunge into $80 pricing, but some of the best games have varied in price from $19.99 to $69.99. However, it's interesting to see one segment consistently deliver in quality. We're, of course, talking about titles priced at $49.99.\n\nWhether it's fun co-op titles, story-focused role-playing games or even massive Souls-likes, the segment feels like the perfect balance between value for money and quality. Mafia: The Old Country is another great example, combining great storytelling with a linear campaign and excellent production quality.\n\nMaybe it's because the segment allows for more experimentation while providing just enough triple-A-esque goodness (without diving too deep into microtransaction hell). Perhaps they deliver more value than their asking price. Either way, $49.99 titles are seemingly here to stay, and we couldn't be happier.",

        "description": "Hell Is Us, developed by Rogue Factor, is an upcoming action-adventure title that combines a unique premise with an old-school approach to its gameplay. It does away with tried and tested navigational assistance that modern games offer players, instead encouraging a more organically unfolding journey through the war-torn lands of Hadea. \n\nYou will need to keep your eyes peeled and your ears open for clues about your objectives while also tackling obscure side quests and environmental puzzles with little to no help from the in-game systems. With terrifying enemies to take on and a whole lot of secrets and lore to discover, Remi's journey of discovery is sure to bring a revolutionary experience to the table when it releases this September.",
