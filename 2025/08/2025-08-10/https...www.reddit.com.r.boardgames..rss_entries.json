Obviously, as it can only be played one time, this is an issue.</p> <p>First copy I bought, as soon as I opened it, I saw the cards all punched out and the sticker sheet had half the stickers removed. I exchanged it for another copy. </p> <p>This one has a full sticker shee. However there might be another issue. There&#39;s a small box inside that has some wooden rods sticking out of it. If I remember ticket, the first one I got had all sticks in it. I don&#39;t remember exactly though. This one, the right most stick is out. The box clearly says on it, do not do anything with the box until told to do so.</p> <p>My question is, is the stick supposed to be out? If it&#39;s supposed to be in, can I just stick it back in or will it mess up some",

Maybe I don\u2019t see the hype or understand the appeal but the only thing that I can see with it is that in theory a neoprene mat avoids things like the cardboards artwork tearing or getting damage overtime and for that I think it\u2019s valid. But since I\u2019m almost never under any risk of damaging my components since I\u2019m so dedicated with being careful with them it hardly seems worth it. Also as a board gamer who loves the textural aspect of components I absolutely will always take having a big cardboard mat over something neoprene simply for the feeling of the cardboard over the feeling of the neoprene. I know it\u2019s very subjective I\u2019m just genuinely curious what other people\u2019s thoughts are. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",

Both resulted in meaningful change and there was much rejoicing (by some.)</p> <p>One of the criticisms raised about the CGE boycott was that it was performative as people would not also boycott Admodee who apparently releases many more Harry Potter games. It immediately raised questions for me. Why not boycott Asmodee? Was it because I thought only a smaller company could be pressured? Was it because it seemed hopeless? Was it because I didn\u2019t think enough people would join to make a difference? Was it indeed because I thought that only a small publisher could/would be \u201cbullied\u201d?</p> <p>In our case it was because neither I nor my husband were familiar enough with Asmodee\u2019s lib",

I recently came across the Kinfire Delve dungeon crawling board game and it caught my interest. A little research and I found out there&#39;s a large (and expensive) board game called Kinfire Chronicles, which definitely looks up our alley.</p> <p>For those who have experienced both, how do they compare? I guess we&#39;re particularly interested in how fun you think they are, the world-building, story, and complexity/setup. I&#39;d really like an informed opinion before buying an over $100 board game lol</p> <p>Also, if folks have any info on the Delve games or the new Council, that&#39;d be great too!

One of the base game ships has gone walkabout. Seller is adamant he didn&#39;t get it in the box, but I have all the cards for it. Can I buy one from somewhere? I emailed oomm, but they could take a week to get back to me, according to the automated ticket reply. 2. Best place to get expansions? I can only find them on US ebay, I&#39;m not paying shipping thats more than the item ( UK based). 3. I really want to sleeve the cards, what are the sizes I need to order/ quantity etc. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PJTheFellHanded\"> /u/PJTheFellHanded </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mm8n7t/stars_of_akarios_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mm8n7t/stars_",

Photoshop felt like overkill, Canva wasn\u2019t built for games, and most \u201ccard maker\u201d tools were either outdated or too restrictive.</p> <p>So I built Deckato \u2014 a web app just for tabletop and TCG creators. Even if you have zero design experience, you can still make professional-looking cards by dragging and dropping elements in the editor. It comes with ready-to-use assets, or you can bring in your own artwork.</p> <p>You can also import from a spreadsheet to create an entire deck in minutes, and export print-ready files without worrying about sizes or bleed margins. My goal was to make something simple enough for a casual creator, but flexible enough for someone making a full commercial game.</p> <p>Would love to hear what you think.</p> <p>site: <a href=\"http://deckato.com/\">deckato.com</a></p> <p><strong>For anyone who wants to",

I loved the look and feel I got from seeing them at a distance but the crowds were too big for me to squeeze in and talk with anyone. All of the games just looked awesome and had a strong dark fantasy vibe to them I think. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/trebor5529\"> /u/trebor5529 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mm462z/gen_con_2025_booth/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mm462z/gen_con_2025_booth/\">[comments]</a></span>",
