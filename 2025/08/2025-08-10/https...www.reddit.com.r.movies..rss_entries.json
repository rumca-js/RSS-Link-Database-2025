For me, it may not be quite at that high of a level but I did enjoy it a lot.</p> <p>I also seem to have had the wrong idea of what this movie is actually about - I was under the impression that this would mostly be just about a sordid affair guy between a young guy and an older woman, but really it&#39;s a character study of one of the most obnoxious and self-absorbed protagonists I&#39;ve come across in a while. The affair is really just a side effect of that.</p> <p>Dustin Hoffman is pretty fantastic as Benjamin Braddock, and it&#39;s equally compelling and aggravating to see him go from being this privileged, overachieving, successful young man everyone loves to being an obsessive, borderline stalker. The affair with Mrs. Robinson, which made the movie so iconic, is a surprisingly small part of the movie. It gets to the essence of who Ben is, ",
