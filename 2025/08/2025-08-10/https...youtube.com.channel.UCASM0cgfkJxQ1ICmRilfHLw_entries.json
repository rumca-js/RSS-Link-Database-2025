Explore Tailor Store's made-to-order collection and embrace quality, custom fit, and zero waste \u27a1\ufe0f https://www.tailorstore.com/patrickboyle\n\nTesla\u2019s sales are falling across the globe\u2014from the UK to China to California. So why did the board just hand Elon Musk a $29 billion pay package? In this video, we break down the contradictions at the heart of Tesla\u2019s current moment: collapsing demand, the Cybertruck debacle, the robotaxi fantasy, and a boardroom that seems more loyal to Musk than to shareholders.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore:\n\nWhy Tesla\u2019s fundamentals are weakening\nHow Musk\u2019s pay compares to other CEOs\nThe governance crisis behind the headlines\nWhether Tesla is still a growth company\u2014or just a cult stock\nThis isn\u2019t just about one company. It\u2019s about how corporate governance is bending under the weight of celebrity, and what happens when hype outpaces performance.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDeriv",
