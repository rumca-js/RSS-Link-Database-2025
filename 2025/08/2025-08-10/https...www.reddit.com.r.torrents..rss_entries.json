But when I wanted to download something today I couldn&#39;t select the external drive as the download folder. At first I thought it was a permission issue because the app doesn&#39;t have access to all files and documents, but the app doesn&#39;t even ask for the permission so I can&#39;t enable it. I now downloaded Flud where downloading to an external drive works normally, but I was just wondering if anybody knows what I did wrong.</p> <p>Thx for the help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Miserable_River_16\"> /u/Miserable_River_16 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1mmhanc/help_cant_download_to_external_drive_anymore_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1mmhanc/help_cant_download_to_external_dri",
