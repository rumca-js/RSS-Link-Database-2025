I don&#39;t have a dedicated 12v 2x6 slot on my PSU so I have two PCIE slots going into the provided adapter.

I am assuming this is a driver-related issue and am trying to figure out how to circumvent. Please advise.

All the games I&#39;ve played, no problems (I don&#39;t use the anticheat ones), games like Gow Ragnarok, RE4 Remake, GTA V, Spiderman, etc. I didn&#39;t even install games from any store ;) I even installed them using Steam. It&#39;s spectacular, really. I have a dual boot with Windows, just in case. I really like how everything works!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vintage-KL2\"> /u/Vintage-",

So I looked onto the Video Cards.sgr file since even though the game is updated, I wasn&#39;t sure it was recognizing my GPU. Indeed, my GPU wasn&#39;t listed, so I added it using the information I already had from The Sims 3 file. But it didn&#39;t work.</p> <p>So I took a look at the config-log file under Documents/The Sims 2 Legacy/Logs and this is what the game gathered:</p> <pre><code>=== Application info === Name: The Sims 2 Legacy Version: 1.18.0.189 Build: ReleaseSRT === Machine info === OS version: Windows NT 0.0 CPU: 5180Mhz, Name:AuthenticAMD, FPU:1, MMX:1 Memory: 0MB Free memory: 0MB User: moira Compute",

On windows I use &quot;zoomit&quot; which allows me to bind the zoom function to a keybind so when I press it it zooms 2x. Maybe I haven&#39;t looked hard enough but haven&#39;t found anything similar. I know the OS itself has a zoom function but it involves 2 keys for it to function (alt+ scrollwheel) which is a problem for me because most of the time I just use my mouse to navigate everything. </p> <p>While the second problem is mostly specific to me, the first is ",
