Me and my partner are openly queer, she&#39;s a butch woman and I&#39;m a non passing trans man. So we look like a gay couple. I noticed that an American woman while taking a selfie, pointed her phone so that me and my partner where in center of the picture with her head a tiny feature. No image of the background, the sea or scenery just a photo of me and my partner. Is this gonna end up on some queer bashing site? Is there a reason for this? I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nothing but both me and my partner noticed and felt it was really weird. Any explanations from Americans?</p> <p>Edited:spelling error lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lonely_Flamingo_8127\"> /u/Lonely_Flamingo_8127 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1mmsf0m/americans_sneakily_took_a_photo_of_me_and_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https",

Any time anyone starts bashing our community (Nick Fuentes, Tucker Carlson, Matt Walsh, etc.), everybody says that they must be gay. It&#39;s true sometimes, like in Ted Haggard&#39;s case, but saying just about every aggressive homophobe is gay smacks of victim-blaming to me. The unspoken implication is that straight people are incapable of being homophobic and that the majority of the abuse our community suffers is caused by closeted members of our community.

They all live within 10 miles of where they all when to high school, all the way up to the grandparents.</p> <p>My daughter\u2019s never been thrilled with the concept that she has to make an announcement to the whole family. So she hasn\u2019t. We suspect a few of them know, but it\u2019s not talked about. Also, we live in a pretty rural conservative area definitely no threat to her safety, but she feels like the outcast. </p> <p>So she\u2019s pretty much in the F-it state of mind, doesn\u2019t care if they know or not.
