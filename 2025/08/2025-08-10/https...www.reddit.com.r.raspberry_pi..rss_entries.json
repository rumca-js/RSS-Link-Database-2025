I&#39;m sure my goal is technically feasible, I would like to know if it is workable in the real world. I would have the project setup by someone with experience.</p> <p>I want to use a Pi 5 with a Suptronics X1301 HDMI to CSI-2 Bridge for video capture. Using Open Broadcast System (or similar) we will encode the video for streaming.Then with a 4g/5g HAT cellular connection broadcast that via YouTube or similar. Power would be either a UPS HAT or a simple external power bank. A small touchscreen, 5 inch or so, to be able to troubleshoot or adjust settings in the field. Some cooling will definitely be required.</p> <p>I understand there would be potential issues with GPIO pins with multiple connections, and the screen would have to be connected by HDMI because the capture card uses the CSI port.</p> <p>Is this a realistically achievable project?</p> <p>TIA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",
