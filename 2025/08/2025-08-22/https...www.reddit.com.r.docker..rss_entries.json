Initially, I thought hosting and deploying just meant selecting my project&#39;s repository from one of the popular hosting sites like vercel or render, but it seems like these sites are mostly catered towards static sites. Then, I learned that reverse proxies should be set up to keep things secure and balance the traffic load, so I implemented in traefik.</p> <pre><code>networks: traefik_public: external: false # False indicates running the container locally services: traefik: image: traefik:3.5.0 command: - --entrypoints.websecure.address=:443 - --providers.docker=true - --providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false - --providers.docker.network=encryption_journal_traefik_public - --log.level=info # Dashboard - --api.dashboard=true - --api.insecure",
