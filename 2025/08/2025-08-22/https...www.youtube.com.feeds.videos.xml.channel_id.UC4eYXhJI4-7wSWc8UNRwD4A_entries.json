        "description": "Robin Hilton | August 22, 2025\nA common misconception of the Tiny Desk is that bands have to keep it quiet or go all-acoustic. So when I invited Ty Segall to play in our office, I made a point of assuring him he could crank his electrified, riff-heavy guitar noise to 11. His three-word reply came via email: \"We shall rock.\"\n\nTrue to his word, the band pushed the limits of the space with stadium-sized vibes, opening with the pulse-spiking \"You're the Doctor,\" from the 2012 album Twins. They followed with the title cut from this year's Possession and the rolling, harmony-rich \"Whisper\" from 2021's Harmonizer. They closed out the set with a gritty take on 2010's \"Girlfriend\" and \"My Best Friend,\" from last year's Three Bells. It's some of the most glorious shredding you'll ever see at the Tiny Desk.\n\nSET LIST\n\"You're the Doctor\"\n\"Possession\"\n\"Whisper\"\n\"Girlfriend\"\n\"My Best Friend\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTy Segall: vocals, guitar\nEmmett Kelly: guitar, background vocals\nMikal Cronin: bass, background ",

        "description": "Lara Downes | August 22, 2025\nAhmir \"Questlove\" Thompson is a timekeeper by profession. As a drummer, he's the co-frontman of the Grammy-winning hip-hop band The Roots. He is also a historian, an author of books and a maker of films that illuminate the ways in which music is shaped by time and culture, and shapes it in turn. So his relationship to time exists very much in the present \u2014 as a creator of rhythmic structure, controller of tempo and catalyst of energy \u2014 but also in the past, as each drumstroke recedes immediately into the echoes of history.\n\nQuestlove's directorial debut, Summer of Soul, won the Academy Award for best documentary feature in 2022; his latest film, Sly Lives!, is a masterful portrait of the legendary funk innovator Sly Stone. There's a moment in that documentary when a young Maria Shriver, in footage from a 1982 interview, asks Sly about the songs he wrote in the late '60s, when, in her words: \"Just about everything in this country was in disarray.\" She asks",
