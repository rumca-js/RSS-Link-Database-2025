My company provides AI subscriptions, so I use Cursor as my main IDE and ChatGPT or Claude as backup tools. My usual stack is MERN and Next.js, with some rare work in Java Spring Boot.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been learning and building projects for the past two years since mid-college, using tutorials, docs, my own knowledge, and AI together. With Cursor, I feel like I actually understand what to build, how to plan, and what to keep in mind. I\u2019m comfortable prompting, identifying problems, and debugging AI-generated code.</p> <p>To be real, more than 90% of my code is generated by AI.",
