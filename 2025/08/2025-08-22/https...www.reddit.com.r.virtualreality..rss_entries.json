I bought a 3S for my son\u2019s birthday and was really excited to try it out as I got it set up for him in the weeks leading up to giving it to him.

I grew up with Lawnmower Man and the Virtual Boy so I don\u2019t feel like my expectations were ridiculous. That said, after the wow factor wore off in the first hour, I found the experience repetitive and ungratifying. It really reminds me of 3D televisions or the Nintendo Wii in that it is sensational and the content created for it is unsubstantial as it relies too much on a gimmicky technology for sales. The Wii was so fun for a couple of weeks before it wasn\u2019t and then it literally just collected dust in the homes of everyone I know. I\u2019m already bored with the quest after 3 hours. </p> <p>All of the games use the same formula: find a thing, pick it up, do something with it, repeat. If it was ",
