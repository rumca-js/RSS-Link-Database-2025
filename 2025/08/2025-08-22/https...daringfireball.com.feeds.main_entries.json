The pricing for yearly TV+ subscriptions and\nthe Apple One services bundle remains unchanged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The annual price for a standalone TV+ subscription\u2009\u2014\u2009unchanged, as Mayo reports\u2009\u2014\u2009remains $99. The usual rule-of-thumb for subscriptions of any sort seems to be to charge 10\u00d7 the monthly rate for an annual subscription. That\u2019s exactly where the TV+ month/annual prices were before today. Now, the annual subscription price isn\u2019t just a little bit cheaper than 12\u00d7 the monthly price ($156), but a <em>lot</em> cheaper.</p>\n\n<p>This seems to be a clear sign that streaming services are different than most subscriptions.
