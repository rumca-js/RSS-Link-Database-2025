As she walked through the forest to get to the pool, Carmen Chan could feel the mud between her toes getting warmer.</p><p>\u201cIt was such a visceral way to be in the forest,\u201d Chan says. The pool had a hot waterfall, the steam from which created a fogginess \u201clike an Indiana Jones adventure\u201d \u2013 even though the real world, golf courses and highways, was only 6km away. A decade after that first trip, the now 32-year-old Chan is still hooked.
