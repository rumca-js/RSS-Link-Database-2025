Even brand new shows have no one. I tried different websites like Yts, Heartive, EzTv and none of the magnet links I try have seeders. </p> <p>I haven&#39;t changed any of my settings so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on.

On the surface the names and sizes looked like a match, but cross-seed didn\u2019t pick them up. Since I\u2019m new I figured maybe they weren\u2019t actually the same, even though they looked like it.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s this Studio Ghibli collection. I first had it from Tracker B and cross-seed matched it on Tracker A. The problem is Tracker A doesn\u2019t give points for cross-seeding, so I deleted the torrents and the data, and just downloaded it again directly from Tracker A. Now cross-seed doesn\u2019t see it as a match anymore, even though it did before. I even tried deleting the db file and running a search again but still nothing.</p> <p>I\u2019m am using the default config",
