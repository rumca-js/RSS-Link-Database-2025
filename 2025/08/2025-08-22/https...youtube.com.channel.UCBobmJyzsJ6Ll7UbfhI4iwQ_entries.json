        "description": "Join Luis Placid and Shazzy Gustafson of ICVR for an in-depth look at how publicly available AI tools can drastically accelerate 3D content creation for Unreal Engine\u2014and explore areas where it still falls short.\n\nThis case study shows how a handcrafted Unreal Engine scene was recreated from the ground up using AI tools and workflows. The session highlights the most effective generative AI use cases, as well as the areas where AI struggled to match the original handcrafted quality benchmark, including 2D-to-3D character generation, environment creation with neural splats, automated character rigging, and AI-driven animation. \n\nWhether you're an artist, developer, technical director, or creative, this talk aims to demystify AI workflows in Unreal Engine, highlight various challenges and solutions, and show where and how you can begin leveraging these tools today to unlock new creative possibilities for you and your team.\n\nTopics include the best publicly available AI tools for UE produ",
