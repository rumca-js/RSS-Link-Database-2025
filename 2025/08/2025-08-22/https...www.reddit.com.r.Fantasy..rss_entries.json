But as I read, I began to realize that McKillip sets up those expectations deliberately, only to undermine them with a story that\u2019s far more challenging and thought-provoking than it first appears. </p> <p>The story follows Sybel, a wiza",

It contains everything you&#39;d expect from Hobb. The character work is exceptional, with all acting like humans and progressing throughout the books. One highlight was Thick. In the hands of a lesser author he could have been a frustration to read, but Hobb handles him and his often conflicting relationship with Fitz incredibly well. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve come across a character with learning difficulties (I read it as Down&#39;s Syndrome, but not sure) written so sensitively.</p> <p>There are sad moments (omitting specifics to avoid spoilers) but they tend to feel believable and never mawkish. Hobb&#39;s reputation as a miserable writer is in my opinion undeserved - there is sadness to offset the hope and happiness that is very prevalent in these books. Fitz moves through life, there will naturally be disappointment. There are also,",

It\u2019s not the high action desert epic of the first book; it\u2019s slower, stranger, almost surreal.</p> <p>What really hit me though is how much this book feels like the blueprint for so many modern sci-fi epics I love. Reading it, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking: Dune walked so Red Rising and Sun Eater could run. The political games, the philosophical undercurrents, the way a hero\u2019s triumph twists into tragedy, it\u2019s all here, raw and experimental.

If I read a review about the First Law trilogy that talks about &quot;the magic system&quot;, or complains about &quot;the world building&quot;, I probably know that this review isn&#39;t necessarily valuable to me because that&#39;s not what the book is trying to achieve.</p> <p>I&#39;ll see threads about books that ",

In this novel, Geryon, a winged, red monster, is also a young man who begins an autobiography at age 5, as a way to understand the world around him, and chronicles his childhood and encounters with Herakles (Hercules). It&#39;s primarily an exploration of love (particularly unrequited), queerness, and loneliness. The book is often called a romance (Wikipedia classifies it so), but it&#39;s only so in such a way as Romero and Juliet or the myth of Achilles and Patroclus is- it&#39;s equally tragic. Carson&#39;s Geryon is in the tradition of Stesichorus and Dante- there appear to be many conflicting accounts of Geryon&#39;s appearance.</p> <p>I feel like discussion online, or at least what I&#39;d seen, is a little misleading as ",
