I reached out to her dad, and I asked her dad if he would talk to her for me and see if she\u2019d be willing to meet up with me. I also made it clear that I respect if she answered no. Last week my daughter met me at a restaurant for lunch. It was an awkward meeting at first, but things got smoother as time went on. I apologized to her profusely and admitted that I was not there for her when she needed me. </p> <p>Our relationship is still strained but I\u2019m thankful that I got the opportunity to see her after 7 years. She talks to me through text now. I hope as time goes on I regain her trust, but I know that may never happen, once you break someone\u2019s trust it\u2019s hard to get it back. She\u2019s married now and her wife is carrying their baby.

I hope this gets seen by the world!!!! I am a straight Florida resident, and I am appalled to find out that overnight in Orlando Fl. The memorial for 49 lgbtq victims of the Pulse Night Club has been removed. I don&#39;t know what can be done but something needs to end. This is disgusting. The way I am seeing the LGBTQ community being treated in my state is beyond messed up. As a resident of this state, I just want to say I am so sorry.
