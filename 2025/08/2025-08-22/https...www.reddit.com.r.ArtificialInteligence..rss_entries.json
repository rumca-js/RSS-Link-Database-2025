Yet, alongside this optimism, a vocal group of \u201csteam engine doomers\u201d has emerged, warning that these machines could lead to societal collapse. These skeptics, often dismissed as alarmists, argue that unchecked steam power might disrupt economies, displace workers, and even threaten human control over technology. But as steam engines become more integrated into daily life, their concerns are gaining traction.</p> <p>The steam engine boom began with machines capable of automating repetitive tasks, like spinning cotton or powering locomotives. Now, advanced steam engines can perform complex operations, from calculating trade routes to drafting legal contracts. Companies like xSteam and SteamWor",

I&#39;m not talking like a college student just asking it to do all the work, moreso to make my tone a little more consistent and flesh out some areas. </p> <p>It worked really well in terms of ranking, but when my manager found out they werent thrilled. We&#39;d never had a conversation about AI use in the workplace and all I&#39;d been hearing were positive things about my content so I didn&#39;t think I was in the wrong. </p> <p>The weird part is other parts of my company are cranking out full-on AI articles, while my team\u2019s apparently expected to avoid it completely. Feels like different parts of the industry (and even the same company) are moving at totally different speeds with this stuff.</p> <p>Curious if anyone else has run into similar tension and how they&#39;re handling AI in the workplace? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SuperDerpy",
