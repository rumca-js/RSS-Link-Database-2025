Uploads fail, etc. I have Nextcloud internally for nas browsing but never used it for large files. Is there a lightweight option just to share those large files?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone, quick question. I&#39;m thinking about finally automating my plex server, and I want to integrate Overseerr to manage requests. I&#39;m not interested in integrating rclone to spoof debrid(currently might change my mind in the future) but rather search and download from the Debrid cache and if nothing is returned, search and download from my trackers. Whats the best way to implement this? Run prowlarr+Seerrbridge together? Prowlarr+Decypharr? Or should I look into Zilean to handle the Debrid side? How do I setup the priority to go through Debrid first then my trackers? Thanks!</p> <p>Edit:Just realized, I&#39;m still willing to setup rclone since decypharr needs it, but I don&#39;t care for the debrid virtual drive mounting for streaming and would just prefer to download. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chromotoast\"> /u/Chromotoast </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, all! I\u2019ve been slowly adding more users to my Jellyfin server, and I\u2019d like to get a better sense of my streaming bandwidth usage. Specifically, I want to see how many Mbps I\u2019m uploading at any given moment and be able to look back at trends \u2014 e.g. from 8pm to 9pm, how much data was I uploading per second on average.</p> <p>I know Netdata can do this, but it also seems to include a lot more system monitoring than I really need. Ideally, I\u2019m looking for something: - Lightweight and easy to self-host (Docker preferred) - Has a web UI with graphs - Can show real-time upload Mbps - Can display historical trends</p> <p>I\u2019m not using Jellyfin in Docker, so I don\u2019t necessarily need the ability to isolate Jellyfin\u2019s activity.</p> <p>Has anyone found a good fit for this use case?
