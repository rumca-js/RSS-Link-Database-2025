However, the waveshare wiki for the screen and drivers are super outdated and doesn\u2019t work anymore. There i\u2019ve tried to use an open source framebuffer copy display driver for LCD screens that connect with SPI. It is called fbcp-ili9341. (github.com/juj/fbcp-ili9341). However it doesn\u2019t directly support the 2 inch waveshare st7789 model. Therefore i\u2019ve also tried to use the LCD show commands (github.com/goodtft/LCD-show) but that also does not directly support a 2 inch ST7789 whose dimensions are 320 x 240.",
