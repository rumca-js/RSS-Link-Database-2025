That\u2019s part of the charm \u2013 and possibly a slight failing \u2013 in the south London standup\u2019s new set. As he treads around in a circle on his small stage, Your Old Mucker unfolds at its own laconic pace, and leaves us to make meaning out of its disparate parts. The 29-year-old\u2019s authority, his sly standoffishness and playfulness with the art form are qualities of a standup near the top of his game \u2013 albeit one who with this ambling, endearing show doesn\u2019t get quite as much out of them as he might.</p><p>The conceit here is that Night\u2019s writing process is, in fact, a walking one. The show traces his perambulations around his local neighbourhood, from the dentist to the butcher, from Nisa Loca",

There are car chases and shootouts with absurdly attractive people in the middle of them and recognisable \u201cthat guy from\u201d faces surrounding. But even back then it would have been a gamble without an A-lister attached, the film probably going the way of the many non-Fast &amp; Furious car flops like Driven, Speed Racer, Drive Angry and Need for Speed.</p><p>Now, it\u2019s a much more obvious, and far safer, fit for streaming, with Disney wisely nudging this one to a Hulu/Disney+ premiere. Eenie Meanie still has the feel of something that was once on a bigger screen, though, with a reported $50m budget edging it above many of the season\u2019s multiplex offerings (mor",

When he tries to pitch it fuller he strays onto Rickleton\u2019s pads and the left-hander benefits from a Carey misfield to run three. De Zorzi then opens his account with a couple behind square off his hip.</p><p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 2-1 (Rickelton 2, de Zorzi 0) </strong>A second slip comes in for the new batter, de Zorzi, and they\u2019re both very happy when the number three plays and misses at his opening delivery. Excellent start for Bartlett who begins with a wicket maiden.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/aug/22/australia-v-south-africa-second-mens-one-day-international-odi-cricket-live-sc",
