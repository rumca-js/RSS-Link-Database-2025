Therefore, I am forced to get the 1st edition copy since no one has the 2nd edition. But the real issue with the 1st edition was the boards or cards were warped (as reported by some).</p> <p>I would like to know from those that have the 1st edition, did you all experience warped cards and boards? Or did that happen only to the few unlucky handfuls? </p> <p>If I were to buy the first edition copy, am I doomed with warped boards &amp; cards? </p> <p>Please advise. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/inquiry821\"> /u/inquiry821 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mxknsx/anyone_with_adventure_tactics_domiannes_",

I am happy to spoil it for myself if it provides my friends with a great experience!</p> <p>Would also love any tips that have worked for you in the past hosting a murder mystery party.

Gold star for me!</p> <p>It turns out I like learning new games a lot more than my friends do, and a couple months ago I realized I&#39;ve been learning about 1.5 games/week so I thought I&#39;d work up a list for my 1-year anniversary. Once I had the list it seemed a shame not to write out a little blurb about some of my favorites, and once I had <em>that</em> it seemed a shame not to put it out there for strangers to argue with my opinions! It should be noted that I play almost exclusively turn-based async, which has definitely colored my views on some of the games on this list, and I haven&#39;t included any games I had already played IRL before getting on BGA. I look forward to hearing your recommendations for more games to check out!</p> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSjjmzG2o6UOO3YC3Dzztb9o3K1QE-DIrxImlszvFeo4pHgm-CID9exRJsdqr0cnGe8Hr",

I will be visiting some friends in a little over a month and we&#39;re going to start a campaign together then. </p> <p>Now here&#39;s the question, do we start from the very beginning? Or do I do the &#39;tutorial&#39; bits solo first and then they can hop in when the story picks up? </p> <p>I&#39;ve read some mixed comments on the first mission, some saying that it&#39;s a bit dull and doesn&#39;t give the best first impression. I&#39;ve watched some playthroughs of the very beginning and it looks fine to me but also not the most exciting. </p> <p>I will be there for a week so we can probably get a few sessions in. We also live in different countries and we dont get to see each other that often so if i can tailor the experience to make it more fun I&#39;m all for it!
