I&#39;ve seen people say &quot;they&#39;re not listening, you are predictable, the algorithm is working.&quot; But I do not believe it. Today I mentioned domestic abuse to my sister in person, and got ads for domestic abuse help. Yesterday my girlfriend mentioned she liked my cologne and I told her the brand. It was then advertised to me endlessly. </p> <p>On my end, I&#39;ve checked my permissions for my microphone and the only thing that uses it is my messenger app and keyboard when I use voice to text. Ill start removing all microphone permissions from my apps and not using voice to text anymore. But is there anything else we can do? It feels dystopian. It really only bothers me on principle and the idea of it all. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gitrektlol\"> /u/gitrektlol </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comme",

As far as I understand it, this way malicious code could be injected into a build that would still be signed with F-droid&#39;s signature, if somehow the F-droid srrvers were to be attacked. But this is also quite unclear because I read on some forum post that apps published on F-droid are built and signed in a VM, so one would need to permanently infect the VM in order to infect the apps?</p> <p>However, when we do trust that the F-droid builds are secure, then we are safe in assuming that the builds published on F-droid actually come from the published source, and are not spiked with additional binaries. This is very important in my opinion, because on github this isn&#39;t true at all.</p> <p>So I don&#39;t really understand the constant dunking on fdroid.
