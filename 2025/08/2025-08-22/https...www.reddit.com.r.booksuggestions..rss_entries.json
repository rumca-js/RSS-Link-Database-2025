I am an agnostic (don&#39;t know) atheist (therefore don&#39;t believe) looking for a book or multiple books about how to live a virtuous life. When I look for this a lot of what comes up is Christian. However I don&#39;t find what Jesus wants or the promise of heaven or hell to be very motivating. But I still see the value of religion and envy their ability to focus and meditate on how to live a good life through the teachings of the Bible and would like to engage in that sort of practice.</p> <p>Does anyone have any examples of books that focus on being a more virtuous person? Ideally avoiding pop psychology, self-help slop or anything political. I guess religious books could be fine if they focus on the benefits of the behavior to the self and others.Thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MagazineRough1490\"> /u/MagazineRough1490 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

Long story short: she doesn\u2019t always have the energy to leave her apartment, so we are starting with books.</p> <p>She used to absolutely love murder mysteries, but lately she says she\u2019s \u201ctired of her usual authors\u201d and always guesses the ending. I suggested trying a new genre, and she seemed open to it! For me, reading fantasy romances a couple of years ago completely reignited my love for books, and I\u2019d love to help her find that same spark (even if it\u2019s not romantasy).</p> <p>Some things about her: - She\u2019s religious (so probably nothing too heavy on demons/occult) - She\u2019s funny, witty, and sarcastic - Met her husband working at Yellowstone - Loves singing/old Hollywood musicals - Born in the late 1940s - Usually reads murder ",
