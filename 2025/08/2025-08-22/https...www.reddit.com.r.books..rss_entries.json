I searched this sub and they were discussed quickly about 7 years ago. I enjoy YA every so often.</p> <p>I was secretly hoping for an all-boys school type story (doesn&#39;t have to be all-boys, but I love stories sequestered in massive mansions) and I can&#39;t tell if the third book will become that or not.</p> <p>I&#39;m also trying to not read the backs to keep the whole thing mysterious.</p> <p>So I&#39;m sort of at an impasse. I have a pile of books to get to before I get to these, and I <em>will</em> donate them back to the LFL.

Usually first person narratives, prefers things that are not fantasy, sci-fi, or romance. She was telling me today about the last several books she had read that had come highly recommended to her. She described them as beautifully written, but tough to read because of the onslaught of awful things that happen to the characters. I think she is hoping to find some engaging fiction that isn&#39;t so grim. I mostly read non-fiction, so my recommendations to her were limited.

It is a more difficult book to get to end, but you keep going because the Galt&#39;s speech is the climax ",

In this novel, Geryon, a winged, red monster, is also a young man who begins an autobiography at age 5, as a way to understand the world around him, and chronicles his childhood and encounters with Herakles (Hercules). It&#39;s primarily an exploration of love (particularly unrequited), queerness, and loneliness. The book is often called a romance (Wikipedia classifies it so), but it&#39;s only so in such a way as Romero and Juliet or the myth of Achilles and Patroclus is- it&#39;s equally tragic. Carson&#39;s Geryon is in the tradition of Stesichorus and Dante- there appear to be many conflicting accounts of Geryon&#39;s appearance.</p> <p>I feel like discussion online, or at least what I&#39;d seen, is a little misleading as to what the book ",
