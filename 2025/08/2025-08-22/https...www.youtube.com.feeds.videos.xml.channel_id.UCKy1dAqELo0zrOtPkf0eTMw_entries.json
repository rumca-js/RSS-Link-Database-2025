His intent was to escape his hectic Hollywood lifestyle and show the world the path to sustainability. \n\nTo achieve this goal, he plucks Judge (Jon Heder), an obscure but idealistic Los Angeles architect, from his stable existence and convinces him that together they could build the world's first truly sustainable ecological retreat.\n\nThe cast also includes Camille Razat, Alaina Huffman, James Jagger, and Rob Corddry, with Tia Carrere and Richard Dreyfuss.\n\nDirector Bill Fishman's Waltzing With Brando will be released on September 19, 2025.\n\n#IGN #Movies",

        "description": "For the first time, Chainsaw Man slashes his way onto the big screen in an epic, action-fueled adventure that continues the hugely popular anime series. Denji worked as a Devil Hunter for the yakuza, trying to pay off the debt he inherited from his parents, until the yakuza betrayed him and had him killed. \n\nAs he was losing consciousness, Denji\u2019s beloved chainsaw-powered devil-dog, Pochita, made a deal with Denji and saved his life. This fused the two together, creating the unstoppable Chainsaw Man. Now, in a brutal war between devils, hunters, and secret enemies, a mysterious girl named Reze has stepped into his world, and Denji faces his deadliest battle yet, fueled by love in a world where survival knows no rules.\n\nBased on the original work \u201cChainsaw Man\u201d by Tatsuki Fujimoto (Serialized in Shueisha\u2019s \u201cShonen Jump+\u201d). Sony Pictures will release Chainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc in US theaters on October 29, 2025.",
