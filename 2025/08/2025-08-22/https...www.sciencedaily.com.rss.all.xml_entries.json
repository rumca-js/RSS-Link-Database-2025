These tiny but brilliant objects, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, appear far too compact and bright to fit existing models of galaxy and black hole formation. A new study suggests they may have formed within rare dark matter halos that spin unusually slowly, creating conditions that squeeze matter into incredibly dense structures. If true, these galaxies could provide vital clues about how the first black holes and galaxies came into being.",
