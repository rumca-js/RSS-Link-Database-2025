The 2025 yield of Crop Art on exhibit in the Horticulture Building includes work that honors Prince, Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin, Bj\u00f6rk, Radiohead, Beyonc\u00e9 and many others, plus a cheeky reference to Hall & Oates \u2026 and even a nod to The Current\u2019s 20th anniversary! Watch the video above to see those The Current was able to capture during a visit to the State Fair\u2019s ever-popular Crop Art display.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1  \n\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\nhttps://www.threads.net/@thecurrent\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@thecurrent.org\n\nThis activity is made possible in part by the\u00a0Minnesota ",
