        "description": "Looking back at Princess Diana\u2019s death raises more questions than answers. From secret phone taps to ignored evidence, vanished CCTV, and witnesses silenced, the official story falls apart under scrutiny. Whether it\u2019s the landmine campaign threatening powerful interests or the note Diana herself wrote predicting a staged car crash, the pattern is chillingly familiar. Just like with Epstein or COVID, trust in government collapses when the people in power control the evidence\u2014and the cover-up becomes more obvious than the crime.\n\n[STREAMED]\n\nhttp://www.1775coffee.com/BRAND to save 15% off your order of 1775 Coffee.\n\nGo to http://rumble.com/premium/brand and use code BRAND to save $10 on your annual subscription\n\nWATCH me LIVE Monday - Thursday on Rumble: https://bit.ly/russellbrand-rumble\n\nAll links: https://linktr.ee/RussellBrand",
