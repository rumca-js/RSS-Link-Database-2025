It also makes it easier to install programs like DaVinci Resolve, configure a firewall, or set up a swap file.</p> <p>Of course, this kind of toolbox is not entirely new, there are other projects out there with similar goals, but LinuxToys might still be worth checking out if you enjoy exploring different approaches.

The PHY handles muxing between these different protocols and also provides the reset controller for the attached dwc3 USB controller. There is no documentation available for this PHY and the entire sequence of MMIO pokes has been figured out by tracing all MMIO access of Apple&#39;s driver under a thin hypervisor and correlating the register reads/writes to their kernel&#39;s debug output to find their names. Deviations from this sequence generally results in the port not working or, especially when the mode is switched to USB4 or Thunderbolt, to some",
