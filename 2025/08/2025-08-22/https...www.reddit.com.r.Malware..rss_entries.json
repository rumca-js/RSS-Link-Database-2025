There\u2019s only so much my smoothbrain can attempt to circumvent these by modifying registry values in the case of something like checking for Xeon with CPU info, trying to patch stuff in a debugger (failing mostly), or \u201chardening\u201d the VM as much as possible to remove device elements.</p> <p>That said, I hate this term, but has anyone tried doing \u201c\u201d\u201dbare metal\u201d\u201d\u201d analysis with Deep Freeze. I have a spare laptop that I would set up with an environment and tools like my VM\u2019s and set up a baseline for restarts. I\u2019m going to be honest and say I don\u2019t care for going super tryhard and doing scholarly level network obfuscation. I\u2019m just going to use a residential proxy IP and call it a day.
