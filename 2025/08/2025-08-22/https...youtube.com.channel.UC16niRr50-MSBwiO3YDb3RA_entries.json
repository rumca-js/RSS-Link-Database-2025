        "description": "Palestinians flee Gaza City districts as Israel says first stages of offensive have begun.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians are expected to be ordered to evacuate and head to southern Gaza. This escalation comes as Israel continues to restrict aid into the strip, with Palestinians facing widespread malnutrition. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he is \"shortening the timelines\" for seizing what he described as \"the last terror strongholds\" in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has also given final approval for a settlement project which would cut off the West Bank from East Jerusalem and further splinter the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich who unveiled the plans said the idea of a Palestinian state was \"being erased\".\n\nAdam is joined in the studio with Panorama filmmaker Jane Corbin, who has reported extensively on the region, and Jo Floto, the BBC Middle East Bureau Chief.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and ",
