I did some searching out of curiosity and I could almost find no way at all anyone can find a phone that has been completely switched off. In very recent models, the phone still has some backup power for FIndMyPhone and such, but for the vast majority, apparently there is no way at all. It emits no signals at all, and at most, you can find the last location in which it was on. I always thought there&#39;d be some way or another to locate almost anything. I still think some other people may know better, what do you guys think? (I&#39;m not experienced, just began my training in CyberSec, sorry if this is a dumb argument or something, just wanted to talk stuff to people who know stuff :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DannyPereira44\"> /u/DannyPereira44 </a> <br/> <span><a href=",
