        "description": "Donna Adelson is a 75-year-old grandmother accused of orchestrating the assassination of her former son-in-law, Dan Markel. The prominent, Harvard-educated professor was gunned down in his own garage. Prosecutors say Adelson paid over a hundred thousand dollars to have him killed. Donna's own son and three accomplices have already been found guilty for their roles in the murder. Adelson's lawyers are painting her as a doting, loving granny, not a cold-blooded mastermind.",

Inside Edition producers Will Evans and Emma Keady spoke to several women in Miami Beach who said being filmed without their permission was a common occurrence. Before long, they found a man perched on a pier overlooking the beach with a large telephoto lens. They watched as he appeared to zoom in on the backsides of two young women on paddleboards.",

On Friday, cops swarmed the family's property and SWAT vehicles moved in, as police arrested both parents on charges of murder. Earlier this week, Emmanuel's mother Rebecca claimed she was attacked in a parking lot, and that her son was then kidnapped. But cops say her story had inconsistencies, and that she has stopped cooperating with detectives.",
