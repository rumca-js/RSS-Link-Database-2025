You deserve some time to relax, chill out, maybe watch a random person create a gaming PC made entirely from hand-cut cardboard. And I don\u2019t just mean installing PC components into a cardboard box\u2014rather, this entire project is an elaborate and nerdy take on papercraft in the weirdest and most wonderful way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1mjly99/a_pc_built_out_of_cardboard/\">a Reddit poster</a> shared a two-minute video of a PC build\u2026 or at least an approximation of one, where almost every single component is lovingly simulated with hand-cut cardboard. The case is cardboard, the motherboard is cardboard, the graphics card is cardboard, even the (working!) CPU fan is cardboard. There are a few metal screws and brackets, and I\u2019m guessing the power supply is only covered in cardbo",

With one of these, you can see a live video feed of your doorstep with a simple phone app, plus several other features of convenience. We really like the Ecobee Smart Video Doorbell, and even more <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C424CVZ8/\">now that it\u2019s only $120 on Amazon</a> (a 25% discount on its original $160).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As tiny as this doorbell camera is, it captures full 1080p video both during the day and during the night. Taking things one step further, this doorbell features two-way audio, so you can talk with whoever\u2019s outside your door, whether that\u2019s to give instructions to a delivery person or to tell your friends to come back later. It\u2019s wired so you won\u2019t need to worry about battery, and it connects to your Wi-Fi network s",

Well \u2013 surprise! Windows 11 has one of those too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Windows\u2019 case, though, you don\u2019t get supernatural powers. What you get is access to a whole heap of commands that you\u2019d normally have to dig deep to find in menus, submenus, and tabs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use Windows God mode to find and manage Windows administrative tools quicker than I normally would be able to, to adjust and check things like my PC\u2019s power plan, and to view my devices. Suffice it to say it saves me a bunch of time by cutting down the time I spend with useless faffing about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, I recommend Windows God mode as a quick way to access functions that you use a lot and wish you had shortcuts for on your desktop.",
