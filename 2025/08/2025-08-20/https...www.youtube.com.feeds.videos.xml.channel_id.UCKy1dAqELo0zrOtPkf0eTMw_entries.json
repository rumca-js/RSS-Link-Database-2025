But the sentiment after a succesful open beta period is that Battlefield will be the one to grab gamers' attention, with former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra saying that Battlefield will 'boot stomp' CoD this year. But Treyarch's Miles Leslie thinks there's room for both, saying the Black Ops 7 dev is trying to shut out the noise and make the best game they can. In other news, Xbox dropped a trailer for the upcoming DLC to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, titled 'The Order of Giants.' The trailer also revealed a Switch 2 release sometime next year. And finally, we\u2019ve got a peek at the five immersive worlds of the all-new Universal Epic Universe, and one of its featured attractions \u2013 Stardust Racers, all at Universal Orlando Resort.\n\nPresented by Universal Orlando Resort, and its new theme park, Universal Epic Universe.

According to Cardy, Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is the perfect combination of Arkham and Lego combat.\n\nCombat aside, it's a lego game, and like other lego games, there's a ton of collectables and skins from decades of Batman movies, comics, and shows. The Tumbler, from Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises), is in the game. Odds are there's a reference to your Batman meme and Batman scene. There's tons of Batman references to make the game worthy of its \"Legacy of the Dark Knight\" title. Villains like Joker, Bane, and Penguin make appearances. Plus, there's also coll",

Frame rate drops were significant when turning the camera whilst exploring outside of the tutorial area, and this, combined with a confusing button layout on Switch 2, made combat confusing and exploration fairly dispiriting. We weren't allowed to record gameplay at the booth, probably due to this fact, but you can hear our thoughts on Elden Ring Switch 2 handheld gameplay in this video. Elden Ring Tarnished Edition releases in 2025, so hopefully there's time for Bandai Namco to work on its performance.",
