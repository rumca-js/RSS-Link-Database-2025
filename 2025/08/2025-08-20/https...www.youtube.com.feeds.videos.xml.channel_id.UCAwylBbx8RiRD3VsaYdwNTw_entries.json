        "description": "Rizwan Virk, MIT affiliate and author of The Simulation Hypothesis, has long argued that reality may be closer to a highly advanced simulation than to the solid physical world we believe in. His ideas bring together technology, quantum physics, and ancient questions about human existence.\n\nOne of the most haunting mysteries he explores is the life review \u2014 the phenomenon where life seems to flash before your eyes at the moment of death. For some, it feels like a panoramic replay of every choice and every emotion, not just their own but those of others they affected. For others, it feels like stepping outside of time, watching their existence unfold as if on a screen.\n\nIs this simply a final surge of brain activity, or is it evidence that every moment has been recorded\u2026 and that death is not the end?\n\nIf you want to learn more from Rizwan Virk, we highly recommend exploring his teachings - https://amzn.to/3JoQO7J\n\nExcerpts courtesy of Danny Jones, Julian Dorey and The Joe Rogan Experie",
