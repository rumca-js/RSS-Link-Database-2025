I see many homophobic people hate on that and copy the trend, just with their &quot;straight flag&quot;. Like I saw the TV glow one, and it&#39;s black and white strips and how they &quot;found god&quot;. I&#39;m obviously not hating on straight people, but why do they say everything is about us when the world revolves around them?

As always, I filled in a form detailing different aspects of my sex life.</p> <p>One of the questions regarded what kind of people I&#39;ve been intimate with over the last 6 months. I checked both &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; (because those were the only options) and the nurse asked what kind of sex I&#39;ve had (anal, oral, or vaginal). I answered that I&#39;d only had vaginal sex with both of my partners and she was so confused. I had to go, &quot;trans men do exist,&quot; and she went, &quot;oh, yeah, that&#39;s true! Hmm... maybe we need to update our forms a bit...?&quot;</p> <p>The only thing they need to do is keeping the anal/oral/vaginal options and remove the gender question altogether since it&#39;s already superfluous. She agreed wholeheartedly with my input and was going to bring it up to her superiors.</p> <p>So, hopefully, a small win!</p> </div><!-- SC",
