But physicists have also come up with theories claiming that the Big Bang was non-singular and can repeat, restarting the cycle over again. These are called \u201ccyclic models,\u201d and they\u2019ve re-emerged into the spotlight now that there\u2019s mounting evidence that dark energy is weakening over time. However, a physicist from UC Berkeley recently published a paper which he claims \u201ccategorically rules out\u201d cyclic models. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly ",
