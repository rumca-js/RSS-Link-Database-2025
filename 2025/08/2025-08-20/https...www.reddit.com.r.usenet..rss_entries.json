Then Radarr sends that result to NZBGet which in turn grabs from all your indexers.</p> <p>Now what happens in the indexers don&#39;t have the retention long enough to grab the file?<br/> Are you just always stuck in a situation where there&#39;s always a chance to get a positive result in Radarr, but it&#39;s actually unobtainable?</p> <p>I hope this makes sense. </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DevanteWeary\"> /u/DevanteWeary </a> <br/> <span><",
