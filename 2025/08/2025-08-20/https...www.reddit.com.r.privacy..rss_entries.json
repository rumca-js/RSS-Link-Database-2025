My phone, Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra does not seem to have the kind night sensors to catch cameras, and l&#39;m looking to find non network connected devices.</p> <p>I was reading on detectors, but I feel like they could be gimmicky or ineffective.</p> <p>I was looking at two of them online, one was a basic stick that had bars to show RF existence - it seems sorta gimmicky, claiming it uses AI for detection. Unlike the stick, second i looked at had a lens you look through while IT sense illumitate camera lenses, and they are very clearly visible. The second looks above board. Edit: I got the links, respective order at end. </p> <p>What are your thoughts? Are these devices effective - at 30 to 50 bucks could they be? Is a several hundred dollar device more effective? G there anything I can do without hardware to better find cameras?</p> <p>For now ill stick with me flashlight and see w",
