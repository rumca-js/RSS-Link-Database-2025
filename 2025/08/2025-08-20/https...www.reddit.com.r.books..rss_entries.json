I was enjoying the thread but it has since been deleted. I would love to know from the community, where in the world are your favorite bookstores and which stores are overrated?</p> <p>I\u2019ve lived in several cities in different countries so here is my list in different places:</p> <p>Favorite Bookstores:</p> <p>Donlon Books (London): this is my absolute favorite bookstore anywhere in the world. The curation is on point and the staff is stellar. One of my favorite books I purchased there was a small photography book on Sun Ra Arkestra that one of the staff members took the pictures for the book at the show in London. She told me about the event and I was able to attend. Really cool full circle moment.</p> <p>Magalleria (Bath, England): top notch curation and unusual finds. Really cool owner and staff.</p> <p>Persephone Books (Bath, England): this shop reprints neglected",

So I&#39;m genuinely curious: How exactly did your parents or guardians make you fall in love with books so early?
