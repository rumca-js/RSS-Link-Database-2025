In this cheeky musical comedy, one of the winners of this year\u2019s Untapped award for rising theatrical talent, we meet young Jes\u00fas (Sergio Antonio Maggiolo), son of Maria and Jose, who is getting ready to make his first holy communion. It\u2019s not the only first heading his way; a sexual awakening is brewing.</p><p>Guido Garcia Lueches plays the other characters \u2013 parents, priests and, most magnificently, Jesus himself. The pair bring the show to life with a musical number for each chapter, moving through acoustic ballads to high-octane pop, all with a Latin twist.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2",

These recipes are wonderful on their own, but even better with some flatbread on the side. Charred aubergine is such a classic way to cook this vegetable, and popular in so many countries across the eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and south-east Asia. The cooked flesh cooks beautifully and holds a wonderful smokiness that really imparts itself into the dip, adding extra depth. Koftas, meanwhile, are always crowd-pleasing for kids and adults alike, and the harissa yoghurt and burnt orange really complement the spice. Both are perfect as a main meal or as part of a bigger feast for sharing.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/20/lamb-koftas-with-smoky-aubergine-salad-recipe-sabrina-ghayour\">Continue reading...</a>",
