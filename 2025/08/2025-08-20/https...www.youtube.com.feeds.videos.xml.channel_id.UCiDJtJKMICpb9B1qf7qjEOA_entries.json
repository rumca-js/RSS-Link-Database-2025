        "description": "We are THRILLED to debut the first in our series of videos from the National Park Service museum conservation lab, part of the Harpers Ferry Center in West Virginia! The lab works on artifacts from all U.S. national parks, treating everything from textiles and paper to wood and metals to leather and plastic. Textile conservation post-graduate fellow Maeve O'Shea and objects conservation post-graduate fellow Daisy Greenwell kick things off for Adam Savage by introducing him to a deteriorated 1860s flag with a colorful history, describing the condition (and mysteries!) of the flag when they received it, and how they're restoring it to some of its former glory. We hope (and think!) you'll enjoy this fascinating dive into history and science as much as we did!\n\nNational Park Museum Conservation Lab: https://www.nps.gov/subjects/hfc/museum-conservation-services.htm\nNational Park Service: https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\n\nIf you'd like to support the work of the NPS museum conservation lab, yo",
