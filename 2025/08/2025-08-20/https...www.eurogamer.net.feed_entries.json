A single 16-pin power cable maxes out at 600W, so the ROG Matrix uses both the proprietary BTF connector built into Asus motherboards <em>and</em> the regular 16-pin power input. That should make this the most powerful consumer graphics card in the world by a huge margin, and just how it's been designed is fascinating. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/this-rtx-5090-graphics-card-draws-up-to-800w-and-looks-like-a-model-from-2008\">Read more</a></p>",

It's part Witcher, part Vampire, part Kingdom Come, and if the modest Polish team can deliver what it's promising, Blood of the Dawnwalker could be great.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-vampirey-witcher-alike-blood-of-the-dawnwalker-is-fast-becoming-one-of-my-most-anticipated-rpgs\">Read more</a></p>",

Their stings are more dangerous than those of bees, and as a genus they are generally considered some of the most vicious insects out there. Their stings can kill (and about 62 deaths a year are attributed to hornets in the US alone). Makes sense that you'd use one for a video game protagonist then.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/not-only-is-hollow-knight-silksong-real-ive-played-it-and-its-harder-and-faster-than-the-original-but-is-it-better\">Read more</a></p>",

Admittedly I was trying to be ironic - it was about how fun it is to smash big mechs into each other! - but also admittedly, there is something about this series that just makes me get a bit over-excited. The original Dawn of War, which took your little villagers in from the cold and turned resource generation into a game of take-and-hold, is a legendary part of the grand RTS tapestry - and it's also a personal, formative game of mine.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-and-it-feels-like-the-sequel-to-the-original-that-rts-fans-always-wanted\">Read more</a></p>",
