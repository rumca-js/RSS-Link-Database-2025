In the near term (today\u201310 years), humans would likely retain the upper hand due to physical dominance, energy control, and the fragility of current AI. Over the long term (20+ years), if advanced AI gains autonomy, scalability, and direct access to physical systems (drones, robotics, cyberwarfare), AI could become far more powerful than humans.</p> <p>Step-by-Step Reasoning Highlights</p> <ol> <li>Current State (Short Term, 0\u201310 years) <ul> <li>AI depends on human-built data centers, electricity, and hardware.</li> <li>Humans can shut down networks, power grids, or servers.</li> <li>AI has no independent manufacturing or resource acquisition.</li> <li>Result: Humans win through resource denial.</li> </ul></li> <li>Medium Term (10\u201320 y",
