        "description": "What parts of yourself did you lose as you grew up? This is one of the central questions asked in Ashley C. Ford\u2019s memoir, Somebody\u2019s Daughter. Ashley joins Chris to talk about growing up with an incarcerated father, grappling with a complicated relationship with her mother, and how writing can be a way of processing and understanding your life. They also discussed why adults become less kind to kids, how libraries can become safezones, and how to confront the messy parts of childhood.\n\nFollow\nHost: Chris Duffy (Instagram: @chrisiduffy | chrisduffycomedy.com)\nGuest: Ashley C.
