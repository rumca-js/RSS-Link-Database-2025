        "description": "Watching back the collapse of the Twin Towers and Building 7 with fresh eyes, the questions hit harder than ever. Was 9/11 really just as we were told\u2014or was it the spark that exposed how crises become opportunities for the most powerful? From pulverized concrete and demolition-like footage to the profits of Big Pharma, Big Tech, and the military-industrial complex after both 9/11 and COVID, the pattern is clear: disaster leads to control. The real lesson isn\u2019t in the rubble, but in how easily fear and chaos are weaponized to strip away freedom.\n\n[STREAMED]\n\nThis is from our 9/11 watch along, to continue watching the show in full, join me exclusively over on RUMBLE: https://bit.ly/SF600-live\n\nGo to http://rumble.com/premium/brand and use code BRAND to save $10 on your annual subscription\n\nWATCH me LIVE Monday - Thursday on Rumble: https://bit.ly/russellbrand-rumble\n\nAll links: https://linktr.ee/RussellBrand",
