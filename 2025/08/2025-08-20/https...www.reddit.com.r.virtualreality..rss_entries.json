As much as I\u2019m enjoying the 3S, I want to upgrade to a more premium product. The problem is that every premium product available on the market is really just an upgrade path from the Index. All the headsets from Bigscreen Beyond 2, Varjo, and Pimax require base stations and Index controllers. This is a problem, since on the Steam store they\u2019re all sold out. Even if they were in stock, the controllers alone cost $369 CAD and the base stations are $200 each. That means there\u2019s no financially reasonable upgrade path unless I\u2019m willing to spend $1500 to $2000 on a headset plus another $1000 or more on accessories. So right now, I\u2019m just in limbo waiting for either the Quest 4 or the mythical Valve Deckard.
