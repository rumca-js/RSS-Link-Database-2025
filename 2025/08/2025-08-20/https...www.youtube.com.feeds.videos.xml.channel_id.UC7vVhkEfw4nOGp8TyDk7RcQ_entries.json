This work is part of a collaboration between AI research teams at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) and Boston Dynamics. We have been building end-to-end language-conditioned policies that enable Atlas to accomplish long-horizon manipulation tasks.\n\nLearn more about this research: https://bosdyn.co/4mwB2Gz\nDiscover more from TRI:  @toyotaresearchinstitute and https://www.tri.global/ \nRegister for our upcoming webinar to learn more about humanoids in the real-world: https://bosdyn.co/3UuZLPg",
