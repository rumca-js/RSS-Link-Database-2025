To my eyes, it&#39;s as good or better than any CRT I&#39;ve owned (though admittedly I&#39;m not a purist). I recently sold my Trinitron and PVM and now I&#39;m wondering if I should move away from actual console hardware into console emulation. The thing is, I&#39;d still like to use the RT4K for it&#39;s unmatched upscaling and CRT effects. Does anyone else have that kind of setup? What does it look like hardware and cable-wise? Or, am I wasting my time and should stick to actual console hardware.
