It\u2019s like having someone do your morning market research so you just get the highlights. Dia can summarize whatever page you are on, which is great for quick reading, but it cannot go out and collect info from other sites or pull it together into a full report.</p> <p>For writing, Dia works more like a writing buddy to me. It throws out title ideas, suggests angles and polishes sentences. If I am staring at a blank page it is good at giving me a push to start. Fellou can handle text too, but it\u2019s more about taking stuff I\u2019ve already written and running tasks with it rather than helping me come up with the content ",
