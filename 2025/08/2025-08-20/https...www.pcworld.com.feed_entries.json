AMD\u2019s Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) provides a simple way to enhance Ryzen CPU performance. Building on the existing Precision Boost technology, which automatically increases clock rates based on load, temperature, and power supply, PBO allows for even more generous operating conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The processor can run longer and more frequently in the more powerful Turbo mode. If you wish, you can also use the so-called \u201cCurve Optimizer\u201d to reduce voltage (undervolting) and further improve efficiency.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"imageId\":\"68a5e818dd6ea\"}' data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\" class=\"wp-block-image size-full wp-lightbox-container\"><img decoding=\"async\" data-wp-class--hide",

My area is an internet dead zone where you might get a bit of 4G on a nearby hill, but that\u2019s about it. No cellular for phone calls, and the best I can hope from a landline connection is 3 Mbps. As a modern man with a modern family full of modern devices, I need fast internet\u2014so I readied Starlink even before my kids\u2019 beds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It worked pretty well, too. At first I heard a bunch of buzzing noises that I was <em>not</em> expecting, but that sort of coil whine is apparently pretty typical. A few minutes later, I was online!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it wasn\u2019t all smooth sailing. Having Starlink isn\u2019t like having fiber internet, and I ran into several surprises along the way. Here are all the things I wish I\u2019d known before getting Starlink at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class",
