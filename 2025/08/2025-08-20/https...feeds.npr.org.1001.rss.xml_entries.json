They wanted to restore the ecosystem and get the elk population, which had decimated the plant community, in check. And it worked \u2013 or so the popular narrative suggests. But is it really so simple? Today on the show, we explore how the Yellowstone ecosystem has changed since wolves returned and whether those changes can really be pinned solely on wolves. Plus, how the narrative of the Yellowstone wolf legacy could affect wolf reintroduction elsewhere.<br><br><em>Curious about other science controversies?
