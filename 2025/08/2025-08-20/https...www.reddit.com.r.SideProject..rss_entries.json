Wanted something that could handle markdown files properly, maybe with some syntax highlighting for code. So I built \u201cSmackdown\u201d - a basic markdown viewer.</p> <p>Then feature creep happened. Hard.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if it could handle PDFs too?\u201d \u201cWhy not add EPUB support?\u201d \u201cCould probably render Mermaid diagrams\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Fast forward to today: <strong>Telescopo Universal Viewer</strong> handles 70+ file formats and I\u2019m not sure how I got here lol.</p> <p>What it actually does:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Documents:</strong> PDF, EPUB, Markdown (all variants), DOCX, DOC, RTF</li> <li><strong>Code files:</strong> Syntax highlighting for Swift, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, Java, C/C++, Ruby, PHP, Kotlin, etc.</li> <li",
