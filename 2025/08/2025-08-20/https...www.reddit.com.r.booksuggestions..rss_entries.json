I tried a book jar already, but, unfortunately, I need something more visual and/or exciting than just the title of the book on a folded piece of paper.</p> <p>I found this really amazing website called Recommend Me a Book, where you read the first page of a random book. At the end, you can either reveal the title and the author or go on to the next first page \u2014 and so on, until you find one that tickles your fancy. This is such an amazing idea, but their catalogue is SO poor (especially when considering foreign books \u2014 English is not my first language, and I have a bunch of unread books in my first and third languages that do not exist in their database).</p> <p><strong>Do you have any other suggestions on random book pickers?
