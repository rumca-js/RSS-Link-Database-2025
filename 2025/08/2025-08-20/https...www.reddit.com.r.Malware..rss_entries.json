FileFix has a similar principle except it instead uses the File Explorer. Here\u2019s how it works</p> <p>A malicious website can force a Windows Explorer window to open on a victim\u2019s computer. At the same time, hidden JavaScript on the site secretly places a disguised PowerShell command onto the victim\u2019s clipboard. The user is then told to paste what looks like a file path into the Explorer address bar. But instead of being a real path, the pasted text is actually a concealed PowerShell command. Once Enter is pressed, Explorer runs the command, which downloads and installs malware without showing any alerts or command prompts.</p> <p>To the victim, it seems like they\u2019re just accessing a normal shared file or folder, making the action feel harmless. This deception makes FileFix an even stealthier and more dangerous variant of the earlier ClickFix",
