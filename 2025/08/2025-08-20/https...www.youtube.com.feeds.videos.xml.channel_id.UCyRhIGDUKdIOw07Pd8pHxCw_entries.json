        "description": "Available Now: https://www.dvgiochi.com/catalogo/rumblebots-ita/\n\nRumblebots is a fast-paced deck management game where you build a squad of fighting machines and throw them into the arena. Across six rounds you\u2019ll recruit, recycle, and level up Bots during the Build Phase and then let them clash it out in the Battle Phase. The last team standing claims victory, while the winner upgrades their workshop with powerful crystals to keep the chaos going. It\u2019s all about synergy, strategy, and a little robo-smackdown energy.\n\n#boardgames #games #gamenight #gaming #tabletop #tabletopgames #shorts",
