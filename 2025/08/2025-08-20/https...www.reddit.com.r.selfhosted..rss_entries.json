This makes it different from any other alternative I&#39;d been able to find.

So I&#39;ve been running a bunch of LLM-related tools lately (local AI assistants, code completion servers, document analyzers, etc.), and while they&#39;re super useful, I&#39;m really uncomfortable with how much access they have. Like if you&#39;re using something like OpenCode with MCP servers, you&#39;re basically giving it an open door to your entire system and network.</p> <p>I finally built something to solve this that could be used for any Docker services - it&#39;s a Docker container called network-filter that acts like a strict firewall for your other containers. You tell it exactly which domains are allowed, and it blocks everything else at the network level.</p> <p>The cool part is it uses iptables and dnsmasq under the hood to drop ALL traffic except what you explicitly whitelist.
