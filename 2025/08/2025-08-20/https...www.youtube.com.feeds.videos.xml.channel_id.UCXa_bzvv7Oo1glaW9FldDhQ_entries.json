        "description": "Midnight Murder Club is a new small-scale competitive shooter with a unique twist on the genre: the game\u2019s setting of Wormwood Manor is shrouded in darkness, and players will have to embrace this darkness in order to survive and take out their opponents. To accomplish this task, each player is equipped with a gun and a flashlight. While the flashlight can be used to help you get your bearings, it also comes with the major drawback of also making you visible to your enemies.\n\nUnfortunately, despite its unique twist and clever ideas, Midnight Murder Club feels like it needs quite a bit more time in development before it can be readily recommended. The game lacks a proper tutorial, leaving new players with only two frustrating options: jump into online matches and get repeatedly killed, or practice against bots. Unfortunately, the bots are also only available in a couple of game modes. This, combined with an incredibly low population, means that Midnight Murder Club may not be worth your",

        "description": "Another month, another Geoff Keighley-hosted showcase that felt like, well, more of a show rather than a momentous event. Such was Gamescom Opening Night Live, kicking off the four-day trade fair, but that doesn't mean it didn't have some pretty big announcements or trailers. Off the top of my head, Ghost of Yotei Legends, Silent Hill f, Ninja Gaiden 4, and, of course, Hollow Knight: Silksong made some of the biggest impressions. Then there's Resident Evil Requiem, which felt more like a smaller piece of reveals to come.\n\nThe \u201cexclusive new look,\u201d as Keighley hyped it up to be, was a blast from the past \u2013 a look at Grace Ashcroft when she was younger. It starts with Alyssa Ashcroft, her mother, returning from what's doubtless a long day of work (which Grace herself indicates with no small amount of frustration). The latter types away on her computer like, and let's not mince words, a nerd, asking for her mother's hand but also pulling it away when told to get some sleep. But then the ",
