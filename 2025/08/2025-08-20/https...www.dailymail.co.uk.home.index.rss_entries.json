        "description": "A few skirt trends have caught my eye this season, but often the prettiest looks are not the most practical. Those satin slip skirts with lingerie-like lace trims? Lovely, but a bit clingy if you've ever had a baby/have just eaten a massive lunch. White midi skirts? I love the freshness, but can guarantee I'd have tea or toothpaste on there within five minutes. The lace maxi skirt however - now that is a trend I've got on board with, and I'm very pleased with my purchase.",
