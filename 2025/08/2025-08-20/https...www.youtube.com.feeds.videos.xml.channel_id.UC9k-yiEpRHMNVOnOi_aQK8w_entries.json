        "description": "A woman collapsed in joy after winning a piece of history at an auction. Her winning bid of $520,000 nabbed a dress once owned by Princess Diana. Renae Plant shared a special connection to the dress. An image shows Plant's hand about to shake Princess Diana's hand back in 1988 when Diana wore the dress for the first time during a visit to Australia, where Plant grew up. The dress is known as the \"caring dress.\" Inside Edition was with Plant when she went to Julien's Auction House in Los Angeles to pick it up.",
