Over the past couple of months, I\u2019ve been experimenting with how LLMs like GPT can be integrated deeper into my daily coding routine not just for &quot;clever hacks,&quot; but as part of an actual productivity pipeline.</p> <p>One thing I noticed early on: writing good prompts consistently is <em>annoyingly</em> time-consuming. Most of us just type quick phrases, hoping the AI reads our minds and then waste time tweaking the results.</p> <p>So I started using a prompt &quot;refiner&quot; basically, I input my raw idea (\u201coptimize webpack config for dev/prod\u201d), and it outputs a fully structured prompt that the AI understands better. Surprisingly, the difference in the quality of the output has been significant.</p> <p>This pairs well with practice platforms that let you test things hands-on (I\u2019ve been using one lately that gives real code",
