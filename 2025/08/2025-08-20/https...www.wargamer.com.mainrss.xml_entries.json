It\u2019s a bat-inspired Pok\u00e9mon that exudes vampiric flair and looks downright adorable with its oversized mouth and little teeth.</p>\n<p>Naturally, I\u2019m thrilled that Mega has faithfully designed a set in Golbat's honor. Right now, you can score a massive 58% discount on the Mini Motion Golbat set over at Amazon US (or a 10% saving in the UK). It's available for $13.50, down from a chunkier $32.39. Forget Pikachu.
