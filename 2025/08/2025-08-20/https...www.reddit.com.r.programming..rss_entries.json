Is it worth buying a 2017 iMac with an i5 just to run Xcode and export my games from Unity?</p> <p>Also, if I use a 2017 iMac, will I face any limitations when exporting games to the App Store? For example, could Apple flag my app as risky because I\u2019m using an older machine, or are there features I won\u2019t be able to access?</p> <p>The idea is not only to export unity games, also any other type of app I work on.</p> <p>I\u2019m asking because I don\u2019t want to make an investment that ends up being useless.
