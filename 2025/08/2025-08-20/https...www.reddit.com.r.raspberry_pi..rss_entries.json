I\u2019m looking into developing games/demos for the Evercade, and I\u2019ve seen a few devs say that they optimised their games on Raspberry Pi first. I do actually have one but it\u2019s so old (possibly Pi 2???) that it\u2019s from when Maplin still existed in the UK lol, plus I use it for my Dreamcast, so I\u2019m thinking of getting another. Either Zero W or Zero 2 W. Evercade devices use ARM, Linux and OpenGL ES 2.0. Older devices and Super Pocket have 256MB of RAM, while the newer ones have 512MB of RAM. Both Zero W and Zero 2 W have 512MB, and both seem to have 1GHz CPU. Evercade has 1.2-1.5 GHz CPU. Zero 2 W has a GPU, while Zero W and I think the Evercade too doesn\u2019t have one? Zero 2 W seems to support both 1.1 and 2.0 for OpenGL ES.</p> <p>Any tips for those who have used Raspberry Pi and/or Evercade for game dev or projects? Many Thanks! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Blayer98\"> /u/Blayer98 </a> <br/>",

In the typical application from the datasheet it says 3.3V to 2.5V but im using the 3.3V version so its 5V to 3.3V. I got the 5V from the VUSB pin and feed the 3.3V to the VSYS Pin.
