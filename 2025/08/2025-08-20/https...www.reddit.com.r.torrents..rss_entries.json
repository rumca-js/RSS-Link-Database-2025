However, Since I&#39;m a beginner I have some questions and hopefully y&#39;all are helpful because I&#39;ve looked online and found next to nothing.</p> <p>I live in Australia, and I&#39;m wondering if I need a VPN or if it&#39;s safe without one? (The last thing I want is to have my connection taken away) If I do need a VPN, what is recommended?</p> <p>What should I do on MAM to up my ratio? I was going to buy a VIP membership as I have the coins for 4 weeks but I don&#39;t have any ratio status.</p> <p>If anyone has anymore tips as someone who has just started on MAM, please feel free to share because I&#39;m still super lost but getting there \ud83e\udee0</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdAggressive4828\"> /u/AdAggressive4828 ",
