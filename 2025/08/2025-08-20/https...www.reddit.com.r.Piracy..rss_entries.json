There are plenty of torrents that are more popular than what&#39;s on the front page but the rolling 7-day window bumps them off.</p> <p>There&#39;s no option to sort by seeders to find what&#39;s popular, even though that feature is available for search results.

For example, I did find pokemon unbound/pokemon xg ng/and grand collosseum all pre patched and was able to play immediately after download. I am using my steam deck for this so its just harder installing mods/patchs myself so thats why I am looking for an easier alternative.</p> <p>Second question: I know there is pc ported games out there such as harikan zeldas, mario 64, etc and others such as &quot;decked&quot; edition games like god of war. Pretty much the same as above, is there any reliable places to find these without any extra work required? </p> <p>While I understand its not impossible to do myself, using the deck is a bit cumbersome and easy to make simple mistakes without realizing.

I&#39;m not good with computers, and my 18th birthday is in a few days, so I&#39;m getting concerned about possible legal repercussions and stuff even though I don&#39;t distribute anything, I know prosecution is unlikely, but still possible. I downloaded Proton VPN, and I was wondering if this will protect me from getting caught downloading my books through Anna&#39;s Archive/something similar like Z Library or Libgen? How can I better understand how the system works to avoid getting into trouble?

Unfortunately, Anna&#39;s nor anywhere else has the particular book I need, and libgen was my go-to (or my school&#39;s pdf share, which is no longer). I&#39;ve checked loads of sites individually but I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a better way to search. I&#39;m still at level 1 (or 2? lol) torrenting so lmk if I&#39;m asking the wrong questions. Do I just need to eat it and pay money? (Or use an older version and do my best). Thank you in advance!
