Melling, the Anita Blake series by Laurel K. Hamilton, Charles De Lint (Blue Girl, Wolf moon..), and anything Scott Westerfield. </p> <p>While some of these may not be very complex or mature in comparison to books I\u2019m drawn to as an adult, i still find myself re-reading many of these every few years out of nostalgia. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Suspicious_Claim_191\"> /u/Suspicious_Claim_191 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1",

Elliott is one of the grandmasters of the fantasy genre, so the prose compares favorably to the bulk of epic fantasies published today. For most seasoned fantasy readers, the story will feel a bit familiar and tropey, but the execution is so refined that I still found much to enjoy the experience. </p> <p>It\u2019s important to consider <em>King\u2019s Dragon</em> in the context of its time. The epic fantasy genre has <em>exploded</em> since the \u201890s. Elliott didn\u2019t invent any of the tropes that she\u2019s playing with here, but they weren\u2019t quite as tired in 1997 as they may seem to contemporary readers.

I mean, no matter what we\u2019ve been through we all need to laugh. My Coop series is humorous in a different way. There\u2019s no trauma in Coop\u2019s world, just the constant frustration of being a good thief in a world that doesn\u2019t always appreciate such a niche skill.

Some time ago I read the Masters &amp; Magic trilogy by Miles Cameron and had a blast. It showed the world in a transition between a medieval(ish) and the modern period: The characters wore armor and fought with longswords and pistols, the light cavalry used bows beside carbines and so on. I liked that setting, because I think that knights (or other armored fighters) are cool and guns are also cool, so the combination is even better for me!<br/> Over the years I read a lot of Flintlock Fantasy/Magic &amp; Musket, like the Powder Mage or The Shadow Campaigns series, and I absolutely enjoyed it.

What the story is precisely <em>about</em> is harder to decipher.
