I mostly game on my PC and I like to tinker with hardware settings, fan curves, and, most recently, mouse acceleration. In Windows, I have everything dialed in using Adrenaline, Fan Control, and Raw Accel, and not having control of those things in Linux might be a deal breaker for me. So my question: what is available to me on Linux and can serve as replacements for these applications? Teach me like I\u2019m 3 lol thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nobleEdge\"> /u/nobleEdge </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mv2dva/interested_in_switching_from_windows_but/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mv2dva/interested_in_switching_from_windows_but/\">[comments]</a></span>",
