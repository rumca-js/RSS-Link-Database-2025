At Gamescom, we got to go hands-on with the game, and you can check out the new gameplay in the video below.</p><p>As the game was delayed time and time again, fans became increasingly angsty about when it would actually be released. But here we are, and yes, we've played it, but there's a small caveat...which we'll get into.</p><p>While it's not the best audio, so you can't appreciate the somber tones of Christopher Larkin's score, you get the idea of how Hornet moves and how her attacks work.
