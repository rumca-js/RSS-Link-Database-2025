        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we\u2019ll do an even deeper dive into the problem of illiterate foreign truck drivers on our roads. This is a much bigger issue than most people realize. The details are truly shocking. Also, President Trump continues his campaign to make the Smithsonian pro-American again. Is this a worthwhile fight? I say it is and I\u2019ll explain. And the anti-man feminists in the media have invented a new term to denigrate men. It\u2019s called \u201cmankeeping.\u201d\n\nEp.1643\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/shorts/RB4uVSDjAKA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXMT72Z7rd0\nhttps://imgur.com/a/c5BARLj\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQbOKVT5x-E\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4XdlNL8\nhttps://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e846f5a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x675+0+23/resize/1280x720!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7e%2F7d%2Facde9d1e4e1b8141817667cafc47%2Fsingh2.jpg\nhttps://imgur.com/a/4XdlNL8\nhttps://x.com/unlimited_ls/status/1957547486005829913\nhttps",
