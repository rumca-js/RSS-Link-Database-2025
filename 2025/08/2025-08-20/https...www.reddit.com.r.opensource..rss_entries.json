I&#39;m a huge fan of shipwreck hunting and the wonders of navel vessels as well. Aside from that, I love opensource stuff so I made it opensource! (I use Linux)</p> <p>At the moment, I&#39;ve added the ships that are the most nostalgic to me as I&#39;ve seen a few in person but I&#39;m still working to try to document more ships and their locations as well as adding more info as to why they sunk and who owns said ship. </p> <p>So far, we have an interactive map, 7 map styles, an account system and a submission system too. My project is 100% community ran so adding ships and features might take some time. Note this is a very new project so much is subject to change.</p> <p>If your interested, check it out! <a href=\"https://github.com/Alfredredbird/Open-Wrecks\">https://github.com/Alfredredbird/Open-Wrecks</a></p> <p>Much love mates!</p> </div><!-- SC_O",

Think of it as Redis\u2019s younger cousin who\u2019s obsessed with time travel.</p> <p>Right now it does the basics: <code>Set</code>, <code>Get</code>, <code>Delete</code>. On top of that, it supports TTLs (both relative and absolute), a compare-and-set for safe updates, and an append-only history log so you can ask <em>\u201cwhat did this key look like yesterday at 3pm?\u201d</em> with <code>get_when</code>.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a <code>SweepExpired</code> to clean up dead keys \u2014 though I\u2019m leaning toward making them tombstones instead, so the history stays consistent. Aside from adding mutexes for concurrency, it\u2019s basically done for v1.</p> <p>A couple things I think are fun:</p> <ul> <li>You can literally rewind state like a DVR.</li> <li>Everything is just stdlib Go \u2014 no giant deps.</li> <li>It\u2019s simple to hack on, but could ",
