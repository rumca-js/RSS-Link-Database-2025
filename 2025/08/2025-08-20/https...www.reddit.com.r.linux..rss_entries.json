So, after installing Debian 12 I get a config error which I was told indicated incompatibility with the hardware. I then go and get the new release hoping this will resolve the issue... it does not. When I boot into BIOS/UEFI I see 3 options, Debian 12 and two named for my USB with the .iso file for Debian 13. If I choose Debian 12 I get the install screen but the same config error after install, I eventually end up at a &quot;terminal&quot; where I can input my usern",
