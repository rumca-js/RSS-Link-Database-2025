However, one major challenge we encounter is Python's inherent slowness as an interpreted language. In this talk, we propose a paradigm shift by redefining our approach as C++/Python, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between the two languages. By leveraging various binding tools, we can significantly accelerate Python's performance and unlock its true potential. We will explore many binding tools and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each one. We will explore CPython and understand GIL pitfalls. By the end of this talk, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of various binding tool",
