Last month Noelia N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 33, a member of the PP\u2019s steering committee, was forced to admit that she had never in fact completed her double degree in law and public administration. She apologised, and stood down \u2013 a move rarely seen in the country.</p><p>Since then, however, N\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s contrition seems to have launched a trend, with a wave of mea culpas from politicians of various parties rushing to revise \u2013 downwards \u2013 their educational achievements. Some have even resigned, emulating N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who said: \u201cI apologise to anyone who feels disappointed but I also believe it\u2019s not enough to say sorry\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/05/wave-of-spanish-politicians-edit-cvs-over-incorrect-claims-of-degrees-and-diplomas\">Continue readin",

Palestine had just had their dreams of the 2026 World Cup ended by a last-minute Oman penalty that was as soft as they come. While some players in white fell to their knees or collapsed crying into the arms of coaching staff, the 26-year-old, with scrunched-up shorts, exited stage left to head to the United States and the global stage of the Club World Cup with Egypt\u2019s Al-Ahly, after impressing so much on the African and Asian one.</p><p>Now, after this busiest of summers, the Danish-born star has signed for Columbus Crew \u2013 a No 9 for one of MLS\u2019s best teams in need of one, and one who takes up one of the team\u2019s allotment of designated player spots, to boot.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/05/how-palestin",
