I&#39;m not really picky, I just want to read about a hot shadow daddy catching feelings for the MC. I&#39;m a bit picky when it comes to writing style, so I&#39;d like recommendations for books that don&#39;t read like a Wattpad fanfic (been there, done that). I also don&#39;t like overly aggressive male characters that reek of toxic masculinity. \ud83d\ude2c</p> <p>Also, there is this one book where Hades falls in love with the main character, but I cannot for the life of me remember the title. If that rings a bell please let me know! \ud83e\udef6</p> <p>Tysm in advance you guys and happy reading! \u2728\ufe0f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Slayolophosaurus\"> /u/Slayolophosaurus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mijb",
