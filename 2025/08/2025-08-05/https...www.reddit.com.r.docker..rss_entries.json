Am I the one missing out? The thing that makes me more worried about self hosting services on Docker is that the folder structure is different compared to Windows. Thats why I dont use any VMs (I dont like my files being &quot;encapsulated&quot; on a box that I cant simply access).</p> <p>Have anyone ever had any problem related to file system overlays or something like that?</p> <p>Thanks:)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rusa-raus\"> /u/rusa-raus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1mif6ez/is_docker_that_good/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1mif6ez/is_docker_that_good/\">[comments]</a></span>",
