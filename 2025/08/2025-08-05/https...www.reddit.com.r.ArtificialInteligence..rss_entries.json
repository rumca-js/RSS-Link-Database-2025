The multimodal reasoning works well enough, but it gets stuck in these reasoning loops sometimes and response times are pretty slow compared to hitting an API. Their GitHub shows they&#39;ve bumped their GAIA score to 79.07 now, but honestly there&#39;s a noticable gap between what the benchmarks suggest and how it feels to actually use.</p> <p>Starting to wonder if we\u2019re optimizing too hard for benchmark wins and not enough for real-world usability.Anyone else tried R1V2 (or other Skywork models) and noticed this benchmark vs reality gap?</p> </div><!-- SC",
