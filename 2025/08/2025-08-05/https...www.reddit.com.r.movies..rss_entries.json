(In a just universe we&#39;d have had a half-dozen of these instead of those Jack Sparrow movies, but anyway.) This is one of those titles that maybe wasn&#39;t a box-office smash at the time, but it remains very highly regarded, and its reputation as the ultimate &quot;dad movie&quot; has only grown over the years. It&#39;s based on a long-running series of books, so the setup could clearly support an ongoing franchise if the box-office was there. Or even just a one-off &quot;Aubrey and Maturin&#39;s Last Adventure&quot; movie would be welcome.</p> <p>We still have Crowe and Bettany. I know Weir&#39;s retired, but I could see a Villeneuve, or even a Robert Eggers with his devotion to historical accuracy, picking up the reins, if he wanted to take a break from horror movies.
