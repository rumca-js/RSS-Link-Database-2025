Got also pretty good feedback and managed to even have couple of customer development sessions.</p> <p>Now i&#39;m thinking what to do next.<br/> - Do i need to incorporate (LLS or .Inc-c), configure Stripe&#39;s checkout and start charging?</p> <p>I still consider 15 users as too low to validate the idea. My overall expenses to support my project are not high and I can cover it myself because I also do 9-5.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of starting some relatively cheap ads on IG, Facebook, X not to gain users but rather to validate more.
