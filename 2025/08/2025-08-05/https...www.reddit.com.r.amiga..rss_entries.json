What fascinated me at the time was that you could press the number keys or maybe the function keys and that would directly influence which bits of the track would play and so you could create your own mix variations. </p> <p>I&#39;ve recently purchased a Pi 400 and I&#39;m having a great time rediscovering games and applications. I even found a stack of Amiga disks earlier which have survived two house moves. I&#39;m looking to buy a Greaseweazle so that I can see what&#39;s on them.</p> <p>Anyway if anyone remembers the above, I&#39;m not sure if it was a demo or what but if anyone can tell me what it is called, that would be great.

I also work on a proprietary version of FreeBSD professionally and was wondering how I could use that knowledge. So I took a look at Amiga emulation on FreeBSD and there is FS-UAE but that is rather old.</p> <p>Amiberry seems like a great idea but didn&#39;t work. So after a little bit of coding, we got FreeBSD support merged into Amiberry. Amiberry will now compile and run on FreeBSD and has full working JIT support as well.</p> <p>I got AmiKit working as my test.</p> <p>There is currently no Amiberry package or port(if you are familiar with FreeBSD&#39;s ports collection), but that may come in the future.</p> <p>So for the 1 or 2 users who like FreeBSD in the Desktop space like me, you can now use Amiga on FreeBSD.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",
