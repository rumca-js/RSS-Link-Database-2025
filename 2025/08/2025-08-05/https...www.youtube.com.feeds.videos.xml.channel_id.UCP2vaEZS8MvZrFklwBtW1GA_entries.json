        "description": "Bathroom exhaust fan removal tips\u2026I take off the grill by squeezing the springs. I\u2019m wearing the Ironclad Command A6 foam nitrile gloves, their ANSI A6 cut resistance keeps my hands safe from sharp sheet metal. I remove the fan body from the joist with a superbar and cut the wire because there was plenty up in the ceiling. Many thanks to Ironclad for sponsoring this video \ud83d\udd25#exhaustfan #bathroomremodel #handsafety #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
