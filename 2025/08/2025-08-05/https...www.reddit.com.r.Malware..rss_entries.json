I searched for it thoroughly in the downloads folder, app settings, control panel, task manager\u2014but it wasn&#39;t found. I checked the downloads bar in my browser, it just states &#39;canceled&#39;, but is this enough to know that it doesn&#39;t exist in my PC anymore? Could it possibly still be lurking in my system? I want to know before I run a full reset, is the full scan and offline scan in Microsoft Defender enough to detect a possibly hidden PUP? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Upset-Owl-4422\"> /u/Upset-Owl-4422 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1mhur2k/potentially_unwanted_pro",
