Rather than raising prices and then giving you the chance to\u00a0switch to a new, cheaper, \u201cwith ads\u201d tier, Amazon added commercials to its standard tier, and you must pay more to turn the ads <em>off</em>.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, want to get rid of the commercials? (And yes, there are more of them than there used to be.) Here\u2019s what you do, along with how much it\u2019ll cost you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"how-to-turn-off-the-ads-on-amazon-prime-video\">How to turn off the ads on Amazon Prime Video</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To nix the commercial breaks on Amazon Prime Video (well, most of them anyway\u2013more on that in a bit), you\u2019ll",
