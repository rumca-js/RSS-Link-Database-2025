I\u2019m nonbinary, and he\u2019s been accepting of it and aware of it since the beginning of our relationship.</p> <p>Occasionally throughout our relationship he\u2019s shown hints(?) that he might not be fully cis or gnc as well, and while I took note of it I didn\u2019t really think much of it since it could be nothing. Honestly, I\u2019m really attracted to his masculinity and the fact that he\u2019s a man, so I guess it kind of freaked me out and pushed me to not think about it too hard.</p> <p>Honestly I still feel pretty new to being nb and gnc, it\u2019s been a weird journey of discovery and questioning myself. Even then, I felt shitty for feeling apprehensive about the idea of my boyfriend being trans/a woman because I guess trans people should be more understanding of each other.</p> <p>Anyway, he told me today that if something changed in his life w",

I came across several vidoes on YouTube based on anime, cosplay and two of them were actually about Femboys wearing their favorite anime outfits and attire. The third was just a guy jamming out in a pink dress, white mask, and pink cat ears. Could have been wolf ears but I think they were cat ears. Anyhow getting off topic. So I looked at the few comments that were made and they were so homophobic and filled with bigotry -.-. I am absolutely sick and tired of people thinking they can verbally abuse and humiliate others through the internet. I am sick of it outsidfe of the internet. Just because someone or some members of society do not understand LGBTQ+ doesn&#39;t give them the right to be cruel but I guess that&#39;s just it isn&#39;t it? They DO NOT CARE!!!!! But I do and I am absolutely tired of it! Let people express themselves the way they want people!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#",
