So is there anything else I can do to either make it more secure with NPM?</p> <p>I see alot of people mentioning a cloudflare tunnel, however the issue with that is I plan on using Nextcloud for cloud storage and see that if you use the cloudflare tunnel, your traffic speed is limited.

I think its pretty good considering all things but won&#39;t really scale, also I dont really like docker host paths :D</p> <p>another approach is to create a NFS mount that is also initialized as a git repository, CI is still needed for the remote git to be the source of truth - not sure how practical this is</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",

I got a ton of great feedback and one request that came up over and over: &quot;When is the iOS version coming?&quot;</p> <p>Well, today&#39;s the day! <strong>The iOS and iPad version is officially live on the App Store!</strong></p> <p><strong>A Quick Word on Pricing</strong></p> <p>After getting a lot of input from you all, I&#39;ve decided to price the Apple app at a one-time purchase of <strong>$9.99</strong>. Here\u2019s the transparent breakdown: this price helps cover Apple&#39;s yearly developer fee based on the interest shown so far. If the app does better than expected, it directly translates into more time I can dedicate to building out new features for everyone. Thank you to everyone who weighed in on this",

Whether it was installing tools, dealing with compatibility problems, or switching between devices, it always felt like unnecessary overhead.

It gives you container-based workspaces that you access in the browser. You get a full Linux environment with a Visual Studio Code interface, the ability to install packages and tools, and support for Docker containers. The goal is to make development environments portable, fast to start, and consistent across any device.</p> <p>Some features:</",
