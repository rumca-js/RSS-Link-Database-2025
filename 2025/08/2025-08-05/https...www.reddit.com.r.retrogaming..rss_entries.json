It&#39;s currently still in development, <a href=\"https://mezzaninesoftware.itch.io/landsword\">but you can play it for free.</a> It has a really nice retro vibe, top down mech combat, destructible environments and it plays really nice. I tried looking online for similar games for the SNES, 32X, Saturn, Dreamcast, PSP, N64, NEO GEO and PS1 but with no luck. Most mech-games from the 90&#39;s are side-scrollers or RPG&#39;s, with some exceptions like Metal Head, GunGriffon or Armored Core 2: Another Age for instance. </p> <p>Does a game similar to Project Landsword exist for any of the retro systems?

The conversations during the game to advance the story are basic dialogue boxes, would have been cool to bring back the &quot;tecmo theater&quot; style. And no sub weapons? Would have liked to see the fire wheel and the other sub weapons make a return. The mechanic of jumping off of enemies, projectiles, etc. reminds me of the Messenger, which I never really clicked with. Not trying to be negative, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a cool game and it&#39;s getting good reviews. I also know it&#39;s a totally new game made by different developers.
