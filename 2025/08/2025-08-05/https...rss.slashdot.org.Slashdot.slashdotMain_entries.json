        "description": "According to two sources Reuters spoke with, Intel is struggling with low yields in its next-gen 18A chip manufacturing process for its next PC chip, Panther Lake. Internal data suggests the company is far from reaching commercially viable production levels, leading some insiders to describe the effort as a \"Hail Mary.\" Reuters reports: For months, Intel has promised investors it would increase manufacturing using a process it calls 18A. It spent billions of dollars developing 18A, including the construction or upgrades of several factories, with the goal of challenging Taiwan's chipmaking heavyweight, TSMC. Intel wants to round out its business designing chips that it largely makes in-house and TSMC helps it produce, with a contract manufacturing business that can compete with this key supplier. But whether Intel revives advanced chip production in the U.S. and gets its contract foundry on solid footing depends on closing the technology gap with TSMC. Early tests disappointed custome",

The company is also promising that users will be able to interact with the worlds for much longer than before and that the model will actually remember where things are when you look away from them. [...] Genie 3 seems like it could be a notable step forward. Users will be able to generate worlds with a prompt that supports a \"few\" minutes of continuous interaction, which is up from the 10-20 seconds of interaction possible with Genie 2, according to a blog post.\n \nGoogle says that Genie 3 can keep spaces in visual memory for about a minute, meaning that if you turn away from something in a world and then turn back to it, things like paint on a wall or writing on a chalkboard will be in the same place. The worlds will also have a 720p resolution and run at 2",

The unprecedented single-month doubling follows speculation that Chinese manufacturer ChangXin Memory Technologies has halted DDR4 production to shift factories toward DDR5 memory for AI applications. \n\nDDR4 currently comprises 60% of desktop PC memory while DDR5 accounts for 40%, per Tokyo-based BCN research. Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology controlled 90% of the global DRAM market in Q2 2025.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=DRAM+Prices+Soar+as+China+Eyes+Self-Reliance+For+High-End+Chips%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fhardware.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F08%2F05%2F1935219%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twi",

From a report: \"We are going to unleash American drone dominance,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at a press conference on Tuesday. \n\nUnder current rules, operators need to get individual waivers or exemptions to use drones without visual line of sight. The department said eliminating those requirements \"will significantly expand the use-case for drone technologies in areas like: manufacturing, farming, energy production, filmmaking, and the movement of products including lifesaving medications.\" \n\nThe proposal includes new requirements for manufacturers, operators, and drone traffic-management services to keep drones safely separated from other drones and airplanes. \"It's going to change the way that people and products move throughout our airspace... so you may change th",

Nature: The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), found that 45 editors handled only 1.3% of all articles published by PLoS ONE from 2006 to 2023, but that the papers they accepted accounted for more than 30% of the 702 retractions that the journal issued by early 2024. \n\nTwenty-five of these editors also authored papers in PLoS ONE that were later retracted. The PNAS authors did not disclose the names of any of the 45 editors. But, by independently analysing publicly available data from PLoS ONE and the Retraction Watch database, Nature's news team has identified five of the editors who handled the highest number of papers that were subsequently retracted by the journal. Together, those editors accepted about 15% of PLoS ONE's retracted papers up to 14 July.<p><div c",

The models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, can run locally on consumer devices and be fine-tuned for specific purposes. Both models use chain-of-thought reasoning approaches first deployed in OpenAI's o1 model and can browse the web, execute code, and function as AI agents. \n\nThe smaller 20-billion-parameter model runs on consumer devices with 16 GB of memory. Gpt-oss-120B model will require about 80 GB of memory. OpenAI said the 120-billion-parameter model performs similarly to the company's proprietary o3 and o4-mini models. The models are available free on Hugging Face under the Apache 2.0 license after safety testing that delayed their March announcement.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=OpenAI+Releases+First+Open-Weight+Models+Since+GPT-2%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fslashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F08",

The Lunar Trailblazer successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 48 minutes after launch. Operators in Pasadena, CA established communication with the satellite at 8:13PM ET, but two-way communication was lost the next day and the team was unable to recover the connection. From the limited data ground teams received before the satellite went dark, the craft's solar arrays were not correctly positioned toward the sun, which caused its batteries to drain. \"While it was not the outcome we had hoped for, mission experiences like Lunar Trailblazer help us to learn and reduce the risk for future, low-cost small satellites to do innovative science as ",
