The campaign has come a long way since the rough state it was in for the Early Access launch, while it still has some rough edges. The road ahead still feels long, and I genuinely hope it has the chance to become everything it wants to be some day. It's already a special game, though, combining the familiar and the fresh into a satisfying RTS experience.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
