I want to play 100s of games a week, but unfortunately I can get as much as 2 games, but they get played 2-3 times during that week. One game is for 3-5 people, and one game is 6+ people. What happens is that I have a collection of roughly 100 games, 50 one 3-5 people, and 50 for 6+ people. When a new week stars, the previous 2 games go on the shelf, and 2 new games come up. Out of those 100-ish games, I think only 2 or 3 are over 2.5/5.0 on the weight scale of complexity, and the rest are much lighter. With that being said, if you would to play a board game for only one week out of the year, and you want to get it fairly quickly to the table, what game would you play? </p> <p>Again, sorry, I know, super specific, but it keeps the FOMO at bay, and usually if one game enters, one leaves because its just a better version of it, etc. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",

For a fairly small footprint game, it had a lot of interesting choices and moving pieces, and some good PvP tension. I especially liked how it was broken into two parts... an Act 1 that takes place on one side of the board (hunting the shark around Amity Island), and then an Act 2 that flips the board over and changes things up (the shark attacks the boat). I&#39;ve seen this approach before in other games, but in Jaws it was so keeping with the spirit of the movie, without feeling disjointed at all. </p> <p>What other good games have two (or more) parts that fit together? I&#39;m not talking about about campaigns that have you sit down to the same game in multiple (perhaps evolving) sessions, but a game that tells its story in multiple distinct parts that play differently.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

I can\u2019t find the minis of them being even resold anywhere seperately. There seem to be bundles of everything for like \u00a3600 which isn\u2019t in my budget at all. But also listings for the KS exclusive version of just the base game. </p> <p>So does anyone know if they for sure are included in the actual box for that? If so I was thinking of buying it and reselling this one. But because this is an old kickstarter product I am finding it hard to find a full listing of the contents and don\u2019t want to buy this and get it wrong.
