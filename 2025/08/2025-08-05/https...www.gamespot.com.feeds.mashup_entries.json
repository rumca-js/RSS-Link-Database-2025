The game will feature a \"preferred input\" matchmaking system, where players using controllers (on Xbox and PlayStation) are primarily matched with other controller users. Likewise, PC players using a mouse and keyboard will be grouped. Cross-play between the two input types will only occur when needed to fill lobbies. This new system aims to reduce input-based advantages while still maintaining quick matchmaking.</p><p>According to producer Alexia Christofi, the game will prioritize keeping players within their preferred community. It will expand to mix platforms when regional player counts are too low for stable matchmaking. This approach is designed to improve fairness in matches while still ensuring low lags and fast match creation. Cr",
