Can I run games that need some form of windows software like powershell to run certain games like stalker gamma? 3. Should I move all of my games that don&#39;t require windows t linux, (I ask this cuz my drive is only 512gb) 4. Does software id use on windows have a lot of open source alternatives such as msi afterburner, logitech ghub, etc? 5. I&#39;ve seen all the cool customization and wonder if it&#39;s easy to do?

I recently bought a second display and I run nvtop on my secondary display to get real time GPU stats while I&#39;m gaming.</p> <p>Diablo IV @ 4K basically maxes out the 8GB VRAM and frequently stutters, freezes and crashes making it effectively unplayable.. 1440P is perfect, obviously</p> <p>I installed Path of Exile 2 playing at 4K and...it&#39;s using about 5-GB VRAM rather than 7.9GB and has been totally stable.</p> <p>My question is simply..why? </p> <p>Why are 2 different games at the same resolution using markedly different amounts of GPU Memory? Is it the gaming engine under the bonnet, or just more efficient coding/textures etc.?</p> <p>I&#39;m genuinely curious, I was going to upgrade to a 4070 Ti Super for 16GB VRAM, but now I&#39;m 50/50.</p> <p>Thanks. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/binary",

I really want to play Fortnite or BF6. &#39;you are so dumb for playing a game thats not supported on linux.&#39; you know what? its OK to use Windows. life is too short and putting up some sort of wild stance about an operating system is so insanely stupid. and everyone who tries to force someone one way or another for an operating system? needs to re-evaluate their life choices. </p> <p>Use whatever operating system youd like to play the games you want to play.</p> <p>99% of everyone crying about microsoft and their privacy are us",

Basically when I open the Steam Client (the native version), after a couple minutes it just closes and immediately opens again, it only happens the first time I open the client, and I can just minimize the window or just close it, but sometimes I start playing and the Steam Client pops up on top of my game and I need to take it away, which isn&#39;t that bad but it becomes a little annoying lol.</p> <p>I just wonder if this happen to anyone else and if there&#39;s a way to make it stop, if there&#39;s not, that&#39;s ok I guess, I can live with it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Oka4902\"> /u/Oka4902 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1mhukb3/not_a_big_deal_but_i_wonder_why_this_happens_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1m",
