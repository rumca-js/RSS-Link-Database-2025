This real-world, long-term study revealed that food processing itself\u2014not just nutrients\u2014plays a significant role in shaping body weight and health outcomes.",

New research shows that while T. rex evolved a skull designed for bone-crushing bites like a modern crocodile, other massive carnivorous dinosaurs like spinosaurs and allosaurs took a very different route \u2014 specializing in slashing and tearing flesh instead.",

        "description": "A group of Chinese scientists has created powerful new tools that allow them to edit large chunks of DNA with incredible accuracy\u2014and without leaving any trace. Using a mix of advanced protein design, AI, and clever genetic tweaks, they\u2019ve overcome major limitations in older gene editing methods. These tools can flip, remove, or insert massive pieces of genetic code in both plants and animals. To prove it works, they engineered rice that\u2019s resistant to herbicides by flipping a huge section of its DNA\u2014something that was nearly impossible before.",
