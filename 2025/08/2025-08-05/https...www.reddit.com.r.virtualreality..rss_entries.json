So now they&#39;re wanting people to pay them for an AI assistant that helps them make games?

It&#39;s like it unanchors from where my eyes are supposed to be and whenever I move my head during that time it just flings and wiggles around but eventually goes back to normal after a maximum of around 20 seconds. Should I factory reset my headset? I did get it 2 years ago.</p> <p>I heard from someone that I should try using Virtual Desktop, or I should try upgrading my RAM.
