I love multiple artists that I listen to daily without a break but most of their music I particularly enjoy is from a few years back and usually gets uploaded to very niche youtube / soundcloud pages that get deleted 3 if not 2 weeks into being made and I just can&#39;t afford to lose music I absolutely love. I though about making this personal archive on my pc but I fear it won&#39;t be secure enough, nor backed up. What are my options? External HDD / SSD? I&#39;m willing to invest in a small backup power generator so nothing gets compromised if let&#39;s say my electricity gets cut for some reason.</p> <p>Thanks in advance! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SaltRelationship9401\"> /u/SaltRelationship9401 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoa",

I&#39;m also planning a transition in the future for switching over to Linux for the desktop as well.</p> <p>With my previous experiences with Linux and NTFS, they don&#39;t act very well together. But windows and btrfs (with the open source driver) works really well in my experience.
