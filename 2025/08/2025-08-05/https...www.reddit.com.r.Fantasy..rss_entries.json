An evocative title, one that spawned a genre of fantasy and SF - Matthew Hughes, Mark Charan Newton and Gene Wolfe, I&#39;m looking at you. This isn&#39;t really a novel or even a fix up - it&#39;s 6 short stories that share a setting and a few characters. They have Vance&#39;s vocabulary on display for sure. The writing is lush, evocative but not overly detailed. The characters though aren&#39;t what many would expect - they are as quick with a sword as a spell and only Liane is as clever, sneaky, boisterous and treacherous as Cugel. And bluntly, the sneaky ones get better characterization than the forthright ones (Liane and Ulan Dhor). Yes, it is definitely a product of it&#39;s time - in how it uses language, how female characters are written and ultimately the plot beats. Still, it was an early one, better than <strong>The Nightlands</s",

I have always been hesitant about watching the show because I have not read the books yet, and I did not know if that would affect my appreciation of the TV show or vice versa, if I watched the show before reading the books. While I usually like shows or books like the Shadowhunters, I have never felt a strong urge to read the Shadowhunters universe books. On top of that, I did start to watch the show a while back, and the first episode was not catching my interest that much. However, I wanted to watch something new, and I saw some scenes on YouTube that made me want to give the show another try, so I decided to give it another try. This time, I pushed myself through the first few episodes, and after that, I started to get captivated by the show. I ended up binge-watching",

The opening hooked me right away \u2014 following Jack Shandy (John Chandagnac) as he\u2019s thrust from a mundane life into a world of pirates, sorcery, and the supernatural was a thrilling premise. Shandy\u2019s transformation from an innocent puppeteer into a reluctant, then confident, \u201cmagic pirate\u201d is one of the book\u2019s strongest arcs. His growth feels earned, and by the end, I was rooting for him not just as a survivor, but as someone who carved out a place for himself in this chaotic, enchanted world.</p> <p>Blackbeard also steals the show every time he\u2019s on the page. Powers\u2019 portrayal of him as a man both terrifying and oddly tragic, especially with his severed, still-living head, adds a surreal edge that elevates him beyond a stock pirate villain. His quest for immortality becomes as desperate as it is fascinating.</p> <p>However,",

What the book is <em>about</em>, though, is a little harder to describe: it&#39;s a depiction of Lanny, who is fey and capricious and whimsical, and Dead Papa Toothwort, who is either an inhabitant or reflection or spirit of the village and the land; it&#39;s a depiction of rural life, and rural people and their relationships; and a (rather scathing) portrayal of how quick people are to sensationalize and capitalize on things, and how quick they are to gossip and assign fault.</p> <p>I adored the way Porter built Dead Papa Toothwort.
