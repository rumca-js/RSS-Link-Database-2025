My existing project parses the SAME headers and posts the messages to Slack but I&#39;m finding that the messages are really generic. To improve on this, I&#39;m looking to use the ENDEC&#39;s dry contacts which close when a message starts and close when a message ends to trigger the Pi to record the audio and upload it as part of the message. I know I can use Python&#39;s GPIO libraries to see if the ENDEC is active, but I&#39;m a bit lost on the sound card part. </p> <p>The general idea is that when the ENDEC receives an alert, the relay closes and recording starts. The parser script parses the EAS message and posts to slack, then when the ENDEC finishes, the recording is completed and uploaded to Slack. </p> <p>What&#39;s the easiest USB sound card I can use to record the clips when triggered by the ENDEC? The only feature I really care about is gett",
