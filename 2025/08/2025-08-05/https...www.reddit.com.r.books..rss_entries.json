Maybe I wouldn\u2019t have had such a reaction a few years ago. A few years ago Obama was elected and I felt like maybe this country was becoming less bigoted. I had hope. Unfortunately Obama\u2019s election caused a huge portion of our country to lose their minds and now we are seeing the ugliest manifestations of racism on the rise. I loved the book.

The book takes on rather too much and is written in such a languid style that I couldn&#39;t take anymore of it without a break. This is odd to say because Woolf is a favorite of mine. I like her style in everything from novels to book reviews. I even liked A Room of One&#39;s Own though it was a similarly languid book. I think my main issue with Three Guineas is that there&#39;s a vast discrepancy or even conflict between the subject and the manner in which it is written. The subject is that a man wrote a letter to Woolf asking her opinion about how they should go about preventing the war which was later known as World War II; Woolf put the letter next to two others, one asking for donation to rebuild a women&#39;s college, the other from an institution acting to enter women into to the workforce.

Been there, read that (twice!), and with an itch on my shoulders I could not scratch no matter how hard I attempted to reach, the only method at my disposal to finally reach back and then some was to also go back into the man\u2019s impressively long history of writing and start from the very beginning with his first novel, Peace, a book some say is unlike anything else he\u2019s wrote and possibly unlike most anything out there. Did I bite off more than I can chew or are what is at one glance philosophical musings by an old man just the thing I, someone who pens reviews often accused of being philosophical musings, need to really make that itch go away?</p> <p>Right off the bat, we get a book that\u2019s deceptively complex. Musings of an old man, maybe, but as each chapter seems almost at random to jump across various point of views (Old man? Young man? Is he now a girl or did I misread something?) and plac",

Sure, Greg is annoying and socially awkward, but that&#39;s part of his character arc and it worked effectively in the film. In the book, through his first-person narration, he goes on tangents on things I just don&#39;t care about. When he made me read through two pages describing alien barf, I wanted to tap out. Four more pages about his filmography with lame punny movie titles, ugh. I can&#39;t handle this. The way he talks about Earl makes me uncomfortable too. I also get weird incel-like vibes from him which I didn&#39;t get in the movie. The whole book is just giving me the ick, and I don&#39;t think I want to continue with it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CynthiaChames\"> /u/CynthiaChames </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1mhvb1x/strug",
