Now they are going to implement this ID verification that I read so much in this sub, yes government ID plus a selfie video, I would drop any website that requires me to do so but I can&#39;t quit my job &quot; they treat us amazing and have good benefits&quot; so this scare me because I can see the trend of crappy online services requiring this as if it&#39;s normal.

The ones that require age verification through ID, face scans, credit cards, or digital IDs for things like search engines, social media, messaging apps, AI tools, and app stores. That\u2019s already intense. But something&#39;s been bothering me. Microsoft is one of the companies listed as a &quot;regulated platform,&quot; right? And if I\u2019m not mistaken, Windows 11 basically forces you to use a Microsoft Account just to set up the OS? Especially on the Home edition. No Microsoft Account means you can&#39;t really use Windows anymore. So if Microsoft is now legally required to block users under 16 unless they verify their age, doesn\u2019t that mean Windows itself is now effectively off-limits to anyone under 16 in Australia? Not just specific apps or websites. The actual operating system. Because if you&#39;re under 16 and don&#39;t want to upload your ID, and you&#39;re not allowed to make a Microsoft A",
