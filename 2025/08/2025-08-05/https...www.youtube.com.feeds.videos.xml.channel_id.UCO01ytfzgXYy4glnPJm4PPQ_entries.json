        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Somali community in Minnesota rallies around a man who abducted and abused a child. They told the judge to go easy on him because he\u2019s still getting accustomed to our \u201cculture.\u201d So what does that say about Somali culture? Also, several more states have now banned junk food from the food stamp program. We\u2019ll talk about that and also the rise of so-called EBT influencers on TIkTok. It\u2019s as horrible as it sounds. Plus, speaking of horrible, a former CNN anchor interviews an AI version of a child who died in a school shooting. Our dystopian future has arrived, and it\u2019s somehow worse than anyone predicted. \n\nTIMESTAMPS \n\n00:00 - 00:33 Opening\n02:08 -21:18 Here\u2019s The Horrifying Proof That All Cultures Are Not Equal\n22:42 - 38:06 Why Hasn't Every State Banned Junk Food From SNAP Benefits Yet?\n38:08 - 44:23 Texas Cop Vows To Give Everyone A Ticket After Not Getting Laid \n46:08 - 58:45 Jim Acosta, And His Interview With An AI Posing As A Reincarnated Human Bei",
