Lots of men one after the other, to be precise, for lots and lots of money: the commercial niche she invented to distinguish herself from countless other amateur porn stars jostling desperately for attention on OnlyFans was inviting \u201cbarely legal\u201d ordinary teenage boys (which in porn means 18-plus) to have sex with her on film, and flogging the results to paying subscribers for a fortune. Unusually, her model involves a woman making millions out of men generating content for free, which makes it slightly harder than usual to work out exactly who is exploiting whom if she turns up (as she did in Nottingham) at a university freshers\u2019 week with a sign saying \u201cbonk me and let me film it\u201d.</p><p>But debating whether getting rich this way makes Bonnie personally \u201cempowered\u201d seems tired and pointless.

I wandered through the ancient city and was astounded by the beauty of the place \u2013 and just as much by its food. I tasted grilled meats cooked over open fires on the streets, and had a kofta dish served with <em>cacik</em>, a classic cucumber and mint sauce, that was so intensely delicious that the moment has been distilled in my memory. Mince, with good provenance and the right amount of fat to carry flavour and lend moisture, is a kitchen hero. Here, it delivers an astoundingly good dinner inspired by that meal, and which shouldn\u2019t break the bank.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/aug/05/lamb-koftas-buttery-tomato-sauce-cacik-recipes-thomasina-miers\">Continue reading...</a>",
