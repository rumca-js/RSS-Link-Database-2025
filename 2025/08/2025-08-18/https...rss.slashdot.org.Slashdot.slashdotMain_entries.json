        "description": "England has declared a \"nationally significant\" water shortage as reservoirs dropped to 67.7% capacity, their lowest levels in at least a decade. The UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology warned of exceptionally low river flows while groundwater continues dwindling across the country. Hosepipe bans now affect all of England, with additional restrictions probable in coming months. \n\nWater companies lose approximately one trillion litres annually through leaky pipes -- 20% of all treated water -- while the annual pipe replacement rate remains at 0.05%. No new reservoir has been built in 30 years despite population growth. Government forecasts project England's public water supply could fall short by 5 billion litres daily by 2055 without urgent infrastructure investment. The economic cost of water scarcity could reach $11.48 billion over this parliament, according to thinktank Public First.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitte",

The results it brings up aren't nearly as relevant. \n\nThis is just one of many ways in which the professionals' social media platform, which has embraced artificial intelligence with ferocious zeal, is being gradually \"enshittified,\" to borrow tech writer Cory Doctorow's phrase. Each new embrace of AI tools promises to make hiring, job searching, networking and even posting a bit easier or more fruitful. Instead, AI seems to have made the user's experience more alienating, and to have helped foster a genre of LinkedIn-speak which bears all the hallmarks of the worst AI writing on the internet. \n\nLet's",

        "description": "A real estate developer searched Google for a cruise ship company's customer service number, reports the Washington Post, calling the number in Google's AI Overview. \"He chatted with a knowledgeable representative and provided his credit card details,\" the Post's reporter notes &mdash; but the next day he \"saw fishy credit card charges and realized that he'd been fooled by an impostor for Royal Caribbean customer service.\" \n\nAnd the Post's reporter found the same phone number \"appearing to impersonate other cruise company hotlines and popping up in Google and ChatGPT\" (including Disney and Carnival's Princess line):\n\nHe'd encountered an apparent AI twist on a classic scam targeting travelers and others searching Google for customer help lines of airlines and other businesses... The rep knew the cost and pickup locations for Royal Caribbean shuttles in Venice. [And \"had persuasive explanations\" when questioned about paying certain fees and gratuities.] The rep offered to waive the shut",
