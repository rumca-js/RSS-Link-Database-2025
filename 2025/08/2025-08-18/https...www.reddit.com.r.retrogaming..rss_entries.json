        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m looking for console RPGs that have a lot of freedom of where you go rather than gate-keeping the player.</p> <p>Final Fantasy 1 (NES), for example, does a good go through preventing the player from going off the rails and bee-lining straight to the final boss. SaGa/FFL has a lot of <em>gameplay</em> freedom, but the player doesn&#39;t have the freedom to travel as they like; they must climb the tower as designer.</p> <p>Pool of Radiance (NES) is more of what I&#39;m looking for. There is an intended order to the early game, but the player is free to say &quot;nuts to this&quot; and run off to pretty much any location, including the final dungeon.</p> <p>Consoles I have are NES, GB/C, GBA, and DS.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/scribblemacher\"> /u/scribblemacher </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1mtb494/console_rpgs_with_a_lot_of_freedom_of_where_to_go",
