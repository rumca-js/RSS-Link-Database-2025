I know instagram is not private, but I had assumed they wouldnt know what else I do on the web if its done from DuckDuckGo? Is that not how this works? Whats the point then? </p> <p>The only explanation that I can think of is that im logged in to instagram from my browser, so they are still able to siphon information from past searches? Or maybe my wifi provider has data brokerage connections and the info is transferred that way? I have Spectrum</p> <p>This is all very annoying because I was feeling happy about not being spied on so much with my new browser but I guess theres no respite from these creeps...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u",

I realized this was the perfect time to improve my home server and self host my own passw manager/2fa. Im trying to fully degoogle and moved my domain email to icloud+, will use their email manager as main email server (paying the $1 a month subscription, cheap and decently private compared to others). But because of this I dont want to keep all my password there, in case I get hacked again lol.</p> <p>Ive set my eyes in vaultwarden, seems good enough. One thing Im thinking now is that it doesnt make sense to keep 2fa and passwords in the same app. So Im thinking to host all my passwords in vaultwarden and then use something free like protonpass to store my 2fa.</p> <p>Does this seem reasonable? Is there any best practice here? Or Im i being paranoid and should just stick with vaultwarden for everything (or even icloud password manager)?</p> <",
