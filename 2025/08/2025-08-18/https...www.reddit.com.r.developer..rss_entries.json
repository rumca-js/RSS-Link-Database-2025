Sci. and I have been a professional developer since 2019. A situation has come up in my professional life which has filled me with dread and anxiety. I am about to become a senior software engineer and devops guy in my company (small startup). We were four devs, but very soon we are down to two. One of the devs who is leaving is my senior backend dev. And now I&#39;m scared that I do now know enough to fill his shoes. I have always been a fullstack developer but my passion is backend deveopment, databases and servers.</p> <p>So. When did you know you were a good software engineer?</p> <p>I feel like I need to take night courses, online courses, go back to school and hold down my job, to not fall behind the curve. I am at a loss. And the stress is killing me. What would you do in my stead?</p> </div><!",

I have the api of value chart for ingame items as well. Also need this bot to be able to have minigames/embeds that are provably fair or rng, such as mines or the ability to coinflip other users for their value (both parties must accept and pick a side). As well as a way for the bot to accept crypto deposits/withdraws, preferably through oxapay. Which I can send details of that over. The bot also must be able to have a withdraw option where if the user has the amount of &quot;val&quot; needed they can type what pet they&#39;d like to withdraw from options given from the bot to where ther",
