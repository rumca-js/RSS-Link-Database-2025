While I enjoyed all the guard characters, a lot of their plot felt like a side setup for future books which is fine in itself. Unfortunately, I really wasn\u2019t a fan of the main Dragon plot as well as it felt very predictable and dragged too long. The humor also didn\u2019t land on me as it felt like Pratchett was forcing some jokes just for the sake of making them even when they didn\u2019t really make sense. After that I put away Discworld and didn\u2019t touch it for months.</p> <p>Last week, I finished a book in the middle of a long serious sci-fi series I\u2019m reading (The Expanse). Wanting something lighter, I decided to give Pratchett another try as he\u2019s such a legend and went with Mort. I finished that book in 3 days, just couldn\u2019t put it away. Whether it\u2019s because I loved the spin Pratchett put on the master/apprentice trope which I often find boring in",

The same goes for staff/cosplayers - we were not in this category. I would urge others in those categories to share their experiences.

Since I have a lot that bothered my with this book, unfortunately and I really want to hear other peoples thoughts on what they felt about it, so please feel free to leave a comment on what your thoughts are.<br/> Here we go:</p> <p>I just finished Empire of the Vampire, and while there are definitely strong moments, I found it ultimately frustrating. The structure, pacing, and character development kept pulling me out of the story, and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the author was always hovering over the page.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just because the story is told through a framing device with a vampire chronicler. That alone can work. The real issue is that Gabriel insists on jumping back and forth in time as he narrates. We constantly shift between the timeline where he is young and meets Astrid, and the later timeline where he meets Dior. This back-and-forth is clearly done to build suspense around the fate of Gabriel\u2019s family",
