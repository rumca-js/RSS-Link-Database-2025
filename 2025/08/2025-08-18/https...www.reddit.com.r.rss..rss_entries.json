One of the issues I run into is that, at this age, many students still have a hard time understanding what is actually &#39;news&#39; and what isn&#39;t. I&#39;m been thinking about ways to build in some training wheels over the summer and I kept coming back to the idea of putting together a group of RSS feeds that direct them to sources that are reporting news and not celebrity gossip and sports scores. If anyone had any recommendations on where I should start with this project I would greatly appreciate it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Inevitable_Gigolo\"> /u/Inevitable_Gigolo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1mtann3/rss_in_the_classroom/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comment",
