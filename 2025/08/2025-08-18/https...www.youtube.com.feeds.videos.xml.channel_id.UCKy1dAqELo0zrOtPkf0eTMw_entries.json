Let\u2019s weigh the pros and cons of remaking and releasing some of the obvious classics like the original PS1 Metal Gear Solid (which already got a Game Cube remake with Twin Snakes) or the PSP fan-favorite multiplayer Peace Walker, which got an overhaul already for the PS3 and Xbox 360 on the HD Collection. \n\nThen there are some that might be a little more complicated to remake and market, whether it\u2019s the ancient MSX games that started the series, Metal Gear 1 and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, or the PSP tactical card game RPG Metal Gear Acid, or Snake\u2019s Revenge, the weird unofficial/un-Kojima NES spinoff Snake\u2019s Revenge. \n\nMetal Gear Solid Delta hits Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5 and PC on August 28th, 2025,",
