        "description": "BrokenLore: LOW is a psychological horror game set in the beautiful and mysterious Japanese village of Kirisame Mura, where the ancient legend of the Gashadokuro, a giant skeleton from Japanese folklore, still lingers.\n\nNaomi Montgomery arrives in Kirisame Mura for a major professional opportunity that could jumpstart her music career. But instead of success, she finds herself facing sinister presences and uncovering the cursed past that haunts the village.\n\nThe game, enriched by original statues from Italian sculptor Bruno Lucchi, blends realistic visuals with stylized low-poly sequences, and was developed in consultation with a psychologist to ensure genuine emotional depth.\n\nHideki: \u201cTime flows in its own way in Kirisame Mura.\u201d\n\n#ps5 #ps5games \n\nMay contain content inappropriate for children.
