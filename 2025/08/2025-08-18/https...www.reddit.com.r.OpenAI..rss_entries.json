Dismissing everyone who misses it as \u201cdelusional\u201d misses that nuance.</p> <p>Since GPT-5 replaced 4o, I\u2019ve seen takes like \u201cpeople rely on AI too much\u201d or \u201cthey treat it like a friend/partner.\u201d Personally, 4o wasn\u2019t a replacement for real people, it was a place to rehearse hard conversations, play out scenarios, and collect my thoughts without fear of being shut down. Or just ask questions at 3:00 a.m. and discuss them. That mattered.</p> <p>Some say \u201cpeople love GPT because it never says no.\u201d This interaction isn&#39;t about constant validation.
