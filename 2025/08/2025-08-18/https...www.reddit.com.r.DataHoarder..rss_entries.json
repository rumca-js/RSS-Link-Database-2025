Right now my only storage is a brand new 1TB SSD. When it comes to long-term storage, I\u2019m seeing people say that if you\u2019re using SSD\u2019s, replace them every five years. If you\u2019re using HDD\u2019s, replace them every decade or so. If you want even longer-term storage, use disc/DVDs or tape/LTO. I was just like your opinions on what hard drives/devices you guys use for your long-term storage. Also, do you guys use the same type of storage for the 3-2-1 rule, or do you mix it up?

These are 1-hour or 1.5-hour lectures (in French) on various subjects, ranging from literature, history, biology, mathematics... They covering many research fields. The courses are mostly in video format, but some from before 2010 are audio-only.</p> <p>The entire archive contains around 5k courses from approximately 170 chairs, for a total size of 700 GB. It covers the years 2006 to 2025. The files were primarily downloaded from the YouTube links provided by the CdF, but some older files were hosted directly on the CdF&#39;s website.</p> <p>Now that I have them, I&#39;m not quite sure what to do with this archive (aside ofc from personal use, since I use them as sort of podcasts). Therefore, I have two quick questions for the community :</p> <ol> <li><p>Is there interest in this kind of dataset, despite the fact that the content is alread",
