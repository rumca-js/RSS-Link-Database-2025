If a movie is \u201crotten\u201d then less people will see it. A fresh tomato doesn\u2019t mean a movie is \u201cgood\u201d and vice versa. I really hate that the success of a films box office rides on a a stupid RT score. There are tons of movies that are considered \u201crotten\u201d that I really enjoy and if I was someone who solely went off this stupid score I would be missing out.

I hadn\u2019t realized it was affordable (in a manner of speaking) for members of the general public to attend and actually see great films and premiers. As a film fan who is not in the industry, I loved having the chance to just watch movies all week and listen to the creators talk about them after.</p> <p>I was inspired to attend TIFF this fall, which I\u2019d heard was similar to Sundance. However, I\u2019m in the midst of the ticketing process now and it\u2019s looking like it\u2019s (a) a good bit pricier than Sundance and (b) harder to get into premiers and films generally.</p> <p>I\u2019m curious what film festivals you all might recommend for members of the general public who can\u2019t afford to drop $5k on tickets and memberships? Open to traveling, though. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ExtremeToucan\"> /u/ExtremeToucan </a> <br/",

Like all great family friendly movies, it manages to be a very wholesome and accessible movie to children while also being a movie with surprisingly sophisticated themes and character work when you look at it with adult eyes.</p> <p>I was so impressed that this cutesy little animal movie managed to deliver some very salient points about biases and class injustice. I loved the part where the dogs go &quot;We have to speak slowly because all sheep are obviously stupid.&quot; And then it goes &quot;the sheep spoke slowly because all dogs are <em>obviously ignorant</em>.&quot;</p> <p>And even though the movie doesn&#39;t come right out and say it in the text, I couldn&#39;t help but feel that the movie was HEAVILY implying some kind of vegetarian message in it.

This is an excellent, chilling movie about a guy who goes crazy due to excruciating circumstances, and I can sort of relate to his predicament! I also lived in LA for about 10 years and I&#39;ve seen much of the same bad scene depicted in the movie, which is a far cry from the Hollywood glamor typically depicted of it! I also know the feeling of being on the edge, but luckily I&#39;m a nonviolent person, so if I lost it, I&#39;d most likely just resort to verbal abuse, which I&#39;m pretty good at!

Every so often, a popular movie or show &quot;leaves&quot; a particular service, and fans panic. Other services sneak ad breaks into inappropriate moments in movies to frustrate viewers into paying extra to &quot;go ad-free&quot;. If you own a physical copy, you only pay for it once; you will always have access, regardless of which streaming service it moves to, and you can watch ad-free without incurring additional costs. If it&#39;s a movie or show that you really love and want to enjoy on your own terms, having the DVD or Blu-ray is the way to go.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FosterMomOfDragons\"> /u/FosterMomOfDragons </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1mt745p/a_case_for_keeping_physical_media/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://w",
