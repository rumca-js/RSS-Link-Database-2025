For some context, im kinda stuck in rereading books i grew up with and looking to branch out. My top 3 fantasy series&#39; that ive read are Skulduggery Pleasant, Rangers Apprentice and The Inheritance Cycle. I also love D&amp;D. I tried starting the Horus Heresy, but had to tap out after 4 books, it just felt like a chores to read.

I would like to get her a couple of feel-good books (fiction, historical fiction), easy reads, that she can enjoy during her recovery. She just finished the Uncommon Reader by Alan Bennett and seemed to enjoy it. She enjoyed watching downton abbey, the crown, but some of the topics covered she had to skip. Any and all recommendations would be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/madame_lady_beeps\"> /u/madame_lady_beeps </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mtme38/post_for_mom/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mtme38/post_for_mom/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Book 1 remains my favorite because I felt pure, powerful love there. When Meek and Mo were together, my heart would literally beat out of my chest from the emotions between them. Their connection was raw and undeniable. But as I got into Books 2, 3, and 4, her love life started to feel different when messiah came back\u2014 more like chaos than romance. All I\u2019ve been feeling is anxiety. The love between Morgan and Messiah feels they\u2019re holding on because of their shared past, not because they truly belong together now. It\u2019s painful to watch them cling to each other while slowly tearing themselves apart. I really didn\u2019t like how Morgan seemed to be forcing the kids to love Messiah. Her relationship with him feels more like an obligation than experiencing love \u2014 like she\u2019s staying with him because he\u2019s the father of her ",

I\u2019m currently reading passengers of the hankyu line by arikawa, and I loved the little subplots of romance throughout the book and it makes me feel really nice. So please does anyone have a book that\u2019s SIMILLAR to the romance of this book? Or just something like this book in general?</p> <p>If possible I\u2019d like it to be Japanese :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Advance9021\"> /u/Ok_Advance9021 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mtitlz/in_need_for_books_like_passengers_on_the_hankyu/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mtitlz/in_need_for_books_like_passengers_on_the_hankyu/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It&#39;s alright... I don&#39;t hate it, but I don&#39;t love it either. I&#39;ve seen a lot of hate and because of the writing alone, I&#39;m hesitant to continue the series after finishing the first one. </p> <p>I like fantasy because its an escape, so I enjoy good world building. I do love a good romance and honestly dont mind when there are somee clich\u00e9s, but try to avoid overly cringey, unrealistic stories. I&#39;m hoping to find some recs that can combine the two! Huge fan of the enemies to lovers trope haha.</p> <p>I used to be big into murder mysteries too!

She doesn\u2019t finish most books because she says they\u2019re \u201cmid\u201d and gets too distracted to complete them. I have recommended the Ramona series by Beverly clearly and she didn\u2019t like it or finish it. The one series she has read more than one book in because she enjoyed it was the Dog Man series.
