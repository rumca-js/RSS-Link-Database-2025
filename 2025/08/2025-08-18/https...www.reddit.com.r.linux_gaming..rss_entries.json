I\u2019m talking about out of the box distro with KDE option. </p> <p>I\u2019m asking as I\u2019ve seen JayTwoCents video where all games he tested was performing worse on Bazzite (Fedora) than W11. I\u2019ve tested Bazzite on the same 7900xtx and also see few games performing worse than my W10. </p> <p>Resident evil 4 in particular was running slower. Is it normal? Or there is something wrong with Bazzite, KDE, 7900xtx, RE4 or something else? Many people claim that amd gpu perform better on linux than on windows.
