When this laptop leaves the office and is no longer subjected to LAN firewall rules (now on hotel/airport/cafe wifi), the last line of defense is at the host level. </p> <p>However, my initial thought is that whitelisting applications that generate outbound traffic or require an inbound rule seems the exact opposite of scalable and future-proof. Additionally, the default allow all out, deny all in approach seems futile as that would grant unrestricted outbound access if something were to slip past our EDR/Enterprise Browser solutions. </p> <p>How do you all approach this situation?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gravityfalls55\"> /u/gravityfalls55 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/c",
