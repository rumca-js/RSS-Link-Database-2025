And the prices get crazy sometimes, which feels like an utter racket because no preset is going to work across ranges of hardware/lighting conditions. I mean the things are literally just .xmp or .xml files, it feels stupid to charge money at all for something that is literally just putting sliders in certain places - and will almost certainly just be starting points.</p> <p>Because they&#39;re just xml files ,here&#39;s no way there could be actual DRM, right?

For that, I&#39;ve included MetroList in my short list, which seems to be the best at the moment, but which has the disadvantage of not playing its songs locally.
