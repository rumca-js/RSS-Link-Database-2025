I already carry 1.5mil in liability insurance that i have for some of my other contracting gigs. </p> <p>Californias cost to be an LLC is $1,000 after fees and everything, and even incorporating in another state still requires the $800 franchise fee. That\u2019s awful steep just starting out with no real clients yet. </p> <p>Just curious what others are doing, what y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts are on the best way to officially create the biz, and if y\u2019all have any insight on whether or not the LLC is needed at this stage. I can always LLC later when i have more clients if need be, but I\u2019m curious if it\u2019s better from the jump. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

One thing that needs improvement is there is virtually no interlinking across all the pages and location pages (home service business). My question is: should I go ahead and knock out all the interlinking across the site all at once or would it be more beneficial to slowlly roll out; like maybe a page a week? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DinoDaddy75\"> /u/DinoDaddy75 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1mt8t2p/questions_about_interlinking_within_a_website/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1mt8t2p/questions_about_interlinking_within_a_website/\">[comments]</a></span>",
