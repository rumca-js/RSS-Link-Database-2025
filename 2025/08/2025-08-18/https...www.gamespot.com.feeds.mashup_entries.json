It also gives fans an idea of how true to the world of Street Fighter they're going with this time around.</p><p>The tease came via an Instagram story from comedian and actor Andrew Schulz, who plays Dan in the film. The image shows what appears to be Rhodes wearing Guile's classic camo fatigues and sporting the USAF Major's famously exaggerated blonde flat top. It's not much, but you see the edge of him, with his shadow on the ground teasing the hair. It's the first real visual nod to the iconic fighter, who was previously portrayed by Jean-Claude Van Damme in the 1994 Street Fighter film.</p><div data-embed-type=\"tweet\" data-src=\"https://twitter.com/WrestlePurists/status/1957316704477782114\" data-has-image=\"true\"><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data",
