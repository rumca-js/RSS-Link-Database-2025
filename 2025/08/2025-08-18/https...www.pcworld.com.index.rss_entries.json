They\u2019re all set to take on the world, right? Well, yeah, but they\u2019re going to need a few accessories to really make the best of that dorm space. Hunching over a laptop screen for hours of studying isn\u2019t exactly ideal.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, we\u2019ve got everything they\u2019ll need to make the most of their setup in a one-stop shop. Kit them out with some or all of these extras, and they\u2019ll be a studying, class-taking, test-passing machine. Or possibly just play a lot of <em>League</em> <em>of Legends</em>. Don\u2019t judge, college is stressful.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve ranked this list starting with what I consider the most essential additions to a standard laptop. If you\u2019re on a budget, go for the top items first.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"usb-c-monitor-dell-s2722dc\">USB-C Monitor: Dell",

However, anyone storing or archiving large amounts of data will quickly hit their capacity and budget limits. Very inexpensive SSDs often only have 256 to 512GB, while HDDs in the same price range offer one or two TB of capacity. If you need more storage, you\u2019ll pay significantly more for SSDs, or have to switch to external storage solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An HDD can also be more attractive from a financial perspective. A 2TB internal SSD typically costs $130\u2013$180, while an HDD of the same size can be found for just $60\u2013$90. Users who focus on price-performance ratio or prefer to put their budget toward a graphics card or RAM may be better off with an HDD.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"imageId\":\"68a308e27817c\"}' data-",
