As the name implies, and her intro (\u201cLadies, and hopefully not too many gentlemen \u2026\u201d) confirms, it\u2019s not made with the likes of me in mind. But there\u2019s still plenty to enjoy for sheepish men in the crowd, as the 25-year-old shares not very fond memories of life at an all-girls private Catholic school on the other side of the Irish Sea.</p><p>At least initially, it\u2019s no great sob story, and not only because Galvo openly admits (and sends up) how pampered and privileged a childhood she had.

My view is that a 2.5 percentage point rise in the average VAT rate is the most viable option to raise sufficient revenue without reducing growth.</p><p>Toynbee also discusses possible changes to inheritance tax and the introduction of a wealth tax.

But his address provoked strong reactions for another reason: up until that moment, Ng\u0169g\u0129 had been closely associated with the emergence of an African tradition of writing in English and acknowledged as a key figure in the rise of the novel as a major genre on the continent; his fictional work was often cited as an example of how English was being remade in formerly colonised societies.

But Ozzy\u2019s health continued to decline and, just days after a defiant final homecoming concert with Black Sabbath last month, the Prince of Darkness died aged 76. The footage has been reworked as a one-hour documentary and is a special ode to the last chapter in the icon\u2019s life, as he moves back to England with the family, battles illness and readies for a performance that will go down in history as the greatest goodbye in rock\u2019n\u2019roll. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/18/tv-tonight-t",
