You can check it out here: <a href=\"https://lemmebee.github.io/ruh/\">https://lemmebee.github.io/ruh/</a></p> <p>My goal was to create a clean and simple tool to help myself and others track our progress in reading the Quran. I wanted a way to see how many Ayahs and Surahs I&#39;ve completed and stay motivated on my spiritual journey.</p> <p>What it does:</p> <p>Tracks Progress: You can see your overall progress as a percentage. Counts Ayahs and Surahs: It keeps a count of the Ayahs you&#39;ve read and the Surahs you&#39;ve completed. Simple Interface: The design is clean and straightforward, so you can focus on your reading. I built this project with the intention of gaining thawab by helping others, and I wanted to make it completely free and accessible to everyone.</p> <p>I would be honored if you would use it and share it with anyone who might find it he",
