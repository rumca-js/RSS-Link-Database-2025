They\u2019re a remnant of an era of computing that\u2019s far behind us, and they\u2019re largely unnecessary in today\u2019s digital world. But when you need one, you need one\u2026 and if you don\u2019t have a FedEx store nearby, you might as well have one at home. I think the best option is a cheap, rock-solid, black-and-white laser printer\u2014and today, you can <a href=\"https://www.brother-usa.com/products/rhll2420dw\">get my favorite laser printer for just $69.99</a>. Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve covered this before. I bought a Brother printer basically identical to this HL-L2420DW model years ago and I love it. (The only difference I can tell is that this one\u2019s slightly faster.) It\u2019s dead simple, just printing black-and-white pages super fast. It\u2019s wireless, so once you go through an admittedly tedious setup process on the one-line LCD, you never need to keep it ",

The combined hours crammed onto planes, trains, or buses can really take their toll\u2014especially if you\u2019re 6\u20193\u2033 like me. Watching a movie or TV show can help distract from the tight seats and lack of leg room, but that has its own issue: ergonomics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting my phone on a tray table or holding it in my lap is fine for a couple of minutes\u2026 but on a long-haul flight or a slow train ride across state lines, it just won\u2019t do. And even if you aren\u2019t as tall as I am, you\u2019ve probably felt the neck strain that comes from hunching too long over your phone. It\u2019s that much worse when combined with the extra discomforts of travel.
