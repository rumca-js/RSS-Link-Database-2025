I\u2019m so excited to start reading, but I\u2019d rather read them in order if that makes more sense, so should I find a copy of The Last Unicorn?

Three days ago I noticed when listing through my journal that there were a few very tiny brown bugs in my journal and it scared me a bit.</p> <p>Then today I investigated a bit more and every book that is in a bookshelf in the centre of my room is infested with booklice. I pulled one from the bookshelf about five days ago and did not notice anything. I put it on the table and I&#39;ve putting my journal on top of that book since then, that&#39;s how it probably got infested as well. </p> <p>I absolutely hate that this happened even though every site online says that they are basically harmless. I&#39;ve looked online and I&#39;ve found pretty detailed posts/videos by people who got rid of the booklice by putting their books in the freezer in a plastic bag but I don&#39;t have this option.</p> <p>My only option seems to be to put the books in the oven but I was not able to find a more detailed description on how to do it.

They&#39;d squandered the goodwill of pretty much everyone who was invested in the prize, and 16/24 of the nominees had withdrawn. I don&#39;t think there was any way that they could have gone ahead with it this year. It&#39;ll be interesting to see what happens next year. It&#39;s a real shame that the foremost LGBTQ+ writing prize has disintegrated so spectacularly. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a",
