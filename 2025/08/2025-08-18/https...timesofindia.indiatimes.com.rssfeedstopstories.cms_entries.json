Vance leveraged his Marine past to ride Trump\u2019s coattails into the vice presidency. Newsom is leveraging parody to carve out space as the Democrat unafraid of MAGA. Act one was the split screen. Act two is the troll war. Act three, if it comes, will be 2028 \u2014 where Gavin Newsom will either be remembered as the liberal who cosplayed Trump for a season or the Democrat who figured out how to use memes to win power. Could he be the Lyndon Johnson of the meme era \u2014 underestimated, even mocked, until history forced him into greatness? That remains unanswered. But for now, MAGA finally knows what it feels like to be on the receiving end of ridicule. And Gavin Newsom is laughing loudest.",
