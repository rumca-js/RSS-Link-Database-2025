It&#39;s essentially a roll and move game, but the board starts out mostly blank and on your turn you add a card to the spot you land that either tells you to move forward/back some number of spaces, roll again, move to a specific spot etc. There can be some wild (dare I say Bonkers) turns where you are constantly bouncing back and forth with no real idea where you might land. It&#39;s super simple without a ton of strategy, but surprisingly fun. Has anyone ever played this game? Also, I would love to see other games that build the board in a similar fashion (Maybe Caylus?)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sanjoatc\"> /u/sanjoatc </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1mu1469/t",
