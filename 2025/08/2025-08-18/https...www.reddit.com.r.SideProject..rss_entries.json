That\u2019s the world I came from, not as a creator myself, but I used to work with them on the promotion side.</p> <p>Funny enough, it turns out the tool works just as well for other types of marketing too, SaaS, affiliate, and beyond.</p> <p>Karmify ended up being a real game-changer for creators and agencies. Finding the right subreddits, analyzing best posting times, spotting viral content, it\u2019s all way easier now, and we\u2019ve got more features on the way.</p> <p><strong>How we got here:</strong><br/> We launched a free beta trial and invited users through a few group chats of creators. Out of 100 trial users, 15 converted to paying subscribers at $199/mo. The goal now is to scale to at least 50 paying users/month, feels within reach.</p> <p>Wis",
