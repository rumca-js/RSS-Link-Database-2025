I saw a really good comment on a tt abt this and they said, &quot;When you&#39;re so used to being the majority, the second a minority gains any representation it feels like oppression.&quot; (Don&#39;t quote me on that i don&#39;t exactly remember). And I, personally am a closeted gay man because in where I live i genuinely fear being an out cast if I come out, I&#39;ve seen it happen to others. I feel like it&#39;s outrageous that because some ppl can&#39;t accept people might have different views, we&#39;re regressing to where some ppl are just outright violent to people in the queer space.

When he told me about what his fitness said I asked him if he feels sorry or ashamed because of me and he said no. I don\u2019t really care what other people think nor do I care if he stays friends with those people, because that\u2019s his chose. I don\u2019t really know how I feel about the whole situation.

Even as a young kid I could see the signs that I liked men. I just dont know how I am going to come out to my family now \ud83d\ude02.

Like they have so much distain for anyone that doesn\u2019t fit into their narrow version of queerness. Like they hate on coloured hair and the stereotype of piercings and neo pronouns. Actively hating on he/him lesbians and asexual people, excluding trans men from the lesbian community. It\u2019s just so gross and I felt like I was going crazy bc they kept deleting my concerned comments. This is my last refuge, please let this one be good. </p> <p>The community is increasingly becoming more divided as the years go on. The far right is winning because some parts of our community are letting them. The far right wants us divided and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. </p> <p>I\u2019m so scared for the future of our community for so many reason and we can\u2019t even come together in solidarity??
