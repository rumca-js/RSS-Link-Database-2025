Because I&#39;ll be using the service less frequently, I&#39;d like to switch to API calls. I saw that ModelScope has a one-click model deployment feature, but I tried it without success. Does anyone have any experience or suggestions? Also, is this more cost-effective than renting a GPU server and opening a public port for continuous operation? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/June_Xue\"> /u/June_Xue </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1mt8hzg/deploy_finetuned_clip_model/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1mt8hzg/deploy_finetuned_clip_model/\">[comments]</a></span>",
