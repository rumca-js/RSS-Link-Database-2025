        "description": "Wouldn't it be great to have a button you could click to convert a Blueprint to C++, one that updates your entire project instantly, and leaves it in a fully compiled and runnable state?\n\nEveryone knows that converting Blueprints manually is tedious and highly error-prone, often to the point where you can\u2019t justify the effort and simply live with the problem. However, after a while it can\u2019t be avoided any longer due to performance issues or overly complex Blueprints that are hard to maintain. And typically this comes very late in development\u2014the worst possible time.  Ironically, when conversion begins, everyone focuses on the C++ part of the process, which is the easy part. The hard parts are often ignored or left as-is. \n\nThose hard parts are what this talk is really about: fixing up every Blueprint node (especially Cast nodes), every variable, Data Table, asset, INI file, and a whole lot more\u2014not to mention all Actor instances across all levels. \n\nThis session shines a light on all ",
