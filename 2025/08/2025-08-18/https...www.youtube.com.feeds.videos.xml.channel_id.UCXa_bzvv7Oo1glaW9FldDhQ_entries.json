        "description": "Despite some caveats, I would still recommend Sword of the Sea for those seeking a relatively light adventure with outstanding art direction, movement, and music. \n\nThe fact that it fires on so many cylinders, from the world design to the overall joy of exploration, and yet fails to enthral me in so many meaningful ways, remains baffling. \n\nBut as endearing as it can be to get lost among the waves, you need something to eventually anchor yourself, and for better or worse, Giant Squid doesn't quite deliver on that front.",

        "description": "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is shaping up to be a faithful yet polished remake of the PS2 classic that defined stealth gameplay for a generation. \n\nWhile Kojima isn\u2019t involved for this project, Konami and Virtuos Studios has surely impressed fans by preserving the game\u2019s core identity while enhancing visuals with Unreal Engine 5, improving animations, and adding subtle quality-of-life tweaks. \n\nThe original release is a very precious memory of my childhood, and it continues to serve as a formative experience that heavily contributed to building my gaming tastes.\n\nThe opportunity to replay that experience in a new light just feels like a dream come true for a long time fan like myself but it\u2019s an even better opportunity for newcomers to experience the chronological start of Metal Gear Solid.",

        "description": "This year\u2019s NHL game from EA Sports is upping the ante when it comes to goalies, and other mechanics. In addition to a goalie overhaul, real life data compiled from NHL EDGE has been implemented across various aspects of the game. \n\nNHL 26 seems like another iterative entry in the series and not a complete makeover. In fact, there\u2019s no new modes that\u2019ve been revealed yet for the game, so expect a similar, yet more refined, package.\n\nWe\u2019ve compiled the top 15 things worth knowing about NHL 26 before considering a purchase. The game\u2019s standard edition releases for $69.99 on September 12 for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S and is available for early access players from September 5th.",
