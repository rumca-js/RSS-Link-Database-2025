When ChatGPT-5 came out the stories were very...bland. Especially with the flow. Like the stories that were being created were broken in parts and o4 did that just perfectly. But with 5 it felt like every part was it&#39;s own indidual story. It would forget details and the characters seem flat too. I wanted to get used to it but I missed how 4o wrote the stories. So I decided to buy the plus version to get 4o back. Omg it has been what I was missing! It feels good to continue the story without having it to remind it of what was occurring in every part. I really hope they do not take this model away because these generative stories brighten my day. I already lost the acesss to playing games on my switch thanks the the stupid virtual card game rule. I do not want to lose another part of my happiness. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",
