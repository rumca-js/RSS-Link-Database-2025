Reflection is a hot topic as it is a new feature in C++26 and as a member of the standards committee, Barry's talk will outline the broader implications of c++ reflection for metaprogramming and library development, and the transformative role it could play in the future of C++\n\nSession Description\nWith the adoption of Reflection for C++26, the landscape of what is possible has shifted. This talk will focus on implementing Struct-of-Arrays for an arbitrary aggregate, but will also take some detours to cover some techniques that will prove useful for solving a wide range of problems. \n---\nB",
