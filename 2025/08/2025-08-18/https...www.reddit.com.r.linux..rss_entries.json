I mean, sure, it still isnt Windows level in compatibility, but since switching to Fedora I can do literally everything I could do on Windows. And ironically enough, most games run legit better now. And I barely had to do anything. It just worked out of the box. While you still have to learn quite a few things (where most of it comes naturally with time just like on any OS) to use Linux efficiently it still isnt NEARLY as bad as it was 5 - 10 years ago. Sadly it seems like most peoples knowledge about Linux is still stuck on that time and they arent aware how far Linux came since then and just keep repeating this outdated shit, making Linux seem much worse than it actually it.

Since Windows 11 likes to force you to make a Microsoft account nowadays, I had her give me an email address and password she wanted to use to make her account. The problem arose when I put her email address in and it got rejected. She uses a local ISP email address and it&#39;s been fine for everything else she uses. Microsoft wouldn&#39;t allow it in this case however and suggested creating a new email. Well of course she doesn&#39;t want to do that. I explained the options to her: I could override this and make a local account with some fiddling, we could make a new email, or I could install Linux.</p> <p>My grandmother, who is in her 70&#39;s asked me to just install Linux. I&#39;ve put Linux Mint on an older laptop of hers to squeeze some extra life out of it before and I guess she really enjoyed using it. So today I installed Linux Mint on her bra",
