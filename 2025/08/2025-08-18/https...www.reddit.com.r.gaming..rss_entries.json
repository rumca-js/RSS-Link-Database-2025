We loved Lego City: Undercover, and worked together to 100% it (which was really rewarding). He\u2019s really good at that controller layout, and doesn\u2019t have any issues playing it. We just kinda play in the open world and go on adventures. He likes to pretend we are firefighter and drive all over the city.</p> <p>We\u2019ve been trying to play Farming Simulator 25, but having to use all the sub menus for the vehicles and actions is proving to be too much for him, as well as the independent camera. It\u2019s a bit much for him.</p> <p>Does anyone have any recommendations for a game we/he can play? I need to be able to go and do things like take the dog to the bathroom, but can\u2019t because I have to sit next to him to do anything with a subm",
