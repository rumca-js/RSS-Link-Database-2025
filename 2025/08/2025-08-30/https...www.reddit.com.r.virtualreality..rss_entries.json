I have a work laptop that has to be used for my work (it&#39;s not physically possible to use my personal desktop or a VM), but I&#39;d like to connect it to my VR headset (Meta Quest 3) for reduced distractions and better productivity because of multiple monitors. I&#39;ve used the Immsersed app and Virtual Desktop, but these are all wireless connections, so there&#39;s a level of latency that I find really annoying. I&#39;ve also tried connecting the laptop to my headset via USB-C cable but I think the port on my laptop is just for transferring because when plugged in it just charges the headset.

It was difficult for me to be in the back of a car, or on a boat, and especially in a plane. The car and boat motion sickness resolved itself, and I don&#39;t take planes often, but for the most part, a Dramamine pill sorted things out. I couldn&#39;t play games like Doom when it came out. I was bummed about this because my friends&#39; favorite games were Doom and Half Life, and I couldn&#39;t even watch them play. Over the years, as frame rates got better and FOV became adjustable, I could eventually play first-person games without a problem.</p> <p>A few years ago, I got a Quest 2. I was really excited to try it, but I noticed that after five minutes with any game, I became dizzy and nauseous. EXCEPT for a game called Moss. I could play Moss for up to 45 minutes. I really loved that game, and was sad when it was over. Since I really cou",

Other notable games that were inspired by this novel would be the Stalker series and Into the Radius. The main difference between these two and Metro is that the latter is more campaign driven so if you played and liked Stalker and ITR and maybe wanted something more linear and story focused then you need to play Metro Awakening. </p> <p>To other fans of the metro games, Awakening holds up to the previous three really well and I believe it is a worthy addition to the series. </p> <p>Some of my notes: </p> <p>The environments are top notch in immersiveness but I would compare them most closely to Metro 2033 in how fucking dark they are lol. Also just like that game, some of the stealth in Awakening felt broken though still doable. As for interactivity, this is where I felt they couldve done more. Dont expect it to be like H",
