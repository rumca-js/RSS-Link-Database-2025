My cousin got a Colecovision console &amp; being a kid, I noticed the graphics were better &amp; the gameplay was more smooth on his machine. Fast forward to now. I&#39;m thinking back to playing the games I enjoyed at the arcade &amp; want to play those at home on my tv, so I was looking at gaming consoles. I should also mention that over the years I&#39;ve acquired a PS2 but only had one game for it &amp; that&#39;s all I played. </p> <p>I found a PS2 game with some arcade classics, I ordered it &amp; it looks &amp; acts just like I remember it did at the arcade. So then I start wondering if PS2 is good for old arcade games, I don&#39;t see why not. I&#39;m not one of those people that have to have every console, I just want something that looks &amp; feels like the old arcade games from the 80&#39;s.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Okcomund9532\"> /u",

They play a lot of platformer games right now on ps5/xbox/switch. Before they get older and graphics are important to them, I\u2019d love to be able to play some retro with them. Huge bonus for light gun coop shooters like time crisis. </p> <p>I first looked at standalone arcades from some of the popular builders but with prices being upwards of $4,000 for a fully featured build, I had second thoughts. I\u2019ve got a home theater already with a lot of open space that may be easier to use with my kids. I\u2019m considering getting one of those emulator boxes but there are so many options and I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s trash versus quality. </p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate advice on best route. I\u2019m still open to getting a full size cabinet if that\u2019s the best route. If there\u2019s a featured option that is compatible with modern TVs, that\u2019s great too. I\u2019d really like light gun ability. My dad",
