Andes formed Condor in 2023, so Condor is a relatively young player on the RISC-V scene. However, Andes does have RISC-V design experience prior to Condor\u2019s formation with a few RISC-V cores under their belt from years past.</p> <p>Condor is presenting their Cuzco core at Hot Chips 2025. This core is a heavyweight within the RISC-V scene, with wide out-of-order execution and a modern branch predictor and some new time based tricks. It\u2019s in the same segment as high performance RISC-V designs like SiFive\u2019s P870 and Veyron\u2019s V1. Like those cores, Cuzco should stand head and shoulders above current",
