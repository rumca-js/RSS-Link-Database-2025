It was hit or miss each week, but some students ended up liking a few games. I may be asked this new school term to do it again but I was thinking to have a league with some casual games where scoring can be tallied and at the end of the term a few prizes can be given out. The only thing is I am not sure which simple enough games can be used in this manner and within a time frame of an hour. </p> <p>So a break down would be there are teenagers ranging from 13 - 16 years of age, about 15 to 20 students, I was thinking to possibly even break them up into groups with various games. One game for a one on crowd was possibly Klask, but i may have to buy more than one of the game. </p> <p>Thanks for all suggestions. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GAiR3",

Initially we understood that the whole sequence (Preparation, Actions, Resources, Discard) is done only by player who\u2019s on turn because it\u2019s written \u201ceach player\u2019s turn is divided into 4 phases\u201d, then we noticed that in description of phases it\u2019s \u201cplayerS\u201d. So it seems that all do \u201cpreparation\u201d, then all do \u201cactions\u201d and so on. So what is correct way? And since I\u2019m here a couple of moments to share (maybe someone can comment on that). 1) We didn\u2019t like the mutations and we play without them. 2) I bought this game since expected some nuclear confrontation, but in reality most of the games won by just conquest and I didn\u2019t see that someone has been able to really build \u201cstockpile of arsenal\u201d big enough for \u201cnuclear exchange\u201d 3) Spy cards? Most of the time they are just left untouched without any interest from the players till the end of the game. Doesn\u2019t look like us",

You play on a board that is somewhat like Sorry!, even with a start, home safety zone and slide, but instead of regular cards, they are monsters that you have to beat in order to progress.</p> <p>Each monster will have three levels, baby, regular and boss. In order to move out of Start, you have to be able to beat a baby monster, you can use your other pawns for help. In order to move around the board, you have to be able to fight a regular monster, and then in order to enter home row, you have to be able to beat a boss.</p> <p>Just like in Munchkin, as you beat monsters, you can gain treasures that either offer special abilities (like going backwards, swapping, combining stats to beat a monster, or even splitting your move between two pawns.</p> <p>I am even considering altering the pawns to make them different classed, each with their own stats and equipable item.<",
