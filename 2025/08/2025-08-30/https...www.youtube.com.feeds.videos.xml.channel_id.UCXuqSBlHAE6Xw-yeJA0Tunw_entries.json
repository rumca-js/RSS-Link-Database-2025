The Switch 2's proprietary USB-C dock issue - the most recent example of Nintendo's anti-consumer practices and \"greedy\" behavior. We demonstrate the proprietary handshake protocol using a USB PD sniffer, explaining why third-party USB-C accessories and docks fail. The video explores the impact on consumer choice, innovation, and the tech industry, comparing it to the evolution of universal mobile phone chargers.
