However, I recently came across multiple posts on Reddit and Hacker News where folks discuss whether hosting platforms train their AI models on private repos. I checked the privacy policies of GitHub/GitLab and couldn&#39;t figure this out. Also, related discussions ended with nothing since no authorized positions of GitHub/GitLab were given.</p> <p>As for me, this is a strong signal that things are unclear, and I should reshape my attitude toward cloud services. The only possible alternative is a self-hosted Git server, which is an overkill for me, since I don&#39;t need to collaborate with other devs.</p> <p>Thus, I built <strong>Encrep</strong>. It&#39;s a CLI tool for creating backups of local Git repos via AWS S3.

I just launched my first real side project and would love some honest feedback from this community.</p> <p>It&#39;s called getborrowed.com - basically a peer-to-peer lending app where people can borrow items from neighbors instead of buying them. Think tools, cameras, camping gear, sports equipment, etc. The idea came from my own frustration of needing expensive stuff occasionally but not wanting to buy and store everything.</p> <p>I built it because I kept seeing the same pattern: everyone buying the same expensive items that sit unused 90% of the time. My neighbor has this amazing drill set he uses twice a year, while I was about to buy the exact same one for a weekend project. Felt like such a waste of money and resources.</p> <p>Thi",

But I hit an immediate signup wall. I hate being forced to create accounts just to try something. I did the Netflix series again and again over the years, I needed something fresh. So I uninstalled and searched &quot;meditation&quot; in the App Store.</p> <p>Insight Timer was first on the list. I opened it and... wow. Interactions and questions everywhere. Where&#39;s the &quot;start meditating&quot; button? Why is this so complicated? Sure, there&#39;s a simple timer, but I needed guidance at the moment.</p> <p>The library had infinite options - exactly what I <em>didn&#39;t</em> need while already overwhelmed.
