        "description": "There are more questions than answers in the killing of a mother and grandmother in the tiny North Carolina town of Scotland Neck. Latoya Lawrence was shot to death inside her car in the wee hours of a 2021 summer morning. Her married boyfriend was charged with her murder, and allegedly confessed. But four years later, the charges have been dropped for lack of evidence, and the conduct of investigators has been questioned. But Lawrence's family and a former cop who handled the case say evidence remains, and her killers remain free.",
