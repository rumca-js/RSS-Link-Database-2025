Should I just go ahead and study/take the exam after I hit ~3 years, then hold the Associate of ISC\u00b2 status until I reach the 5-year mark? 2. Or is it smarter to just wait until I have the full 5 years so I can get fully certified right away?</p> <p>For anyone who\u2019s taken CISSP \u2014 what worked better for you? Was taking it earlier worth it, or did waiting until you had more experience make things easier?</p> <p>Appreciate any tips or lessons learned \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Remarkable_Visit_988\"> /u/Remarkable_Visit_988 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https:/",
