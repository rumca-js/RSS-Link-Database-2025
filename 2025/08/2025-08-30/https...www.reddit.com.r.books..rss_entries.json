        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I finished reading The Shining this morning, and it was my very first Stephen King novel. At first, I wasn\u2019t too impressed as the plot unfolds at a slow pace in the beginning. However, once Jack Torrance encounters the hedge animals, I was hooked, and by the time the hotel\u2019s party began to come alive, I was completely unnerved. The moment when Wendy discovered confetti and party favors spilling from the malfunctioning elevator was especially chilling.</p> <p>One aspect I found underdeveloped was Wendy\u2019s jealousy of Danny\u2019s affection for his father. The subplot was introduced but never explored in any depth. It either needed more attention or could have been left out entirely. I\u2019m curious if this theme is revisited in the sequel.</p> <p>Despite that, the novel has absolutely inspired me to dive deeper into King\u2019s works (I\u2019ve already ordered Pet Sematary). I\u2019d definitely recommend The Shining to readers who want a story that delivers goosebumps without ",

It was so raw and harrowing, didn&#39;t sugarcoat anything and didn&#39;t even really give us that satisfactory ending, because in real life, people don&#39;t always say what they want to say, and we&#39;re always left with regrets in one way or another. And can we talk about the last chapter? The almost out-of-body pov with all the childhood dreams and fantasies and desires of the main character coming back in his final breath. Loved the way dying was portrayed in that chapter so much, and love how aptly it was titled &quot;Starman&quot;.</p> <p>There is so much anger and sadness in this book, and every bit of it is important. I have SO many emotions but I can&#39;t find the words to express them. I&#39;d love to know your feelings about this book.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su",

Rain was pouring down and lightning cracked in the distance I had only been on the forest road about 10 minutes or so and already I was dreading the 40 minutes of the drive remaining. The car was thick with smoke and fog unfortunately it has always been a characteristic of mine to keep the windows down no matter what, and not even the pouring rain could change that. The radio had started going in and out about 2 minutes ago but I decided to leave it on to add to the certain ominous feel of this place.
