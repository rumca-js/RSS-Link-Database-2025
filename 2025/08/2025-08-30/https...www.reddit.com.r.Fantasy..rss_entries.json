Basically, people (such as myself) will say that they find these books unengaging because the protagonist is too capable / self-assured / cocky, and this makes it had to engage with their story. Because it starts to seem like a wish-fulfilment story, and/or we can feel the heavy hand of the author given their character an easy ride. </p> <p>And one defence I see for both these books - and others - is that the protagonist is an <em>unreliable narrator</em> - that we should not take what they say at face value.

Everything about the story, characters and world that Sanderson has crafted is just phenomenal. It\u2019s lore and worldbuilding in my opinion is some of the best ever.

It\u2019s an Arthurian legend. The book was kinda trippy. I don\u2019t remember much but l remember Merlin was kind of the bad guy and his name was spelt differently. Something like Myrridin or similar. There may also have been a scene where they need need a bridge to cross somewhere and Excalibur extends itself to form a bridge. The only other thing l remember is a line from the book where one character finds himself in a building that is kinda circular and there\u2019s this realisation about how women built this structure because men tend to think in straight lines. If this rings a bell with anyone please let me know.
