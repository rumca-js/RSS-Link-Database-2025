Here are some key insights:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Performance Evaluation</strong>: The research marks the first integrated study focusing on ChatGPT&#39;s performance in formulating stochastic models, demonstrating that GPT-4-Turbo significantly outperforms previous models in tasks relating to variable matching, objective accuracy, and partial scoring.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Innovative Prompting Methods</strong>: A novel multi-agent prompting framework is introduced, where specialized ChatGPT agents collaborate to tackle different aspects of modeling.

But those newbie artists, especially those that just trying to learn the basics, will be under pressure from AI. For example, someone may scold them: &quot;AI does a better job that you do.&quot; &quot;Why bother posting it? GPT does a better job than you!&quot;. I do not doubt that a lot of them may eventually give up, and let AI do their job. </p> <p>But here&#39;s my question: If there is fewer and less people learning how to draw, then how can we expect more Master level artists in the future?
