I\u2019m alright with these things happening in the story, but I don\u2019t like it when they\u2019re the central point.</p> <p>So I\u2019m looking for fiction mystery books that are about investigating literally anything that isn\u2019t a murder, kidnapping, or anything else you\u2019d hear about on your average crime podcast.

Three of them were older ones (pre-2000s) and honestly, they didn\u2019t click with me at all. The explanations and ideas just felt weird and kind of outdated, like they weren\u2019t making any sense.</p> <p>Because of that, I\u2019ve started feeling like newer sci-fi (post-2000s) just works better for me. Not saying the classics are bad, just that they don\u2019t vibe with how I think. For context, my favorite sci-fi book right now is Project Hail Mary.

We both like to read, so I thought we could do it together, like a book club of just us (we\u2019re also very introverted). Problem is\u2026I can figure out a book. We\u2019re both into Fantasy. I\u2019ve been reading more Romantasy lately (things like the Empyrean series, \u201cThe Wolf King\u201d, and I just started \u201cThe Court of Thorns and Roses,\u201d as example), and he\u2019s not opposed to it. I just want to find a book we\u2019d both like. He\u2019s enjoyed Scott Lynch, Brian Sanderson, Robert Jordan, and David Eddings, to name a few. I enjoy Eddings and Sanderson as well.</p> <p>Any suggestions for a book that we could read together after our boys are in bed that would both like and enjoy discussing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nerdy-hedgehog\"> /u/nerdy-hedgehog </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1n3pvfa/fa",
