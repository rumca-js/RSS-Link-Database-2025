        "description": "Dying Light: The Beast is poised to be one of 2025\u2019s standout survival horror titles thanks to Techland\u2019s ambition to craft a sprawling open world in meticulous artistic detail. The Beast\u2019s setting of Castor Woods is both serene and disturbing, a former vacation destination turned bloodsoaked wasteland, where diverse biomes dictate player movement, combat, and survival strategy. \n\nFrom exposed grasslands to dense woodland, every location fosters dread and tension, while intricate blood detail and environmental storytelling encourage players to remap the brutality besieging the humans that were left behind to forge survival in the face of unfathomable horror. \n\nParkour and resource scavenging evolve into lifelines, whilst the stalking undead provide newfound unpredictability. Loyal fans of the franchise, primed by years of support, are ready for an expansion of Dying Light\u2019s formula, and The Beast is ready to deliver.",

        "description": "With Borderlands 4 nearly upon us, launching on September 12th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC (Switch 2 players will have to wait until October 3rd), it's a good time to look back on everything that's changed and improved over Borderlands 3. \n\nThe latter divided fans pretty heavily, which is a nice way of putting it, but Borderlands 4 does a lot more than just address those misgivings. Here are 15 significant differences between the titles before you buy.",
