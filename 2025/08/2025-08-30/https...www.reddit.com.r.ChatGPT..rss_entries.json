It&#39;s a cult classic, critically acclaimed, yet I got a red warning halfway through its reply. Same thing happens when I ask it to translate articles on sensitive topics from English to French, it also refuses. Even if I ask it to censor only enough to understand the article, it deletes its answer and shows the red warning again.</p> <p>Political topics are even worse. I wrote a post about Gaza and asked it to correct my syntax, but it kept rewriting parts it didn\u2019t agree with. I clearly explained what I meant, yet it repeated the same behavior over and over, each time claiming in French that it finally understood and explaining what I wanted, but then still changed the entire meaning of my message, saying the complete opposite with the translation.

On the contrary, I think it&#39;s an incredible tool. But I feel like we&#39;re using it the wrong way. My philosophy is this: Humans should create the content, and AI should polish it. We should be using AI like a grammar teacher, an editor, or even a high-quality translator.</p> <p>\u200bThe biggest issue, in my opinion, is content created with a simple prompt like, &quot;Hey ChatGPT, write me a blog post about X.&quot; These kinds of texts, I believe, just create noise.</p> <p>\u200bI&#39;ve reached a point where I can read the first few sentences of a text and instantly tell, &quot;A human didn&#39;t write this.&quot; It&#39;s like I&#39;m seeing the same robotic, templated sentences everywhere, lack",

Suddenly, it started hallucinating, giving me wrong or irrelevant answers left and right.</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried everything: new chats, super specific instructions, even switching back to the legacy model. Nothing helps. It\u2019s like it doesn\u2019t want to do the simple tasks anymore. If ChatGPT, the flagship AI, is this unreliable now, what hope do we have for other AI models that are supposedly \u201cless powerful\u201d?</p> <p>Is this a temporary glitch, a change in the model, or are we witnessing the limits of generative AI? I\u2019d love to hear your experiences or theories. Has your AI assistant started acting up too? What alternatives are you",

I was working through some Docker iptables stuff with it, and multiple times I caught it happily advising me to do things that would nuke my entire iptables, then completely forget stuff it had told me a few minutes ago in the conversation. And on top of that it was making some really basic mistakes.</p> <p>I&#39;m almost certain 4x would not have done this. It&#39;s possible 4x hallucinated a bit more - can&#39;t really tell - but it definitely didn&#39;t completely forget context from a few minutes ago in the same chat.</p> <p>So sorry to all t",
