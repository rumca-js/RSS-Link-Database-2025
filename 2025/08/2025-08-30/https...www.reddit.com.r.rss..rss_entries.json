I was looking for something simple to just see the posts and clean and simple way. I tried some apps in app store but there UI is not clean or has some features that I do not need or asks for payment.</p> <p>LuFeed is created from this frustiration of mine. I create a basic reader and connected to firebase. Currently there is no cost for me so I can published it for free.</p> <p>This is my first app in app store :) So If you can you try out and give feedback about it I would be very happy</p> <p><strong>App Store:</strong> <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/lufeed/id6749610483?l=tr\">https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/lufeed/id6749610483</a></p> <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"https://lufeed.com/\">https://lufeed.com/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jondonessa\"> /u/jondonessa </a> <br",
