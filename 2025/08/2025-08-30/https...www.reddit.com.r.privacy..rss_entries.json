But while watching video we started getting weird messages (it was a friends only stream so no outsider was there). We deleted app and even changed Google password and only granted location permission. Is my data safe? Can they just access all my drive data? Is the app safe. Tbh I felt it&#39;s safe as it has 50M+ downloads on play store with 4.2 star rating. But those shady messages put me in doubt.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BugSlayerDev\"> /u/BugSlayerDev </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n4dgc8/used_google_account_to_play_video_on_rave_is_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1n4dgc8/used_google_account_to_play_video_on_rave_is_my/\">[co",

In my head, when companies sell data, that data includes connections to various accounts and profiles.

But before I invest the time to update my old accounts, I was hoping for a second opinion, for weather this idea is stupid.</p> <p>Why:<br/> - no cross service tracking by email (coockies, fingerprinting are already barely possible)<br/> - unsubscribing is easier, just deactivate the alias<br/> - less danger from data breaches<br/> - I have to open my password manager everytime anyways, so once implemented it isnt more difficult to use.</p> <p>How:<br/> - 1 account, many aliases wich are forwarded and can be replied from (important for customer service or claims). More important aliases are auto directed in special folder<br/> - Im currently leaning towards Tuta mail 36\u20ac/y (maybe <a href=\"http://purelymail.com\">purelymail.com</a> 10$/y, but open for suggestions)</p> <p>Potential problems:<br/> - they allready know all my accounts belong to me, since most are current",
