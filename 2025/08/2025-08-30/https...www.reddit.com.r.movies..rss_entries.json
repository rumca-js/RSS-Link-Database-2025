It manages to be over the top while staying basically true to history. The chaos, performative grief, scheming, and backstabbing following Stalin&#39;s death is played perfectly by a cast of heavy-hitters who make it all the more farcical by playing it straight.

Im an 18 year old guy from Israel and I&#39;m Jewish so army service is mandatory for me and my friends. I always was against war and the apartheid in the west bank and never new what ill do with the army when i grow up. I did not enlist especially now with the genocide in Gaza. After watching grave of the fire flies i couldn&#39;t believe i was watching a Japanese film about ww2 i felt it was about Gaza and Seita and Setsuko were Palestinian children trying to escape the horrors. Because of this strong connection to my every day problems of living in a society who is commenting unspeakable crimes against humanity this movie hit me even harder. i never cried so hard, 30 minutes of tiers going down my face. I think that in order to understand the terrors of war every, person in Israel should watch this masterpiece. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dan",

As he walked in the room the man he worked with throughout the movie was behind him, so he knew he was getting killed by his own people so to speak, or a close ally. A second or two later bang he\u2019s shot dead. I believe that\u2019s the ending scene. If anyone knows what movie this is that would be amazing.
