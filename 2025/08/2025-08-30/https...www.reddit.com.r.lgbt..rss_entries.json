I am a teen girl who lives with her brother, mother, and father and has come to realize in last year or so she is attracted to women. I realize I am likely bi or something of the such but labels don\u2019t suit me so eh. Ever since I was a small kid my parents have always raised me to believe the gay relationships are normal the same as straight ones (which they are). My family is supportive of lgbtq, we have trans friends and when talking about my future they always refer to a partner as \u201cyour husband or wife.\u201d All I am trying to say is that my family is so supportive that I don\u2019t feel a need to come out I\u2019m just gonna do my thing lol. I also think my sexuality is fairly obvious but they still see me as their baby girl.
