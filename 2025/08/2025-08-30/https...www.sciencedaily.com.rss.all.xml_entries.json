        "description": "Spicomellus afer, a newly analyzed Jurassic ankylosaur from Morocco, is overturning scientists\u2019 understanding of dinosaur evolution. Unlike any other known creature, it carried a collar of meter-long spikes fused directly to its ribs, along with an early form of tail weaponry that predates similar adaptations by over 30 million years. These bizarre features suggest its armor may have been used for show as well as protection, before shifting toward defense in later ankylosaurs.",

By combining machine learning with millions of electronic health records and routine lab tests like cholesterol or kidney function, the system produces \"ML penetrance\" scores that place genetic risk on a spectrum rather than a simple yes/no. Some variants once thought dangerous showed little real-world impact, while others previously labeled uncertain revealed strong disease links.",
