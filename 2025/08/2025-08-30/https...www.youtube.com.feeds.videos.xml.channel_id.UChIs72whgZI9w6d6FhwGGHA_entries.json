The AMD Ryzen 5 5500X3D CPU is for the Latin America market and builds upon the AM4 X3D CPU lineage with a lower frequency 6-core, 12-thread part that has the same vertically stacked cache as the 5600X3D, 5700X3D, and 5800X3D style of CPUs, just on a lower-end part. The 5500X3D likely takes fallout from the manufacturing process and then respins it as a new model, allowing AMD to salvage silicon while theoretically dropping the price in specific markets. AMD has previously done this with the 5600X3D, which was a Micro Center exclusive in the US due to low intended volume.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
