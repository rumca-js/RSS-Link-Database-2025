The feedback was awesome, and one of the most common comments was about the name. You spoke, I listened! The project has been officially renamed to <strong>PHPing</strong>.</p> <p>A huge thank you to everyone who gave their input.</p> <p>For those who missed it, PHPing is a lightweight monitoring tool built in PHP with a single-minded focus: <strong>solving the notification flood problem with parent-child dependencies.</strong></p> <p>If you have a server rack where a switch is the parent of 20 servers, you shouldn&#39;t get 21 alerts when the switch goes down. PHPing solves this by understanding those relationships. If a parent is down, its children&#39;s notifications are automatically suppressed.</p> <p>Core Features (for newcomers):</p> <ul> <li><strong>Parent-Child Dependencies:</strong> The main reason this project exists. Stop alert storms.</li> <",

I want to keep the PC running 24/7, preferably in locked state, so that rocket.chat can be accessible remotely via cloudflare all the time. Right now when I lock the PC rocket.chat turns off after some time, I guess because docker stops. Now, initially I didn&#39;t plan to use it as server so that&#39;s why no windows server and I was unable to install rocket.chat on docker Engine thus using Docker Desktop.

To do this I plan to get adguardhome working on my home network. Unlike other services such as Vaultwarden, I don&#39;t see why this service should be within the tailscale network unless you disagree?</p> <p>Looking further forward, if I wanted adguardhome available remotely when out and about, if I pointed my client device DNS to the host device tailscale device IP, would this in theory work? Probably not so simple but wondering if I am in the right ballpark...</p> <p>Any advice greatly",
