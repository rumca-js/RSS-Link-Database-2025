I like to think I am quite clued up on how to structure a website and then get links etc. So my question is should I just do this myself and see how it goes, or is it essential to pay a company to do this? A spinoff question would then be - why do companies pay for SEO monthly? Wouldn&#39;t it be a one and done thing? What changes in a month? Or am I being naive?
