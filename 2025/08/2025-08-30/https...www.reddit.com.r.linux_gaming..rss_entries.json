Starting No Man&#39;s Sky through SteamVR does the expected thing that it does in a lot of other games, laggy tracking and a lotta ghosting, looking like really low FPS. If I use Monado, the game itself seems to work ok, but the controls are all broken. Snap turning doesn&#39;t function at all, smooth turning stays at max speed no matter how low I set the sensitivity, and the grip controls don&#39;t work at all once inside a ship, so I can&#39;t grab the handle to exit. It also seems that the icons for a lot of the controls in the tutorial are replaced with exclamation points in a yellow triangle. Seems something about going through Monado is breaking the way NMS reads my controllers. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/c0mander5\"> /u/c0mander5 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
