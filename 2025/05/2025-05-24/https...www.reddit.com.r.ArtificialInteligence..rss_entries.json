As you can see, it failed pretty badly. (It didn&#39;t even get the &quot;ixircesi&quot; example I gave it.)</p> <p>The reason it fails so hard at this is because terms like &quot;ixircesi&quot; aren&#39;t in its vocabulary. When it&#39;s writing something like &quot;exercise,&quot; the tokens &quot;exer&quot; and &quot;cise&quot; are fundamental units of prediction for the model. It doesn&#39;t know that &quot;exer&quot; is made up of 4 letters.</p> <p>Now, a decoder transformer (which is what a LLM is in principle) can complete this task in principle. While its vocabulary is still words or parts of words, it also has individual letters in its vocabulary.

I feel this is extremely important given the degree of emotion that people tend to pour into these programs. Whether it is talking with the character about trauma, abuse, thoughts of self harm, or drug addiction, I read a study that just as many people use these bots for therapy as people do for research.

Until now, the only known algorithms for accomplishing certain tasks required an amount of space roughly proportional to their runtime, and researchers had long assumed there\u2019s no way to do better. Williams\u2019 proof established a mathematical procedure for transforming any algorithm \u2014 no matter what it does \u2014 into a form that uses much less space.</p> <p>...
