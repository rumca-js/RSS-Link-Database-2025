        "description": "In communist China, medical care is divided by power and privilege. Retired high-ranking officials enjoy exclusive access to top-tier doctors, free treatment, and elite hospitals\u2014benefits paid for by taxpayers. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens struggle to afford basic care. Some are forced to choose between life and poverty. In one heartbreaking scene, a mother kneels beside her terminally ill daughter, apologizing for having no money left. The daughter replies, \u201cMom, let\u2019s stop treatment. I\u2019ll still be your daughter in the next life.\u201d This is the cruel reality of healthcare under the CCP.\n\nWatch as we expose the brutal inequality of China\u2019s medical system and the human cost of a regime that values status over life.",
