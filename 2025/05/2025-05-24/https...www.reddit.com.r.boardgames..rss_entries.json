There were golf holes painted on the glass with hazards and such. The idea being you drank and wherever the beer line fell after drinking, those were your strokes. I bought a set cuz I thought it was fun. A month or two later there was a football (American) where you drank to your receiver. And just now I saw a baseball themed, where drank to the bases. If you drank nine innings, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d know it. So what would be the generic, umbrella term for these type of games? Pint Glass game, Beer Glass game, or Glass game? None really work.
