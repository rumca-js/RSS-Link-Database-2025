Do i set timezone within env or call for django&#39;s project config every time or.... Goal is to future proof and commit to one way to compare/set time. </p> <p>There are no sensitive checks, mostly for search, filtering. No payments yet.</p> <p>As far as i understand if everything stays on the same server and set to the same timezone it should be fine. Only issues can be if i talk with external server and all those conversions, but im asking about within the app itself. </p> <p>Thanks and ask and ill answer if there anything i missed or did not explain. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lon",

I jumped into the official tutorial, but I didn\u2019t understand much, it was literally the first thing I tried to do in college after learning Python \ud83d\ude05. It was confusing, and I had no idea what was going on.</p> <p>So I created the guide I wish I had back then <strong>super beginner-friendly</strong> and written in plain language.</p> <p>It covers:</p> <ul> <li>Setting up your environment</li> <li>Creating your first Django app</li> <li>Understanding URLs, views, templates, and models</li> <li>Building a basic CRUD app (Templates/Static)</li> <li>",
