The latter is important, because to get this mighty berry to reach its delicious potential, we need to dehydrate it (that is, remove as much water as possible and then hit it with lots of flavour). You could fry it, but, when the weather is lovely, I prefer hands-free cooking, which means roasting it. In this recipe, after roasting, I\u2019ve used one of my favourite braising liquids \u2013 a mix of soy sauce, sake and sesame \u2013 to bring the aubergine back to life.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/24/vegan-recipe-aubergine-braised-soy-sauce-sake-sesame-oil-meera-sodha\">Continue reading...</a>",
