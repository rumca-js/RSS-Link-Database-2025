From my understanding it\u2019s more like traditional downloads, client server kinda thing. </p> <p>But that got me thinking, are there copyright trolls when using Usenet as well? I\u2019m no expert in how copyright trolls work but I\u2019d think it\u2019s at least harder to do so with Usenet right? </p> <p>Idk exactly how Usenet works either yet, is it like newshosting gets the data and hands it to u, or just points u in the direction of the server with the download for u to connect? I\u2019d imagine the latter. </p> <p>I\u2019m honestly just interested to know. I\u2019ll be using a vpn nonetheless. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Predatorxd6996\"> /u/Predatorxd6996 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1kulb01/copyright_trolls_on_usenet/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href",

I truly appreciate those of you who DM&#39;d me, emailed me personally, or messaged me privately. Heck, I even had one of you amazing people message me through LinkedIn! Our dev team was aware, and working on the issue, but I was out of pocket and unable to make a post on Reddit or elsewhere to let people know what was going on.</p> <p>Basically, we continue to outgrow the server cages we have been using as we have been adding a ton of new storage into our system. Our team has essentially been onsite for three straight weeks updating systems and adding enormous numbers of drives. The end result will be an even better product experience for our members and we will no longer have to maintain hardware in so many different data centers. Some people may have notic",
