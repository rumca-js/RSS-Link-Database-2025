My mom showed me a lot of the classics in addition to the new ones that came out during my life, but I hadn&#39;t seen the vast majority of these films since childhood. So, nearly two years ago, I set out to watch every movie from Walt Disney Animation Studios (so, no live-action remakes, no made-for-TV sequels, etc.), in chronological order, to refresh my memory and fill in my blind spots. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. I ranked all of the movies on Letterboxd, and included my favorite moment from each one (usually an animated flourish, but occasionally a quote or an extended sequence). And below, I listed some good and bad surprises, and I ranked villains, vocal performances, and songs, just for fun!</p> <p><a href=\"https://letterboxd.com/grant692/list/disney-ranked/\">https://letterboxd.com/grant692/list/disney-ranked/</a></p> <p>Good Surpri",
