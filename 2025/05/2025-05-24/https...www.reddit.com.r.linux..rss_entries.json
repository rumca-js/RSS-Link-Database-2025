Many have probably created VMs with QEMU, VirtualBox, or any other virtualization stack -- but Linux on x86 has an interesting concept where you can compile the kernel to run like a normal userspace process.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure what exactly could it be useful for in production; I see that people mainly use this to debug custom kernel builds. Regardless, I think it&#39;s an interesting concept that can be fun to play with, and it&#39;s very easy to set up.

Neither forefox or chrome will let me use hulu, disney, tubi, or max. So- it looks like i might need a newer os because what i have isnt supprted, but im not very computer saavy. I just want something that doesnt have to update and change all the dang time, bells and whistles dont really matter too much. Do i get a whole new OS? Will i have to back up everything i have and then put it back? Any help would ne greatly appreciated, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pottedpirate\"> /u/pottedpirate </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ktzh3k/could_anyone_lend_a_digital_hand/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ktzh3k/could_anyone_lend_a_digital_hand/\">[comments]</a></span>",
