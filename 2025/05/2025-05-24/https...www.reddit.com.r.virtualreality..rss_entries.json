Just got an Oculus 2 and hoping to introduce some senior family members to it, and I feel like the very first impression could make or break their interest in it lol. I thought the Oculus (where you just play with the blocks, remote controlled blimp, and dance) tutorial was something that was pretty welcoming and easy. Also a huge bonus that you can do it seated. </p> <p>I saw a lot of recommendations for Puzzling Places so I grabbed that and it\u2019s great.

I did so by learning how VR works, it&#39;s just coding and a camera with sensors, and that&#39;s it. I also looked into relativity, but due to it being 200 dollars didn&#39;t catch my mind because it was a full-fledged VR system by itself, and what I have decided to make is a VR headset for PC, in which my PC will act as a device of VR but display would be shown in my mobile and with sensors and camera continuously feeding the data. My goal with this setup is to have it work with social VR platforms like <strong>VRChat</strong>\u2014to let me move my head and hands naturally inside the virtual space and interact with others in real time. I want to replicate full-body movements as best as possible with affordable components, so I can hang out, dance, and communicate in VRChat without investing in expensive gear. ",

With these modes, the game ran smooth with a bit of an oily, smeared look to it. Not amazing but I could totally get past it. However, I found the biggest problem with these modes is the latency increase. The input lag was really bad and made the game pretty unplayable. I haven&#39;t seen anyone mention this and it totally caught me by suprise. </p> <p>Switching to &quot;Legacy AER&quot; (which has no interpolation) improved graphics pretty significantly and more importantly solved the input lag problem. The issue was that 60fps per eye was really choppy and ended up giving me pretty bad motion sickness. </",

Gorn wouldn\u2019t open at all. Skyrim VR looked like dogsh*t even with a mod to make it look better that game had the least lag. Walking dead saints and sinners worked fine but had lag spikes here and there but the image quality also was bad (Refunded after an hr). And some free VR games I\u2019ve tried all worked fine terrible image quality and reaction lagged a lot even when I was alone",
