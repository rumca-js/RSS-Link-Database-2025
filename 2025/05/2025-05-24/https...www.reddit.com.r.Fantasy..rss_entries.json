I loved how there were guns and I loved all the family drama. <em>BUT</em> there are few this that keep on bothering me.</p> <p>First of all I felt that the author kept trying to show the clans in a very positive light. I love morally grey and even evil main characters. But only when it is acknowledged that they are not good. There were instances when some characters objected against some questionable things the main characters and the clan did, but then those people were just painted as negative. Like for instance, Niko. I loved how he stood up to Hilo and acknowledged the problems to his face. Honestly Niko wasn&#39;t wrong, but at the end it is just shown that what he did was wrong of him and he came back and apologized. And the clanless movement storyline had so much more potential to make some strong points against the clan",

For many years, I&#39;ve been keeping a list of words I encounter in fantasy books that I don&#39;t immediately know the meaning of. I usually understand them from context though. At this point my language level is near fluent, but I still encounter words I don&#39;t know. </p> <p>I rarely encounter this issue in books that are not fantasy. So my question is this: do fantasy authors routinely use &quot;harder&quot; (for lack of a better word) words than authors of other types of books? Or is it just coincidence that I keep encountering these types of words in fantasy books and not elsewhere? Or am I just uneducated and these words are actually very common? What is your experience?</p> <p>For reference, here are the latest words I&#39;ve added to my list:</p> <p>Obdurate</p> <p>Svelte</p>",

It is beautifully written with real depth to the central three &quot;Nazgul&quot; type characters. Supposedly written as a LOTR from the losing sides point of view it&#39;s more a mixture of that and the mythology of the Silmarillion. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for some Tolkien like tales. The &quot;good&quot; side are more sketchy but this genuinely works inside the tale as the main characters are unaware of their plans.

But it is it so hard to write a <em>fantasy</em> story where gender or sexuality is treated equally?</p> <p>The problem is, I still want something mature but not grimdark. I feel like most of the books I&#39;ve read have to point out things that are wrong with our society. When I read books, I want to escape from reality.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/drop_MAC-10_pls\"> /u/drop_MAC-10_pls </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ku54qa/recommendation_of_books_that_do_not_have_any/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

I have been having trouble caring about the plot, the characters and what happens next. I loved the Divine Cities Trilogy, so I want to like this one too. Does the third book get noticeably different or better? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PoiEagle\"> /u/PoiEagle </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ku0fri/question_about_foundryside_the_founders_trilogy/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ku0fri/question_about_foundryside_the_founders_trilogy/\">[comments]</a></span>",

If you found that one to be unbearably annoying (which I completely understand) you won\u2019t like this either. But if you enjoyed HTRTWADT, I am happy to say that Wexler wrapped the duology up perfectly. Every bit as silly, but also with a lot of heart.</p> <p>The books starts out with Davi working to prevent a war between the wilders and the Kingdom. She is, given the events of the first book, able to play both sides, using both her friends and allies among the wilders and her deep knowledge of the Kingdom. This involves both convincing the people on both sides who would welcome peace that peace is possible, while also overcoming resistance from those (again on both sides) who actively oppose any sort of peace. Much maneuvering happens. Along the way we finally get to meet the oft-mentioned Prince Johann the Himbo Boyfriend. Happy to report that he fits all",
