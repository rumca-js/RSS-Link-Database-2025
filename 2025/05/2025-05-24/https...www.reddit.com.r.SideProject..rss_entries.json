Instead of using -1, the symbol <code>T</code> is often used. So, for example, <code>T10</code> means:<br/> (-1 \u00d7 9) + (1 \u00d7 3) + (0 \u00d7 1) = -6.</p> <p>It\u2019s a <em>balanced</em> system because the digits are symmetrically distributed around zero. This makes certain computations, comparisons, and even some hardware designs cleaner \u2014 and it&#39;s an interesting area of research in computer science and mathematics.</p> <p>While researching Goldstein&#39;s theorem and analyzing number distributions in balanced ternary for research, I needed to convert large datasets between decimal and balanced ternary.
