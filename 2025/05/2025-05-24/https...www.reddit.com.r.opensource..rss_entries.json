Aside from using an exotic language and paradigm for development, it is similar to dwm, but is highly customizable, has extensive documentation and some nice and even rare features. E.g. keymap and command selection lists, ability to dynamically create/delete/move/rename workspaces and even basic window animations.</p> <p>It&#39;s not yet the first stable release, but it&#39;s getting close and is in active development.
