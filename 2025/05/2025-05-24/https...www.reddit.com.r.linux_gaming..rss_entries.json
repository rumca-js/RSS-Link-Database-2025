I watched YouTube benchmarks on the same GPU (AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT with Ryzen 5 7600 as CPU, 16GB RAM), and they had way better performance. Then I tried installing the game on Windows, and I too got much better frame rates.</p> <p>With Linux, I get about 100 on ray-tracing ultra on 1080p, with FSR3 framegen enabled. However, even the framegen does not feel like it is doing anything; it boosts the framerate in numbers, but it still feels below 60 FPS. On Windows my monitor was locked at 60Hz so with FSR3 FG on, I got stable 120 FPS on same settings on the benchmark.</p> <p>I tried running the game in gamemode too, but that did not help.

Turns out you need to also run &quot;flatpak update com.valvesoftware.Steam&quot; every time you change your driver version and download the corresponding Steam Flatpak, which I was unaware of. Hopefully this saves someone time down the line. Have a great day! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/StandardishPotential\"> /u/StandardishPotential </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ktzsiv/psa_using_steam_flatpak_and_updating_drivers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ktzsiv/psa_using_steam_flatpak_and_updating_drivers/\">[comments]</a></span>",
