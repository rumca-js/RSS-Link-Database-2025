        "description": "Arline Mann, a former Goldman Sachs managing director turned painter, brings a lawyer\u2019s precision and an artist's intuition to illuminate the quiet resurgence of representational painting in a digital age. Mann dissects the movement's broader return to classical technique, human touch and lived experience, making a case for realism as not just tradition, but a countercurrent and a lasting presence in contemporary art.",
