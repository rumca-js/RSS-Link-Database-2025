Current paradigms focus on alignment through control, incentives, or constraints. But perhaps the path to truly safe AI lies not in programming obedience, but in cultivating empathy. This paper argues that AI safety may ultimately require a foundation not of logic or fear, but of love. By reframing AI not as a tool to be constrained but as an agent to be nurtured, we open the door to a model of relational safety\u2014one that mirrors the way trust is built in human development. We suggest that the practice of love, modeled as a cognitive and ethical structure, may be the only viable path to long-term coexistence with systems that rival or surpass human intelligence.</p> <p><strong>1.

Another source we need to but haven&#39;t been able to scrape is LinkedIn. </p> <p>We did try using OpenAI web-search-preview to scrape some of the data from LinkedIn. </p> <p>Approach: 1. Open a session on browser 2. Log in to LinkedIn 3. Set the cache LI_AT in the Pupeteer code. 4. Use this to open up the browser, go to pre-logged in LinkedIn, look up the company</p> <p>Problem is: it just blocks the account after a couple of tries. Mind you we have been trying this out on Sagemaker. So it might be blocking the IP after a few hits.</p> <p>From my observation, any platform which requires login kinda fucks up CUA for now. </p> <p>Any ideas on how we go about solving this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",

A lot of people attribute it to poor prompts, but I think there\u2019s more than that.</p> <p>We know AI is great at MVPs and scripts. But in my experience the benefits it gives you go down a lot in large apps, especially using something like cursor/roo/claude code.</p> <p>So I think everyone that says \u201cit\u2019s increasing my productivity immensely\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s useless\u201d or anything in between should add a disclaimer about the size of the application they\u2019re using it for and its scope so we can understand if it\u2019s good prompts vs bad prompts, a tooling issue or just small app vs big app. Otherwise there\u2019s just this huge polarization in the community and every day we\u2019re not getting closer to understanding why it\u2019s happening.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dudevan\"> /u/dud",
