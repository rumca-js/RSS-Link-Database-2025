        "description": "FromSoftware's Elden Ring has become ever-present in discussions about world design, and for good reason. Both the base game and Shadow of the Erdtree are renowned for their incredible open worlds, the latter more recently for utilizing verticality to retain a unique sense of scale.\n\nThis makes Elden Ring Nightreign all the more interesting since it's essentially a multiplayer-focused map with a battle royale-esque circle closing in on players. Despite its smaller size next to the Lands Between and Land of Shadow, it still inculcates that sense of discovery, even as locations become familiar over multiple runs. \n\nLet's dive deeper into the world of Limveld and what makes it so enthralling ahead of Elden Ring Nightreign's launch on May 30th for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4, and PC.",
