It ends right there and another plot(charachter) begins. Honestly i find each plot interesting on its own but it gets frustrating. Say i get invested in a character and their journey and then it ends abruptly. I fold the book , shelf it and pick it up again months later , repeat the cycle.</p> <p>Also, i think the best story/characters for me just passed through the past pages.

Lets say Hungry Joe the first few pages are conversations and character development on and around Hungry Joe but then it has other character their story, conversations etc., and difficult to comprehend.

I know Sula is widely acknowledged as a brilliantly written novel, but for some reason, this particular line is seldom mentioned in that discourse (at least as far as I\u2019ve seen). It comes from a scene between Eva and her daughter, Hannah: \u201cWhat you talking\u2019 \u2018bout did I love you girl I stayed alive for you.\u201d To me, this line acts as a sort of emotional climax to one of the book\u2019s earlier themes, the harsh realities of survivalist motherhood. It\u2019s a brutally concise way of expressing how, for a lot of women like Eva, love often couldn\u2019t be tender, because necessity always came first. Eva neglected her children emotionally at times, that\u2019s not in dispute, but that line also forces you to reckon with what she did do: she stayed alive. That was her version of love, and it wasn\u2019t nothing. I\u2019m not trying to paint Eva as a hero, she\u2019s a deeply compl",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I was listening to Stacked podcast and it brought the ending into question for me. I never realized just how ambiguous it was. </p> <p>1) Was Candace really pregnant? The podcast casts some doubt because her timeline is all skewed and no one ever noticed her big belly.</p> <p>2) Was Candace fevered at the end? I was wondering this too to be honest. She wouldn\u2019t stop driving or stop for gas. Jonathan\u2019s old routine was becoming her\u2019s somehow, and she was embracing a nostalgia she never had the whole book. Plus she was embracing her mom\u2019s ideal alternate life in Chicago. I thought no because first we see the gridlock of cars then a crane collapse then it opens up after the crane collapse and there\u2019s open road and buildings. I thought that signified society getting stuck in capital and how the Shen Fever made it come to a crashing end but that\u2019s there\u2019s hope for it. </p> <p>3) Did Candace murder Eddie and/or Bob? Were they actually fevered?",
