She says this because if she saw a trans person in a changinroom she would have a full blown panic attack and therefore does not want it. I know this is not ok in the slightest but it feels very incentive to ask her to fix her problems insted.

I am pretty sex-repulsed but not sure if I&#39;m on the ace spectrum, have some kind of unresolved trauma etc. Generally speaking, I have no issues with this situation since I simply don&#39;t have sex. But other people are often bothered when they want to talk about sexual experiences and I ask them not to. Just had a second friend practically beg me to go for therapy because &quot;something is wrong&quot; with me. Now I&#39;m questioning my whole world view. I&#39;m sure she meant it in a way that she thinks I could live more comfortably if sex as a topic wasn&#39;t such a trigger for me but now I just feel bad about myself. And I did see a therapist once but they agreed that this wasn&#39;t really a big issue that needed to be worked on since it only really affects me in friendships.
