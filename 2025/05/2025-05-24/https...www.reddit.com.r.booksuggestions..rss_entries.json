No stats, no dice \u2014 just layered consequences and evolving character identity.</p> <p>We ended up writing over 2,000 pages of branching narrative \u2014 full of moral dilemmas, social dynamics, and ambiguous choices that leave the reader wondering whether they\u2019ve done the right thing (or what that even means).</p> <p>The hardest part?

I don&#39;t have any attachments with him as I only have a little to no memory of him. I sometimes find myself upset and mad at him, he died in a vehicular accident (drunk driving). A feeling of grief and sadness has been lingering inside me throughout my whole life. I don&#39;t exactly know how to cope and grieve for someone whom I never actually remember. I know he loved me when he was still here, but as bad as it sounds, I think of him as a stranger. My mom also rarely talks about him. I&#39;m a girl, and I always find myself so sad and jealous seeing other girls with their loving fathers. This also significantly impacted how I viewed myself growing up and my relationships with men.

I want books that specifically feel like the atmosphere of Dreams : they are dreamlike, surreal, as if the dream of a teenager about crazy stuff happening and it feels so momentarily real that we forget that it is diversion from life itself. Plus, these are the moments of our life we really care about and hold deep towards to the point of recurrence. A unforgettable experience in itself but ironically also the one we forget the easiest. May it be anything meeting a celebrity, talking to a friend who is no longer around, an older girl you had crush who doesn&#39;t even remember your name , but has been asking it around to every person in the town recently. This type of stories always gives me chills . They are more about life rather than our daily mundane occurrences or stories about them. You&#39;d be doing me a huge favor.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --",

I read the Dune series by Frank Herbert (originals only, not any of his son\u2019s work) last year and I\u2019m currently on book three of A Song of Ice and Fire. I\u2019m looking for another series to start after I finish. I really enjoyed the overall feel of Dune: sci-fi, politics and a bit of environmentalism. It felt more plot driven to me than character driven which I enjoyed. One of my favorite things about Dune was reading things in later books that made open and forgotten concepts from earlier books just kind of click into place. I know the obvious answer is Star Wars but I haven\u2019t even began to dabble in the fandom and haven\u2019t seen any of the movies so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m ready to commit to something so huge. I prefer series in the 3-5 book range. Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lolo_mar\"> /u/lolo_mar </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"htt",

I couldn\u2019t put this one down. The characters and fight scenes and tension made me feel like I was fighting for my life next to the characters. The plot twists were amazing. </p> <p>I just loved absolutely everything about this book. I\u2019m desperate to get this high again, but I don\u2019t know where to even begin.
