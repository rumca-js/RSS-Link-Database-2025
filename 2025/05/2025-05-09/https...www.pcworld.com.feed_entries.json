The only thing that can ruin the day when the sun is shining is your phone\u2019s low battery warning. Thankfully, the Baseus Picogo power bank is an easy fix for this problem, no matter where you are going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Baseus Picogo MagSafe power banks are not only going to save you in a pinch, but they\u2019re also going to serve as gorgeous accessories. With a slim build and a beautiful design, these power banks have an aluminum alloy cover. That not only makes them sturdy enough to survive life in your bag, but it also makes it easy to avoid overheating during charges because heat dissipates more easily. Meanwhile, the soft-touch silicone cover is scratch- and wear-resistant, and reveals no unsightly fingerprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the smooth casi",

Fortunately, in the age of robots you can ditch the laborious chores of manually skimming leaves from your pool\u2019s surface and scrubbing algae from its walls and floors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invest in a modern robotic pool cleaner and let that machine do that dirty work for you. (Sadly, we haven\u2019t yet seen a robot that can scrub our toilet bowls.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These labor-saving pool bots come in various shapes and sizes with diverse capabilities, not to mention a wide array of prices. The most sophisticated models go for $2,000 or more.

They seemed too small and weak to provide the home office performance I needed. But one day I decided to try one out\u2026 and quickly changed my stance. Today\u2019s mini PCs are actually pretty amazing, delivering solid power in a compact chassis at a cheap price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the Beelink EQR6, for example. It\u2019s about the size of your palm, fits neatly under your monitor, contains decently powerful specs, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-SER6-PCIE4-0-Display-Computer/dp/B0CYPV1LBZ/\">it\u2019s only $389 at Amazon right now</a>. That\u2019s 22% off its $499 MSRP. This is a Prime-exclusive deal, but if you don\u2019t have Prime, you can still score this mini PC at this price by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\">signing up for a free 30-day Prime trial</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p",
