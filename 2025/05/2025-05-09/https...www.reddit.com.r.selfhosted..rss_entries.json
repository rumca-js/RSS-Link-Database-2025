I would like to have training videos and tests with the ability to make courses would be nice. I am trying to find something that can be launched with docker compose but the options seem limited. I would also like Authentik support preferably through OIDC. I have setup Moodle and it seems great but its much too heavy for my needs. I have been looking at Chamilo, ILIAS, and CanvasLMS. None of there seem to support docker so I would need to spin up a vm just for this which is a pain in my ass. I will do that if thats what it takes but I do not want to do that over and over so I need to do my best to pick the best thing first. Thank you all for your input. If there are other cool features of an LMS that maybe I am not thinking about please let me know too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",

Its been working well but I ran into a snag with Frigate which also uses this folder. When I make a new folder or add a file, via Windows SMB, it puts the ownership to the root user. Ive come to find out that Frigate wants to use user 100000.</p> <p>Is there a method to set the default user when using SMB? </p> <p>To make it more confusing I also store immich photos on the same mount which DOES use root. Not sure if I can select the user based on the sub folder? </p> <p>As Im typing this I wonder if the better solution is to convert frigate to also use root and not mess with cockpit. Anyways just looking for a soluition. As you can probably tell I&#39;m only 6mo into using linux so some of this is new to me. Appreciate any help</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",

I have setup everything for selfhosted media (arrs, qbittorent, Jellyfin) and followed the trashguides for configuration and folder structure. It feels like even though I have hardlink activated in sonarr and radarr the size of my torrent folder is bigger than my media folder. I would really appreciate the help. When I check the torrent folder properties there are a lot of hidden folders(ugos nas) and when I go inside and check each of the specific media categories folder, their size is according to the media one. What are all these hidden files/folders? Have I messed up any configuration? Is this behavior normal?

All i know is that it is like providing in isolated place to run application in it, so if a mulfunction or security breach happen, it won&#39;t affect or expose the rest of your system. Is that right? So is that like some sort of Virtual Machine?</p> <p>But what are really the use cases of it? For instance If am running Audiobookshelf, Calibre, and Some other local app remotely through my other devices from other networks for eprosnal use, do I really need to put those apps in a docker? How necessary is that? How much extra security does it bring? Or is it not worth the effort in such cases?</p> <p>There are way more qiestions I have, but lets keep it limited to these for now.</p> <p>Thank you in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ExtremePresence3030\"> /u/ExtremePresence3030 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfho",
