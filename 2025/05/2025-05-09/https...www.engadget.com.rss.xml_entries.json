Clocking in at 1.5 pounds, it weighs almost the same as the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and its 7.8mm thickness also makes it the thinnest Surface ever. But it's also running a slower processor than last year's 13-inch Surface Pro, and is stuck with a far worse screen. Its keyboard, which is once again sold separately for $149, also doesn't angle up for ergonomic typing.</p> \n<p>So was that all worth it for a more compact $800 Surface Pro? It depends on what you're looking for. If you've been hankering for an incredibly light Windows tablet that can occasionally transform into an adorable 12-inch laptop, the Surface Pro is a success.
