At the company I work for, the &quot;powers that be&quot; are really pushing to get an AI voice agent deployed (multiple; like an entire call centers worth). . Our manager has found a couple of solutions that we have been able to work with and develop, but nothing to the scale or quality that the higher ups want. So to my question, does anyone have any recommendations or know what the best AI voice agent solution is? They really want it to be conversational and not *collect user prompt &gt; read through the entirety of the knowledge base with items related to the prompt*; like trying to give someone instructions, but you read all 20 instructions without stopping. They want something that can stop, make sure the user is following along, verify they are, then continue with the steps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DrTrannn\"> /u/DrTrannn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.r",
