But the dragons are very secondary in this story and almost feel like an afterthought. There are dragons present throughout but we never really get to know them. The main character Anequs&#39; dragon is mentioned every other page, but all she does is have vague emotions or play. And now and then we get an update on how big she is or how her appearance has changed. But that&#39;s about it when it comes to dragon content.</p> <p>What this book is really about is colonialism, racism and academic learning. So here are my thoughts on those aspects.</p> <p>The colonialism: Interesting concept to apply to a dragon story but nothing new was brought to the table.</p> <p>The racism: Very heavy handed with no subtlety or nuance. It almost became tedious because the same talking points were repeated over and over. </p> <p>The academic learn",

As premise, this does not count as hard mode. However, as Yeva stays in the palace, she does become more assimilated, learns the language of the people (her mother&#39;s ancestors), their culture. Basically, she behaves as an immigrant. There are albeit, parts where she does track the dragon, but in the story itself it is clear that she&#39;s sort of adapted to the land. At the finale, she does end up staying at the kingdom, having decided she&#39;s better off there than in her old home, where she felt isolated. She also stays because at the climax of the story, she ends up betraying her old kingdom to save her lover.</p> <p>So technically, would this be Stranger in a Strange Land hard mode?

The <em>Spellmonger</em> series felt right up my alley, but it escalated into a nationwide war halfway through the first book. I actually enjoy escalating the stakes gradually over a slice-of-life story, but I don&#39;t want it to happen that quickly. </p> <p>Weirdly enough, what comes to mind most are series like <em>Rivers of London,</em> or <em>the Dresden Files.</em> Neither are small town focused in the slightest, but both focus on a wizard helping out his local community with often mundane-seeming problems at times, building up a group of allies to help him eventually take down the big bad. </p> <p>I&#39;d like to see that, but in a more countryside setting. Any recs? </p> </div><",

Villoso (4.5 out of 5)</p> <p>Queen Talyien&#39;s husband left her the day they both were to be crowned King and Queen. For five years she struggles alone to maintain peace in her land, until her husband sends her a message asking to meet in a foreign land. Talyien travels alone in secret to meet him with just a few trusted staff and guards. However, the meeting goes awry after an assassination attempt leaves her alone and stranded in a foreign country, not knowing who to trust.</p> <p>This is character driven fantasy and I loved Talyien. Villoso managed to write such a complex character that is somehow strong yet weak, confident yet full of self-doubts. Some reviewers talked about being disappointed in the book because they had expected this big badass female protaganist--she is titled &quot;The Bitch Queen&quot; after all. But I felt like many of them were missing the point. This is a woman in a leader",
