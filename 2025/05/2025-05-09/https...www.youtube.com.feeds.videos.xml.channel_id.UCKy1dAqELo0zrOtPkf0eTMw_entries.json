        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nNintendo has been updating their user licensing agreement for Nintendo Switch Online, and not surprisingly, they want to punish people for violating their terms and conditions. If you're caught modding, hacking, reverse engineering, or doing a number of other things to their hardware or software, Nintendo reserves the right to render your Nintendo device \"unusable in whole or in part.\" In other words: they'll brick your Switch or presumably your Switch 2. Oh, and they may listen in on your Switch Online voice chats, too. In other news, famed game designer Hideki Kamiya wants to go back to his hit 2001 action game, Devil May Cry. The game spawned a successful franchise, but Kamiya definitely sees how dated the gameplay is. After he's done rebooting Okami for Capcom, he'd like a shot at Devil May Cry (not counting the reboot DmC, which he was not a part of). And finally, the next installment in the Godzilla x Kong series is in production, with a 2027 release date. ",

        "description": "Watch the Launch Trailer for Doom: The Dark Ages, the latest addition to the first-person shooter franchise developed by Id Software. Players will rise as the Doom Slayer once more in a past era to conquer gods and kings, shred enemies with devastating favorites like the Super Shotgun while also wielding a variety of new bone-chewing weapons, including the versatile Shield Saw. From more intimate combat styles with demons, flying atop a Mecha Dragon, or mobilizing in a tower-sized mech, the Doom Slayer has plenty of new toys to play with his food. Doom: The Dark Ages is launching on May 15 for PlayStation 5 (PS5), Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam).\n\n#DoomTheDarkAges #Gaming #IGN",
