I think the only things we are missing are Inside Threat Protection. We were looking at several companies that provide more services, but I feel like this is overkill. From what I found, the only thing that we would need is a SOC, as we really do not have that, and a centralized logging system. I was thinking of creating playbooks using LogicApp / PowerAutomate or something like that for a type of SOC, where we take action on specific alerts that has occurred overnight / weekend.

From what I understand, CSP helps prevent attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by controlling which resources a browser can load. But how critical is it in practice? If a website already has a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in place, does skipping CSP pose significant risks? For example, could XSS or other script-based attacks still slip through? I\u2019m also curious about real-world cases\u2014have you seen incidents where the absence of CSP caused major issues, even with a WAF? Lastly, how do you balance CSP\u2019s benefits with its implementation challenges (e.g., misconfigurations breaking sites)? Looking forward to your insights!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Necessary_Rope_8014\"> /u/Necessary_Rope_8014 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ki6s18/how_critical_is_contentsecuritypolicy_in_",
