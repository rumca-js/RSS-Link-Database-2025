It mostly tells the story of two thieves who, despite their seeming lack of luck when it comes to stealing, decide to target bigger this time. This book&#39;s writing simply gets to the plot without any lag or overwhelming details or words in between, which is one of the things that makes it so fantastic. The character chemistry and interaction between these two thieves are quite entertaining to read, and the interludes of humor provide a feeling of realism to the conversations. It only has one chapter for now, but this one is really great. I hope the next chapters will be released soon.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Consistent_Art_8627\"> /u/Consistent_Art_8627 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kic2gq/this_new_suspense_book_is_sure_to_become_a/\">[li",

I\u2019ve read E.E. knight\u2019s Age of Fire series and loved it, but there\u2019s humanoids involved. I\u2019ll accept books that don\u2019t necessarily have dragons either, such as Redwall, as long as humans aren\u2019t around.
