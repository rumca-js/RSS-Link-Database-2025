        "description": "AI coding agents are no longer a distant idea\u2014they're already starting to reshape how we work. \n\nYC's Tom Blomfield and David Lieb discuss how AI coding tools are transforming software development, why small, high-agency teams will be able to do what once took armies of engineers, and why there's never been a better time to start something new. They explore the bigger picture too: a future where there's more abundance, knowledge work becomes more accessible, and founders have more leverage than ever before.\n\nIf you're thinking about building, there's no better moment than right now.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:46 The combine harvester argument for AI\n2:23 Building with no-code tools\n5:37 The arguments against AI coding\n7:01 Jevons Paradox\n9:26 What happens to the software jobs of today?\n12:16 How will these tools affect knowledge work?\n15:08 The transitory challenge period for people\n16:21 Advice for future founders",
