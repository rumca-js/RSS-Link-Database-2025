On the frontend, we are are planning to use Angular (to be consistent with our other applications).</p> <p>I have hired two other Django developers that I found through this subreddit in the past, and they both have been awesome, so hoping for a similar experience again.</p> <p>The job is located in College Station, TX. In a perfect world, the candidate we choose would be close to this location, but I am open to hiring a remote resource if we can&#39;t find the right person close (some travel will be required, especially at the beginning if this is the case).
