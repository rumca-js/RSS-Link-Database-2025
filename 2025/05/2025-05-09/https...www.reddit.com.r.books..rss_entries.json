I hoped for more scenes with a main character right in the thick of action-like the parts of this story where we&#39;re following the troop in Iceland-but it\u2019s still far from disappointing. I\u2019ve mostly stuck to high fantasy because I love it, but now I\u2019m excited to broaden my horizons a bit! I liked the multi faction, jumping back and forth between parties, that this book did but also now interested in single party stories.

I recently decided to listen to the audiobook, and this time I came away feeling much less impressed overall. I don&#39;t want to denigrate Westover&#39;s achievements; she is undoubtedly a blisteringly intelligent person who has worked hard to get to where she is now. But for a book called <em>Educated</em>, I&#39;m left feeling like there is a lot of grey area in her education. Maybe I have just never met someone as intelligent or hardworking as her, but I am just not comprehending how someone can go from literally no formal education to getting a PhD at Cambridge on a normal timeline. Does BYU regularly accept students who not only lack a high school diploma but a GRE as well? I could buy getting a 27 on the ACT if you&#39;re self-taught and able to study as much as she was without school to worry about - I got a 32, and I&#39;m n",
