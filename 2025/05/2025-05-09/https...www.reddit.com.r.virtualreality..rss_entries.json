I&#39;m currently looking at the Asus RT-AX82U (AX5400) and the Asus RT-AX3000 (AX3000).</p> <p>What\u2019s confusing is that I keep seeing both of them listed for around the same price, sometimes the AX82U is actually cheaper, even though on paper, the AX82U looks faster and is more feature-packed.</p> <p>Is there a reason these are priced so similarly? Is the AX3000 somehow better in ways that aren&#39;t obvious?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cubed_Candy\"> /u/Cubed_Candy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kiutci/asus_rtax82u_vs_asus_rtax3000/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kiutci/asus_rtax82u_vs_asus_rtax3000/\">[comments]</a></span>",
