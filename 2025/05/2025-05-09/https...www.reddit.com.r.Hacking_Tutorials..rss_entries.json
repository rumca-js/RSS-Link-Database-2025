I&#39;ve also completed most of the labs on PortSwigger and read a lot of hacking books.That said, despite all this effort, I still feel like I\u2019m stuck. I wouldn\u2019t call myself a beginner anymore, but I feel like I\u2019ve been at the intermediate stage for a long time without making real progress. Sometimes, it even feels like I\u2019m not a \u201creal\u201d hacker.I\u2019m ready to invest some money into leveling up my skills. I can\u2019t afford a certification right now, but I can spare around $15/month. I was considering either a THM Premium subscription or HTB Academy. I\u2019m especially interested in HTB Academy\u2019s Bug Bounty path, which I believe costs around $8/month if you have a student email (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) but i am also open to any suggesti",
