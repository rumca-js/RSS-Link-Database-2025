After install I played my first session, everything&#39;s fine, no issues. Now though? Every time I start it for some reason the game&#39;s music and SFX are muted or missing. AND ONLY THOSE. The menu interact sounds work just fine, and dialogue plays too. Music and SFX though? Gone. SFX meaning environment, ambient, spell, ability, movement and all those sound effects. If it was just music I wouldn&#39;t mind too much but without SFX it&#39;s grating as hell.</p> <p>The only &quot;fix&quot; I&#39;ve been able to find is reinstalling. And since it&#39;s a 114 GB I really don&#39;t feel like uninstalling then reinstalling every time I wanna play the game. Verifying integrity of game files does nothing. Switching proton versions works only once for any version then the game doesn&#39;t start. I need help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"http",

I wanted to try my G29 which has worked flawlessly on Windows on linux and couldn&#39;t seem to connect it. I read that it needs to be switched to PS3 mode, but it seems to be stuck on the PS4 mode according to the terminal when I do lsusb even though the switch is on PS3. I assume the switch is broken.
