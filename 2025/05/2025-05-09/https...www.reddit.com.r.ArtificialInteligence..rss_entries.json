The Arc B580 doesn&#39;t beat the A100 all across the board, but the performance differences do lead me to serious questions about what limits the B580&#39;s usefulness in AI workloads. Namely, to what extent are the differences due to software, such as driver tuning, and hardware limitations? Will driver tuning and changes in firmware eventually address the limitations, or will the architecture create a hard limit? Either way, this inquiry is twofold in nature, and we need to analyze both the software and the hardware to determine whether there is the potential for performance parity in AI workloads in the future.</p> <p>I am informal about this .Thanks for your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BonelyCore\"> /u/BonelyCore </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",

So it can be educative, fun, or anything in between. </p> <p>The session will be joined by maximum of 30 people. The only other restraints are that it should ideally be interactive (participants wont have laptops, but will have phones) and it should last for approximately 20 minutes.</p> <p>Any idea and help is more then welcome.

A lot of IT and programmers have a very optimistic view that AI is more likely to increase the number of new positions, which I personally don&#39;t think at all.</p> <p>We are living in capitalism and web development etc. positions will instead decrease and there will be more pressure for efficiency, so 10 positions in 2025 will be done by 1 person in the near future.</p> <p>Is there something I&#39;m missing here? Why should I pay a programmer 100k a year in a near future when AI agent will be able to design, program and even test it better than a human withing minutes?</p> <p>As hard as it sounds, the market doesn&#39;t care that someone has been in the craft for 20 years, as long as I can find a cheaper and faster variation, no one cares.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Worth_Telephone_3450\"> /u/Worth_Teleph",
