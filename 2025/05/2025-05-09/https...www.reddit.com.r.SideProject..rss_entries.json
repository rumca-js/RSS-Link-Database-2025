I started my Etsy shop PrintMuseWorks recently, creating retro and cozy designs like coasters, sweatshirts, and travel art\u2014all made with Canva and Printify. It\u2019s just me doing everything: design, listings, Pinterest, and socials.</p> <p>I\u2019ve posted videos, made boards, and tried keywords\u2014but still no sales. Just a few likes and saves. I know a lot of you started from scratch too, and I\u2019d love to hear: What finally tipped the scale for you? Was it product photos? A viral Pin? A Reddit post?</p> <p>Let\u2019s share and help each other out. I\u2019m still learning, still grinding, and not giving up.</p> <p>Thanks in advance to anyone who replies!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PM-W-2541\"> /u/PM-W-2541 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1ki70ks/launched_my_etsy_shop_solo_with_zero_budgetstill/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Si",

Just focus on creating value without expecting anything in return (yes, even \u201cmentioning\u201d your offer counts as an ask). People naturally gravitate toward useful content. And the serious buyers will figure out what you do on their own.</p> <p>Saw someone on this sub put it perfectly, (also seen the same pattern with our users): &quot;Worrying about showing your offer when there\u2019s no real audience to see it is a losing strategy.&quot;</p> <p>If done right, it\u2019s a scalable revenue channel.<b",
