But did the number go up in any significant way since then? I was thinking about it this week, and I\u2019ve not only never seen an app that used these link-outs, I\u2019d never even heard about one that did. And I try more apps than most people, and I hear about a lot more apps than most people. If you\u2019re aware of any apps that used this (or even better, if you\u2019re a developer who did use it), <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/contact/\">let me know</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It seem",
