Wouldn&#39;t it be great to have a 3-on, 1-off, 4-on, 2-off schedule or a 3-on, 2-off, 2-on, 3-off schedule?</p> <p>And the calendar would be much simpler. It could have eleven 30-day months and a final twelfth month of 30+ days to include extra days to match the solar year.</p> <p>I invite you to imagine this together at <a href=\"https://TenDayWeekCalendar.com\">https://TenDayWeekCalendar.com</a></p> <p>It lets you connect your Google Calendar &amp; Tasks and Microsoft To Do so you can see how your plans fit into 10-day weeks.</p> <p>And if you are a freelancer or a person who works at any convenient time, then perhaps you will want to live and work by this calendar. ;-)</p> <p>Have fun!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kentich\"> /u/kentich </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://tendayweekcalendar.com/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",
