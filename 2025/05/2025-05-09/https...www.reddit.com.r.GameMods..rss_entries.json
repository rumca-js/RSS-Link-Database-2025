He randomly became imposter though already there were other three imposters and he was able to kill,shapeshift and Vent without any cooldown limit. In next game when he died by voting out he spawned 100 guardian angel around all imposters and crewmate&#39;s body. I tried to find the mod nowhere to be found when I asked him he didn&#39;t reply the only thing he said is it was free if incase someone knows such mod please share it in comments still hard to find. . </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/idkwhomoggedme\"> /u/idkwhomoggedme </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1kinxg4/among_us_2025328_mod/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1kinxg4/among_us_2025328_mod/\">[comments]</a></span>",
