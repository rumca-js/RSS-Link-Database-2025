It was 2020 and the country was in the middle of a Covid lockdown. This time the streets were packed with up to a million fans eager to witness the club\u2019s first victory parade in 35 years as it looped round the city on bank holiday Monday.</p><p>Triumphant Liverpool players began the slow open-top bus journey at about 2.30pm on Queens Drive, south-east of the city centre. It was due to finish at about 7.30pm at Blundell Street near Royal Albert Dock. But the celebrations were brutally curtailed. This time not by a global pandemic but a lone driver in a people carrier.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/27/visual-guide-to-how-the-liverpool-parade-collision-unfolded\">Continue reading...</a>",
