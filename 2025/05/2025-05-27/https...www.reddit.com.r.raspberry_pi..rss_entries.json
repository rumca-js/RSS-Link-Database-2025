Saw Jeff&#39;s review on those SSD HATS and got interested. My question is, is there a big performance difference between using NVME SSD and SATA SSD? Since Pi 5 is only able to use one lane of PCIE Gen2. How much faster the NVME SSD need to be compared to SATA SSD to justify the additional spending? Where I&#39;m from, storage isn&#39;t really cheap and NVME price is much higher compared to older SATA SSD. I&#39;ll be using the Pi with docker as build machines, some light browsing and coding on VS code.
