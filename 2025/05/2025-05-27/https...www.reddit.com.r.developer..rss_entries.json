I&#39;m a newbie dev and I enjoy creating useful app which simplify my usual gameplay in game or other similar things. So I decided to create a smart autoclick with various cool option such as multi-click, click on a specific position with a visual render, stealth mode, other various things including auto keyboard and macro option. But I&#39;m wondering if this is enough to gather people and find some customer. Of course my app will be free because nobody will buy an app like this.
