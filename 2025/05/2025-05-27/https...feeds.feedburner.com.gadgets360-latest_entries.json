Once thought isolated to Java, H. erectus likely roamed the now-submerged plains of Sundaland 140,000 years ago. These ancient humans hunted turtles and large mammals and may have adopted modern hunting techniques, possibly through cultural exchange with Neanderthals or Denisovans. This discovery, detailed in studies led by archaeologist Harold Berghuis, reveals how glacial-era land bridges shaped early human evolution in Southeast Asia.",

Unveiled in a May 12 arXiv paper, this transient stood out due to its long-lasting emissions lasting over 79 days\u2014unprecedented among FEXTs. EP241021a also produced optical and radio emissions, suggesting a multi-component structure. Scientists believe the source may be a magnetar engine or a jetted tidal disruption event (TDE), although neither theory fully explains the observation. This groundbreaking discovery could transform our understanding of rare, energetic cosmic explosions",
