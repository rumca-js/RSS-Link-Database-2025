No issues with direct downloads (~55 MB/s) and with another Usenet provider (Frugal, ~30 MB/s). Is there someone who is facing a similar issue? I like <a href=\"http://newsgroup.ninja\">newsgroup.ninja</a> due to high retention days (6129, comparing to Frugal, which has only 3000+ days, and I am experiencing failed downloads, which with <a href=\"http://newsgroup.ninja\">newsgroup.ninja</a> no issues).</p> <p>I already changed DNS server on my network adapter, issue remains</p> <p>The issue with slow download speed is only with <a href=\"http://newsgroup.ninja\">newsgroup.ninja</a>, so it has nothing do with possible high congestion on my ISP or network settings on my computer.</p> <p>So my question is: Is there someone who is facing a similar issue and maybe could solve it?</p>",
