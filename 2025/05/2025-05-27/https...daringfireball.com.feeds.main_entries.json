I\u2019m sure there are talented engineers there\ntoo\u2009\u2014\u2009the OpenAI announcement refers to \u201cphysicists, scientists,\nresearchers\u201d among the team members\u2009\u2014\u2009but the fact remains that\nthis is a startup whose leader and key lieutenants appear to all\nbe designers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe the whole IO thing will come to naught. Maybe it\u2019s all hat, no cattle. Maybe it\u2019s a great idea but a long shot to play out (which is my gut feeling). But there\u2019s a weird internal-to-Apple lingo thing here. At Apple \u201cproduct designers\u201d are very much engineers. PD at Apple is a hardware engineering discipline, not the kind of \u201cdesign\u201d you\u2019re probably thinking of as \u201cdesign\u201d.",
