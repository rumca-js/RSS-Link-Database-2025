Among the options I&#39;ve considered are the 5070 and 4070 Super, which should run a bit better than the 7800XT when not VRAM-bound.</p> <p>Are any of you gaming on 40/50 series cards? How&#39;s the support compared to AMD we know and love? Last time I used Nvidia on Linux I had a GTX 760, and there were a few hiccups, some things like virgl weren&#39;t supported, etc but gaming was generally good. I do know Nvidia now offers another, open-source driver. </p> <p>Are those equivalent choices or is AMD still the way to go for graphics under Linux? If so, why?
