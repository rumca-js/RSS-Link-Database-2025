It\u2019s such a dark, bleak film, but so beautiful at the same time. The whole idea of how war just destroys innocence and the group of friends just gets completely destroyed is heartbreaking. I also love the metaphor in how they think war will be vs how it actually is. They think war will be like deer hunting (a meticulous and precise skill) but in reality, war is just like Russian roulette (a random game of chance) it\u2019s an absolutely brilliant film and De Niro is fucking fantastic in it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/These_Feed_2616\"> /u/These_Feed_2616 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kwxm7o/the_deer_hunter/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kwxm7o/the_deer_hunter/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Wonderful angles and lighting, it absolutely sold me on the movie being 5 stars. Also the opening scene in Gone Girl, very good decisions made there. Also can&#39;t post this without mentioning the aspect ratio changing during Catching Fire when Katniss enters the arena. Gives me chills still. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/uselesssociologygirl\"> /u/uselesssociologygirl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kwu5e9/do_you_have_a_favorite_shot_in_a_movie/\">[li",

Unfortunately, my unpredictable work schedule means I actually miss out on watching some good movies in theatres. My girlfriend and I have to coordinate our work schedules, and sometimes we&#39;re able to go on the third week. We both only got to see Sinners on the week of its return engagement in 70mm because IMAX agreed to it.</p> <p>Lately, IMAX has been screening a lot of new releases for only a week or two, and rereleases for maybe 1-3 days. Michael B Jordan himself complained about the small 3 day window which he couldn&#39;t attend the screening of the 4K Princess Mononoke restoration. This is occuring quite often because IMAX has been adamant about signing contracts for as many films and experiences as possible.

Maybe once or twice a year and really just to take my oldest to go see something like Minecraft. But we wanted to take the whole family to go see Lilo and Stitch. It was my youngest twins first movie. My wife bought the tickets. I grabbed the popcorn and 4 bottles of water. I asked my wife how much the tickets were and she said about 95 bucks. The popcorn and waters were 35. Maybe it was just because of the sticker shock with it being 5 tickets. I don\u2019t know. </p> <p>The theater wasn\u2019t nice. The seats weren\u2019t your typical \u201cnew\u201d reclining wider seats. It was a regal theater if that makes any difference. </p> <p>I just can\u2019t fathom going back to see a movie in the theaters. At least not with the entire family. Am I cheap?
