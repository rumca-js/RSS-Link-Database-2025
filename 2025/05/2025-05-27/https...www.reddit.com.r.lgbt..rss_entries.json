Me and my gf had sex the other day we were tipsy but not drunk and she double fingered me if you know what I mean. She has never fully gone into my butt before only ever teased so it did feel brand new to me but i climaxed really really hard. </p> <p>We use natural coconut oil as lube and the whole room smelled of coconuts by this point. </p> <p>I came so hard I just laid still afterwards for a while. </p> <p>My gf got up and went to the bathroom and I heard her washing herself for what felt like ages. That\u2019s when I thought wait why is she washing did I get my period? But no. I then realised I had poop on me. I was completely mortified and I heard her go downstairs and I went to the bathroom and cleaned myself up. </p> <p>When I went back into the bedroom she had striped the bed and put it in the washing machine. </p> <p>She was trying to save my embarrassment ",
