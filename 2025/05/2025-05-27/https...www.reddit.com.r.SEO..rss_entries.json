I ran the codes through Google rich test results prior to embedding them and none of them had issues , or if they did I fixed them prior to running site audit. </p> <p>Anyways, I am indexing them today through Google console and decided to run a site audit through semrush as well. </p> <p>I am getting a lot of structured errors and they are all either organization or local business issue with the specific error being \u201ca value for the name field is required\u201d and \u201ca value for the address field is required\u201d </p> <p>When I consult ChatGPT they are certain this is because squarespace has their own auto schema and Google is reading a second schema block that has missing required fields. ChatGPT is telling me to ignore the issue , but it is driving me up a wall. As I said I ran all of my codes through Google rich result and schema.org",

People connect with people, not businesses.</p> <p><strong>Video and social are stealing attention from traditional search</strong> - More time is being spent on social platforms consuming video content. And while AI-generated video exists, people still want to see content from real humans.</p> <p><strong>AI search is fundamentally different</strong> - Whether it&#39;s ChatGPT or Google&#39;s AI mode, people are searching differently.
