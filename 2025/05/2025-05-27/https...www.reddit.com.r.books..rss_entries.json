There&#39;s no explanation provided in the book as to why and how this has happened. She struggles with the recent death of her boyfriend Sam, and this supernatural connection becomes the core of his emotionally introspective story. The book by Dustin Thao explores how emotionally complex and messy grief can be. Throughout the book, they talk via phone calls, and her recovery isn&#39;t linear and simple, which is raw and true. It shows that grief is a personal and complicated experience that cannot be simplified or rushed. The paranormal element of being able to talk to Sam adds a surreal depth to the story. It not only acts as an interesting plot for a book but also acts as a strong metaphor for how we wish and yearn for one last conversation after losing someone we love. The conversations on the phone are often the same exchanges that we crave after losing someone.",
