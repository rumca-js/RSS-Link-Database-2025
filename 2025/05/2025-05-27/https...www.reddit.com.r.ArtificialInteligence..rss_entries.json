How often do you use large language models and how often do your friends use them. Forty two percent claimed they touch AI zero to one day a week while forty seven percent said their peers use it four to five days. Table 1 shows why the mismatch exists. Seventy one percent admit they are embarrassed to say they rely on AI even though they do. Nearly eighty percent under-report their own use.</p> <p>Pretending only helps the people who already own the servers. If workers stay silent, the skill gap widens, the pay gap follows, and the same story repeats that we saw with the early internet. The tool will not vanish.
