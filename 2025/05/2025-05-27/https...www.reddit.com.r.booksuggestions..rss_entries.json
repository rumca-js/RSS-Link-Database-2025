What I&#39;m looking for is any non-fic book about feeling like a fictional character, or related to NPC&#39;s in the way that they are essentially just BG characters.</p> <p>BG Info: I like video games, the Stanley Parable is one I&#39;m playing right now, and I&#39;m a HUGE fan of the way it kinda messes the line between &quot;video-game&quot; and &quot;real-life&quot; sometimes. So that kinda inpired me. Also, I never thought somebody took the theme of feeling like a fictional character seriously until I found out that Broom of the System (D.F. Wallace) was inspired by that theme to write it. I also see people today calling people an NPC because of just having &quot;basic&quot; or &quot;bg character&quot; aspects (going back to the video game theme?)

I&#39;m helping someone with a school project, and they are trying to look into queer representation in children&#39;s books, especially from the art perspective.</p> <p>Currently, they&#39;re trying to find some bad examples. So if you&#39;ve ever ran into a kids&#39; book with overly stereotypical, badly executed or otherwise poorly done queer characters, please drop the book&#39;s name in the comments. I know this is kind of an odd and specific request, but any help would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wild-Stand-4514\"> /u/Wild-Stand-4514 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kwqzla/childrens_books_with_bad_queer_representation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kwqzla/childrens_books_with_bad_queer_representation/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Would prefer if there\u2019s some other interesting lore apart from the romance.

What I&#39;m looking for is any non-fic book about feeling like a fictional character, or related to NPC&#39;s in the way that they are essentially just BG characters.</p> <p>BG Info: I like video games, the Stanley Parable is one I&#39;m playing right now, and I&#39;m a HUGE fan of the way it kinda messes the line between &quot;video-game&quot; and &quot;real-life&quot; sometimes. So that kinda inpired me. Also, I never thought somebody took the theme of feeling like a fictional character seriously until I found out that Broom of the System (D.F. Wallace) was inspired by that theme to write it. I also see people today calling people an NPC because of just having &quot;basic&quot; or &quot;bg character&quot; aspects (going back to the video game theme?)

It\u2019s not written to be inspirational.

It\u2019s about what it means to be a high-achieving teenager hiding in plain sight, performing strength while quietly drowning.</p> <p>The themes range from trauma, dissociation, and identity to resilience, justice, and how we begin to heal (especially when we don\u2019t even know what healing looks like yet).

Lots of enemies to lovers or forbidden relationships. However it was kinda made into a chore for me to do growing up so it\u2019s been hard for me to get back into reading. Does anyone have any book ideas like that? Preferably no smut but if it\u2019s extremely mild I don\u2019t care. And I do not want some sort of high school or college location for the story. Please give me some titles of what I may like!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zoe_Moth\"> /u/Zoe_Moth </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kw9sjn/romance_books_to_get_me_back_into_reading/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kw9sjn/romance_books_to_get_me_back_into_reading/\">[comments]</a></span>",
