For instance, BGG has a weight, but it is unclear if that is a rules complexity weight or a strategy depth/breadth weight. It would be great if BGG would expand their data, but since they don&#39;t seem to be inclined to do so, I&#39;m considering building a separate site to do so. </p> <p>People could go there and vote on data, view data, and filter games based on the data. This would be pure likert scale data - no comments, no forums, no free form text input, etc. The only exception would be size (table/box sizes). There would not be an API. I don&#39;t want to risk people to trying to scrape what meta data BGG does have.</p> <p>Some of the data I&#39;m considering are:</p> <ul> <li>minimum table size/space</li> <li>b",

My partner and I have played probably around 50 games between the two of us, and recently added the Lost Fleet expansion. For anyone familiar with the game, I highly recommend the expansion! It adds four new characters, new space tiles which slot in between and around the existing tiles, and just enough additional actions to expand each character&#39;s options outside the relatively gameplan of the base game. </p> <p>This was our first four player game ever, and in addition we had one new player with us as well.

The cards are multi-function - some are just fruits, some let you steal from other players, some give you the dog (which blocks stealing from you), and some are the sets of fruit you need to score.

Obviously there are many light games that are very fast to set up, and many deep games that are worth the setup time, but it&#39;s impressive when a game manages to have tons of crunch but only takes a few minutes to put on the table.</p> <p>Best answers I&#39;ve come up with for games with an excellent setup time to depth ratio from my collection are Arcs and Furnace. Furnace only takes about a minute to setup and is very deep and replayable, definitely if my criteria was &quot;fastest setup to most analysis paralysis&quot; this game would win. Arcs I&#39;ve also been really impressed with especially since getting Blighted Reach, that box&#39;s organizers make base Arcs about a 5 minute setup, not counting struggling to pick Leaders &amp; Lore.</p> ",
