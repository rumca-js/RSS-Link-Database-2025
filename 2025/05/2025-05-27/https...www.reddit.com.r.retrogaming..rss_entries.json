It must have been part of a game magazine&#39;s cd out of the late 90&#39;s I guess.</p> <p>In my memory it was something similar to command&amp;conquer, but you were able to build your own units by combining weapon systems and other parts like track- or wheel- or hover-technology.</p> <p>You had to do some research to enable new technologies and combine all the parts to save more blueprints.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure, if the maps looked like on-earth or some alien-ished, but I think it looked like dark gray deserts with mountains.</p> <p>Does anyone remember what this game was named like or if theres a possibility to play it in a remastered version or new game?</p> <p>I&#39;m so sorry I don&#39;t now more about this one.</p> <p>If you have any questions, please comment them down below. </p> <p>I&#39;m pretty sure we can find the game :)</p> <p>Thx in advance BR </p> </div><!--",

We are probably talking mid 90s. The consoles I remember having that it could be on are Sega and N64, also POSSIBLY Sega Dreamcast and SNES. This game was basically Mario kart before Mario kart. It was a racing game, 3 laps, but more futuristic and maybe even alien type vehicles to drive/fly. There were plenty of weapons to fire at the other racers as you went.

My brother and I inserted that cartridge and our young minds were BLOWN. We could not believe that games could be so big and look so good. And the physics, my god!</p> <p>Wall jumping (and just the general control) in Ninja Gaiden. I think Batman did it first(?) but to me it was a new concept and it was AWESOME. They recreated that magic in 2004 with the 3D reboot and once again Ryu was the best controlling character in gaming (to me). Also notable is Ninja Gaiden II for the cool weather effects that affected gameplay and the AWESOME dark level with the lightning. Hadn&#39;t seen that before. Was very impressive. EDIT: Also cutscenes!. How the hell did I forget the cutscenes? </p> <p",
