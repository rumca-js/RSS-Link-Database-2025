Fortunately <a href=\"https://www.lemonamiga.com/\">LemonAmiga</a> hosts user scores but unfortunately there is no simple way to filter the games by whether or not they are an arcade port. <a href=\"https://amiga.abime.net/games/search\">Hall of Light</a> on the other hand does let you search by whether a game has/is a conversion and whether the other platform is arcade. Unfortunately there are no user scores easily listed at HoL. If only there were an easy way to combine this information...</p> <p>Unfortunately neither database has a friendly API that could be used to unite this information but writing a short HTML parser/spider isn&#39;",
