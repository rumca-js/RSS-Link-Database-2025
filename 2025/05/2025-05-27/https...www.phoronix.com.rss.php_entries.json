        "description": "This month I have been running many Linux benchmarks of the HP ZBook Ultra G1a with the very exciting Ryzen AI MAX+ PRO 395 Strix Halo SoC featuring the powerful Radeon 8060S graphics. While there were the very promising OpenGL and Vulkan benchmarks shown so far from AMD Strix Halo on Linux -- including the very compelling performance compared to Microsoft Windows 11 -- many are interested in the ROCm compute aspects for Strix Halo. Here are some of the first benchmarks of the GPU compute performance for the Ryzen AI MAX+ PRO with the new ROCm 6.4.1 release compared to Strix Point as well as Intel Xe2 Lunar Lake on their Compute Runtime stack.",
