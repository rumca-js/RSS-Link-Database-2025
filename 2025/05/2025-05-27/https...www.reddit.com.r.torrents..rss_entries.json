I converted one of the movies to MP4, but I couldn\u2019t figure out how to make Apple TV (that\u2019s what the internet said to use) recognize it and add it so I could put it on my phone. I see other suggestions like using third party apps, but I was hoping to not have to purchase a subscription. When I look online for answers, I think that they are answering based on thinking it\u2019s a home movie or a video I took with my phone, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s about 2g if I remember correctly. Any advice? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HisBaeBee\"> /u/HisBaeBee </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1kwdncu/torrent_to_iphone/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1kwdncu/torrent_to_iphone/\">[comments]</a></span>",
