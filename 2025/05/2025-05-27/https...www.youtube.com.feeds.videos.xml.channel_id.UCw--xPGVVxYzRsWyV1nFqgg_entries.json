Netflix has officially canceled The Witcher (again?), A24 is bringing Elden Ring to the big screen with Civil War director Alex Garland, and Jurassic World: Rebirth is giving slop.\n\nMeanwhile, Game of Thrones faces controversy over on-set safety, LEGO reveals its Lord of the Rings Balrog Book Nook, and a published fantasy novel accidentally includes an AI prompt. Plus: The Summer War climbs the Goodreads charts, Guild of Tokens gets more love, and Warhammer shares a massive staff bonus.\n\n\ud83d\udcda My Books:\nNeon Ghosts: A Witch's Sin Hardcover: https://shop.wraithmarked.com/collections/standard-editions-1/products/neon-ghosts-a-witchs-sin-hardcover\nBreach of Peace: https://tinyurl.com/BoPTLT\nRebels Creed: https://tinyurl.com/RCTLTDG\n\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch & Signed Books: https://www.danielbgreene.com\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DanielBGreene\n\ud83c\udfa5 Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-EqiFg67s2Nd0imgRXg5w\n\ud83d\udcac Discord: https://discord.gg/xUzhVv4\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instag",
