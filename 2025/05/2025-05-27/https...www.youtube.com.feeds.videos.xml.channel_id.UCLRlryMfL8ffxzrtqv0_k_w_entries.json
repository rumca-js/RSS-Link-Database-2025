For the first time in the history of the series, two films tell a coherent story. \"Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1\" ended with Ethan and his team going on the hunt for the sunken Russian submarine Sevastopol. The antagonist Gabriel is also after it, as he works for the Entity - an artificial intelligence that could influence the fate of the entire world.
