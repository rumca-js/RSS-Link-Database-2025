        "description": "Toilet flange repair tips\u2026I use 1/4\u201d closet flange spacers to raise the height. Ideally the flange would sit on top of the tile floor. But it\u2019s more cost effective to use spacers with Lexel sealant. The extra long closet flange bolts are also necessary since the tabs are under the original flange. This is a strong repair that prevents leaks between the wax ring and toilet bowl since the flange is above the finished tile floor \ud83d\udd25#plumbing #bathroomremodel #homerenovation #homerepairtutor",
