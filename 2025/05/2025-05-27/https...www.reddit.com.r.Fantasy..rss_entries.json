I want a book that feels like that, where as your reading you heart is bumping out of your chest, you can visualize their every move, it feels more like you watching gods fighting in all their divine glory and legends will be based off this battle and passed from generation to generation. I want to put down the book and look back on it not as words on a page but I work of art that has gloriously decided to bless my eyes and will keep me thinking about, he at t still pumping, still thinking of it in all its glory for days on end after reading it.

Guy Gavriel Kay deserves that criticism more I think, even though I like him and his work. </p></li> <li><p>The worldbuilding works for me. It unfolds while you read, piece by piece. Nothing stops the story. Even when he\u2019s dropping lore, it slides right in.

I struggle to fall asleep generally and many of the books I normally read are too bleak to read and trigger anti-sleep thoughts (=existential dread). So I need immersive fantasy to transport me into a world of imagination before heading into the land of sleep. I used to read fantasy avidly when younger and books that I&#39;ve read that would fit this general theme would be The Hobbit and LOTR, obviously, the Inheritance series, Inkheart, The Brother&#39;s Lionheart, the Skulduggery Pleasant series, Harry Potter, and others I&#39;ve forgotten. Please help recommend me fantasy adventure books that don&#39;t include bleak existential dread triggers but are also exciting. YA or adult, either works. Much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mirkywoo\"> /u/mirkywoo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kwyipn/re",

That being said - I am looking for some recommendations for fantasy books that are amenable to audiobooks\u2026I\u2019ve found that stories with huge worlds and numerous names / many POVs are just too hard to follow because I can\u2019t see how everything is spelled, so it\u2019s hard for me to keep track while listening. When I read I love GRRM, anything John Gwynn, priory of the orange tree (roots of chaos series), and I\u2019ve recently finished mistborn. So- I can normally handle epic fantasy when physically reading\u2026but I need plot lines that are easier to follow for audiobooks.

I especially enjoy how the main team acts like they are in a completely different story, while side characters take everything much more serious.</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m struggling to really define what kind of genre that would be.

Loki vs Thor (Marvel), Wonder Woman vs Circe (DC), He-Man vs Skeletor (Masters of the Universe) Jack vs Aku (Samurai Jack) just to name a few well known examples.</p> <p>Typically, the warrior doesn&#39;t have any powers but makes up for it in cunning, magical items or weapons, luck and aid from superpowered allies. If the warrior does have powers it will be from ki/mystical martial arts that are separate from magic (see Liu Kang vs Shang Tsung from Mortal Kombat) or may have non-human ancestry.</p> <p>Anyway, I&#39;ve been wondering if it&#39;s possible to have a Heroic Sorcerer vs Evil Warrior story. Does such a thing exist in media? How does it play out?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cicada_5\"> /u/Cicada_5 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kwbkos/are_there_examples_of_heroic_sorcerer_vs_",

That&#39;s the thing I loved most about ASOIAF.</p> <p>Apparently the Dandelion Dynasty has a lot of warfare, but I also heard it reads like a history book which I&#39;m not sure is something I want hahaha. I got so many books on my &quot;want to read&quot; list on goodreads now that the list is completely useless. Pretty much everytime I see something recommended on here I add it.</p> <p>Looking forwards to hearing the recommendations!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ijusti\"> /u/Ijusti </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/",
