We are trying to build something that actually catches these issues faster and more accurately (although this is debatable because different tools catch things differently). The project was initially written in Rust, and it flopped, there were too many false positives and the speed was just 2 seconds faster than vulture, a close competitor. Now we have completely rewritten the entire codebase in Python. We have also included how we do our benchmarking, so any feedback is welcome. It can be found in the root directory titled <a href=\"http://BENCHMARK.md\">BENCHMARK.md</a></p> <h1>What Skylos Does:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Detects unreachable functions and methods</strong></li> <li><strong>Finds unused imports</strong> (even aliased ones)</li> <li><strong>Identifies unused classes</str",
