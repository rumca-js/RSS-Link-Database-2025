It\u2019s a social media app designed to make doomscrolling a little less mindless. Instead of endlessly training an algorithm with likes or follows, users just type or say what they want to see\u2014like:</p> <p>\u201cShow me easy vegan recipes I can actually cook\u201d \u201cMake me laugh with golden retriever fails\u201d \u201cShow me quick productivity tips\u201d</p> <p>The app then generates a feed instantly tailored to that prompt using AI (semantic video classification, vector search, etc.). You can also save your favorite prompts as \u201cfeeds\u201d and switch between them with one tap. The goal is to make content consumption more intentional, fun, and controllable\u2014especially when you\u2019re looking to unwind without getting sucked into random content spirals.</p> <p>Would you personally use something like this?

It checks things like: \u2022 Weak refund policy phrases \u2022 Broken SSL or slow-loading scripts \u2022 UX friction points \u2022 Trust and fraud signals</p> <p>Why I built it: I come from a fraud and customer experience background, and I saw too many good websites lose trust because of small, fixable things. I wanted a quick way to test trust like a skeptical customer would and show clear ways to improve.</p> <p>Free to try: 1 free advanced scan with full report.
