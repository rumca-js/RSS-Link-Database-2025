First use is easy to understand, but I don\u2019t get the second one. Since playing this card costs one turn, then gives you one turn to play, what\u2019s the advantage?

From what I understand they\u2019re nor similar at all. For those who&#39;ve played both, what does each game do best? What are the biggest ups and downs of each one? And ultimately which would you choose, and why? Thanks for helping me decide!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sioded\"> /u/sioded </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kdgfqt/agricola_vs_lost_ruins_of_arnak_which_should_i_get/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kdgfqt/agricola_vs_lost_ruins_of_arnak_which_should_i_get/\">[comments]</a></span>",
