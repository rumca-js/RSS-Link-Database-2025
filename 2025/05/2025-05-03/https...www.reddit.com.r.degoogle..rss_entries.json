Too many times will I get something completely different because a song or an artist share the same name.<br/> - Tidal, I&#39;m not going to use a paid service. Also I&#39;m not happy with the TOS.<br/> - Deezer, Ditto.<br/> - DAB Music Player, the best out of any of the ones I&#39;ve used, the song control UI is just a little unintuitive and I&#39;m missing the ability to search other people&#39;s playlists.<br/> If there really is no alternative with as much convenience, I&#39;m begrudgingly willing to go back to using the web version of spotify on hardened firefox.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway575792\"> /u/throwaway5757",

The problem is recently apple kneeled for the UK and disabled encryption. What are good phones that can be encrypted like icloud. I had a Huawei for 5 years 2018-2023 and the phone was great I started using a power-bank after the 4th year and the boot-loader was unlocked. What are your suggestions I hate Google but Im starting to hate Apple too since they kneeled for the UK. What are good phones to chose from and a plus for me will be if the boot-loader is unlocked.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Open_Engineering8855\"> /u/Open_Engineering8855 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1kdtpa1/what_phone_ti_get/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1kdtpa1/what_phone_ti_get/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Apps that I\u2019m asking about are:</p> <p>WhatsApp Instagram Spotify etc</p> <p>Banking: How is banking on the OS.. safety and app usability is what I\u2019m trying to know about.</p> <p>Maps: How\u2019s the maps implementation..is it any good compared to Google and Apple Maps or am I just better off carrying a physical map instead.</p> <p>Notifications: Read some stuff about delayed notifications on GOS so wondering is that still the case or has it been fixed.</p> <p>Future: Recently heard about Divest just suddenly shutting down. I know stupid question but how is the future looking for GOS?</p> <p>",
