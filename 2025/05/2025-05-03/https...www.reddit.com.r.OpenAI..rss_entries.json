Back then, we really had to rely on our knowledge and do our own research in times we needed to do so. Sure, people can still decide to not use AI at all and live their lives and work as normal, but I do wonder if your usage of AI impacted your duties well enough or you would rather go back to how it was back then.</p> <p>Tbh I like how AI tools provide something despite what type of service they are: convenience. Due to the intelligence of these programs, some people&#39;s work get easier to accomplish, and they can then focus on something more important or they prefer more that they otherwise have less time to do.</p> <p>But it does have downsides. Completely relying on AI might mean that we&#39;re not learning or exerting effort as much and just have things spoonfed to us. And honestly, having information just pres",
