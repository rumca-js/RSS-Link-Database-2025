My talk will explore how PMR can be used to meet functional safety requirements and to build embedded systems that are robust, performant, and testable.\n---\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nScott Dixon\n\nI'm a Principal Software Engineer at Amazon.com with 25 years of experience, 20 of which were spent writing C++ programs. Over my 15 years at Amazon I worked on various projects such as the launch of Amazon's video streaming service (now Prime Video), various devices including the Kindle eBook reader, and now the Prime Air delivery drone (flying robots!).
