However, almost all of the series I&#39;ve read until now have been variations of Hero&#39;s Journey. </p> <p>One of my absolute favourite movie genre is the Da Vinci Code/Indiana Jones - type of movies where there is a mystery or a quest to find some ancient artifact/city/truth etc. These movies seem to have in common that the main character is usually very competent from the start and their growth is not the focus of the movie. I love following the breadcrumbs around the world and see the mystery unfold. The problem I can see is that these movies tend to rely heavily on pre-existing mythologies and history which could be difficult to replicate, but on the other hand they already sometimes incorporate mysticism or fantastical elements.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried to look for book recommendations in this sub but couldn&#39;t find a post lookin",

It\u2019s so incredibly magical, and the environments so completely different from the real world, that it feels like live action would mostly all be cgi anyhow.
