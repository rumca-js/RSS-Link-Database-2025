Recently, I&#39;ve been trying to look for more queer folks in my school, but it&#39;s not been easy cause most of my school isn&#39;t diverse AT ALL. And so a fine day rolls around, and my friend walks in with these really cute shorts, so I look at them, and THE HEARTS ARE PRIDE FLAGS. Now, I wouldn&#39;t think anything of it, except there were colors for the trans flag too, which is how I knew they weren&#39;t just rainbow hearts. So I think on this for a couple days, and today rolls around. I finish my math test, and look down cause I thought my shoe was untied. And what do I spot? A rainbow anklet (one of those wide elastic fabric band bracelets) above her sock. Now, I have no gaydar whatsoever. So how do I ask if she&#39;s queer or just an ally?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Apart-Dragonfly8074\"> /u/Apart-",
