This ended up blocking Linux users from being able to play online. I have seen some people on ProtonDB say that they can play online using the Proton Battleye Runtime. I have tried to do this but I get kicked out after 20 seconds of playing. So here is 1 theory for me, it may be because I am using Epic Games. I got GTAV for free through Epic Games almost 5 years ago. Epic Games does allow you to add custom launch options similar to Steam. Although, I do not know if it is actually working or not. This is what I do to get into online.</p> <p>Launch GTAV through Epic Games, Epic games is running through Lutris BTW.</p> <p>Launch story mode (wait for story mode to finish loading)</p> <p>press &quot;p&quot;, then go to the online tab to host a invite only session</p> <p>load into my garage, drive car for about 20 seconds</p> <p>get kicked</p> <p>Is there anything",

The game launches fine, but I only see a black screen on my remote TV. I&#39;ve noticed that the game opens in a fullscreen while steam big picture is windowed (I had to, on full screen it&#39;s slooow), and I suspect this might be causing the issue.

So I&#39;ve decided to test it anyway. I ran Cyberpunk&#39;s built in benchmarks a few times, with the display connected to the motherboard output then the gpu output. I&#39;ve actually got marginally better performance when I connected to the motherboard output. (124 avg fps, 100 min, 150 max vs 120 avg, 100 min, 145 max). So... is this information outdated? Did pcie 4 surpass the bandwidth/latency limitations and is the slight compute advantage of offloading the DE etc to the igpu overtake? I thought I&#39;d see more of a difference and in the favor of connecting directly to the gpu, but this is not the case. I&#39;m surprised. Can you guys",

I had a very strange problem when I went to Redhat where in both KDE and Gnome, setting my refresh rate to 240hz caused the screen to flicker once in a while. Alright, so I set it to 120hz. Booted up Clair Obscur and on &quot;Epic&quot; settings, instead of my 50-60fps, I was getting 20-30. Weird.</p> <p>For giggles I installed Cosmic. I could select 240hz, but I still get a screen flickering issue, very randomly (much less frequently, but still happened). Happened in Manjaro as well after I updated to kernel 6.14, so I think it&#39;s a kernel issue. Anyway, booted up Steam and I&#39;m still stuck at 20-30fps.</p> <p>Only thing I can think of that is different is I&#39;m running Kernel 6.14.x now. I could only run 6.13.8 on Pop 22.04 because some dependencies weren&#39;t updated that I didn&#39;t want to mess with. Also, maybe, it&#39;s because I&#39;m on the btrfs file system in",
