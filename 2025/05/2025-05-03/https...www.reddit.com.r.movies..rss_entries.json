The trench itself feels claustrophobic and filthy. You can feel the pain of each soldier especially Daniel Craig who was the top performer IMO. The scene of him suffering in silence eating his wife&#39;s jam was probably my favorite part. </p> <p>It&#39;s very indie and psychological. Even inside of the trench it feels like at any moment they could simply get overrun. The soldiers hear awful things happening outside of the wire and it&#39;s like nails on a chalkboard.</p> <p>I like that they chose to go with the ugly, non-cliche, unattractive ending. There&#39;s nothing glorious here, just death. The writing is brutally honest and doesn&#39;t hold back. </p> <p>I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in war films.
