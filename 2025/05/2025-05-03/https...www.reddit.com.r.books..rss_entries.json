Usually, it is something minor like an incorrect name or noun in the audio that can be worked out with context clues. But in chapter 38 of Oathbringer (&#39;Broken People&#39;) there is an entire line of text that is not only different, but directly contradictory to what is read by Michael Kramer in the audiobook, and is actually minorly relevant to the story. It is starting to get annoying. </p> <p>I like Sanderson&#39;s books, but it drives me crazy that content altering mistakes like this occur. Do",

Many critics regard him as without peer as a short story writer, and consider these to be his defining legacy and a key influence on the development of the modern short story. I personally enjoyed his comic stories, but not so much the others - but before I get to that, I&#39;ll give a short overview for those unfamiliar with Chekhov. </p> <p>Many of his stories are very short and yet powerful, while others are the length of novellas. They can be quite demanding on the reader, because in many instances not much interesting seems to happen. But that&#39;s because Chekhov focuses on character sketches, or on conveying wisdom about human emotions and relationships, or simply depicting the harsh conditions of his time. Quite a number of his stories are tragic and pessimistic, capturing the gloom and miserable poverty of late 19th century Russia, as well as t",
