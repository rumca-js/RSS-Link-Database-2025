Out of habit, I immediately scrolled to the \u201cGame file size\u201d section on each page to see how much storage each game will require. Some Switch 2 game file sizes are bigger than I expected, closer in size to Windows PC counterparts than original Switch ports were.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This makes sense given that Nintendo\u2019s upcoming console is powerful enough to run games at 1080p and beyond at fast frame rates. And yet, it\u2019",

(That\u2019s a good thing, in my opinion.) Some of them are broader strokes, like the kinds of storytelling beats that made the Avengers so appealing: It\u2019s a team-up tale about heroes with different styles and interests coming together, learning to get along, and fighting together in a worthy shared cause. Some are more specific, like the fact that the Thunderbolts gang literally winds up fighting in the husk of Tony Stark\u2019s penthouse in Avengers tower.&nbsp;<",
