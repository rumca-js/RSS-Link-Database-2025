Even if it wasn&#39;t necessary, I&#39;ve decided to go hard-core with the cooling fan by mounting an Argon THRML 60mm Cooler, mainly because I liked the aesthetic. Now, everything&#39;s working fine, but the fan only spins during the boot, roughly for 10 seconds, then it stops. </p> <p>I monitored the temperature and, even with the fan off, it&#39;s always stable at 30\u00b0C-40\u00b0C. I was wondering if this is should considered as normal behavior - meaning that the cooling fan should start spinning only if the CPU temperature reaches a certain temperature level - or if there&#39;s something bugged with my cooler.</p> <p>Thanks to everyone who can help me sorting this out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kintaro__oe\"> /u/kintaro__oe </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1kdt78k/fan_not_spinning_argon",

In my home lab I am currently running pfsense on a bare metal machine. I also created a docker swarm with a mini pc I bought by accident on Amazon and another dell pc hosting Proxmox. I am running several containers in the swarm such as authentik, nginx, etc. I still do not have a NAS but I am looking into purchasing some equipment so I can either build one or just buy it through Amazon. I am kind of in a what to do state since everything is pretty much up and running efficiently. I remembered I bought the Pi for ddns but i changed my mind about it. I did see a cool video of making it a portable wifi router that can link to my home network via vpn tunnel. But I just wanted to see if any of you had any other better ideas. I am taking ALL CONSIDERATIONS. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ITWIZNALA\"> /u/ITWIZNALA </a> <br/> <spa",

I have a raspberry pi model B+ 512 (2014) and I&#39;m looking to install Docker on it. I ran into several errors, and was initially able to fix them until I ran into one that seemed to be caused by an incompatibility in the version and my Pi&#39;s architecture (which if I&#39;m not mistaken is arm v6?). I ended up trying to install a newer pi OS just for giggles and that didn&#39;t work, so I went back to the pi 1 32 bit bookworm.</p> <p>Can someone please help me to install Docker on this old (but free) raspberry pi?
