It checks things like:</p> <pre><code>\u2022 Weak refund policy phrases \u2022 Broken SSL or slow-loading scripts \u2022 UX friction points \u2022 Trust and fraud signals </code></pre> <p>Why I built it: I come from a fraud and customer experience background, and I saw too many good websites lose trust because of small, fixable things. I wanted a quick way to test trust like a skeptical customer would and show clear ways to improve.</p> <p>Free to try: 1 free advanced scan with full report. Here\u2019s the link to check it out: <a href=\"https://scancx.com\">https://scancx.com</a></p> <p>Would love feedback.
