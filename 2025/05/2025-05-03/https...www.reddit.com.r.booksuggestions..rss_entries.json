A few that have stuck with me are the ends of Life Of Pi, Im Thinking of Ending Things, and Murder On The Orient Express. I was curious, as I know endings have a big impact on the reader themselves. Another one I forgot to mention has not been published yet, but its on book sprouts called &#39;Cage Bird&#39; or Caged Bird, I forget. My mom recommended it to me as she always surfs those ARC catalogs, and after reading it it really did change my life. I hope to see more work from the author, Michael Verren, and the other authors of the books I have listed- including Kazuo Ishigoro for Never Let Me Go.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AnimalsBetterThanUs\"> /u/AnimalsBetterThanUs </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ke2di5/what_is_a_book_thats_ending_resonated_with_you/\">[link]</a></span> &#3",

If anyone could recommend me romance books wether it is fictional it is fine. However if possible I would really like it if there aren\u2019t many misunderstandings (like stupid misunderstandings that could easily be solved), no cheating, and no stupid female or male lead I don\u2019t want the female lead to always depend on the male lead like for her to have some character if you know what I mean, also if possible for it to be fun, i am fine with wtv trope, just PLEASE NO SAD ENDING THAT WILL MAKE ME CRY!!! Some books that I really enjoyed were the love hypothesis and the wattpad story I sold myself to the devil for vinyl pitiful I know (love this story I always read it at least once a year for 8 years now).

I typically write Horror with Religious, Comedic, or Gothic themes to them or Dramadies about filmmaking and dysfunctional families.
