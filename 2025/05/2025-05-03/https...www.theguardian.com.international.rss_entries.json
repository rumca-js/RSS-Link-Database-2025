There was precious little rotation from the manager before Wednesday night\u2019s Champions League, semi-final second leg away against Paris Saint-Germain, the tie that cast long shadows here. Arteta wanted to keep his starters in the groove, to generate momentum for the Parc des Princes with a win. So much for the theory.</p><p>Arteta rested Jurrien Timber, who had picked up a minor knock in the 1-0 first-leg defeat against PSG but that apart, he went with pretty much his strongest available line-up. It was certainly a contrast to the approach of his PSG counterpart, Luis Enrique, who made 10 changes for his team\u2019s Ligue 1 game at Strasbourg. PSG, who have already sewn up the title, lost 2-1.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/03/arsenal-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",
