        "description": "NASA has delayed its TRACERS mission to no earlier than 2025 to provide additional preparation time for the crew. The mission will send twin satellites to explore how solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetosphere, particularly through a process called magnetic reconnection. These high-speed solar particles can trigger auroras and impact satellites, astronauts, and communications. Managed by the University of Iowa and launching on a SpaceX Falcon 9, TRACERS is a key effort to understand and forecast space weather effects on Earth.",

They assembled hardware for upcoming solar arrays and relocated an antenna used by Cygnus cargo ships. The EVA sets the stage for a 30% power boost to the station. While some tasks were postponed due to time constraints, most objectives were completed successfully. The milestone highlights continued progress in ISS upgrades and the growing role of women in space exploration.",

Shaped by cosmic radiation, the cloud offers insight into the raw materials behind star and planet formation. Scientists believe more hidden clouds like Eos await discovery.",

However, palaeontologists strongly dispute the claim, citing the lack of dinosaur DNA and preserved skin tissue. Experts argue that without authentic samples, the collagen is too generic to replicate actual T. rex skin, rendering the concept more fantasy branding than scientific innovation.",
