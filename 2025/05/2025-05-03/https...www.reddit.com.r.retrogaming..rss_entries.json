It&#39;s the first Game Gear game that I&#39;ve awarded a perfect 50/50 score. Ristar was close with 48 and Shinobi 1 and Tails Adventure got 44, for context.

Maybe more subjective, but modern games seem to lack the soul and originality of retro games. They&#39;ve just become increasingly bland and uninspired imo. I also understand the PS5, PS4, Switch, and XBONE are a long way from being considered &quot;retro&quot; but even excluding the last two console gens, most of the games I play now are 6th gen or older anyways.

I was using a modded snes mini for several years, but for some reason it powers off randomly a lot (no idea why) so I&#39;m ready to move on.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something I can run through my tv, plug a usb controller into and that has a decent library of games (nes and snes in particular). I&#39;m not super computer savvy, so I&#39;m trying to stay away from ones that require me to involve a laptop. I&#39;d probably just get another modded mini, but they&#39;re pretty old now and I&#39;m worried it will break like my last one. </p> <p>Any advice? I greatly appreciate it. Also, I&#39;m new to this sub, so if this is one of those posts that everyone is sick of or if I&#39;m breaking rules, let me know and I&#39;ll delete.
