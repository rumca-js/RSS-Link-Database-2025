I use airlink for everything as I don&#39;t have space near my PC to take a cable, although I do own one, so I have to go downstairs. I don&#39;t have a set budget, but I also don&#39;t want to be saving for years on end to get a good setup. <strong>I also have a steam deck, so maybe a PCVR wired headset would work by streaming to my steam deck which is connected to the headset, but idk if that would work.</strong> If not, what should I look into for a airlink-style headset (Pico 4U?) that has better visual quality for a decent price.</p> <p>TLDR Questions:</p> <p>Looking at a replacement to my quest 2 with better visual fidelity, I only use PCVR with the quest so standalone isn&#39;t needed, but I need an airlink-style system.</p> <ul> <",

They both appear quite great but none of those is ofcourse flawless. Some says go for the Pimax as it offers greater resolution and some others though say it has a 2 drivers layer (or something similar to that) which in turn will make it perform worse than the Index. Some others say the index is future proof as it&#39;s natively supported by SteamVR which is i guess something i cannot underestimate as i like to play with an overlay (during ED mining sessions i watch netflix), ",
