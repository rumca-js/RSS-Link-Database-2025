He calculated this in the following way: He says that before 713 BC, the calendars of the world were 360 days long. So instead of dividing the 1,872,000 days of the Count by 365, you have to recalculate. So I did the calculation myself:</p> <p>3114 BC minus 713 BC = 2401 years.<br/> 2401 years divided by 360 = 864,360 days.<br/> So first subtract the 360-day count from the Mayan Long Count: 1,872,000 minus 864,360 = 1,007,640.<br/> Now translate that into years post 713 BC: 1,007,640 divided by 365 gives us 2760.66 years.<br/> Now subtract 713 to get the year at the end of the Count: 2760.66 minus 713 = 2047.66.<br/> As the calendar probably started at year 1 rather than year 0, we take off another year and get 2046.</p> <p>So the math checks out.
