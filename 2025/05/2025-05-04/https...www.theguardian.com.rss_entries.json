Inspired by animal breeding, Galton encouraged people with \u201cdesirable\u201d traits to procreate while discouraging or preventing those with \u201cundesirable\u201d traits from doing the same. As social and intellectual qualities were hereditarily \u201cfixed\u201d, he thought some groups were naturally superior. Galton constructed a racial hierarchy, with white Europeans at the top.</p><p>Eugenics has since played out in varying, always tragic ways. Attempted genocides and forced sterilization are first to mind, though the 20th century brought about the concept of soft eugenics: non-coercive methods of reducing certain conditions through individual choice and medical advice.
