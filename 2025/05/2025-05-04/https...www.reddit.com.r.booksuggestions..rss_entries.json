Nevertheless I think About the story very often. So now I am looking for similar romance recommendations: I liked the trope that he had a disability/ accident and he was still suffering from that. The FMC is helping him and they fall in love. He is kind of a beta male and needs her to feel better or to heal. Do you have any rec for me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BoysenberrySimple729\"> /u/BoysenberrySimple729 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ketqnz/book_recommendations_with_healing_beta_mmc/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ketqnz/book_recommendations_with_healing_beta_mmc/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I just finished Most Ardently by Gabe Cole Novoa and it was kind of close, I just like big gay romances and I prefer them to be adults or in college. I liked that the main guys in house in the cerulean sea had kids and I liked that it was kind of super casual and like you were peeking into everyday life instead of a super action-packed book. I&#39;ve seen other gay romances I&#39;m interested in, but theres always like an apocolypse happening or someone needs to come out to their family or someones headed to college and leaving their life behind, those are either too close to real life or just too stressful. </p> <p>TLDR: I need a gay cozy book, preferably about adults, that doesn&#39;t have much action, similar to the House on the Cerulean Sea by TJ Klune</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

This came three months after my mom unexpectedly passed.</p> <p>Please suggest a book to soothe my soul. Something like House in the Cerulean Sea or another fiction that makes me feel like I\u2019m getting a giant hug at the end. Any genre of fiction is fine and I\u2019ve read all of TJ Klune\u2019s books so definitely need another author. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Roscoe340\"> /u/Roscoe340 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kejfbd/desperately_need_a_feel_good_fiction/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kejfbd/desperately_need_a_feel_good_fiction/\">[comments]</a></span>",
