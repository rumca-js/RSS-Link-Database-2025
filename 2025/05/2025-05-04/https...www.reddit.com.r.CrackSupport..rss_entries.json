Moving the game from an HDD to an SSD removes a lot of the stuttering but it&#39;s still there and yes I tried all the stutterfix mods, they don&#39;t help, my legit copy of red dead online runs smoother on my HDD than the cracked story mode does on SSD.</p> <p>I have the Razor1911 crack on the latest 1491.50 build, I even tried going back to an old 2020 build but it still stutters.</p> <p>If anyone can test it, is it a problem with the cracked version or does the legit story mode also run worse? As it stands the cracked story mode is unplayable on HDD and barely tolerable on SSD, but RDO runs like a dream on HDD, all on same settings, I tried everything from going back to ancient GPU drivers from when the game first came out to experimenting with different settings but it doesn&#39;t matter it stutters even when everything is on low.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fina",

All the other games for the Abandonware list have doesn&#39;t have that problem just this one. I tried many things like creating save file (which I didn&#39;t have that for some reason) in the (local c/username/&quot;my username&quot; /documents) and then I created it there but didn&#39;t work. I did open it as an admin. I tried to change in properties in compatibility section as Windows 7. Everytime I tried to save manually the game always said: &quot;Save unsuccessful&quot;.",
