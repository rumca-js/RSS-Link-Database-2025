You send one API request, and it routes it to the right backend (Ollama, local HF Transformers, OpenAI, Anthropic).

I have a question about tailscaile and docker, I am not sure I quite understand it yet.</p> <p>What I want to do: I have a VPS on the Internet running a reverse proxy and services with docker - currently not connected to my tailnet in any way. Additionally I have two raspberry pis in two locations connected to my tailnet. They use Prometheus to gather some metrics. If I am connected to my tailnet, I can access these metrics just fine. </p> <p>I now want to add these Prometheus nodes to a grafana view running on my VPS, so that I can take a look at them, without the need to connect the end user device to the tailnet. How would I go about that, without connecting the VPS as a whole to my tailnet? </p> <p>When reading the docu about tailscaile &amp; docker it is usually about hosting a service inside my tailnet. But I want to give my running docker service (grafana) access to nodes from my tailnet, while also being connected to the proxy network",

I already posted in the truenas subreddit to ask how rational this setup would be. I already have proxmox installed and the internal display removed (it was broken). I was planning to setup ha os and truenas via proxmox, but right now I am really unsure about the data safety of truenas via USB. I was planning to use a 2 bay USB Sata hub with software mirroring. TrueNAS needs ZFS for maximum advantages, which is not workign well via usb, also hardware raid is off the table. Would having 2 drives for redundancy still make sense with software mirroring? Would a debian with smb be better for my usecase? How safe would either solution be and how good is health monitoring for both?

Yesterday there was an update to the Termius app. After updating however i&#39;m getting just a blank blue screen. Nothing seems to be loading. This was over apt. Last time I had issues support gave me a folder to chmod and it all worked fine after that, even if I had to run that same chmod after every update. This time that didn&#39;t work. I uninstalled multiple times trying to reinstall over cli, downloading the deb, and snapd (both by cli and store), as well as the flatpack in app center. None are loading. Does anyone have any suggestions? I can&#39;t run any of my scripts to test a few updates as I have them all saved in my vault. TIA</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/J",
