Replugging PoE only leads to the red Power LED blinking 3 times with a longer pause inbetween and some nice coil whine. </p> <p>On USB Power, the 3b+ still boots and operates normally (or at least as normal as I can judge)! And as mentioned, PoE did work before, then just... didn&#39;t.</p> <p>Today I was finally able to confirm that it is most likely not the PoE HAT itself at fault: Not on",
