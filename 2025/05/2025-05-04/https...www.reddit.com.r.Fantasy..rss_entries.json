The father even goes blind after making it.</li> <li>The son and his brothers swear revenge on the king after their family is ruined.</li> <li>There&#39;s a several year long adventure where the brothers are all separated.</li> <li>I think there was one reveal where <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">a dangerous mercenary leader reveals he&#39;s actually one of the original brothers.</span></li> <",

I was fortunate enough to receive an early review copy of Lies Weeping, and I\u2019m thrilled to share my thoughts.</p> <p>As someone who hasn\u2019t read The Black Company before, this was a gritty and thought-provoking piece that lit a burning desire in me to read the entire series. For those who don\u2019t know, Lies Weeping is the first of four new books launching a fresh arc in the series, centered on Arkana and Shukrat as they take up the task of recording the Annals.</p> <p>You want unique and compelling characters with consistent voices? Check. What about cosmic entities and a voyage through reality and cause? Check. Maybe you crave a story that makes you feel the weight of gods and eternity, told with the signature no-BS voice of the father of Grimdark? Check.</p> <p>This story has it all, and was a thoroughly go",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I quite liked this. It had some weird pacing things, especially where the romance was concerned, but the banter and plot i think made up for it. And it&#39;s a standalone, I feel like they usually have weird pacing since they have to get so much done in such a small ammount of time (compared to 2+ books) so I really didn&#39;t mind it feeling a bit off at times. Anyway, good banter, dragons, LGBT romance, politics, it was a lot of fun. I also liked the relationship between the dragons and humans, it was a lot different than found in most books. Also, I really loved that the FMC was 32, not some 18 year old who happens to fight as good as veterans 3 times her age lol. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SnooEpiphanies2846\"> /u/SnooEpiphanies2846 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ke8vk5/the_sky_on_fire_by_jenn_lyon/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.",

I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations that fit some of this criteria. I really enjoy stories that have:<br/> - Deep character development (overcoming/struggling with internal conflicts)<br/> - Some kind of fantasy/medieval setting or Post-apocalypse (Just, anytime where surviving in the wild is more difficult).<br/> - Worldbuilding: gods, religions, conflicts, wars, cities, different cultures (all that jazz)<br/> - Romance (hetero) but not too spicy. Like, characters fall in love, kiss, but it doesn&#39;t go into graphic detail about what happens during sex scenes, if there are any... I&#39;m not a fan of erotica.<br/> - Dragons, monsters, fantasy creatures (good, bad, neutral or part of nature. It doesn&#39;t matter).<br/> - Companions (friends, family, lovers, party members) - I&#39;m also partial to the &quot;decides to travel and protect the ",
