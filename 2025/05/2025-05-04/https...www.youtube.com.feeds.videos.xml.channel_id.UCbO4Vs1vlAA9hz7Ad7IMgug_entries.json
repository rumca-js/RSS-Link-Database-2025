        "description": "Welcome back to Inside Tabletop. In this series I talk to people that live and work in Gaming, getting them to share their insights on the business of game entertainment. \n\nLike clockwork we see editions of Games Workshop's mainstream games come and go on a ticking 36 month release schedule. As sure as the sun will come up, that means a new Edition of Warhammer 40,000 next summer (already?). How does this affect things in the market and is it good for customers? I'm joined by Chris from Lords of War to tackle this trend and what it means for tabletop.\n\nIf you're a Patron; this episode is also available as an exclusive audio Podcast today as well that you'll have already heard three days early!\n\nGMG is publicly supported.
