However, the film wasn&#39;t made due to several reasons. 1 was that Microsoft had very strict terms, demanding $10 million against 15 percent of gross. 20th Century Fox &amp; Universal both decided to partner on the film. However after awhile, 20th Century Fox threaten to pull, &amp; Universal demanded Jackson to reduced his first dollar revenue deal, which he refused, thus, Halo was cancelled. Another was that the production was plagued with problems with pre-production being re-started multiple times.</p> <p>I kinda wish the film got made, but one thing that came out of this was that Peter Jackson decided to help Blomkamp make District 9, which I enjoyed. However, I do think if the film did get made, if probably would ",

Warfare is not a movie, it\u2019s an experience. I have never in my life felt that overwhelmed and stressed by a movie. The sound design is unforgiving and overwhelming and loud. The movie barely has a story (compared to something like saving private Ryan or lone survivor), but it doesn\u2019t need one. The point of the movie is not to tell you a riveting story about a squad that gets pinned down and makes a miraculous effort to escape. The point of this movie is to drag you to the deep end and try and drown you. With a run time of 1hr 35 minutes, it feels like it\u2019s about 40 minutes long. You get so sucked in and feel like you are there. The movie is insanely fast paced. I love war movies, and this one might take the cake for the most intense and overwhelming war movie I\u2019ve seen. </p> <p>I can see and appreciate where people come from if they say they don\u2019t like it.
