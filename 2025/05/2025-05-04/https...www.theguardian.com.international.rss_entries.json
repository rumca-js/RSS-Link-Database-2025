These sides swung and comprehensively missed at each other for much of the 97 minutes played. This was no clash for the purist.</p><p>Celtic may be the happier when dust settles. They avoided three successive league defeats to their oldest foes \u2013 a feat Rangers last achieved in 1996-97 \u2013 and recovered from a goal behind. Celtic were the better team in the second period but Rangers always carried a counterattacking threat. Hamza Igamane and Nicolas Raskin should have done better when afforded late chances to win this for the hosts. Ferguson and his staff also appealed wildly but in vain for a penalty, nine minutes from time.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/04/rangers-celtic-scottish-premiership-m",
