        "description": "Spring is nearly here - and that means it's almost spray primer season in my neck of the woods. And what do I spray outside with rattlecans? TERRAIN. I've got a lot of terrain projects lined up for spray prime time so I'll talk about that and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game!
