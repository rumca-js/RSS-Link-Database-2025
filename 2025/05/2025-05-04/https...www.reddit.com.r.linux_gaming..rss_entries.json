I tried to follow the installation process but while the sudo make dkms-install seems to run in terminal; even sign MOK keys, it doesn&#39;t create the msi-ec folder in<code>/sys/devices/platform/msi-ec/</code></p> <p>I am on Stealth17 A13VH and performances aren&#39;t a problem but heating is currently. The CPU fans don&#39;t seem to work or only slowly. CPU reaches 90~95c during gaming with an external cooling pad on max power.</p> <p>I switched to Linux after my Windows 11 install got pwned by a virus, I formatted everything but I would rather not disable secure boot just to be safer.

The play button goes from running to stopping to play again. That&#39;s it. The game itself doesn&#39;t being up a process at all.

Also planning to stick with Linux (currently have an old Dell Optiplex with A. nVidia 1030 GT playing older games from my steam backlog, so far it is OK). Now my problem is. Should I risk it and go with nVidia, for the DLSS? Or ease my life with an AMD GPU, but have a less polished upscale technology? Or go with an AMD GPU since it is better on the raw performance side, and play in native resolution completely ignoring FSR? At the moment my resolution would be 1080p, but also planning to go 1440p. Since I don&#39;t have enough desk space for a monitor bigger than 32&quot;, and actually planned only a 27&quot;, 4k is not a big deal for me at the moment. Should I bother myself because of the DLSS/FSR, or just skip it and go native? Planning to play Cyberpunk, Witcher 3, Oblivion Remaster and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. And some CoD or BF (strictly the campaigns no multi-player), for fun. What would you suggest and why? Curr",

I do play in 1440p so opting for a 4060 is a no-no a priori. My hassle is understanding if the b580 is actually worth buying on Linux 6.14 (Using Nixos with bpfland + cachy kernel) and Mesa 25. I used to own a 6650xt which was giving me pretty good performances, even in RT, but afaik the b580 is better than the 4060 in everything. I would also point out that the b580 drivers are not mature at all but is also have ai upscaling, and given that this is temporary GPU I will change in 1 year or more having a good compromise woulnd&#39;t be too bad.

Im ready to try something new, preferably something stable, quick, and easy to use (no arch, tried cachy, not a fan.)</p> <p>I game pretty often, both Steam and various games of EPIC, GOG, and <a href=\"http://twitch.io\">twitch.io</a> but the newest game i have is at least a year old. I video record and edit. I have an Nvidia GPU.</p> <p>Any of these a problem with Pop_OS? Is there a better OS to use?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Open-Egg1732\"> /u/Open-Egg1732 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ke9f0o/is_pop_os_a_good_replacement_for_bazzite/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ke9f0o/is_pop_os_a_good_replacement_for_bazzite/\">[comments]</a></s",
