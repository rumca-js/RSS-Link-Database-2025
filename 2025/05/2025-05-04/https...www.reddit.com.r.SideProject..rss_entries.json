We\u2019re honestly still processing how wild that is. Our Discord is getting more active too, we gained 1500 also in less than 2 days with people giving feedback, investors n VCs begging to get in, testing early builds, and just hyping each other up.</p> <p>We\u2019re still building 24/7 to get this thing polished before launch, but seeing this kind of response made us feel like we\u2019re definitely onto something.</p> <p>AMA.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Old_Assumption2188\"> /u/Old_Assumption",

Because, as far as I know, no one has posted about this site on Reddit yet... Using this site, we can stream only audio from YouTube without video. This is especially useful for those who often listen to songs on YouTube. When streaming only audio without video, the FUP data balance is also saved to a large extent. Even if the internet speed drops to 64Kbps because the FUP data balance on your mobile is completely exhausted, there is no problem. This is because most of the songs available on YouTube come with low bitrates like 48kbps, 56kbps. Almost, they can be streamed easily with a 64kbps connection without any buffering problem (Just we need to make sure that no apps are using the data connection in the background).

It works through automation and messages, and gives you monthly insights that actually make sense.</p> <p>We just opened up a 30-day free trial (no card required) and I\u2019d really appreciate feedback \u2014 on the concept, the flow, or anything that feels off.</p> <p>Site: <a href=\"https://www.nobooks.co\">https://www.nobooks.co</a> Happy to share more or trade thoughts with anyone building in the space!</p> <p>P.S. Right now the product is available in USA only but we plan to make it available around the world!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jalx98\"> ",
