She\u2019s been missing for 28-29 hours at this point, and he still won\u2019t call the cops, or her friends, or her family\u2026 nothing. </p> <p>I\u2019m unsure of what to do. I obviously don\u2019t know who these people are or where they live. </p> <p>If anyone can help me figure out how to get in touch with the girlfriend\u2019s family, or file a report, or\u2026 SOMETHING. I would greatly appreciate it</p> <p>The longer a person is missing the more likely they are to be dead, and I\u2019m not willing to just let this go\u2026 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AlienSheep23\"> /u/AlienSheep23 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/",
