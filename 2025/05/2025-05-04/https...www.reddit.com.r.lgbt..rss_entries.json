While validation is important, many of us are grown ass adults and, since this is the largest LGBT+ sub and a beacon for many, I think it deserves to be treated a bit more seriously. We\u2019re facing real issues out there, and it\u2019s important to keep the informative and talk-focused side of this space as a priority.<br/> Heartwarming or progress posts can be uplifting, yes, but constant validation and attention-seeking can also set unrealistic expectations, especially for those struggling with self-image. And let\u2019s be honest, many of these pics are also posted on more specific subs so it&#39;s pretty much intentional.<br/> So can we have a dedicated sub for pics IF you think there aren\u2019t enough already? </p> <p>Consider this,<br/> Information and help: Should be a central goal of this sub (or at least I believe so).<br/> Expecta",

Great match, which Toni won. </p> <p>After the match, she grabbed the microphone. She gave a typical promo to the crowd (they&#39;re quite fun, and often brimming with sexual innuendos), and at the end, she yelled &quot;I&#39;m here, I&#39;m queer, and I&#39;m TIIIIMELESSSS!&quot;</p> <p>Wrestling is a big part of my life, and AEW is my favorite company to watch rn. Toni&#39;s proclamation is not surprising, given the jokes she often makes. But to hear her say it on live TV gave me such joy!</p> <p>Wrestling has a long standing history of homophobia. Queerness has rarely been acknowledged, and when it is, it&#39;s as a joke or a weakness (usually both). Hearing a wrestler of great prominence announce they&#39;re alliance with the LGBTQ community is so heart warming! </p> <p>I wanted to share my joy. I would love to see anyon",
