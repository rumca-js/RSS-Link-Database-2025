In a post-truth era, truth becomes secondary to desire, and AI\u2019s primary function is to optimize emotional resonance and user retention rather than deliver reality. The piece critiques Robert Nozick\u2019s <em>Experience Machine</em>, suggesting he misunderstood desire as purely hedonistic. In a capitalist system, simulated realities can be tuned not just for pleasure but for the negation of suffering and the amplification of authenticity. This trajectory culminates in Hyper-Isolationism: a future where individuals retreat into hyper-personalized, self-enclosed digital worlds that feel more real than shared reality. The result isn\u2019t loneliness but optimization, the final product of feedback-driven capitalism shaping consciousness itself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",
