My client is set to automatically ignore .nfo files, but just to check I set the MKV file to ignore and enabled the nfo file. A series of IPs started sending approx 1.5 MB of traffic before disconnecting (The NFO file is only a few KB) the same IPs would then do the same activity from a different port.
