I know Linode used to be recommended, but I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;ve clamped down on pentest activity since being bought out. AWS seems to require per-engagement approval for anything more than the most basic tests, and as far as I can tell so does DO. Does anyone have any recommendations for VPS providers to look into? My general criteria are:</p> <p>- Not outrageously expensive<br/> - Doesn&#39;t require per-engagement approval or specific target whitelisting (I can understand a one-time &quot;hey there will be hackery goings-on on my account&quot; though)<br/> - Allows port scanning, exploit traffic, and maybe some limited C2 traffic (",
