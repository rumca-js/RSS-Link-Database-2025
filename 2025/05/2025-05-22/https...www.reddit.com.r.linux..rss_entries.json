What stood out was the use of a <strong>fake Realtek driver update</strong> to trick users into installing malware. The malware also includes anti-VM detection and other updates compared to previous campaigns.</p> <p>It starts with pretty basic social engineering but gets sophisticated quickly \u2014 once installed, it can grab saved passwords, browser data, and more. It\u2019s targeting macOS specifically, which is still a bit unusual compared to most malware campaigns.</p> <p>Has anyone else seen this?

This research pioneers the use of deep learning techniques to predict the sequence of tasks selected by CFS, aiming to evaluate the feasibility of a more generalized and potentially more adaptive task scheduler for diverse workloads. Our core contributions are twofold: first, the systematic generation and curation of a novel scheduling dataset from a running Linux kernel, capturing real-world CFS behavior; and second, the development, training, and evaluation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network designed to accurately forecast the next t",
