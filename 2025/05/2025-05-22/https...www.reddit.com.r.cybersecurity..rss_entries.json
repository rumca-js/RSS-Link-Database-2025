To keep a long story short, I have the question of is it possible for a cyber criminal to impersonate someone\u2019s work phone number, cell phone number, and work email and contact another individual pretending to be that person. For example: could someone get ahold of my official email without me knowing and proceed to answer any emails I receive posing as me, without altering the email itself or without having to change anything? If so, how does one combat this to make sure the person they are talking to on the phone/ and or email is the person they actually believe they are talking to. Thank you! I\u2019m new to this online world. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Honest-Simple-4504\"> /u/Honest-Simple-4504 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1kt4mts/cyber_phishing_impersonation/\">[link]</a></span> &#3",

The interview is supposed to last about 10 minutes, and according to the contact, it&#39;ll cover logistical aspects of the job and include some technical questions to test my knowledge. They also mentioned that I won\u2019t be allowed to use any outside sources to help answer.</p> <p>Any advice on what I should look out for or brush up on beforehand? I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll go for fundamentals and maybe ask how I&#39;d handle certain scenarios.</p> <p>Also, they mentioned they&#39;re hiring a specialist to help with their company&#39;s growth. From your experience, do companies usually make a single hire for something like this, or do they typically bring on multiple people (like a team and a lead)? Just curious what I might be walking into.</p> <p>Appreciate any insights. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
