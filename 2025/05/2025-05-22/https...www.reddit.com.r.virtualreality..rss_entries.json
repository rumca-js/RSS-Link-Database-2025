I thought nothing of it and did a hard reset but when I logged back in I wasn&#39;t able to get past the login screen of the actual quest 2. After about a day I was able to get into 1 of my three profiles but I was only able to get close to 2 minutes before it black screened. My brother was playing the night before and it was working perfectly fine. I just wanted to see if anyone else has had this problem and if so how can I fix it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dramatic_Appeal_2244\"> /u/Dramatic_Appeal_2244 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ksg1l8/quest_2_black_screening/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ksg1l8/quest_2_black_s",
