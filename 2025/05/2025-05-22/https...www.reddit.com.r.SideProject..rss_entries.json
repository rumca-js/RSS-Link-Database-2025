Think of it as a &quot;Product Hunt for devs who haven\u2019t gone mainstream yet&quot; \u2014 updated regularly based solely on GitHub activity like stars, forks, PRs, and watchers.</p> <p>The goal is to help people discover interesting, useful repos before they blow up, a place to support underdog builders, contributors, or even join in early.</p> <p>Would you find something like this useful?
