        "description": "Onimusha 2: Samurai\u2019s Destiny releases for modern hardware with a disappointingly conservative remaster, which means many of the game\u2019s aged flaws and issues have been brought over as is with not much to blunt their edges. \n\nFrom dated design decisions to a frequently frustrating camera, there is plenty about Onimusha 2: Samurai\u2019s Destiny that can easily frustrate the player, which means it isn\u2019t necessarily the easiest recommendation. It does still have its strengths, of course, from solid combat to impressive art design and more, which means there\u2019s still enjoyment enough to be had here, but most of the praise for the game does come with caveats.",

        "description": "Technical issues aside, Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon puts the AA spin on the classic formula of The Elder Scrolls, with its own twists and unique aspects. There is so much to do across the world of Avalon to learn about the dark history of King Arthur and everyone that surrounded him, and the overall narrative is surprisingly engaging for this setting. \n\nThe freedom offered in gameplay is a refreshing touch that allows you freedom to see and explore the world and fight some terrifying enemies. While technical issues plague the experience, what\u2019s underneath is an incredibly ambitious and generally well-executed transition into games for the Tainted Grail franchise, and it\u2019s an exciting vision for what this franchise and genre can be.",
