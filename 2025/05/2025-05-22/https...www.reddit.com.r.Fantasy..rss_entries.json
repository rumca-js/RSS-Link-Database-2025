I really want a painting that looks like a traditional landscape, but instead of a bird flying in the distance, it&#39;s a dragon. But not an obvious one, one that makes you double take to check if you saw it correctly. Are there any recommendations for artists that create subtle fantasy art?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Chemical-6323\"> /u/Ok-Chemical-6323 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ksx2kh/art/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ksx2kh/art/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Multi POV is also cool. I didn\u2019t like Red Rising (too much action, not enough character work) and I have read ACOTAR and Fourth Wing and am ambivalent about it.

I don\u2019t want to read Dungeon Crawler Carl please, I know it\u2019s fun but it just isn\u2019t for me. Romance is not out of the question but it\u2019s also not a requirement.
