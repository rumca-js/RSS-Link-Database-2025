I could not find much information when I had to deploy django, celery, flower to ECS with a Load balancer, connection to S3 and Cloud front with terraform, so I decided to create a series of articles explaining it. The bad thing is that its taking me way too long to explain all the modules of terraform and would really like to gather feedback from the community to check if its something that people really want or its irrelevant.
