I took my daughter grocery shopping today, and we stopped in the bathroom. On our way out, a trans woman was washing her hands in the sink next to us. I didn\u2019t pay her any mind until I heard my daughter ask if she was a boy.</p> <p>I shushed my daughter and told her that was very rude. I then apologized to the lady, assuring her that my kid is just very young and unaware of transgender people.</p> <p>She was very kind and accepted my apology, but I still feel bad. I patiently told my daughter in the car ride home that sometimes girls look like boys, and sometimes boys look like girls. I don\u2019t know if that was the right answer.</p> <p>How can I stop this from happening again? My daughter doesn\u2019t know many trans people. I have a very close transgender friend, but my daughter doesn\u2019t think of her as &quot;transgender.&quot; She just views her as &quot;one of mommy\u2019s girlfriends.&quot;</p> <p>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just figured out a few months back that I\u2019m non-binary. I have noticed that anytime I tell someone that I am they immediately say something like \u201cbut you look like a man\u201d. I explain that my appearance doesn\u2019t change anything but they never seem to understand. They insist on the idea that I\u2019m a man because of what I wear. To be clear, I don\u2019t really care what pronouns people use with me but it\u2019s when they flat out try to say that I\u2019m not nonbinary that I get pissed. Do people not understand that your appearance doesn\u2019t determine your gender identity? I\u2019m starting to feel invalidated by this and was wondering if I could get any tips or whatnot on how to deal with it.
