Colonial German doctors conducted unspeakable medical experiments on these emaciated helpless Africans decades before such atrocities were ever visited upon the Jews. Thousands of Africans were massacred. Regrettably, historians neglected to properly register the slaughter, that is, to lift it from the footnote in history that it had been relegated to until now.</p> <p>In an attempt to give the incidents their rightful recognition in the historical context of the Holocaust, Dr. Firpo W. Carr has authored a new book entitled, Germany\u0092s Black Holocaust: 1890-1945. In it, he reveals the startling hidden history of Black victims of the Holocaust. The mayhem and carnage date back to the turn of the 20th century, many years before there were ever any other unfortunate victims, Jew or Gentile, of the Holocaust.</p> <p>",

I include them in my count because when I reread I&#39;m still investing the time and energy, and giving them my full attention. Because I keep track for my own curiosity, it&#39;s rare that I would share that total with friends, but if I did, I would mention that they were predominantly new books but did include some rereads.

As the games and adventures of his youth become engulfed by a larger story, he finds that it forms a tapestry of unbelievable horror that he never could have expected.

Kept me entertained. Couldn\u2019t wait to see what happens next. </p> <p>I feel as if every book I read is a \u201cmystery book.\u201d Every book I look at is people are killed and Detective or the ex detective is going to find out who it is! WoOooOoOo. </p> <p>The ones I enjoyed were Stephen King\u2019s Doctor Sleep. A fictional book about Hank Aaron and his bodyguard. LOVED that book. Couldn\u2019t put it down\u2026..and Bull Mountain. That book was amazing to me!! </p> <p>But,I get books. I look at them\u2026I\u2019m like this looks so good. And I get so bored with them quickly.
