Something simple like either incrementing up in certain intervals to a threshold value, or decrementing down from a starting value to 0 in specific increments. Representing this with LEDs could be something like a strip of LEDs where each LED corresponds to, say, 20 minutes, and one would use something like a button to trigger a subtraction of time/turning off one of the LEDs. If it&#39;s a display-based method, then I can see this being a lot more complex, perhaps even making a simple UI.</p> <p>I have a pi 4b, it&#39;s currently running pihole but I don&#39;t have a huge need for pihole anymore.

I don&#39;t know a whole lot about how the power management system works on the pi, but here is the breakdown of my problem: I want to have one, unified usb c port that can both be used to charge the device (the usb 5v goes to the charge/supply circuit) but, I also want to wire a usb data port to it as well, to connect usb thumb drives and such, which typically requires a 5v source from the device. My 5v from my battery comes to the 5V pin. If I try and plug in a usb male into the usb data port, and break out the 5v to the usb C receptacle, will the 5v cause issues with my power circuit by feeding 5v back into the charging circuit? Is a simple diode all I need on the 5v line?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cr4zyC4tD4ddy\"> /u/Cr4zyC4tD4ddy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1kszbk5/how_do_i_s",

My intention is to add 1 more nvme to run both of them in raid1.</p> <p>My research with chatgpt so far gave me this:<br/> create a single disk raid1 array and declare disk2 missing, using<br/> <code>sudo mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/nvme0n1 missing</code></p> <p>rpi-clone sd card onto above single disk raid1<br/> when new nvme comes, plug in and sync raid.</p> <p>Just want to check with anyone with experience on this topic to confirm chatgpt wasn&#39;t hallucinating this process.
