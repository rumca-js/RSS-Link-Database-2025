        "description": "Palia\u00a0reviewed by Travis Northup on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, also available on Nintendo Switch.\n\nPalia is a fantastic multiplayer cozy life sim with strong characters to bond with, engaging activities to grind, and a nearly endless chase for more resources to build your perfect home in the world\u2019s kindest village. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that the cozy sensibilities of Animal Crossing would mix well with the online design of an MMO, but it\u2019s difficult to pull myself away from setting off fireworks with friends and helping the bumbling mayor find his misplaced sandwich, even after more than 70 hours. There\u2019s still plenty of room for Palia to grow, whether it\u2019s the surprisingly brief story we\u2019re gotten thus far, a scarcity of multiplayer-focused activities to engage with, and enough bugs and performance issues to put a not-so-cuddly fly in the otherwise soothing ointment, but it\u2019s still a great candidate for your next virtual vacation.",

        "description": "Monster Train 2 reviewed on PC by Dan Stapleton. Also available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S (on Game Pass), PC, and Nintendo Switch.\nMonster Train 2 is a fantastic upgrade for what was already one of the best deckbuilding roguelites out there. Its new Equipment cards layer on even more ways to build a team of super-powerful monsters, and its five new clans of delightfully weird characters are every bit as ripe for experimentation and unexpected results as the original cast. You can play it dozens of times and not take the same approach twice \u2013 and even if you choose the same starting options you have to adapt and think on your feet to make the most of what fate decides to give you. I can easily say right now that its endless challenge and the pleasant surprises I\u2019m still discovering within it will keep me coming back for hundreds of hours.",
