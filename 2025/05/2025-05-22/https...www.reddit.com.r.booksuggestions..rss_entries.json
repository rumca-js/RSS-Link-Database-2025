I&#39;m looking for some good mystery books, unit can be of any other genres as well!</p> <p>I really enjoyed &quot;the naturals&quot; series, the dynamic between characters, the romance, the discovery aspect in general. Very good. But hated &quot;the inheritance games&quot; from the same author, the characters had no chemistry, everything was forced, the girl could have 2 thoughs without &quot;feeling their presence and heat beside her&quot;. I felt it was such a downgrade.</p> <p>Do you have anything that I might like?

Stuff like <strong>Ex Games by Stella Rhys</strong> or <strong>Tis the Season for revenge by Morgan Elizabeth.</strong> The latter was soo cute i wanted to cry at the end, not because it was sad, but because of the realization that I might never find love like this again. Hence I want more of such tropes.</p> <p>I&#39;m fine with any setting, but not immature characters...by that I don&#39;t mean perfect, but I don&#39;t want a whiny, childish main character, ya know?

It started out with FMC in her apartment, maybe reading a book. She had a cat. She was transported back in time to the British isles to a castle. She was saved by MMC from rape during a feast or banquet at that castle and the romance developed from there. It seems she had lived present time in America. I know this isn&#39;t much to go on but I just remember I really liked that book. I do know this isn&#39;t Beyond the Highland Mist and also not the Diana Gabaldon Outlander series.

It can be stuff like after a war (like the Odyssey) or it can be much more mundane reasons for them being separated. It can feature a bunch of guys trying to get back home with him or not. Just an interesting story of man/people trying to get back home after getting separated from them.

I mentioned to my mom (her grandma) that I want to get her White Oleander, Memoirs of a Geisha, The Bell Jar and Madame Bovary for her birthday. She was adamantly against it and said \u201cwait five years\u201d.</p> <p>I read these books at a young age (11-15?) and while (at the time) I didn\u2019t entirely understand the themes discussed, I still really enjoyed them and they contributed importantly to my personal development in terms of intellect, cultural awareness, femininity, etc. Also, like my niece, I\u2019d experienced a lot of difficult things at a young age and these books made me feel less lonely. Another point is, since she lives in a foreign country, she doesn\u2019t have access to many books in her preferred language (English) so I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s had the opportunity to read much classic literature. I\u2019d love to offer these titles.</p> <p>What do you think? Too ser",
