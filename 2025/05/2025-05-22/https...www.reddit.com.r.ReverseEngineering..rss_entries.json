I just open-sourced a project I built with a friend as part of a school project: <strong>DecompAI</strong> \u2013 a conversational agent powered by LLMs that can help you reverse engineer binaries.</p> <p>It can analyze a binary, decompile functions step by step, run tools like gdb, ghidra, objdump, and even combine them with shell commands in a (privileged) Kali-based Docker container.</p> <p>You simply upload a binary through a Gradio interface, and then you can start chatting with the agent \u2013 asking it to understand what the binary does, explore vulnerabilities, or reverse specific functions. It supports both stateful and stateless command modes.</p> <p>So far, it only supports x86 Linux binaries, but the goal is to extend it with QEMU or virtualization to support other platforms. Contributions are welcome if you want to help make that happen!</p> <p>I\u2019ve tested it on several Root-Me cracking challenges and it managed to solve many of them",
