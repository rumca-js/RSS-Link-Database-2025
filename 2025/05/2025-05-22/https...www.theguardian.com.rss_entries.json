When the minister \u2013 or in this instance the England captain \u2013 said Jacob Bethell would be straight back in for the series against India, this apparently referred to the squad and not necessarily the XI.</p><p>That Stokes sought to make this clarification through the back channels perhaps said more about the task at hand than England\u2019s true thoughts on the subject. No captain would ever wish to send a player out believing whatever they achieved would be irrelevant, not least a vice-captain and team-first character such as Ollie Pope.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/22/ollie-pope-smashes-169-off-zimbabwe-t",

But who is this left-field thinker who dispatched his young goalkeepers to undergo professional boxing training, spend hours performing acrobatics on trampolines and talk intensely to sports psychologists? R\u00e9gis Le Bris eventually became Lorient\u2019s first-team manager in 2022 but, after a promising opening season, the Breton team were relegated from Ligue 1 last spring. No matter; a month on from that chat with Meslier in North Yorkshire, Sunderland named Le Bris as their head coach and, now, the 49-year-old is preparing to lead the club out at Wembley on Saturday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/22/sunderland-playoffs-regis-le-bris-young-stars-invesment\">Continue reading...</a>",

Do you have to approach your acting in a different way? </strong><em>HighPriest1967<br></em>Paul is an extraordinary director, a visionary director, and I absorbed so much by watching him work.

But it soon realised it was going to be quibbles all the way down. Leslie Crowther? Died in 1996. Kym Mazelle? Still very much with us. But Zippy? Well, Roy Skelton, who voiced him (and the Daleks) died in 2011. But is Zippy dead? Or was Zippy ever alive? What about the LSO? Presumably some of the people playing in the LSO at the time the single came out in 1990 have subsequently passed. But does that count?

There\u2019s a fun scene in the new Netflix thriller Dept Q in which her character, Dr Rachel Irving, weary of her client DCI Carl Morck, plants herself down behind her desk to eat her packed lunch in front of him. Morck may be the kind of troubled detective we\u2019re used to seeing in police dramas, but Irving isn\u2019t a typical therapist. She\u2019s blunt, antagonistic even. It\u2019s a \u201cshitty\u201d job working with police officers, she tells him. Another time she describes him as \u201cdoolally\u201d, which in my experience is not something a typical therapist would say; Macdonald, who has had therapy, \u201cbut not regularly\u201d, may agree.</p><p>In the show \u2013 adapted from novels by ",
