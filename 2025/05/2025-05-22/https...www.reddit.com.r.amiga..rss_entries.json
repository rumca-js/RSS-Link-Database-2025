After the almost immediate success from my first post, I wonder if you clever lot have an answer to this.</p> <p>So I had T2 The Arcade Game when I was a kid. It\u2019s not amazing, but was one of my favourites back then as I was becoming immersed after watching the movie for the first time. Point being, I remember it very well. </p> <p>Trying it emulated many years later, I notice that whichever ROM I use of the various options, and whichever emulator I use, it doesn\u2019t produce the correct sound. </p> <p>There is an option to play with Music and FX, or just the FX. However selecting Music and FX results in only the Music being heard. This was definitely not the case with my legitimate game and Amiga 500. Not having either nowadays I\u2019m unable to test or verify. </p> <p>So my questions I suppose are\u2026</p> <p>Could this be an issue with the Roms themselves? the emulation? I\u2019d love to play it as I remembered it. </p> <p>Thanks everyone</p>",
