I&#39;m wondering everyone&#39;s takes on AI and therapies? Not chatgpt or other ai that has been proven to be non - beneficial, but I just want to be able to talk to people about this kind of discussion of AI and therapy, or depressed and isolated people being able to talk about their problems and everyone&#39;s opinions with that. Like people unable to get therapy or don&#39;t have friends and have issues preventing them from getting friends.

By removing inference-heavy linguistic agents from the AI decision chain, and reverse-engineering meaning from absence (what we term &quot;mystery notes&quot;), we argue for the construction of a new, constraint-derived language optimized for clarity, compression, and non-hallucinatory processing. We present a roadmap for how to formalize this new substrate, its implications for AI architecture, and its potential to supersede traditional language-based reasoning.</p> <hr/> <ol> <li>Introduction Current AI systems are deeply dependent on symbolic interpolation via natural language. While powerful, this dependency introduces fragility: inference steps become context-heavy, hallucination-",

It offers control over match threshold and max results. It also doesn&#39;t provide an AI generated answer but rather a basic search or an ai ranked search. My logic was that if you&#39;re using AutoRAG through an MCP server you are already using your LLM of choice and you might prefer to let your own LLM generate the response based on the chunks rather than the Cloudflare LLM, especially since in Claude Desktop you have access to larger more powerful models than what you can run in Cloudflare.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/brass_monkey888\"> /u/brass_monkey888 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/noops888/cf-autorag-mcp\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1ksmk67/an_alternative_cloudflare_autorag_mcp_server/\">[comments]</a></span>",
