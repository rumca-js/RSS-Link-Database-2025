The whole reason I even started considering switching is cause I found a thorough guide for how to install Mint and use it for gaming. I like that the Cinnamon desktop looks similar to Windows, and that Mint in general seems very useer friendly. Since it&#39;s pretty popular I&#39;m less worried about running into a difficult problem and not finding support as to how to fix it. However I&#39;ve read that it isn&#39;t the best distro for gaming since it uses Ubuntu.</p> <p>Bazzite is newer to be. A friend recommended it as being specifically for gaming. I like that it has all tools for gaming already installed, like Steam, Lutris, Proton, etc. I also like that it is seemingly more &quot;locked&quot;",
