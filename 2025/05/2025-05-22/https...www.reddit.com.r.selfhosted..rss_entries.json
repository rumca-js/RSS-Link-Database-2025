It uses esbuild and <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html\">Node SEA</a>. It uses postject to inject your code to nodejs binary. It focuses more on compiling cli and Servers like pkg or nexe (express) than fullstack applications like electron or tauri. It has rich ESM and typescript support. It has good DX and cli UX. I made it bc i didn&#39;t like using pkg or nexe, they cause a lot of problems with esm.</p> <p>LIMITATIONS: Now it has problems compiling projects with depencides containing binaries (e.g. bcrypt, rcedit), and it compiles only for Windows but i&#39;m working on it</p> <p>If you like it, leave a \ud83c\udf1f and comment what you think about it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/B",

Since friends and family also want to have access to my library, I have made the server available via a reverse proxy and a domain. However, I don&#39;t want to get into any conflicts with copyright or similar. The jellyfin server has password protection but I don&#39;t trust it. How can I make my server as anonymous or invisible as possible from the outside? I can think of two possibilities. 1. every device that wants to connect to jellyfin establishes a VPN connection with my server. But this raises the question. How do I separate the jellyfin server so that I only share the server via the vpn tunnel and not the entire network? 2. i create a reverse proxy on a vps But the question arises whether this can really be done anonymously.</p> <p>Has anyone realized something similar and can help me with my decision?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",
