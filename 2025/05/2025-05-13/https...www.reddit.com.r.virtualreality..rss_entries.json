However, after spending a bit of money on numerous accessories to help make the experience better, I always felt like putting on the headset and using it was a pain. Mainly because it felt like it was a brick on my face despite the Bobovr strap + battery pack, not to mention making sure it didn&#39;t shift down during playing, which it still did. </p> <p>About half a year ago, I sold my Q2 + accessories and have been lurking forums and websites following development and games for other headsets. With the recent announcement of the Pimax Dream Air SE, despite their QC problems, if I were to put my mind in getting a headset now, it would probably be one of these:</p> <p>Quest 3 + accessories for wireless, ac:n + batman, and playing games/vids with VD. </p> <p>PSVR 2 + PC Adapter for higher image quality of the game and the fact",

I can&#39;t figure out what to buy. The valve index seems like a decent option but seems to be getting quite expensive for a now 6 years old headset. I really don&#39;t mind about having no wireless or standalone option which is why the quest 3 doesn&#39;t seem very appealing to me even with its low price if there&#39;s a PCVR equivalent for a similar (reasonably) price. Any advice ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gegandco\"> /u/gegandco </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kltusd/best_quest_3_equivalent_for_pcvr/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kltusd/best_quest_3_equivalent_for_pcvr/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I am so tired of this, all I want to do is play all my VR games on steam but I cant, the only thing I know could be an issue is what meta has told me, sometime they tell me what is wrong (most of the time all they say is a fix), what I have been told is it&#39;s either an outdated driver or my device switches it&#39;s GPU to a GPU which can&#39;t handle VR, but if these are the issues, I ",

I currently own an Oculus (or Meta) Rift S and have been for roughly 4-5 years at this point. It&#39;s been through its fair share, and I think it&#39;s nearing the time where I could/should replace it. I was thinking about getting the Quest 3 (or something else), but am not sure due to recent noise about Meta releasing an upcoming headset within the next year or so.</p> <p>So I just wanted to ask: would it be smart for me to pull the trigger and upgrade now, or would it be better to wait a bit more?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Excavious\"> /u/Excavious </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1klcjy8/upgrade_or_no/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1klcjy8/upgrade_or_no/\">[comm",

I use a cable cause air link didn\u2019t work great for the longest time. But it started with my quest not showing my pc on the link menu, but it wasn\u2019t an issue because I instantly load into the pc menu when I plug in my headset. I never looked into it tbh, but recently now my headset just disconnects from pc. It used to be only steam games, then it affected my oculus, and now my headset won\u2019t even load the oculus menu. I\u2019ve switched cords and usb slots and I still get the same effect of mid game crash to quest menu and I can\u2019t reconnect until I unplug and replug it a 4th time. I\u2019ve reinstalled oculus or at least I\u2019m 90% sure I uninstalled oculus, so frankly I\u2019m lost. Any help would be awesome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JustRawBread\"> /u/JustRawBread </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kla",
