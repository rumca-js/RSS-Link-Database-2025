I would need a tool that can analyze code locally (Not integrated in CI/CD). Currently I am using Kiuwan, but it looks pretty outdated and the developers are retrieving functionality from it, so I&#39;d like to change. Basically in Kiuwan I upload directly the source code and get the analysis done like that, which is specially useful for legacy code (C, C++, etc) that is not being integrated in the cycle. </p> <p>So my question is, are there any alternatives on the market that offer the capacity to analyze code out of the cycle? For what I seen so far, most industry-reference tools like Snyk, SonarQube\ufeff, Veracode, etc are only used for SAST analysis on the cycle, not providing the capacity of scanning out of the cycle. </p> <p>Any suggestion is welcomed, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FlashySail2137\"> /u/FlashySail2137 <",

So I have been using Tenable Nessus as a Vulnerability and Hardening analysis tool for quite a while but I still have some issues with it that I can&#39;t seem to resolve.

Apart from the authentication = 1 Success. I have found that the analysis can fail on a lot of plugins even If the authentication is successful and I haven&#39;t found a direct or simple way to see what is failing and why. When contacting the support they always request the *db file that they can process, but as a user there is no transparency for the user to see directly what is failing or why, contacting the support each time is very time-consuming. </p> <p>Also, regarding the analysis against Windows machines (Wks, Servers), the requirements needed for the scan to be successful are huge (requiring open po",
