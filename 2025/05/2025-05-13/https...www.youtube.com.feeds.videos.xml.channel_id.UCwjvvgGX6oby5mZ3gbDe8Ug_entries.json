        "description": "A courageous Chinese medical student, Luo Shuaiyu, paid the ultimate price for uncovering a horrifying organ harvesting operation within a major hospital. Before his mysterious death, he compiled 16 pounds of damning evidence \u2013 including chilling recordings and documents \u2013 detailing forced organ extraction, falsified death certificates, and a black market for human body parts. This is his story, his evidence, and the desperate plea of his parents for justice against a system seemingly designed to silence the truth.\n\nFor more evidence, please click the link\uff1ahttps://www.upholdjustice.org/",
