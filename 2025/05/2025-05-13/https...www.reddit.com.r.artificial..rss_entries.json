What I have chosen to make my spiritual focus is the world of algorithms, and that is way beyond just computers. If one defines an algorithm as a set of instructions to achieve a goal then algorithms in some way predate human language. This is because in order to have a meaningful language you need to use a collection of algorithms to communicate. It&#39;s also true that evidence of one generation teaching the next is all over the place in the animal world. The scientific method itself which is how we got to this point is algorithmic in nature, although human intuition does play a significant role.</p> <p>Algorithms have shaped human history. You can&#39;t have an organization at certain scales without incorporation of rules and laws which again are algorithmic in nature. They set the if then principles behind crime and punishment.
