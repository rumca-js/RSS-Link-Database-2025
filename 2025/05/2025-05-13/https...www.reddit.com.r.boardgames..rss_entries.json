So if you need to flip you have a stationary device that you just give a flick of the finger. I know there are other ways to accomplish this (dice, app) but humor me.

And I\u2019m really curious where most of you stand on that spectrum. For example, Agricola puts a lot of emphasis on simulating the pressures of subsistence farming, while Caverna offers a more generous and abstract approach to the same theme. </p> <p>The reason I bring this up is that my team and I are currently developing a game of our own, and realism is definitely a big part of it.
