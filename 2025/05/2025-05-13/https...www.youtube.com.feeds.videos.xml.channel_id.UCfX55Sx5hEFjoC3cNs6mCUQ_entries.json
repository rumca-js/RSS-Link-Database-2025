        "description": "Sponsored by: vCluster\n\nModern platform engineering requires more than just Kubernetes \u2013 it\u2019s about building a cohesive ecosystem that supports developer autonomy and operational scalability. In this session, we\u2019ll walk through how to build a self-service Kubernetes catalog using Helm, GitOps, and vCluster, while integrating CI pipelines and composable infrastructure tools like Terraform, Helm, Kro, Kratix, etc. Learn how to connect these components into a seamless platform experience that\u2019s ready for real-world, day-2 operations.\n\nTopics we\u2019ll cover include:\n\n- How can you build a Helm-based catalog that empowers teams to deploy services on their own?\n- What does it mean to \u201ccompose\u201d infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Kratix, and Score?\n- How does label-based deployment work in Argo CD, especially across multiple vClusters?\n- How can Go-based templates and CI pipelines generate deploy-ready manifests for GitOps?\n- What does a fully integrated GitOps workflow look like from CI",
