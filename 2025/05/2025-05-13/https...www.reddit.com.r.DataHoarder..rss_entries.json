        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I bought a Windows Mobile 2003 PDA (Acer n35) which came with an SD full of this .pbf backup files from 2005. The backup software that comes preinstalled on Windows Mobile 2003 only creates .abk files, and the software for the PC (ActiveSync) only creates .stg backups, so I dont know what software was used to create this ones. Maybe its from some Acer OEM software that came with the device originally? I couldn&#39;t find much about it so idk. Also, this PDAs have a thing in which the memory gets completely wiped when it runs out of battery, which its another reason why I want to see whats inside the backups, but also means that I have no idea if they were made with some software from the PDA itself. </p> <p>So i would apreciate if someone has any information about that!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/displayboi\"> /u/displayboi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comment",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Well, finally managed to fill up my DS1512+. I&#39;m a novice and would love some advice on 1) If I should even upgrade (or go with another NAS) 2) If I upgrade, any good deals on drives out there? </p> <p>Use case: I just use it to store my photos and have some peace of mind. I currently have 1 WD 12tb (WD120EMAZ), 1 WD 8tb (WD80EMAZ), 3 WD 8tb (WD8003FFBX) = Total 27.9TB</p> <p>I understand that Synology has been shady lately, so am not sure if I want to support them. But until I can research an alternative, should I just buy 1 or 2 new drives? If so, any deals out there? </p> <p>Thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/blueangel78\"> /u/blueangel78 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1klca48/new_drives_for_ds1512/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1klca48/new_drives_for_ds1512/\">[comments]</a></spa",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was running Windows Server 2012 R2 until this morning and needed to install a new OS. I went with Windows 10 LTSC as I didn&#39;t think I needed most of the server functionality since I am just running a Plex media server.</p> <p>Then I realized that two of my drives were not mounting. Both are WD Red 12 TB. I could be completely wrong and backwards on this but I believe they are MBR formatted. It has been years since I installed them and I remember needing to cover one pin on the drive&#39;s connection after I shucked them. Anyways, they won&#39;t mount and I believe the MBR partitioning is the issue.</p> <p>Looking for recommendations on the easiest way to get the data off of them, and back into my pooled storage. My thought was connect them via external USB connection, transfer the data off, format the drives using GPT, and then transfer the data back onto them. Is that the best route to take? Any other suggestion to avoid having to transfer roug",
