        "description": "This year\u2019s F1 driver\u2019s championship is the most unpredictable it\u2019s been for years so Codemasters and EA Sports have a tall order on their hands if F1 25 is going to replicate even a modicum of the real-life season\u2019s on-track excitement. \n\nAs it happens, F1 25 has potential to be the series\u2019 best for years \u2013 matching the current driver\u2019s championship in that regard at least. Countless overhauls are coming, from My Team and Career mode updates, much-needed revisions to car handling, graphical innovations, customisation options, even circuits in reverse! \n\nIn fact, there\u2019re so many novel elements to year\u2019s iteration that it\u2019s been near-impossible to select the top fifteen things you need to know before you buy.",
