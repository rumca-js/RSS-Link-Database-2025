All the URL&#39;s are with &quot;watch?v=&quot; instead of the &quot;/shorts/&quot; in the URL, width and height of the thumbnail are all 450 by 360 wether it&#39;s a plain video or not...

I&#39;m still learning how everything works and exploring what kinds of content I can follow.</p> <p>Right now, I&#39;m mostly interested in finding good RSS feeds for <strong>webcomics</strong> and <strong>podcasts</strong>, but I&#39;d also love to explore other categories down the line (like tech news, niche blogs, etc.).</p> <p>Are there any good directories, curated lists, or sites that organize RSS feeds by category?
