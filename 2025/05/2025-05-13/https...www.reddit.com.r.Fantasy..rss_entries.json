It&#39;s a lot more light-hearted than the First Law, but it is genuinely funny and the action is excellent. I guarantee if this was from another author, people would definitely rate it as much higher. The characters, are all fun. A little pandering to stereotypes sometimes, but the book had a nicely hidden surprises that spiced things up for me.</p> <p>Overall, I think it&#39;s worth pushing through the first few chapters. I remember starting off a little annoyed at how derivative it all was, but over the course of the book flat characters deepen and the book finds its rhythm.</p> <p>I will say the book bucks most of the common criticisms levelled at Abercrombie. There are few truly slow parts, and it&#39;s not grimdark in any sense of the word. I think <em>the Devils</em> is an excellent jumping point for a new reader.</p> <p>",
