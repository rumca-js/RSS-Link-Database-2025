Unfortunately, anything I have tried with Metasploit has not worked with the x86 architecture of the laptop. There don&#39;t seem to be too many resources out there detailing how to do this with x86. Following some of the few guides I found but with little success. Has anyone done Eternal Blue on an x86 machine before and do you have any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pholus_5\"> /u/Pholus_5 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1klzgx9/eternal_blue_for_x86/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1klzgx9/eternal_blue_for_x86/\">[comments]</a></span>",
