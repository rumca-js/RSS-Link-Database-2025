But yeah been outside more recently with lots of insects many of whose lives I destroyed; really, the mass suffering and migration are fascinating as much as they are painful to watch.

I should probably like to get my hands on nonfiction first and scifi second. That said I&#39;m happy with any positive or descriptive/extensive mentions of insects in literature, although it may be a good idea to keep it to the topic as much as we can.

I really liked the first book and plan to read the rest of the trilogy. I also have the first three books of The Stormlight Archive, The Sword of Kaigen, and World War Z, though I haven\u2019t read them yet.</p> <p>I liked Mistborn, but it felt a little too \u201cscientific\u201d at times. It was still a very good book, but I\u2019d prefer a magic system that feels a bit stronger. (Spoilers for Mistborn Book One) The Lord Ruler was hyped up to be incredibly powerful, but in the end, he didn\u2019t seem as strong as I expected.

Because authors generally want to convey meaning without overwhelming or confusing the reader, many interesting worldbuilding aspects might be ignored or avoided - such as having a unique light source to that world. Some authors don\u2019t care to have an in-world character explain their light source, especially because it would be natural to them. How many of us would write in our diaries how to use a light switch? </p> <p>With Isekai, authors have an excuse to go into these details - they\u2019re new for the character.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>When I say adult I don&#39;t mean gooner smut because I&#39;m sure there&#39;s plenty of that, just looking for stuff that&#39;s written at an adult reading level for adults, as it seems like this is more popular as teen lit. I specifically like stuff with some political intrigue that features vampire societies that have been hiding under the surface of our world pulling the strings (think Vampire: The Masquerade if you&#39;re familiar), but I&#39;m open to any suggestions for the best reads.
