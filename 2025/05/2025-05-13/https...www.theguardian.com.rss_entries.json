This results in an unusual and not unpleasant mixture of aesthetics: gangsters in sharp suits and wide-brimmed hats and a ragtag band of salvage divers whom they hire to recover their ill-gotten gains.</p><p>The film also makes good use of its Australian setting, with attractive riverside locations which are again not typical in a shark movie. Hang on, you might think, what\u2019s a shark doing in a river?
