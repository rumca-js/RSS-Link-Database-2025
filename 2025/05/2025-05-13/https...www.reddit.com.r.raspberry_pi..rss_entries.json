I followed a YouTube tutorial and also got help from ChatGPT and Claude to configure WireGuard on my Pi. Everything processed fine.</p> <p>As part of the setup, I created a DuckDNS account to get a domain and token. Everything went smoothly, and I was able to connect the WireGuard VPN to my travel router.

Normally, the first step is to connect to the router\u2019s Wi-Fi, then log into the router via its local IP address. Once connected, the router should use the WireGuard VPN to assign me my <strong>home IP address</strong> (as configured on my Raspberry P",

I learned that in order to activate the siren the officers have to return to their office and use a computer to log into a website and send the signal, which seems not practical given reasons this might be used. I was thinking of a few different solutions, but one of which was a physical button connected to something like a Pi. </p> <p>I was thinking that when the button was pressed it would activate a script on the Pi that opened the website, executed the login and then activated the sirens.</p> <p>So what are the internets thoughts on the feasibility of the project? I&#39;ve done a little research and it seems possible if I can learn java and/or python for the script, but I am open to suggestions. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sad-Huckleberry4833\"> /u/Sad-Huckleberry4833 </a> <br/> <sp",

What i want to do:</p> <p>Rpi/microcontroller with two small spi displays (st7789 1.9\u201d and ili9341 2.8\u201d) that will constantly show gifs/videos and play some sounds through gpio output (pwm+audio filter+amp+speakers). Also some sensors (distance, gyroscope) that will condition what is being shown on displays.</p> <p>What i tried:</p> <p>-esp32 - total failure - too weak and memory too small to fit all data </p> <p>-rpi zero 2 w - this was my to go option (at least this is what i thought) - fbtft_device deprecated - can\u2019t find a way to optimise spi communication and gif decoding - ended up with a python st7789 library, tested pil and cv2 to encode gifs. Unfortunately streaming even short gifs to two screens at a time makes cpu go 100% and the animation is far from being smooth. Is there a better way to communicate with those displays more efficiently to s",
