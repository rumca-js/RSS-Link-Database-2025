First 30 days are free and 20% off the annual premium subscription when you use our link \u279c  https://brilliant.org/sabine. \n\nA team of biomolecular engineers have come up with a new way to generate electricity from rainfall. Their method involves having rain flow through tiny tubes, and they claim that it can generate up to 100 Watts of electricity per square meter of tubes. Will this revolutionize renewable energy? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nPaper: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.4c02110\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n\ud83d\udd17 Join th",
