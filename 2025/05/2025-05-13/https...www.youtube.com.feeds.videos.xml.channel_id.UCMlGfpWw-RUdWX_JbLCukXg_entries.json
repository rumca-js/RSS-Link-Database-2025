We will use two examples from the standard library to demonstrate this and show how in one place, the standard's interpretation of amortized constant complexity is at odds with the usual use of the term.\n---\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nAndreas Weis\n \nAndreas Weis has been writing C++ code in many different domains, from real-time graphics, to distributed applications, to embedded systems. As a library writer by nature, he enjoys writing portable code and exposing complex functionalities through simple, richly-typed interfaces. Both of which C++ allows him to do extensively.\nAndreas is also one of the co-organizers of the Munich C++ User Group, which allows him to share this passion with others on a regular basis.\n---\n\nCppCon is the annual, week-long face-to-face gathering",
