Nicknamed the accordion worm for its ability to shrink to one-fifth its normal size, it was found 30 meters deep in R\u00eda de Arosa. Traditional taxonomy methods failed to classify the species due to limited external features, so researchers combined morphological and genetic data to identify this unique heteronemertean in the Lineidae family. This breakthrough highlights the importance of molecular tools in marine species discovery.",
