I would plug a device into it, wait a week, and then check the accumulated data in the app to review the usage.

So the needs are pretty modest: (1) storage, viewing, and sharing with fam &amp; Friends of my own images, personal video (my own, not commercial tv &amp; film), and some important documents. Right now this totals a bit under 1TB, but growing slowly over time. (2) Reliable automated backup and archival of these items (local, and to an appliance (or service) in another location). </p> <p>For home, my thinking is to get a miniPC and self host Immich and Nextcloud (and maybe eventually Frigate). No gaming, no plex, etc.. What&#39;s the sweet spot for this sort of usage? Are brands like GMKtec and Beelink fairly reliable? Would you go intel N100, ryzen, something else? Is it worth getting a box with capacity for 4 M2 drives (I already have two 2TB M2 drives, and prices for other formats don&#39;t seem that much cheaper any",

I am thinking about moving to Komodo and like the fact that it integrates with git. In the whole process however I started to wonder about the best way to handle config/.env files which are used next to docker-compose files. From my research so far I determined that the general recommendation is to NOT put those config/.env files into a git repository along the compose files, as they may contain secrets and other instance specific data.</p> <p>My main concern is the case of a Desaster recovery e.g. when my hardware failed. In this case I want to be able to restore everything quickly exactly as it was and this would include config. I don\u2019t want to recreate all .env files from scratch as they usually contain way more then secrets.</p> <p>I could of course simply backup my .env files in the same way as I backup the data of my containers (binds).
