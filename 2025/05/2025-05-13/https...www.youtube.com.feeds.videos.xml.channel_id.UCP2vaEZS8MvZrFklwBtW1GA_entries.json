        "description": "Hand protection tips\u2026I have to work around ductwork which can easily slice a hand. But I also need grip to use different materials and tools.

Many thanks to Ironclad for partnering with me and making gloves that keep hands safe\ud83d\udd25#handprotection #workgloves #ironcladgloves #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
