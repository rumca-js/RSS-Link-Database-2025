        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nGrand Theft Auto 6 won't be gracing our consoles until 2026, but what if we had another GTA to hold us over? That's what former Rockstar technical director Obbe Vermeij is suggesting when asked about the rumors of a GTA 4 remaster. With the Oblivion remaster selling well (despite performance problems on all platforms), Rockstar could port GTA 4 to a more modern engine and let us roam around Liberty City before hitting up Vice City in GTA 6. Rockstar has not announced anything officially, but \"insiders\" are suggesting otherwise. In other news, Stellar Blade will be the next Sony-published game landing on PC next month. The new version will feature new outfits and a new boss to fight (those things are also likely to make their way to the PS5 version, as well). And finally, Prime Video's Fallout will drop its second season this December, and a third will be in production sometime after that.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #GTA",

A testament to the powerful, simple joy of a well-executed setup and payoff, Bloodlines\u2019 lethal Rube Goldberg machines are tactile and satisfying, benefiting from a solid blend of goopy practical and visual effects. It\u2019s a fantastic jumping-on point for new fans, but the Final Destination faithful are well taken care of with cheeky references to previous movies and a truly poignant farewell from one of the horror genre\u2019s late kings, Tony Todd.",

        "description": "The Precinct reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.\n\n\"The Precinct\u2019s focus on proper arrest protocols and penalising excessive force requires a certain level of patience that not everybody will possess (and it\u2019s a system that eventually wears out its welcome) but I genuinely enjoyed prowling the city for procedural crimes while the story lasted \u2013 and the soggy, neon-splashed \u201980s setting works wonders. Fallen Tree Games had a previous crack at emulating the top-down shenanigans of classic Grand Theft Auto back with 2019\u2019s American Fugitive, but putting the action on the right side of the law in The Precinct has proven to be far more arresting.\"",
