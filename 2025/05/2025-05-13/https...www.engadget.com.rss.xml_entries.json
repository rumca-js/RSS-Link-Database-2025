It\u2019s a very S25-looking device, but the company is pitching it as a design-centric addition to its, let\u2019s admit, bulging S25 family. The S25 Edge\u2019s body is 5.8 millimeters (0.22 inches) thick if we ignore the camera bump like everyone else does. Granted, it\u2019s not a huge bump.</p>\n<p>Samsung says it engineered the lenses to be substantially thinner than those on the S25 Ultra while keeping the same 200-megapixel camera sensor. And there are only two cameras on the back this time. Gasp! Unfortunately, Samsung has gone for an ultrawide secondary shooter rather than a telephoto, likely due to the handset&#39;s size constraints.</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on-release-date-price-000022902.html\"><",
