I will link my website below my name and title on each column.</p> <p>There doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of competition for \u201cfinancial advisors near me\u201d in my area. It\u2019s still a small town and there are not any other independent advisors yet, but it\u2019s projected to be one of the fastest growing towns/cities over the next decade - so I really want to improve my local SEO. Hopefully this can help?</p> <p>Any thoughts are appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/New_Range5907\"> /u/New_Range5907 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1kla4kr/how_much_will_contributing_monthly_columns_to_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1kla4kr/how_much_will_contributing_monthly_columns_to_my/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Long story short I could not walk or use my hands, and was basically a vegetable. I had to quit my job as an SEO director, and let go of several clients. Fast forward to now, my health is under control and I need to get going again....BUT I&#39;m trying to wrap my head around the absolute shit storm that hit this industry while I was under this proverbial rock. In all of my years as an SEO I have never seen so much change. Lucky me.</p> <p>I honestly don&#39;t even know where to start, I feel extremely lost and behind. I have no doubt I will catch back up. I don&#39;t feel comfortable jumping into a management position, and definitely not a director level.</p> <p>Can anyone point me in the right direction? I feel like I need to be a sponge right now and soak up as much as possible. I honestly feel like I&#39;m starting over so much has changed.</p> </",
