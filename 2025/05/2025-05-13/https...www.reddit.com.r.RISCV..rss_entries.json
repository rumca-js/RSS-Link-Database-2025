It looks super interesting, but I\u2019ll be honest\u2014I\u2019m a complete noob when it comes to it.</p> <p>From what I understand, Ripes is used for visualizing how a processor works, especially in terms of pipelines and assembly instructions. I want to get a solid grasp of how to use it, not just to pass my classes, but to really understand what&#39;s going on under the hood.</p> <p>My question is: where should I start? Should I begin by reading documentation and learning the concepts first, or just jump into some YouTube tutorials and get a feel for it by watching others use it?</p> <p>Also, any beginner-friendly resources or tips would be much appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jumpy-Transition7132\"> /u/Jumpy-Transition7132 </a> <br/> <sp",
