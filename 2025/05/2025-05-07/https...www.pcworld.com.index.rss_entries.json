My most recent example is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Endoscope-Adjustable-Semi-Rigid-Waterproof-Inspection/dp/B0CZHT2VHS/\">this USB-C endoscope camera</a>, which I snagged for just $21.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s an endoscope camera? Think of a long, flexible tube with a camera and light attached to one end. In the medical field, it\u2019s used to look inside the human body\u2014but for me, it\u2019s been an everyday game-changer for all kinds of practical uses.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-listicle-chart\"><div class=\"wp-block-listicle-chart-item listicle-chart-item\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading  \" id=\"before-i-got-this-nifty-little-accessory\">Before I got",

If any of your devices are still stuck on a 128GB, 64GB, or even 32GB microSD card, now\u2019s an excellent time to upgrade to something bigger. Right now, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B0B7NV73PJ/\">256GB SanDisk Ultra microSD is only $20 on Amazon</a>, a great price for the size and speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SanDisk Ultra works with just about any microSD-compatible device, offering up to 150 MB/s transfer speeds that make this card ideal for recording 1080p videos, storing files for portable use, moving files between phones, and saving game data in handheld gaming devices. The SanDisk Ultra also comes with an SD adapter, so you can still use it with devices that don\u2019t have micro",
