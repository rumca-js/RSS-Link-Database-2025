So many great new releases and exciting books and short stories, and so many good book clubs and read alongs going on here. </p> <p>I just finished The Tainted Cup by Robert Jackson Bennett, and one of the themes of the book really did <em>something</em> to my brain. I&#39;m talking about the leviathans, and the way they shape the Empire of Khanum and the living philosophies and thoughts of people living near the sea walls. (+ the scenes where they are directly mentionned. Wow)</p> <p>For those who haven&#39;t read : I love this sense of doom, that a higher threat, something you can&#39;t act upon yourself, can destroy your whole world in an instant. I&#39;m looking for a book that has this sense of doom shaping the worldbuilding, plot and characters ! </p> <p>Huuggee bonus if the characters actually experience the end of their world together !</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; ",

My second bit of good news was when I discovered that book one of a favorite authors&#39; new series is being translated and a release date has been announced. All to be topped off when I found out that an author I follow is releasing a new series. The great thing about this new series is that, about a month ago someone asked here on reddit &quot;what do you never see but really want to&quot; and my answer is what this new series is about.

So far, I&#39;m finding it pleasant but oddly dull. I absolutely do not require a flashy plot, either at the beginning or later in the book (in fact I love a lot of books often called &quot;slow&quot;), but there&#39;s something kind of bland and sedate about it to me that&#39;s making me consider giving up on it. Those who have read it, what might induce me to keep reading another hundred pages or so? Or does the &quot;feel&quot; stay exactly the same? </p> <p>I know the guidance is often to just stop reading the moment I&#39;m not excited to read more, but I try to give books more grace than that as I am often glad I powered through.

I\u2019ve noticed that I enjoy reading books that make me generally uncomfortable (maybe that\u2019s weird, maybe it\u2019s not). I finished the Red Rising series and there are certain parts where main characters are in danger, suffering, etc. that I absolutely hate but it\u2019s what draws me in and keeps me wanting to keep reading more and more.</p> <p>I also recently finished The Sword of Kaigan and while it was honestly a fantastic story, how it kept me on my toes and at times quite sad and emotional was a key factor to why I loved it.</p> <p>I recently started The First Law Trilogy and the first book has been TOUGH to get into.

That deep, sensory connection to the land\u2014using the forest like a living apothecary, or calling on plants as allies\u2014really captures my imagination. Ideally, the setting has a strong nature presence woven throughout, not just as scenery but as a meaningful part of the magic or lore.</p> <p>Fae are a main interest, but I\u2019m open to non-fae fantasy too, as long as the relationship with nature plays a central role.

It\u2019s a forbidden magic but she becomes a monster hunter and works with a team to keep their city safe.
