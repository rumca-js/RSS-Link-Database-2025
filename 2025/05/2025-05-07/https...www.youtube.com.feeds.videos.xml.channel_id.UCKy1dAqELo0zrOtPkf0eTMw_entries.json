This week Daemon is joined by Podcast Unlocked's Ryan McCaffrey and IGN's Executive Tech Editor, Bo Moore, to talk GTA 6's influence on the PS5 Pro. Will Sony's latest Pro console get a bump in sales because of GTA 6, considering it'll be the best way to play the game until the inevitable PC release? And we take a look at Microsoft's new pricing strategy for the Xbox Series X and S and all the accessories. The strategy: everything costs more now. And, will PlayStation follow suit and raise prices on their hardware? They've done it in other markets, will the U.S. be next? Plus we have last week's poll results, and a new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.\nAnd don't forget to join us for IGN's second annual IGN Live, a huge in-person event held in Downtown Los Angeles. You can get tickets at IGN.com/Live and use promo code NGCW for a discount.\n\n#IGN #GTA6 #Gaming",
