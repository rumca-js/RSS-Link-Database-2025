One cluster, marked by high inflammatory load and insulin-resistant fatty liver, showed particularly high risk.

        "description": "Life depends on genes being switched on and off at exactly the right time. Even the simplest living organisms do this, but usually over short distances across the DNA sequence, with the on/off switch typically right next to a gene. This basic form of genomic regulation is probably as old as life on Earth. A new study finds that the ability to control genes from far away, over many tens of thousands of DNA letters, evolved between 650 and 700 million years ago. It probably appeared at the very dawn of animal evolution, around 150 million years earlier than previously thought. The critical innovation likely originated in a sea creature, the common ancestor or all extant animals.",

If global temperatures rise by 3.5 C by 2100, 92% of children born in 2020 will experience unprecedented heatwave exposure over their lifetime, affecting 111 million children. Meeting the Paris Agreement's 1.5 C target could protect 49 million children from this risk. This is only for one birth year; when instead taking into account all children who are between 5 and 18 years old today, this adds up to 1.5 billion children affected under a 3.5 C scenario, and with 654 million children that can be protected by remaining under the 1.5 C threshold.",

Its true beauty lies in its unique symbiotic system of fungi and algae, or cyanobacteria, that form a self-sustaining partnership, allowing it to thrive in even the harshest conditions. With that inspiration, researchers created a synthetic lichen system that collaborates like natural lichens. Their system uses cyanobacteria, which turns air and sunlight into food, and filamentous fungi, which produces minerals that seal the cracks. Working together, these microbes survive on nothing more than air, light and water. The autonomy of this system sets it apart from previous self-healing concrete endeavors.",
