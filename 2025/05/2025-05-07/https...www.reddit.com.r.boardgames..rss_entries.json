It just so happens I beat the same person for first place and I think he thought he had both in the bag until I counted at the end. In fact, one came down to a tie breaker (Scythe Expeditions or whatever it\u2019s called.) Anyway, I felt guilty, like I cheated him out of his victory when he seemed really sure of it. Maybe I just don\u2019t care if I win that badly or maybe I prefer to see others happy, but I went home feeling almost like I cheated or something (which I didn\u2019t.) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dophin26\"> /u/dophin26 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kgmizo/anyone_ever_feel_guilty_for_winning/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",
