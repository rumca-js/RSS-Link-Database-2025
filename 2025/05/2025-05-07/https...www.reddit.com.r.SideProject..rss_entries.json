Problem is, it&#39;s a notion dashboard, it doesn&#39;t feel the same as using an actual app and after a few days I just lose the spark.

I\u2019ve managed to get it working on Xcode simulator. I want to make a few changes to it and test it for a few weeks before I make it available to the public but I was just wondering how would you market something like this. It would fall under productivity. </p> <p>My steps were to: 1. List on product hunt 2. Promote it on subreddit 3. No idea how gumroad works but can I list it there? 4. Share with friends and family 5. Just keep talking about it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f</p> <p>Any advice for a novice would be super appreciated.

Essentially, it lets you be your own fitness coach, by just answering some basic questions in the onboarding, it will generate you a fully customisable workout split dedicated to you, and if you don&#39;t want that then its a fully functional workout tracker too. It&#39;s my first app, and I&#39;ve put a lot of effort into this. To help with initial marketing I&#39;m giving away one month of premium to all users who sign up to the early bird. The app will launch in around 2 weeks time. Here is the website if anyone is interested and I would also be keep on any advice you guys have.</p> <p><a href=\"http://smartsplitapp.com\">smartsplitapp.com</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Prope",

I know it might be tough to convince gym owners, but I feel like it could help a lot of people who travel or move often.</p> <p>Has anyone else faced this issue?

No one really knows how much effort they actually put in. I made hundreds of tiktoks, and marketed for 2 hours daily non stop for the past few months. To add to the spice, my friend who was working with me also quit after 2 months of no traction. I know $2.99 is nothing but the confidence it gave me to keep going is soo invaluable. So if someone like me who has never sold a thing before can sell in first 4-5 months, you can too.
