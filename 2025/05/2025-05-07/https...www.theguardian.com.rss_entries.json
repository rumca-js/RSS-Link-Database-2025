Rather than coasting on the nostalgia summoned by his 1985 hit, the title is instead a reference to the top-and-tail sex position (Adams has claimed, much to the annoyance of his co-writer, that the song was also referring to the same thing).</p><p>It\u2019s the unusual focus of awkward teen gamer Abby (relative newcomer Sam Morelos) who has a long-running obsession with her classmate Max (Disney star Matt Cornett). The best she\u2019s been able to manage throughout their time at school is small talk, but when he breaks up with his longtime girlfriend, she sees an opportunity.

How far the name-letter effect influences our bigger life decisions \u2013 where we live, our choices of career or life partner \u2013 remains contentious, but there are clear indicators that, far from serving simply as identifiers, the names we are given at birth have the power to influence our psychological, social and&nbsp;economic outcomes.</p><p>Florence Knapp\u2019s ",

The European orchard bee, <em>Osmia cornuta</em>, which has established itself in southern England, is an important pollinator because it is among the first to begin foraging in the spring. On the continent, colonies are encouraged to live in cherry and apple orchards since they are said to be better pollinators than honeybees. It is about the size of a honeybee, but more brightly coloured.</p><p>The UK was once too cold for the species since it emerges early in the year and needs warmth. It was first identified in Greenwich in London in 2014 and has spread rapidly since. This spring has been perfect \u2013 warmer and drier than usual, so the population is likely to continue to grow.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/07/specieswatch-new-honeybee-s",
