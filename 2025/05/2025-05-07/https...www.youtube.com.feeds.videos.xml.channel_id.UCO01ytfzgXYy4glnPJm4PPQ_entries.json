        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the debate over the n-word heard around the world has obscured one question that deserves consideration: Why was that Somalian man in that park in Minnesota? Why has Minnesota imported thousands of Somalians over the past few years? And what benefit does this mass Somalian migration bring us? We\u2019ll talk about it. Also, the Supreme Court upholds Trump's trans military ban. More major retailers are moving away from self-checkout because of all the shoplifting. And the Piers Morgan Show descends into chaos after Piers dares a woman to say the n-word.\n\nEp.1591\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJmkzml0WIQ\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldnVmC6qk20\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4LF_fyregc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoiXmPXfsc4\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@hopewalz/video/7499564036535635242\n\nhttps://x.com/JustNewsBLOG/status/1919830884972179668\n\nhttps://x.com/TheStrongDad/status/1919543497599660348\n\n- - -\n\nBecome a DailyWire+ member and watch t",
