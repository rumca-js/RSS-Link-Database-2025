The late Kentaro Miura's legendary manga series is a seminal work whose influence can be seen in any game with oversized swords and a penchant for over-the-top violence. The two franchises are both steeped in blood, gore, and demons--practically making them a match made in dark fantasy heaven.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately, Diablo 4's Berserk crossover is largely a disappointment, one that doesn't capitalize on the overlap between its two franchises. Far from honoring Berserk, it mostly just feels like a cash grab, an excuse for players to potentially spend well over $100 on cosmetics and nothing more.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berser",
