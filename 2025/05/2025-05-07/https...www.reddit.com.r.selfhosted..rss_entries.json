In the beggining of my setup I needed a timeseries database that would serve me to display data in Grafana for server telemetry and other use cases for my smart home. I eneded up going with InfluxDB for 2 reasons: The documentation was really solid and the system really easy to setup, and they provided the Telegraf agent that would do a lot of the work for me out of the box. I saw later on the Prometheus project growing and getting more and more adoption in the open source community and InfluxDB moving more and more away from that spectrum into a more enterprise-focused monetization framework, which I am totally OK with, to be fair.</p> <p>Now I am coming to the point that soon I might have to migrate InfluxDB v2 to v3 and this won&#39;t be an easy task as I have been reading.

Turns out when I tried restoring from an export, I lost all my metadata. I did manage to recover all the documents, so I\u2019ve been slowly working through re-tagging, renaming, adding correspondents, etc. It\u2019s been a painful process that has forced me to learn a lot more about Paperless and Docker in general, which is not a bad thing.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m nearly done rebuilding things and want to spin up what I hope will be my \u201cfinal\u201d stable Paperless instance.

No CPU decoding. QSV is enabled but ffmpeg crashes constantly with filter errors like &quot;Impossible to convert between the formats supported by the filter &#39;Parsed_fps_0&#39; and &#39;auto_scale_0&#39;.&quot; Tried various formats and hwaccel tweaks. VAAPI and iHD drivers are installed and working. Frigate sees the VAAPI driver but the stream dies with every cam.</p> <p>Main goals are live view in browser, stable recording, and full hardware decoding. No detection right now. Just want it running smooth and offloading decoding to the GPU. What\u2019s the proper way to get this working on the N100?</p> <p>I also tried shinobi but that was CPU in",
