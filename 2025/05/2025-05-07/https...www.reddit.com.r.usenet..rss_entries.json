I already have drunkenslug, dognzb and nzbgeek and they do find some stuff in that language but 90% of what is there is on English. My family has a hard time understanding English so I want to make their life a little easier. I was able to find stuff like chile-bt but they are torrent based most of them. I want something that at least have an API key so I can connect it to Sonnar and Radar</p> <p>Any guidance on this would be awesome!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Illustrator_9044\"> /u/No_Illustrator_9044 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1kh8ilp/looking_for_an_indexernewshost_that_has_has/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1kh8ilp/looking_for_an_indexernewshost_that_has_has/\">[comments]</a></span>",
