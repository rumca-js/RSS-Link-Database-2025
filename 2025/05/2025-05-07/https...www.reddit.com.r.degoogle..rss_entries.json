I need a new search engine/browser, a new way to make slideshows and documents and spreasheets. I know there are some things like this but I want to be supporting a company who isn&#39;t a total scummy AI infested mess. I constantly and looking stuff up so a new search engine is a must, I also am trying to write books but feel weird using google docs now, and I love keeping track of info so spreadsheets and slides are really nice. Also, is there any sort of gmail equivalent? Because it feels like having an email adress is a necessary thing but again, google is horrible. I&#39;m sure there are things I&#39;m not thinking of right now, but any suggestions would be soooo apprieciated!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/applstair_\"> /u/applstair_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comme",

Not using Google and Meta services, switching to Grapheneos and using Qubes OS, isn&#39;t it itself a metadata? Isn&#39;t there a risk of being tracked as an outlier and potentially being supervised by companies or governments in case the geopolitical situation takes a more &quot;supervising&quot; turning point? Would a milder strategy and &quot;hide in plain sight&quot; be useful in this case? Thank you for the answers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Docmccoy26\"> /u/Docmccoy26 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1kh4epb/not_using_google_services_or_whatsapp_isnt_itself/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1kh4epb/not_using_google_services_or_whatsapp_isnt_itself/\">[comments]</a></span>",
