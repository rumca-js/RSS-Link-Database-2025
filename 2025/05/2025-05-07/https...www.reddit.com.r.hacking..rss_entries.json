I have a Sony UBP-x700 that I&#39;m looking to add a screen to so it can be a stand alone music player. In particular, I have some SACDs that I&#39;d like to play without having to hook it up to my TV. This at first seemed like a fun little project that has proven to be quite difficult (which describes most projects I start).</p> <p>My wanted functionality is:</p> <ul> <li>a method of controlling the unit with play/pause/previous/next/etc commands (should be easy enough, something as simple as an IR blaster would work, but definitely open to other options)</li> <li>a way to retrieve metadata on the disk, including the track list, the currently playing track, and the name of the album. Album art would be cool too, but I&#39;m not sure if that is stored as metadata on the disk. </li> </ul> <p>If I can get this information, I should be able to figure out the rest I think",

It would be cost prohibitive since this is mostly for personal knowledge gain.</p> <p>Or if anyone knows of a way to create a compatible device with a raspberry pi or arduino, that would work as well. I&#39;d want them to produce different but repeatable results though, just like a keylok II would.
