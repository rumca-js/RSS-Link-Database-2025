She loves contemporary novels and shows like White Lotus and Big Little Lies, and is really into drama, rich people getting into messes, power dynamics, and secrets. She&#39;s also a lesbian, so if there\u2019s any sapphic content, that\u2019s a bonus, but not necessary. She\u2019s also not a fan of historical fiction, even though I think it might be her vibe. Could you recommend fantasy novels that are more plot-driven, with social intrigue and maybe a bit of magic, but don\u2019t focus too much on romance or get bogged down in worldbuilding? Ideally, something with a bit of that White Lotus drama feel, maybe with rich people, politics, and high-stakes tension!

Specifically ones similar to GTA IV as that one is my favorite of the GTA series. Some books that deal with the falsity of the American Dream, crime, revenge, shady government politics, american satire, and all those themes you can find in GTA IV.

I\u2019d prefer something by a professional like a psychologist or something, but anything would be good. Also something on being more empathetic would probably be in the same vein.

I hear the game is compared a lot with The Lord of The Flies as well but I\u2019ve already read it. Just lookin for something not necessarily terrifying in traditional horror senses but a horror that\u2019s underlined with tones of trauma and heartbreak. </p> <p>I guess other books that I\u2019m looking with similar vibes for are American Mcgees Alice, SH: Shattered Memories, Paranorman and Coraline. As much I would love to own and play the game I heard it\u2019s actual gameplay has a lot to be left desired and acquiring the game is like searching for a unicorn.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RiddleMeTwister\"> /u/RiddleMeTwister </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kgo6gj/gothic_no",

One thing I\u2019ve come to regret is how little I\u2019ve read in my life. I feel like I\u2019ve missed out on a world of ideas, perspectives, and stories. I also feel quite out of touch with the world beyond my own little bubble.</p> <p>I\u2019ll have a few months of spare time and want to read a lot. I\u2019d love to hear your recommendations for books that were truly eye-opening, life-changing, or just deeply fascinating. I\u2019m open to any genre or subject. Surprise me!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EJKibble\"> /u/EJKibble </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kgjsv4/looking_for_lifechanging_or_eyeopening_books/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kgjsv4/looking_for_lifechanging_or_eyeopening_books/\">[comments]</a></span>",
