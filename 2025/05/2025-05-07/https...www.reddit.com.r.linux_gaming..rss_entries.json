Already happened like 3 times with Fallguys, 1 with Gears 5 and now this time with Halo Infinite.</p> <p>I read people saying MS wants to &quot;harm&quot; Linux and stomp it, but facts say otherwise.

I &quot;chose&quot; arch because it&#39;s a DIY approach but DIY also means complicated (sometimes). Like most gamers, I used to run windows only and unlike most gamers, I have 4 drives in my computer (C drive for windows, a Games drive and a Misc drive) for my Linux, I bought a new drive but that doesn&#39;t matter. All the drive mentioned above are formatted NTFS so I have to use ntfs-3g or any other alternative to access them on Linux.</p> <p>The problem I am facing now, is that apart from one game in my library (Undertale), I can&#39;t play anything that is downloaded on that drive. I tried explicitly telling steam to use proton for the games but none of them start up. I asked chatgpt for advice and apparently my drive is missing permissions (exec if I&#39;m not mistaken).</p> <p>So I am wondering: do I have to format my games drive in ext4 that way I don&#39;t have that problem or can I change",
