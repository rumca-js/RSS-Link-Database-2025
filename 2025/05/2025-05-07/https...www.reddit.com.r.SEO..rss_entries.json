Or do you get the UI/UX designed first and then go for fully custom development?</p> <p>Personally, I usually go with custom UI design and develop everything from scratch without using frameworks like Bootstrap. It keeps the site very lightweight, which helps with CWV and also improves schema setup and semantic html.</p> <p>However, for some websites especially client projects I also use ACF or block editors when full customization is not required.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to know what your usual method is.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Additional-Resort-21\"> /u/Additional-Resort-21 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1kh9p",

When I visit the page on my website, it still shows the old content.</p> <p>Has anyone else faced this issue?
