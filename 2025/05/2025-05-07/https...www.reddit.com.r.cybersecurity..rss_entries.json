My most recent one was Security+ and I\u2019m looking for something that is a bit more challenging/useful but also still recognized. I\u2019m interning at MSSP as a SOC Analyst this summer and many people take CYSA+ right after without much prep so I\u2019m not really considering that for the purpose of this post. I\u2019m looking for something more hands on that also holds some weight around the industry. I\u2019ve done a lot with Hack The Box and I am considering doing the CDSA but I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s not really recognized. So if anyone has any recommendations for certifications that are a step up from CompTIA while also holding weight around the industry that would be greatly appreciated. </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Other-Noise5344\"> /u/Other-N",

My key skills are within compliance but do have some hands on experience too. I am currently out of work and thinking could I work as a freelancer for companies and review their environment and work with them to pass compliances such as iso27001 or pci DSS compliance. </p> <p>I am based in the UK and wondered if there are any other freelancers who are doing the same? I appreciate any advice you have. </p> <p>Thanks in advance </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/stu_lil21\"> /u/stu_lil21 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1kgrvem/freelancing_is_it_worth_it/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1kgrvem/freelancing_is_it_worth_it/\">[comments]</a></span>",
