Sure there&#39;s some design (in the sense of &quot;make it pretty&quot;), but realistically that&#39;s maybe 10% of the work. The other design tasks might be really closer to creative problem solving (how to make a building or masterplan functional efficient etc.), but even that can become incredibly subjective (so not data driven).</p> <p>I see many speaking up about how AI will take over the world, but possible that the loudest dominate the conversation not reflecting many other professions?

This is a billion dollar company that (I am not going to name the company but it is a big manufacturing company in my country) did succeed. My question is why does AI seem to live in this weird perfect world where consumers would boycott products and regulators would always act swiftly. I tried testing this by giving it examples of unethical business models and told them to analyze them (stuff I know did succeed but I reworded them to avoid looking obvious) and every time it insists regulators would crack down and consumers would boycott and companies are increasingly striving for transparency. It should be trained on real world data, no? So why does it always seem to believe good always prevail and bad",

It\u2019s fascinating to hear what one of the world\u2019s top investors thinks about AI\u2019s trajectory. PTJ was genuinely optimistic about AI\u2019s potential to transform industries, but he raised a serious red flag about privacy. He noted that even the summit\u2019s four seasoned panelists struggled to address privacy concerns convincingly. One panelist\u2019s response? That they are planning to buy a quiet piece of land with chickens and animals to escape the tech overload eventually. It\u2019s a stark reminder that while AI\u2019s promise is huge, the privacy question remains a tough nut to crack.
