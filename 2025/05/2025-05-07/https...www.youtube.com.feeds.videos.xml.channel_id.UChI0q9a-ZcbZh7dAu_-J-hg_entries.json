        "description": "\"ElsaGate\" (a primarily 2016 and 2017 shock video phenomenon) was a pivotal moment in YouTube history. \n\nWhen the YouTube Kids app became overrun with inappropriate content, purely for the sake of ad revenue, drastic changes were made to the website during a media and advertiser firestorm, but now (in 2025) there is a new wave of AI driven slop infesting keywords targetted at children, with a multitude of distinct similarities.\n\nAs the content spread like a virus, little to nothing is being done about it, by a platform that seems to be ignoring a problem rather than proactively solving it. ElsaGate 2.0 is on the cusp of being here. \n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https://linktr.ee/uppereche",
