        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So clinger winger was always my favorite level on NES and it was pretty easy and people always said it&#39;s the hardest level. I thought pish posh. NOW I try it on Rare Replay with an xbox controller and discovered why people think it&#39;s hard. Going around the corners, the xbox controller registers for example, LEFT, DIAGONAL (bad and slows you down), DOWN. The NES controller on OG hardware is instantaneosly going LEFT, DOWN. It&#39;s so bad that I can BARELY pass it on Rare Replay if I use rewind about 50 times. This blew my mind. Hopefully you find it interesting. Oh and I think the NES MIGHT be fine even running a diagonal on a straightaway since one of the input directions is correct, so it&#39;s probably not picky at all (unverified).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kuli24\"> /u/Kuli24 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1khamgb/battletoads_clinger_winge",

I barely remember these two retro beat em up games, so if anyone could name them would appreciate it.</p> <p>for the first one, all i remember is the health bar was round shape and would sit on top right. I believe you lose a life after taking 4 hits.</p> <p>second one, i remember a bit more, there might be 3 or 4 character. One wore red dress, the other wore blue dress and the 3rd one wore a sleeveless yellow jacket with white hair may be. One of the powerful weapon was a bazzoka that can shoot like 4 missiles. All of them had a move like shoryuken from street fighter yelling Niyaaaa. Lastly, when the bosses die, they would give of items like points/food and so on. </p> <p>This is a 2D game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PlentyVisual2854\"> /u/PlentyVisual2854 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1kh",

I want people who had sports careers, but were the least successful at it. I&#39;ll accept examples either where the athlete had lots of potential, and perhaps a short high peak, but weren&#39;t able to sustain a successful career, or just athletes who were good enough but never great. </p> <p>Granted, there will probably be weird edge cases where it&#39;s debatable whether the person is getting named as an athlete, or some other kind of celebrity.

I was trying to find an old game (miner madness) in the internet for some years now, finally, I got my hands on it because I found it on an old cd, but the problem starts when I try to play it. Loading screen works fine, without any glitches, but when I try to play it just loads so slow and I cannot play. Can someone, please, help me find where to download a normal version of it or can someone help me fix this issue? :( Thank you in advance! Oh, by the way, I found literally only one website that mentions something about this game, so if it changes anything here it is - <a href=\"https://rawg.io/games/miner-madness\">https://rawg.io/games/miner-madness</a",
