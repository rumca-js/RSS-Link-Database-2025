I used to hike more a few years ago, and the book inspired me -not to do the Appalachian trail, in fact, it turned me off of ever wanting to do that, but to plan for a long 20 km hiking trip in my own more gentle backyard. I started hiking again to get in shape, and last week I did a 5.5 km hike, the longest hike I had done for a while, and I think I&#39;ll do another 5K hike tomorrow, if only it would stop raining for one damn second.</p> <p>What about y",

Great book, loved it. Maybe only the introduction part which I think takes up about 30% of the book was a bit boring as I am not really well versed with psycho analysis and the theory involved, so I found myself just carrying along in the beginning. However once the stories started it was much better, I enjoyed each story. I think the ones that had the most impact on me was the first one of the greek wife and the last one of Emily. Best one I would say was definitely Emily in the end.</p> <p>However, while reading these stories I started to question how much of this was the authors own made up fiction and how much reality. I mean she provides the stories in dialogue form so obviously it is made up, which makes me think a lot of her own bias has slipped in and tinged all of these stories.",
