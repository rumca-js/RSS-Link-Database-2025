It wasn\u2019t perfect, but for fans of the movie, it was magic.</p> <p>I\u2019ve always felt that this game is long overdue for a faithful remake. Not a reboot. Not a reimagining. Just the same story, same characters, same locations \u2014 but rebuilt for modern consoles and PCs with: \u2022 Updated visuals (Fhloston Paradise in 4K? Yes please), \u2022 Modern third-person controls (especially for Leeloo), \u2022 Re-recorded voice acting (bring back Milla and Bruce if we\u2019re lucky), \u2022 Same structure and missions, just smoother, shinier, and more fun to play.</p> <p>Imagine running through futuristic New York or battling Mangalores in Zorg\u2019s factory with Dead Space-level polish but old-school design. That\u2019s what I\u2019m dreaming of.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve put together a quick fan pitch idea to try and get some at",

His birthday is coming up, so I got to tinkering. I made up a raspberry pi setup running batocera. For the controller, I got him an 8bitdo neogeo controller (it&#39;s a simple joystick with 4 large buttons and shoulder buttons). This combination seems to work pretty well so far, but I&#39;m trying to load it up with compatible games (joystick and max 4 button games) that a young at heart 70 year old would enjoy. So far, I&#39;ve got the following; </p> <p>Arcade - Asteroids, burgertime, bust a move, defender, donkey kong, frogger, galaga, galaxian, i robot, joust, joust 2, magical drop 3, matrimelee, ms pacman, pacman, pochi &amp; nyaa, Popeye, qbert, rampart, space invaders, sunset riders, tetris</p> <p>Nes - Super Mario bros 1-3, tetris</p> <p>Snes - Dragon&#39;s lair, street fighter 2, space invaders, super Mario world</p> <p>Thanks in adva",

Could have been Sega or NES, perhaps a computer game but I had limited pc access back then. But I remember there being a ship combat phase where you picked what you attacked the bad guys with and where, and then a boarding phase with named characters you could equip with different weapons. Woulda been top down or isometric pov.
