For context, I&#39;m a transfemme who has just begun to transition in a world that is feeling increasingly unsafe. This isn&#39;t a one-off either; I have chosen to visit establishments and get health care at places whose websites have a pride flag.

There are many ways to prove that the abrahamic god does not exist just by using logic, because the only thing abrahamic religions are consistent about is being logically inconsistent. There are also so many things in the bible that contradict everything we know about science.
