Immich works with no issues on the host machine but I can&#39;t access it from any other device on the LAN. I&#39;ve tried localhost:2283 and I went and inspected the container and tried it with that IP as well, still nothing. I edited the docker-compse.yml to change the ports from 2283:2283 to 2222:2283 to see if there was some conflict and this didnt change it either. End goal is to set it up for remote access either through a domain or nginx, but for now how do I get it accessible on the LAN?
