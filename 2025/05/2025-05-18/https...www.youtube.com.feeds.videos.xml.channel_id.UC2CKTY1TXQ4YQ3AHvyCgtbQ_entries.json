        "description": "We had a great weather streak here for a bit, and I built four big MDF buildings while it was nice out, and even primed them - too. But now, I have to figure out what colors to paint them for the cyberpunk board I want to make. I'll talk about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game!
