For people who are also into DJing, my controller only supports Serato, and it can be tricky to learn a software when you don&#39;t even understand what each feature does and when it should be used. I&#39;ve watched tons of free tutorials but it&#39;s not enough for me to understand every part of how the software and hardware should be used. I&#39;d also like to find DJ tips and techniques but all these courses I have managed to find in online torrents for dj software and technique courses are very short and focus on more advanced topics. (i found two). I&#39;ve also tried the websites for courses in the megathread but most of them are not usable at this time. Thanks for reading, and happy torrenting ;)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/freshyfruitz\"> /u/freshyfruitz <",
