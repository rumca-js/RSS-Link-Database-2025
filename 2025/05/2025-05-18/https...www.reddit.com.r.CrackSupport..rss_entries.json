Yesterday I figured out the actual issue by trying OCCT stability test.</p> <p>Turns out the culprit is probably my cheap mobo, it makes it so the cpu can&#39;t handle 3600mhz overclocked ram. It was the cpu spitting out errors, not the ram. Thats why im thinking its probably the mobo.</p> <p>I set it to 3200mhz, no more errors in OCCT or the repacks. Keep in mind I never had any crash or issue with the pc, just the repack installers.</p> <p>Guess I eventually just need to buy a better-ish mobo to set the ram at full OC again.</p> <p>From previous searches and posts there was a lot of speculation and weird fixes about what the issue was (things like using the repack 4gb of ram limit made no difference), turns out this was it.</p> <p>Specs:</p> <p>B",

I bought SOM from steam but alas it is always crashing with no definite fix, (btw, if anyone knows how to fix pls help me) I remember playing the pirated one from fitgirl and it was just fine. So i thought to just get that again, but alas #2, it is gone.</p> <p>I tried the one from DODI but all I got was more headaches. So, as a last resort does anyone have a repack stashed somewhere that maybe they can share with a desperate gamer like me?
