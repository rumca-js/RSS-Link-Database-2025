I can of course set up both but I want Grocy to track meal plans/ingredients and Tandoor to keep track of recipes. Although I am not sure about ingredients tracking because each recipe can end up having different spelling of ingredients but we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get there.</p> <p>So, I wanted to ask what the community does as I will probably end up writing a script that can do what I want. What is the most optimal way y&#39;all have managed that? What kind of integration (as in, who handles what) would be the best and most desired? So far I am thinking about integrating only the recipe management aspect, which would make Tandoor/Mealie only a recipe creator so that they don&#39;t manage the ingredients/shopping list/etc.</p> <p>Would love to hear other suggestions. Thank you for your time.</p> </d",

After many nights trying to resolve an issue while deploying a kubernetes cluster locally, I managed to deploy it and started to install things like: grafana, argocd, longhorn and jellyfin.<br/> I just deployed jellyfin on kubernetes and is running smoothly! Showed to my wife and she was very happy.<br/> I currently have 2 nodes in my cluster, my pc as cp and a worker. My worker configuration is:</p> <p>Storage: 240gb ssd sata, 240gb ssd nvme<br/> CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz<br/> GPU: RTX 3060<br/> RAM: 16gb 2400 mhz<br/> Very happy overall!
