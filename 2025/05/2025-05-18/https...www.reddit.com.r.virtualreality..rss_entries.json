I want to go wireless, most probably Q3. I currenly have very basic router so will need something better and there come question: <strong>Is 6E really a &quot;must&quot;?</strong> Its quite expensive. Isnt wifi 6 enough? I will use new PCVR headset in same room as wifi router. I live in house so there are no other (neighbours) wifi signals which would intereference. To use internet also two mobile phones and TV (rarely) will connect to the router. <em>I read about Puppis S1 but I dont like the idea - another USBs occupied, another thing on the table.</em> I also read reccomendation to use dedicated router for VR, again I would like to avoid it. If I use 6/5GHz bandwitch only for VR that should be ok? PC will be connected via cable to router.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
