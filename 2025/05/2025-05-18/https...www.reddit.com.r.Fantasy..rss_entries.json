I read it&#39;s synopsis and thought it was interesting so I grabbed it and it&#39;s direct sequel, <strong><em>Grievar&#39;s Blood</em></strong>, that day.

And then it dawned on me.... where is the spec fic? Where is the horror? Have I just accidentally read.... a crime novel? </p> <p>I picked up the book from Barnes and Noble having no prior knowledge of Uketsu, who is an enigmatic Japanese youtuber. The book looked cool - it features in-world art, blogs, and interviews - and I thought it might work for the epistolary square. I finished the book in a day, and really had fun with it. </p> <p>More than anything I would describe it as a puzzle. You are reading these seemingly separate stories, meeting new characters, and reviewing all this creepy ephemera. At one point I had to get out the paper and pen and start diagramming a family tree to keep it all straight in my head. Ultimately it all comes together very satisfyingly. <",

From start to finish,the characters can barely breathe and are tossed from one mission to the other,but it feels a lot better spaced out in terms of time than the Poppy War. 2. The realities of war. This is my favorite aspect of this series.The shifting POV from a victim&#39;s side in Poppy War to the one causing it makes you see how dispensable people are seen by the political class. Kuang doesn&#39;t hold back in mirroring the real world in this story,and there were times I would be like &quot;That&#39;s how they talk!&quot; 3. Vaisra. I liked how his personality, words and actions are felt directly, and through others when they are used as extensions of his will. Everything he does or doesn&#39;t do makes sense in a twisted way. Even when other character explicitly say he will do it,it&#39;s still shocking when he does it. 4. The battle sequences.",

I particularly enjoy dark sinister characters like violent and human-eating creatures like Orcs, Goblins, etc. Specialists are cool too like warriors, assassins, rangers, etc.</p> <p>I only have one request, which is that it&#39;s very easy to read/follow. BTT was really easy to read because the characters were simple, the story was straight-forward, and it wasn&#39;t full of convoluted characters/plot-lines. I tried reading the Ice and Fire series but couldn&#39;t get into it because of how many characters I needed to keep track of. I found the show to be much easier. </p> <p>Reading is only a small hobby for me and I often do it at work while waiting for work to pop up",

The book is consistently funny throughout its length. The humor usually stems from the characters&#39; idiosyncratic behaviors which is sort of thing that works for me. Stephen is just so goshdarm earnest that whenever he says something that sounds silly, I imagine him saying it with the blandest expression and utmost gravity that I can&#39;t help but laugh.

No horror, dystopian or very present content that could be triggering. Ideally a book that does have a pov from a woman. LGBTQIA+ is also welcome.</p> <p>Enjoyed: - the winnowing flame trilogy by Jen Williams - the ember in the ashes series by Sabaa Tahir - the book eaters by Sunyi Dean - currently reading Paladin&#39;s grace by T kingfisher which so far everyone is liking.</p> <p>Popular ones we&#39;ve read but not everyone loved: - gideon the ninth by Tamsyn Muir - priory of the orange tree by Samantha Shannon - the martian by Andy Weir - justice of kings by Richard Swan - This is how you lose the time war by Max Gladstone &amp; Amal El Mothar</p> <p>We&#39;ve read more but hopefully this gives an idea.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",
