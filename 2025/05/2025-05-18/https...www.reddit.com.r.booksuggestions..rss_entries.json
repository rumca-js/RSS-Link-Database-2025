I would love suggestions on authors or starting points. </p> <p>I don\u2019t care the gender of the protagonist, I just want to steer clear of gross sexism. I also don\u2019t care about any romantic plot lines. I really like action and life threatening situations/major injury. In the romance books subreddit I tried Whiteout by Adriana Anders and that was okay, a bit too focused on the romance vs action for me and a convoluted plot.

My younger sister is going to turn thirteen in a couple of weeks and I wanted to get her a book thats about being a teenager/preteen girl and that sort of thing.</p> <p>However, our parents are very conservative and religious. And I&#39;d like a book that can subtly expose her to things outside of what they tell her she&#39;s allowed to read. Something that can inspire her to be her own person without it being the type of book that they&#39;ll go through and say it&#39;s a bad influence. </p> <p>She doesn&#39;t have her own phone and hardly has that many friends. So I feel the best way to help her is through books. </p> <p>But it&#39;s very important that it&#39;s subtle... like not even dating can be a big part of it. </p> <p>This feels like a very specific request and impossible but I really want to help her out.</p> <p>Thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

A couple books that come to mind growing up were Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Ender\u2019s Game, Percy Jackson, Rangers Apprentice, and a lot more. I\u2019ve recently set out on a journey to read some classics in the Science Fiction genre. I started with Dune and absolutely fell in love. Next I ventured on to Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion. Hyperion was a masterpiece that I enjoyed much more than Dune, but FoH was less engaging, but I grinded through to hear the end of the story. After some research I decided on Gene Wolfe\u2019s Shadow and Claw. At first I enjoyed it but as I got about halfway through I couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, it made me not want to read anymore and I haven\u2019t read in close to six months.

For context, I lost my virginity to a woman who was twice my age, and more recently I was in a relationship with a woman in her late thirties (I\u2019m in my twenties). She told me it was the best sex of her life, and she really appreciated how much attention I gave to foreplay. On the flip side, my past relationship with someone my own age didn\u2019t work out \u2014 we just didn\u2019t connect emotionally or physically.</p> <p>On top of that, I also have a soft spot for chubby or plus-size women \u2014 I find them incredibly sweet, adorable, and beautiful.</p> <p>So, I\u2019m looking for book recommendations where the main female character (MFC) is older than the male main character (MMC). Bonus points if the MFC is plus-size! I\u2019m open to both smutty and non-smutty recommendation",

I decided to read it because the movie is my absolute favorite comfort movie. I adore these books. </p> <p>I\u2019m currently on book 3 (reading in order of publishing) and I\u2019m starting to prepare myself for the end and looking for my next fix. I\u2019m honestly just kind of concerned I won\u2019t fall in love with a new universe like I did this one. </p> <p>Some things of note: - The main appeal of these books to me is the magical/witch aspect. Fantasy is a must. - I also love the way the world is built with magic. The warm, traditional fall feeling is perfect to me. - Doesn\u2019t have to be focused on romantic love. - Women\u2019s empowerment/closeness with other women in a platonic and familial way are some favorite themes from these books, too - LGBTQ+ themes would be a plus, though! Just not essential. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",
