I\u2019m really passionate about cybersecurity, especially the defensive side hings like threat hunting, incident response, and security operations. But I keep wondering: is this kind of career basically an \u201cemployee-for-life\u201d kind of deal?</p> <p>By that, I mean is it hard to break out of traditional employment and truly freelance or build your own business in defensive cybersecurity? It feels like most roles are within companies or MSSPs, and freelancing opportunities seem limited or really competitive.</p> <p>For those who\u2019ve been in this space a while, what\u2019s your experience? Have you found ways to freelance, consult, or create your own business in defensive cybersecurity? Or is it mostly a steady employee role? Would love to hear your thoughts and advice!</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ninaNes\"> /u/ninaNes </a>",
