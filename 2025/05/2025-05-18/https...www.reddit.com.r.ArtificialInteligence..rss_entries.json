Sometimes the API returns really good, accurate words. Other times, it gives only 4 complex words for an A1 user even if the transcript is really long (like 200+ words, where I expect ~40% of the words to be extracted). And sometimes it randomly returns translations in the wrong language, not the one the user picked.</p> <p>I\u2019ve rewritten and refined the prompt so many times, added strict instructions like \u201cre",

Let\u2019s clear up the confusion.</p> <h1>The Black Box Problem</h1> <p>At its core, the black box metaphor means we can see what goes into an AI system and what comes out, but the reasoning in between remains opaque.
