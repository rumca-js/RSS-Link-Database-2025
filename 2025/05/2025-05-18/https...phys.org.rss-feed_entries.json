        "description": "In the world of quantum computing, the Hilbert space dimension\u2014the measure of the number of quantum states that a quantum computer can access\u2014is a prized possession. Having a larger Hilbert space allows for more complex quantum operations and plays a crucial role in enabling quantum error correction (QEC), essential for protecting quantum information from noise and errors.",
