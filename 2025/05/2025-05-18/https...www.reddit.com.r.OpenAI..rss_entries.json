Their ability to see connections between past and future events starts increasing, the longer the duration of the task, the more elements n in the task. Assuming each element has dependencies with every other element in the task, we get dependencies = n^t for every added timestep t. As you can see, this is an exponential increase.

All data is securely stored, and you have complete control over it.
