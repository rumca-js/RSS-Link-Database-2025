I\u2019m doing the same stuff over and over, and the worst part? I was glued to my screen like it was my full-time job just to know things weren\u2019t broken.

It monitors Linux servers, lets you schedule tasks (like backups, custom scripts, whatever), and gives you instant alerts when something&#39;s off. Oh \u2014 and you can run commands remotely through a browser. No SSH needed. But here\u2019s the personal bit\u2026 The name \u201cZuzia\u201d is actually my daughter\u2019s.

We&#39;ve built a recipe management app based on our frustrations with existing solutions.</p> <p><strong>The Problem</strong></p> <p>We&#39;ve tried many recipe managers over the years, but always found ourselves drifting back to plain text notes. Recipes tend to change and evolve with each cooking session - tweaking amounts, swapping ingredients, and adding notes. Traditional recipe apps make quick edits like this tedious with structured forms and separate &quot;view&quot;/&quot;edit&quot; modes.</p> <p>But simple notes have limitations too - they can&#39;t automatically scale ingredients when you need to adjust portions, convert between metric/imperial, etc.</p> <p><strong>The Solution</strong></p> <p>We&#39;ve built Prepbook - a recipe manager that combines the simplicity of text notes with smart cooking features:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Text-first approach</strong>: Edit directly in the viewing interface - no switching modes</li> <li><strong>Sm",
