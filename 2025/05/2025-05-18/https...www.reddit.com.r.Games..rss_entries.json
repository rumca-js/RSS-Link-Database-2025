Every unit has a stamina bar that indiciates when it\u2019s ready to move, so turns are loosely defined. Two or more units can move at the smae time, you can dodge incoming attacks and levels feel alive with realtime hazards. We even have a giant boss that\u2019s an entire level in itself (check the gameplay teaser below).</p> <p>It\u2019s been a long time since I posted about our game here. In the past 10 months Tyrant\u2019s Twilight has received a complete visual overhaul.
