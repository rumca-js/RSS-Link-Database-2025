Lots of goals. The multi-player parts was amazing. Being able to set up to 16 bots running around with their own agendas. Being able to make teams. Setting up areas with laptop guns to just killanyone running down the hall. Oh and the maps were fantastic. </p> <p>I loved time Splitters 2 for the same reasons.

My favourite hobby was playing as Raiden, going to the Shell 1 Core, and seeing what mayhem I could cause; the concept of stealth did not exist. Oddly enough, my parents didn&#39;t mind any of the violence or sexuality present, just the language. There\u2019s a scene where Raiden says, \u201cDamn!\u201d after he encounters a locked door with E.E. My mom became incensed and threatened to take the game away. </p> <p>Now that I&#39;m older (30), I&#39;ve come to understand and appreciate the game&#39;s incredible themes, such as the use of AI, censorship, memes, social engineering, VR, and freedom of thought. The game was ahead of its time in this department, and it\u2019s one of my favourite games of all time and the best game that defined my childhood. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",
