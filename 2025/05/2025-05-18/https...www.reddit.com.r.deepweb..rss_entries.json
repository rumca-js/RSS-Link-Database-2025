But everytime i search for some docs, info, etc, it leads me to 1000s of ads or something that looks like scam (not legit). How to look for a legit source in deep web. Or is it the case that deep web is no longer a viable source due to misuse by spammers and scammed. Is there any proper guide that&#39;s relevant to current situations on deep web, how to identify right and wrong in this fabric..?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ccoolavi_\"> /u/ccoolavi_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1kpatf3/confused/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1kpatf3/confused/\">[comments]</a></span>",
