Wouldn&#39;t need to be NASA supercomputer levels, nor would I expect it to be. Just something that could run most low-to mid-range games. 4-8GB RAM would be all you would need for that, I would think. Or really, just as much as you could cram into it at that size. Maybe even SteamOS-capable, if that&#39;s even possible. If not, Linux would do just fine for my purposes. </p> <p>Are there any out there like that?

I&#39;m on a laptop, I tried playing Risk of Rain 2 and got some textures kind of buggy at times, not really a significative issue. But like after 10 minutes of playing my laptop on where the processor is got hot like crazy. Game was running smooth but it was overheating like crazy, fps were limited to 60 and textures were on 1/4 resolution. Also on windows that never happened, it did overheat sometimes but later in the game when there&#39;s a lot of stuff happening. Is there any driver for the fans I should download or something? My theory is that the game is taking mi integrated graphics and overloading them as if it was an actual gpu and just letting my cpu chill </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/someoneyoudlike\"> /u/someoneyoudlike </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1kka1a7/nonlinux_games_overheating_my_cpu/\">[lin",

AMD GPU with the open source drivers</p> <ol> <li>Why does the game look better scaled? I play on 1280x960 8xmsaa and it straight up looks better than on Windows. It looks a bit pixelated so maybe the MSAA is not running or working as usual? Since it would look like a blurry mess on Windows. Also, crosshairs are literally pixel perfect, no antialiased bullshit, they look crisp.</li> <li>My mouse has 1200 DPI in memory and I play 1.0 sens in cs, but somehow my sensitivity when launching on linux is much slower. It&#39;s really important to me that sensitivity remains consistent so I can play faceit on windows. Also, it kinda feels weird, like it has accel on it but very subtle?

As a huge fan of the original I was quite excited.</p> <p>The graphics, world and sound design is good and the the combat feels a bit more accessible than the original. The skill customization has also been turned up and that is a great addition. The world setting has always been the thing that drew me to the original game and this time round they do not disappoint, it looks amazing. </p> <p>The performance was a bit poor, and for instance I had to play on FSR quality mode, as Native AA had weird graphical issues, and TAA just looked poor and performed quite badly. It did not really make a difference what preset I used, it still performed poorly. Another disappointment is that the loot the creatures drop is not the loot they are carrying like the original.

It&#39;s not a typical Bethesda game because it uses some combination of UE5 and Creation Engine. So you might think that the easiest way is to just replace files without any mod manager because they are not built for such hybrid games. Well on Linux you have Limo - Mod Manager.</p> <p>It&#39;s such an amazing tool. I created deployers for different kind of mods. Classic esp mods(with LOOT sorting!), DLL mods, ini configs and UE5 Paks. If you are worried that you won&#39;t be able to easily mod games on Linux just spend 15 minutes learning how to use Limo.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve recently dusted off my old gaming PC that was high-end around 2017/2018. It has an Nvidia GTX 1060 and an Intel i7 (probably 7700), with 16GB of RAM. I&#39;m not a big Windows fan, and Windows 11 would barely run on this PC, so I want to switch to linux.</p> <p>A lot of people recommend SteamOS, but I&#39;m concerned about that it may not work with older hardware. Most info I find on the web is outdated, or fake. Also there&#39;s a lot of confusion between the latest SteamOS version, older versions (which are supposedly more compatible) and the best version for Steam Deck.</p> <p>Which OS would you recommend? I am familiar with linux, so using other OS won&#39;t be a problem for me. </p> <p>Does it support legacy Nvidia drivers reliably?</p> <p>I&#39;m going to play only steam games like The Witcher 3, GTA 5, but if these big titles would be a problem, I&#39;m still more interested in the smaller titles like Stardew Valley and Dave the Diver.",

I am running Fedora KDE and I just can&#39;t get Battle net to reliably launch every time. It just sometimes works and sometimes it doesn&#39;t and I don&#39;t know why? I am just getting tired of rebooting my system to roll a dice if this reboot will work or not. Anyone having same experience ? Battle-Net was working just fine on Lutris but due to latest update to battle net I&#39;ve been forced to move the app to the steam and Proton 10.

I first installed Fedora, but Dota 2 was lagging very much. I then tried Zorin OS to see if it would work properly (I chose Zorin because it is Ubuntu based). It didn&#39;t. I dont know why it is not working. My no5ebook previously had Windows 11 installed and I could play my Dota runing at 120 FPS on low. Now, on Linux, I can barely open. I tried to start a match and the program kept closing because of high memory consume. </p> <p>Do you know what it is the problem and how I fix it?</p> <p>Some key infos: - My GPU is Intel Iris (on Zorin it appears as Mesa Intel)",
