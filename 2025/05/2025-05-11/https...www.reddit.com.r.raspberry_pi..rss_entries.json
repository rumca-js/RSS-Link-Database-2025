The laptop is from 2014; its big, slow, and deafening loud (I&#39;ve cleaned the fan but I think its beyond saving). Its mainly for downloading/watching movies and stuff, so not super intensive, and I reckon a RPI could handle it. (Prologue question, is this a stupid idea?)</p> <p>Main question; the laptop is running Lubuntu, which I&#39;ve grown quite used to. I&#39;ve read that a RPi can&#39;t run Lubuntu, but CAN run Ubuntu. I don&#39;t understand how this can be true, as Lubuntu is supposed to just be Ubuntu but lighter, could anyone enlighten me?
