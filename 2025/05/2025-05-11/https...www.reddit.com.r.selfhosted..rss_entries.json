At night, when I\u2019m not in the living room, uploads resume as normal.</p> <p>The app works by periodically updating qBittorrent\u2019s max_active_uploads setting.<br/> Using this method, I can still force-start torrents if needed, and they\u2019ll become active even when max_active_uploads is set to 0.</p> <p>\u2728 Features:<br/> - \ud83d\udd52 Automatically toggle between quiet and active modes based",

Due to a mix of past hardware failure reasons and moving from other solutions to nextcloud, I\u2019ve got multiple copies of whole directories scattered around my NAS. I want to tidy it up. I\u2019ve set up a VM running digiKam to find duplicates but suspect it\u2019ll be running at 100% CPU on all cores for many days.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking that a faster solution would be to use dd and sha256sum to get a fingerprint of say the first 2K bytes of every file (headsum), store them in a SQL db. For all files with the same fingerprint set a rescan flag to get the sha256sum of the whole file. The db would store host, path, filename, size, headsum, fullsum, scandate, rescanflag.</p> <p>Any thoughts on improvements?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_markse_\"> /u/_markse_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/",

Simply clone a repo and upload your ROMs. A website will automatically be created for you, with a name of (mostly) your choosing, and will be hosted on the public internet, all for free. You can access this device using a phone, a PC, or a tablet. Works with Bluetooth and USB controller. Supports touch controls out of the box.</p> <p>This is now my method of choice for retro gaming. It&#39;s simply too convenient. Now, no matter what I bring with me, I always have access to my ROM library. I can just ask to use the device of anyone around me, punch in the website, and boom, I&#39;m gaming. I haven&#39;t had to install anything on that person&#39;s device.</p> <p>I make no money from this. If you like this and would like to let me know, you can tip something here: <a href=\"https://",

I recently learned of Zulip and thought we should give it a try before we decide on Mattermost. We&#39;ll be using the hosted version of Zulip for a summer internship program with &lt;50 students. Can self-hosted Zulip support separate organizations/workspaces and connect them in shared channels like Mattermost or Slack?
