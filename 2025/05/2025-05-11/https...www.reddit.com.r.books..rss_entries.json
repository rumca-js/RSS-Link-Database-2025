The experience of an audiobook is meant to be as immersive and as close to the written text as possible. well I\u2019m sure that whoever is producing the audiobook puts an effort into selecting the right narrator but if it&#39;s not Jeff Hayes I\u2019m taken out of the experience. One example that comes to my mind is the example of Jim Dale with the Harry Potter books, his performance is not bad (I prefer Stephen Fry anyway) but his Hermione is horrendous and given how heavily Hermione is featured the books it made getting through his version impossible.
