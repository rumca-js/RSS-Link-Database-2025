The idea is simple: a virtual pet that lives on a local web server, where you can interact with it feed it, check its mood, and watch it evolve.</p> <p>Everything is open source My goal is to create a playful yet meaningful little companion that encourages interaction and local-first tech. I&#39;m exploring things like behavior changes over time, modular components, and even the possibility of integrating small ML models (within ESP32&#39;s limits).</p> <p>I\u2019m sharing this with the hope of connecting with others who love building playful, privacy-conscious, open tech.
