        "description": "Onimusha is an outsider amongst other big names. Still, that hasn\u2019t stopped the series accumulating something of a cult following, with fans of the medieval Japanese adventure praising the series\u2019 marquee hack and slash combat combined with environmental puzzling, exploration, and pacing of survival horror. \n\nOnimusha 2: Samurai\u2019s Destiny follows a remaster of the first game in the series \u2013 Onimusha: Warlords \u2013 and this sequel arguably betters its predecessor in every way. The time is nigh to step into the horror-tinted historical Japan again, blade in hand and demons to slay. \n\nThis video highlights fifteen things to know before you hit that buy now button.",
