I love the physical media, but I\u2019m not necessarily stuck on having physical media, but downloading digitally some of these retro games I\u2019m finding to be difficult or nonexistent. For example, I want to play Parasite Eve 1 and 2, but can\u2019t find them anywhere. The only other thing I can think is emulation, maybe that\u2019s what I need to look into but just wanted to check with the community to see if there\u2019s any other options that you\u2019re aware of.

We remember the aim of the game to be that you would find coloured keys to unlock gates and you\u2019d have to fight really classic black and white striped big build prisoners but they were also animals of some sort with a ball and chain round their ankle that they may or may not have hit you with.
