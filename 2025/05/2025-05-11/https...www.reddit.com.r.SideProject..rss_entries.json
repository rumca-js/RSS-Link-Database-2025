I&#39;ve worked in both big tech and startups for a very long time, and keep up with all the news. For a while, I was thinking, all the articles about tech news sound the SAME, and are often just regurgitating whatever a company puts out in their press release. Meanwhile, the communications coming out of many tech companies is laughable, between the buzzwords and extraordinarily optimistic/exaggerated claims. </p> <p>I thought, what if someone wrote about tech news, but with snarky takes?</p> <p>So, I launched SiliconSnark as a side project. I&#39;ve published about 130 articles since Feb 10, and have been getting a few hundred visitors per month just from posted on X and Bluesky. Traffic&#39;s growing steadily, and I&quot;n hoping by the end of the year to have 2-3K unique monthly visitors. </p> <p>I&#39;m committed to keeping this going for at least a few yea",
