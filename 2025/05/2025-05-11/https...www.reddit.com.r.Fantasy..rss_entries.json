I also did the same with everything Drizzt Do&#39;Urden as a teenager. And I am currently, impatiently, waiting on the next installment of The Dresden Files. I have read plenty other series and titles, but those come to mind immediately when I think about what I like. Aside from the obvious classics. I like cool, aura farming heroes, small tight knit teams, magical beasts-pets-familiars, swords and sorcery, and love interests that can keep up when it&#39;s time for action. </p> <p>Thank you for any help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BrandNewby\"> /u/BrandNewby </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/F",

The whole slave/mistress dynamic wasn\u2019t nearly as convincing as the authors wanted it to be, in my opinion, and Kevin\u2019s presence tended to overshadow a lot of the better emotional moments for Mara.

The model for this is Gene Wolfe\u2019s Soldier of the Mist and its sequel, which weaves together the gods and the forces of nature in a way that I think was pretty accurate for the Ancient Greek world. To a lesser extent some of Gore Vidal\u2019s books are interesting in this way (Julian, Creation). </p> <p>Two things I\u2019d like to avoid are dead/mostly dead gods (think City of Stairs for instance, but I find most fantasy that is religious shows religion in decline), and YA. I am more interested in \u201cliterary\u201d stuff than pulp generally, but pulp that\u2019s a good fit is still welcome.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/somguy18\"> /u/somguy18 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kjoak1/novels_that_depict_",
