        "description": "The ROG Ally 2 has leaked, and in this video, I wanted to test the performance of the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme, although we don\u2019t have one yet. However, we do have a very close competitor: the AMD Ryzen AI HX 370!\nWe\u2019ve disabled four cores, bringing it down to an 8-core, 16-thread APU. We\u2019ve also overclocked the LPDDR5X RAM to 8000MHz, and of course, the iGPU is the 890M with 16 CU cores and based on RDNA 3.5.\nSo, we have a pretty close match to the Ryzen Z2 Extreme. How much faster will the ROG Ally 2 be compared to the ROG Ally and the Steam Deck? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% coupon code for software\uff1aETA\nWindows 10 Pro OEM Key($17): https://biitt.ly/KpEmf\nWindows 11 Pro Key($23):https://biitt.ly/RUZiX\nWindows10 Home Key($16):https://biitt.ly/2tPi1\nOffice 2019 pro key($51):https://biitt.ly/o0OQT\n2016 pro key($28): https://biitt.ly/xWmvn\nBuy Windows 11 CDkeys at https://w",
