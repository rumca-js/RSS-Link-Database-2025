I mean, just look at this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ACEMAGICIAN-Computers-Display-Desktop-Channel/dp/B0D3HN3NBK/\">Acemagician M1 mini PC that\u2019s only $398 on Amazon</a> (was $499). I challenge you to find a similarly priced laptop that offers this much power. Yeah, I\u2019ll wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Acemagician M1 features an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor that\u2019s bolstered by a chunky 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a delightfully productive combo that\u2019s affordable yet powerful enough to handle most of the tasks you\u2019d want to do, from spreadsheet calculations to web surfing to editing photos to mind-melting Netflix binges. The 1TB SSD offers fast enough file operations to boot up and move data in a flash. And if this isn\u2019t enough, you can always upgrade to 64GB of RAM and 4TB of st",

That growing temptation finally culminated in me building a desktop PC just for AI \u2014 to try my hand at <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2660539/i-started-vibe-coding-my-own-apps-with-ai-im-absolutely-loving-it.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2660539/i-started-vibe-coding-my-own-apps-with-ai-im-absolutely-loving-it.html\">vibe coding apps</a> just for fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My budget wasn\u2019t that high, so for the build I landed on an AMD Ryzen 5 2400G CPU with a base clock speed of 3.6GHz, and an Nvidia RTX 3090 video card. That combination was validated by my fellow PC builders online as entirely suitable for AI, so I felt confident I was onto a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they",
