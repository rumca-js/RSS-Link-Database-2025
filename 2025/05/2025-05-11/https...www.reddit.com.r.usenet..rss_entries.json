I see the lower plans and shifting to one of them may better suits me. I have a few other news readers, althub, and some other backbones, but because EasyNews has been in play so long, I can&#39;t really remember how I&#39;m using it?! I know that sounds silly, but I&#39;m wondering if going to a lower tier is going to affect me drastically, so help a senior figure out the best way to check this?!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jedimole\"> /u/Jedimole </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1kk9xka/is_biggig_for_easynews_still_worth_it_and_how/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1kk9xka/is_biggig_for_easynews_still_worth_it_and_how/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Some stuff gets downloaded perfectly; however, some other stuff gets &quot;missing MB&quot; for a whole season of a series or on very famous and recent movie. Online, all I find is based on &quot;99% completion&quot; or users saying they have no issues. Am I doing something wrong? If I&#39;m missing any details, let me know.
