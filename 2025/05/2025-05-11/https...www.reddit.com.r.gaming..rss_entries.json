For anyone looking for an interesting ride that strikes some unique chords, I cannot recommend Inscryption enough; it&#39;s an indie horror/comedy deck-builder card game with roguelike elements and more puzzles than you can shake a stick at.. and as you can probably tell by that description, it is a strange and complex little beast. If there&#39;s one thing that I love most about it, it might just be the sheer amount that it accomplishes without a massive Ubisoft/Rockstar/The Other Big Ones/Naughty Dog level budget. And that&#39;s not to say that it&#39;s a completely flawless game or anything, but it does So Much right... it has genuinely incredible atmosphere and sound-design, a crazy amount of depth in its mechanics, and one of the most addictive gameplay loops that I&#39;ve ever gotten my hands on. That being said, it absolutely can be punishing and irritating at its most difficult.. but it never threw anything at me",
