        "description": "As The Trial for Luigi Mangione makes its way through the justice system, another legal action has recently showed up, this time against United Healthcare (by investors) for its allegedly misleading financial statements. \n\nGoing back even just a couple of years, the companies business model appears to be directly at odds with the interests of patients, in a broken Health Care system that is increasingly damaging for a large number of people. \n\nAI algorithmic systems should not be in charge of critical health decisions, at companies where the profit model directly benefits from withholding care from those in need. It is a broken system with an obvious flaw. \n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: ht",
