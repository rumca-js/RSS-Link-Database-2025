I&#39;m also a sucker angst and friendships, and the gut-wrenching beautiful friendship between Eugene Park and Yeon Jung is what I love to see! The letters also just made it so good, the way Sori looked for them was one of my favourite things! I just really love the whole thing and I&#39;ve reread it so many times!! And the CHARACTERS.

And I want to understand this condition better so that I understand my sis&#39; behavior better and help her, get along with her more.</p> <p>So any books you would like to recommend that might help me on that?

For some more information, I&#39;d prefer it to be fiction (I don&#39;t really enjoy non-fiction that much) and for reference, I typically enjoy fantasy, science fiction, magical books or, at least, books that have an interesting plot and story, some action (less introspective, sorry) and an amazing world building (or describing, in this case) </p> <p>Any idea?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",

So, I have very few personal recommendations to go off of. </p> <p>One series I&#39;m considering is the Thursday Murder Club (I&#39;ve read the first 3), but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a little too twee in tone? She&#39;s leant me one book from her Robert van Gulik collection, but I haven&#39;t gotten around to reading it yet :/ I know she&#39;s always had an interest in Chinese &amp; Japanese culture as well, so any novel with those settings may work, too. I&#39;m just guessing that she&#39;s probably read or sampled every mystery series that&#39;s over 10-20 years old, so I need ideas for other books she may not have gotten to yet!

There\u2019s conflict: external and internal.
