Due to work, my wife and I had to move to another country and sold almost 90% of my collection.</p> <p>Back in 2020 when I knew almost nothing about games and because of being super expensive, my main way of getting boardgames was online auctions, that way i could learn a lot of new games and refine my preferences, but i quickly became bloated of games and did not give them as much play as i wanted. But now, i was given a second chance to rebuild my collection.</p> <p>So, my question is, <strong>which games would you choose to rebuild your collection? What are games the you would buy again and again?</strong> My preferences are euro-games (ark nova, age of innovation/terra mystica, tzolkin, ultimate railroads), fillers with high replayability (splendor, compile, tichu), deduction games (alchemists, &quot;sherlock decks&quot;), cooperative games (gloomhaven, sky team), etc...</p> <p>I would like",

The board(s) are red and white (or possibly red and black. There was a disagreement on this). </p> <p>In this game, you&#39;re building out a design onto this circular board.
