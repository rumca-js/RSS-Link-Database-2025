Wow. </p> <p>See there\u2019s nothing like being in the hands of a master filmmaker. But so many of them like Fincher, Cuaron, Scorsese, they seem content making films for streaming. Or when you do have a master like Spielberg making something like West Side Story or The Fablemans, the theatre is EMPTY. Which isn\u2019t to say we don\u2019t get great new films in theaters. Of course we do. Sinners is a terrific film. </p> <p>BUT Now that I\u2019m getting older I find myself revisiting old favourites over watching new films.

This is an insane and seemingly ballsy creative decision (imagine if &quot;Avengers: Infinity War&quot; had Thanos killing all the main Avengers in the first act), until you realize why it was done; to sell more toys. The film is a feature-length toy commercial and they were simply clearing out the old line to make room for the new toys. They just did it in the most upsetting way possible.</p> <p>&quot;Hey, kids, guess what? Remember all those toys you love and cherish? They&#39;re all DEAD! WE KILLED THEM ALL!!!...so how about buying some new ones? We got them right here!&quot;</p> <p>Of course, the joke is, they play",

However I\u2019ve never seen any of the movies in the cinema as I was too young to get in, but the new final destination bloodlines movie comes out next week so I\u2019m definitely going to the cinema to watch it, and I\u2019m considering making it extra special by seeing it in 4DX at cineworld. I\u2019ve never watched any movie in this format so I have no idea what to expect / what kind of effects there will be or what kind of movies give you the most experience for your money.

As a lover of film, I always appreciate how a good film takes you on a journey for a couple of hours and makes you forget your real life problems for a brief period of time.</p> <p>Along the way you experience great visuals, engaging stories, connect with characters, hear gorgeous music, and often times learn a thing or two about the world or human emotions. Sometimes there are themes that make you reflect and ponder over.</p> <p>There is a lot written about the future of movies and there is increasing competition from various forms of entertainment for people&#39;s time.

I kinda like war movies, whether it\u2019s something like fury or saving private ryan, there\u2019s TONS of Great War movies. I haven\u2019t seen one like this though. I don\u2019t know really what it was about this one, it was just different. And I have read that it was incredibly realistic, and people with PTSD actually had a hard time sitting through it. But watching the end credits was a really cool finish, especially seeing the actual people go through how they would clear a street/area. So am I kinda overreacting here or was this legit a good movie?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DakPrescoot\"> /u/DakPrescoot </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kjrqof/warfare/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kjrqof/warfare/\">[comments]</a></span>",

At first, when he tried to make it in 1978, he envisioned John Belushi as Bill Cutting and Dan Aykroyd as Amsterdam Vallion. However this production died when Belushi overdosed in 1982. Then Scorsese tired to re-configured the project with Mel Gibson &amp; Willem Dafoe, but it stalled and Scorsese went and did other projects.
