Keyboard pop-up delayed for 1s?!</p> <p>To begin with, it was started by Instagram, I don&#39;t know what happen or how it happen, only god knows how it happen. This is the first time the phone act shitty to me cause I know my phone ain&#39;t that old yet, it running QLCMM SDM710 Snapdragon. Make me panic by thinking &quot;it&#39;s dying Platform?&quot; But no, turn out there&#39;s a shitty simple script and extremely small, but sadly it so shit that it can&#39;t even hide itself from phone manager &gt;&gt; category &gt;&gt; &quot;not installed apps&quot;</p> <p>I&#39;m so lucky that I still use my First phone (currently I am using it) as 2FA and not my secondary fresh phone that run better than this phone,(I stay on this phone because of only 90Hz display.) Plus it&#39;s fucking 4:50 morning",
