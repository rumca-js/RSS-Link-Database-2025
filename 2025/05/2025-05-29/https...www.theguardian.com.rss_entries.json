It\u2019s no wonder, perhaps, she went on to a career playing quirky characters in quirky comedies. She was a bridesmaid in 2011\u2019s Bridesmaids, the bride-to-be in 2012\u2019s Bachelorette, and an eccentric employee at a breastfeeding boutique in What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting from the same year. She starred alongside Anne Hathaway in The Hustle, the female-centred remake of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. She was the ginger tabby cat Jennyanydots in 2019\u2019s ill-fated Cats, and played Fat Amy in all three (so far) Pitch Perfect movies.</p><p>Wilson now st",

However, it is difficult to ask questions about them. What is the longest fjord? Well, where are you measuring from and how are you accounting for curves? How many fjords are there in Norway? Nobody has ever really added them all up, have they? And anyway, how big does an inlet have to be before it can be considered a fjord? So, no fjord questions this week. Instead, we have the usual: 15 questions on topical news, general knowledge and popular culture.
