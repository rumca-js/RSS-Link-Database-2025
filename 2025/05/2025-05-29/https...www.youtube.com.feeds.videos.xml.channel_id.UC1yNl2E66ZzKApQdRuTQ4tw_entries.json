Head over to https://www.economist.com/Sabine to get started.\n\nYou might associate lasers with things like destroying planets or melting through steel. But researchers are working on a way to do something more productive with the technology: cooling computer chips. It could solve a big problem because overheating is currently the major obstacle in the way of cramming more transistors onto microchips. Let\u2019s take a look at how laser cooling works and why it might just be the cooling technology of the future.\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/",
