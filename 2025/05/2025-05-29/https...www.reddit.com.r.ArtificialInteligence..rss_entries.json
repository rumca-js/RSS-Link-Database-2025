As of now I\u2019ve accepted admission at school A, and I plan to take as many ai/ml classes as I can as well as stats classes and I do plan on getting a math minor and doing the 5 year masters program and get a masters in either cs or ai. I believe school A\u2019s cs and ai are both ranked higher than School B\u2019s (although not by a lot, and school B\u2019s math department is higher ranked than school A\u2019s) but I don\u2019t know if a cs with a math minor is strong enough to get a career started now.

Drawing upon classical theories of cognitive consistency, two preregistered studies tested whether GPT-4o changed its attitudes toward Vladimir Putin in the direction of a positive or negative essay it wrote about the Russian leader. Indeed, GPT displayed patterns of attitude change mimicking cognitive dissonance effects in humans. Even more remarkably, the degree of change increased sharply when the LLM was offered an illusion of choice about which essay (positive or negative) to write, suggesting that GPT-4o manifests a functional analog of humanlike selfhood. The exact mechanisms by which the model mimics human attitude change and self-referential processin",
