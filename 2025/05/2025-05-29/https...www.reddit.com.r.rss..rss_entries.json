Previously I just had below link which I was using { <a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/topics/CAAqKggKIiRDQkFTRlFvSUwyMHZNRGx6TVdZU0JXVnVMVWRDR2dKSlRpZ0FQAQ?hl=en-IN&amp;gl=IN&amp;ceid=IN:en\">url </a>} which was working fine and was able to gather all the required news articles. But now I need it to perform for many more countries , I know I just need to hl , gl and ceid with the ISO country codes to perform for different countries , but the catch is suppose I am running for China , I can see all the headlines and articles are in Chinese language , I need something which will provide me headlines in English language. I know there are some services like <a href=\"http://rss.app\">rss.app</a> but I am finding something which is not paid currently , so if you guys know something which does same work will appreciate that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
