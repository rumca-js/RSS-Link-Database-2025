But the Nvidia drivers managed to keep me away with the bad drivers. This changed with the 570-open driver. I installed it with DXVK like usual and Wine. Now I managed to get Forza Horizon 5, Notion, Steam, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Steam(the Windows version for mods). And other software much easier then in the past. I am really happy that more software becomes available on Linux and like this. The year of Linux might be possible and not that far away as it seemed a few months ago. This is a huge leap in compatibility. 6 months ago, when I tried last time none of my Windows apps worked, and it continued with everything. I am grateful for the progress that has been made the last few years. If you are wondering I am using Linux Mint. On a Dell G15 with an Nvidia RTX 3050 mobile and an Intel i7-11800h.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",
