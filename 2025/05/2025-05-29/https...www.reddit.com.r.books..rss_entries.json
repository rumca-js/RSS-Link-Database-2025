Perhaps a lot of it happens unconsciously. You can&#39;t read Les Mis\u00e9rables and not be affected by it. I could not think about poverty the same after that. About religion, law, justice, grace, and family bonds. I did not necessarily agree with the author or enjoy all parts of the book (the chapters about the Battle of Waterloo and also the sewer system went on and on). But the book left a mark on me. It made me look more closely at things, to think deeper about humanity and our values. About love.</p> <p>Usual light summer reading, in contrast, affects me much more briefly and less significantly and I don&#39;t think it changes my worldview in any significant way. But that&#39;s why I read a variety of books. Sometimes I&#39;m not looking to think deeply about things.</p> <p>By the way, the same is true of nonfiction. Atul Gawande&",
