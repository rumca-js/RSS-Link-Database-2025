My main questions is regarding which GPU ist better supported in either Fedora 42 or Ubuntu 24.04/25.04. I would love to go with Wayland, but experienced quite a lot of issues with my old GPU. Performance-wise the GPUs should be comparable, but I&#39;ve ready that way more games support DLSS4 compared to FSR4. However I dont really know if those features are really supported on those platforms. Cuda/Deep Learning might be useful, but are Not an deciding factor. I would love to hear aome additional opinions in which GPU to choose and some pros/cons I have not considered.
