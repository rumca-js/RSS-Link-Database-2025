I wanna start with a website, but if y&#39;all have any other ideas do tell. The idea is there are two teams. One attacks it, one defends it. Whoever wins gets a reward, idk yet what the reward could be. If this sounds like an inexperienced user, it is. I have no experience in this, but I&#39;m trying to learn and I&#39;d like a group to learn with.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Soulfurr612\"> /u/Soulfurr612 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1kyfsir/hacker_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1kyfsir/hacker_game/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I know that the imei is tied to the hardware, but it can be found in settings. So if the attacker can control and see everything on your phone through remote access, can they find it? Yes, there are probably much worse things that someone could do with this access and maybe having the imei wouldn&#39;t even be worth it, but I just wondered if it was possible.
