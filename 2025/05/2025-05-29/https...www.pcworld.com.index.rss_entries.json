The Deck\u2019s custom AMD Ryzen \u201cAerith\u201d processor requires severe graphical sacrifices to hit playable frame rates in intense games \u2014 if you can run them at all. When you\u2019re playing, you\u2019ll blow through the battery in just a few hours. And while non-Steam games <em>can </em>be added to the Deck, it requires wonky technical workarounds that normie gamers probably won\u2019t bother to troubleshoot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Nvidia\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/\">GeForce Now native app for the Steam Deck</a>, announced today and available immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your internet signal is strong, and you pay for a <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/630335/geforce-now-review.html\">premium GeForc",
