Is there a market for reclaimed chips, parts or shells? Is there a good way to test those parts? We are rapidly growing the team and I figure desoldering a bunch of already broken boards would be good practice before having them work on customer devices. If those removed parts have some use even better. I would love if these broken machines could help keep other older consoles running longer and stop rotting on the shelf.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/retrogamertech\"> /u/retrogamertech </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1kyd5i1/reclaimed_parts_from_broken_consoles/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1kyd5i1/reclaimed_parts_from_broken_consoles/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I stopped playing Sea of Stars because I decided I wanted to backtrack and play some old games in the genre to see how things evolved and play some of the classics I missed back in the day. </p> <p>I own the SEGA Genesis Xbox collection that was recently delisted and I thought I would start there since it has Shining Force, Shining in the Darkness(?) and Phantasy Star II, III and IV. I&#39;ve tooled around with those games for while and while I have been surprised at how much of the genre conventions were already established and how playable they are there are a few things that I really do not like and I am wondering if there are any classics that minimize/avoid these things.",

I think most of them are a significant visual improvement over the originals.</p> <p>Apparently, the PC-Engine and the Genesis use the same 512-color palette. However, even when the Genesis was new, I noticed that Genesis games generally looked less vibrant and saturated compared to other platforms. I know the Genesis can display relatively colors at once, but some Genesis exclusives can still look quite bright, colorful vivid, such as the Sonic games.</p> <p>I\u2019ve read that the Genesis&#39; video encoder may be the reason for this discrepancy. However, if this were true, Genesis games would look brighter when emulated, which they obviously do not. Is there a clear explanation for this strange phenomenon? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",

I&#39;ve been trying for months to remember an artistic education program (I think) that had hidden a game of an Apache helicopter fighting in some desert. The game appeared when you pressed the black color and put you at the controls of that formidable device, I still remember that to dodge the missiles launched by the enemy I had to fly low and then go up and then go down and repeat this maneuver until the missile was destroyed, I remember that the camera was fixed and that there was not much else.

I currently have a model 1 genesis with a 3.5 mm jack to rca for stereo sound, super nintendo, pc engine, and a sega saturn all hooked up via rgb to ypbpr adapters to the switch box. The receiver is also outputting to a splitter which is spitting out video to a crt and an ossc going to a capture card. If i have it on the input for my Sega Genesis, turning the console on or off shuts off the reciever</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/420BLAZBLUEIT\"> /u/420BLAZBLUEIT </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ky2bsi/onyko_receiver_shuts_offgoes_into_stand_by_when/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ky2bsi/onyko_receiver_shuts_offgoes_into_stand_by_when/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I believe the laser lens might be the issue, but I don&#39;t know how to repair consoles and don&#39;t trust myself to. Does anyone have any recs on where I could find someone or a place or store chain to fix it? I tried looking online in my area and couldn&#39;t find anything.
