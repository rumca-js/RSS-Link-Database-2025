Included is a technical appendix designed to provide more rigorous mathematical exploration of the framework. This post and its technical appendix were developed by me, with assistance from multiple AI language models, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Claude Sonnet 4, and Claude Opus 4, that were used as Socratic partners and drafting tools to formalize pre-existing ideas and research.
