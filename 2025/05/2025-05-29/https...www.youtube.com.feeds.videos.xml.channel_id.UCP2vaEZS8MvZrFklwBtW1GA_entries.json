        "description": "I have to connect these water supply lines to the bathroom above. I like using SharkBite Max fittings because they're fast and rated for up to 400 PSI (most homes have a PSI of 50 to 70 PSI). My first step is to cut the tubing, deburr it, and mark the depth. Then I push the PEX A up to the mark. These steps prevent water leaks and the SharkBite Max fittings are great for PEX A, PEX B, and Copper.
