I get its basic functioning (haven&#39;t dug so deep yet) and am also aware of certain repercussions. So I understand read the descriptions of packages, what applies to others may not apply to you, and things can also be set the way they were pretty quickly so don&#39;t panic.</p> <p>That said, I want to know how you folks are maintaining your devices with UAD. Like for instance after a system update maybe some deleted apps reappear. So how do you keep a track of it? Maybe export files? But wouldn&#39;t that be a manual task? Is there a way to quickly maintain the device in such situations? I don&#39;t mind plugging my phone to my PC and sit with a tool for its upkeep, but want to know how can I do this quickly and efficiently. </p> <p>I am so excited to learn what all you have to share. Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",

My degoogling journey is progressing very slowly (very slowly indeed!); ditching Google Drive will come later. I also dislike being tied into Meta but I don&#39;t see any way of ditching WhatsApp, with the whole world wedded to it for the foreseeable.</p> <p>My question: I&#39;ve just noticed that WhatsApp offers end to end encryption on its daily backup. Seems like a no-brainer, and I can&#39;t think of a way it could be problematic (for the time being, until I&#39;m fully degoogled)? But what am I missing? Is there a (privacy/security, or other) reason not to use this setting? Except for it being Google and Meta of course!</p> <p>One of the reasons I got on WhatsApp when I first heard of it was the e2ee (which was a new concept to me then), like most of us I imagine. To my shame I hadn&#39;t really thought about it with the backups.</p> <p>I&#39;d hate to be without ",
