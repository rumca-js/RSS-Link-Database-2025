Through the \"BMI Challenge,\" the association is encouraging its 110 members donate to We Are Stronger Than Censorship, an initiative cosponsored by the Independent Book Publishers Association and EveryLibrary Institute; if members raise $16,000, BMI will match that sum with its own $16,000 donation.",
