I love Android and the various Linux distros, and I even prefer Windows over macOS. It&#39;s pretty ironic and a bit sad that for the past five years as an <strong>Android developer</strong>, every job I&#39;ve taken has handed me a <strong>MacBook</strong>. Companies consider it vital for their teams to be able to compile and compare both Android and iOS apps.</p> <p>This all makes me wonder: <strong>Is there, or will there ever be, a viable legal case against Apple regarding Xcode and their macOS requirement?</strong></p> <p>It feels like they&#39;re really limiting competition and forcing developers into their ecosystem.
