I couldn&#39;t connect, so I opened the settings, and I noticed that another device was connected to my phone via Bluetooth. It didn\u2019t notify me or ask for permission\u2014it was just connected. I quickly turned off Bluetooth and then reinstalled (reset) my iPhone. So far, I haven&#39;t noticed anything suspicious.</p> <p>Could I have been hacked, had my data stolen, or had malware installed on my phone? What else can I do? Or am I overreacting?</p> <p>There was only one other person nearby on the street, but they were just walking and didn\u2019t appear to be holding anything.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mocsoklada\"> /u/mocsoklada </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1kyhnxt/unknown_bluetooth_device/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/com",
