While this provided flexibility, it led to significant inefficiencies and rising costs.\n\nBy adopting vCluster, Aussie Broadband eliminated the complexity and high costs of a VM-based Kubernetes architecture, allowing them to consolidate their infrastructure onto a single, high-performance bare-metal cluster.\n\nIn this session, Michael Norris, Platform Engineer at Aussie Broadband will discuss their journey from VMs to Bare Metal Kubernetes with Lukas Gentele, CEO LoftLabs (vCluster).",
