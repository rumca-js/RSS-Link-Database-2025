You see, I need a secondary kinda plotline which will join the principal one Some infos and/or dnis - it needs to take place in a village - after this pl, the volume will end up with a fight between the heroes and one of the main antagonist&#39;s henchmen - nothing too surnatural (like with anciens entities, my characters are still too weak for that lmao) - nothing s\u20acxual (my characters are mostly minors) - it needs to be something that will last 7-8 chapters If you want more infos, you can absolutly ask for it even tho I might not answer directly. I know I&#39;m asking for quite a lot but I need ideas and what&#39;s better than to ask fantasy lovers ? Thanks a lot to anyone who will (at least) try to help me, I might not using it here but I could save it for later.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Posi",

I would love to know people&#39;s fav songs with fantasy lyrics! </p> <p>For example, the Erlk\u00f6nig by Schubert, based on a poem by Goethe, is about a fairy king trying to steal a child from the arms of his father (this is my favorite version if you want to listen: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VdhRYMY6IEc\">https://youtu.be/VdhRYMY6IEc</a>). </p> <p>The other one that jumps to mind is the Yawning Grave by Lord Huron which is from the POV of a force of nature or nature spirit or something like that. </p> <p>So I&#39;d love to know more songs that are about a character or story that is clearly fantastical in a traditional sense, but are relatively modern songs rather than old folk songs. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CalicoSparrow\"> /u/CalicoSparrow </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kyigtn/modernish_songs_with_a_fantasy_narrative_or/\">[link",

Remember that? It was sold in a rather attractive wooden box, with the title done in wood burning.</p> <p>I gather that most serious Tolkien fans find this version a bit dodgy, but I&#39;m a pretty casual Tolkien fan myself, and God I love it. When I think of the songs in the story, it&#39;s these tunes I go back to. I suppose some of the pronunciations of the names are not the ones we&#39;re used to nowadays, and the voices for the dwarves are higher than what we&#39;d imagine, but it&#39;s charming and well acted, and it has a certain breezy quality that I find very appealing. Tolkien adaptations easily become a bit ponderous. Your mileage may vary, of course.</p> <p>Have you listened to it? What did you think?</p> <",

We\u2019ve timed this one very nicely as Written on the Dark was just released 2 days ago in Canada and the USA, and today is publication day in the UK. It\u2019ll still be new for most readers, so for those who got a ARC or read it quickly (thank you) let\u2019s be careful about spoilers, as we chat? Pour yourself a drink and let\u2019s settle in\u2026</p> <p>I\u2019m supposed to re-introduce myself. I\u2019m Guy Gavriel Kay, I\u2019m Canadian, I love Negronis, Martinis, and single malt scotch. I make puns too often and I adore good limericks and baseball. And this is my 16th novel. It has been a long run, and I feel deeply grateful to readers worldwide for that. <em>The Fionavar Tapestry</em> appeared 40+ years ago now. I\u2019m aware, more than ever these days, of being one of the lucky writers.</p> <p>This AMA is open now for questions and I\u2019ll be back here at 8 PM E",

So recently my friend was telling about this Chinese gay romance that&#39;s about a guy who transmigrates into a webnovel as a fish and has to prevent a mute prince from becoming a tyrant. In English it&#39;s called The Disabled Tyrant&#39;s Beloved Pet Fish. And I just wanted to read it, and don&#39;t regret borrowing these books from my friends. I&#39;m currently reading part 2 but dreading the day I finish part 4 because honestly I love these books. It&#39;s a slow burn (there&#39;s not even romance in the first part), and sweet as sugar with a big spoonful of humor added. So far I have had plenty of moments that I could not hold my laughter and that is one of the reasons why I love this so much, something that puts such a smile on my face is simply worth reading. It&#39;s the first time I even read a gay romance",
