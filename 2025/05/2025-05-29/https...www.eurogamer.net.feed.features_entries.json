Nvidia's Turing architecture - the RTX 20 series cards - weren't exactly well regarded at launch back in 2018 but with the RTX 2080 Ti, I'd say we're looking at fine wine at its best. Its performance today battles it out with the recently released RTX 5060, it has more memory than the new Nvidia offering and its outputs don't decline on PCIe gen 3-based PCs&hellip; because it is a PCIe gen 3 card. Despite its seven year vintage, it's still a card that outperforms the current generation consoles and even taps into some (though not all) of Nvidia's latest neural rendering technologies. This is indeed fine wine, but fine wine with a chaser, if you like.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nvidias-rtx-2080-ti-revi",

As a result, I&rsquo;ve never played a game where I spent so much of the time simply trying to work out what it&rsquo;s doing. What&rsquo;s the intent, To a T? What do you want to be? It turns out I wouldn&rsquo;t truly understand any of this until the final credits had rolled. In fact, I&rsquo;m still thinking about a lot of it. Either way, what follows isn&rsquo;t a review so much as a journey - <strong>and I&rsquo;m afraid it probably contains things you might not want spoiled. Be warned.</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/my-main-challenge-with-to-a-t-was-trying-to-work-out-what-to-a-t-actually-is\">Read more</a></p>",

Movement abilities are. It's a theory that's become a preoccupation of mine of late, and in every game, I low-key look for evidence to support it. And I think I've found some.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/movement-abilities-will-always-be-the-best-abilities-in-games\">Read more</a></p>",
