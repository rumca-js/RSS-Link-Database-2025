I love campaign games and coop games plus my partner loves stardew valley. One of the consistent complaints I have seen is that the core rule book and character rule books have a lot of errors or errata that require outside reading to fix/understand. </p> <p>This is something I really struggle with in games as I enjoy complexity but really struggle when things aren&#39;t clear or require alot of interpretation. Is there a full second printing of the game that fixes this issue amongst all the expansions? Or have the fixed this some other way? I&#39;m struggling to find a clear answer.
