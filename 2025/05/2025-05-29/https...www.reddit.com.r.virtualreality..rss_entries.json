From what I gathered on forums and reddit, I expected the 4080 to best the 7900XTX. Most tout Nvidia drivers to be better and more stable for VR, content creators like Benchmark Odysseys have found significant daylight between the two in favor of the 4080 in their VR racing tests. I was looking forward to the uplift from the 4080 and sell the XTX. It started as just a quick and dirty test using FPSVR but they were so evenly matched that I expanded the game tests and started sifting through graphs.</p> <p>System: 9800X3D, 32GB DDR5 Ram 6000mhz CL30, Windows 11, Pimax OG Crystal</p> <p>I will preface this by stating that I&#39;m just someone on reddit with no real expertise or in depth technical knowledge.

Something like F1 or VTOL VR. I was looking at the Pimax crystal light since it looks great but I\u2019ve seen a lot of people talking about the weight being an issue and it looking fairly fragile. </p> <p>Any and all help is appreciated </p> <p>TL;DR: Looki",
