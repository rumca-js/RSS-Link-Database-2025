        "description": "<p>While we're still waiting for a true electric minivan to hit the US, VW's ID.Buzz microbus is close. It's a unique family hauler that'll definitely get your neighbors buzzing. No, seriously, during my week of testing I had over a dozen conversations with strangers who were fascinated by the ID.Buzz. One of my neighbors stopped their car dramatically when they saw it, backed up, and just had to give me a thumbs up and praise it as \"cool as hell.\"</p> \n<p>My kids were similarly enamored, they loved its cute design and enormous interior space. In many ways, it's the family EV I've been dreaming of \u2014 something that could comfortably seat seven people and carry tons of cargo for road trips. Unfortunately, its high $60,000 starting price and relatively lackluster 234 mile range hold it back from true greatness.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"a686a791978d4e1d9524e79eb07d79c7\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.vw.com/en/models/id-bu",
