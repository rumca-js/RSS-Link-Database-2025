Feeling doomed due to being alone, wanting other humans, looking for other tribes (exploring planet, both our own and other). </p> <p>A more formal way to explain this would be a book which discusses sociology through the lenses of tribalism and the idea of neotribalism.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So pretty much the title, I just have read so many fantasy books tat base around like the straight couple and lesbian ones never seem to come up on tiktok that much. I have like 40 books that are all fantasy but are just missing the romance part that I want as a lesbian. I started writing a book as well because I kinda just got sick of not seeing anything so I decided to make one but also now I want to get back into reading, any sort of genre is fine but I tend to lean more towards fantasy. And maybe any sort of book about young women kinda trying to figure it all out and sort of just like lost in the world, real romanticised sort of thing. The quiet sadness, realness. Hope that makes sense.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JackfruitMotor4996\"> /u/JackfruitMotor4996 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ky7zg5/lesbian_book_recommendations/\">[link]</a></span> &",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone, I recently came across a lesser-known indie novel that honestly surprised me with how deeply it resonated. It\u2019s called Fragments of Reality by M. Oce. The book follows a woman who wakes up with no memory of who she is or why voices keep speaking to her. Told in fragmented, dreamlike chapters, it slowly unpacks dissociation, memory loss, and psychological healing.</p> <p>There\u2019s no romance subplot or fast-paced drama\u2014just a raw, quiet unraveling of trauma and self-discovery that I found really moving. It made me wonder:</p> <p>Do you know any other books with this kind of introspective, emotionally layered tone? Something that leans more literary or psychological fiction, preferably without romance?</p> <p>Open to any suggestions! And if anyone\u2019s looking for something reflective and haunting, I genuinely recommend checking this one out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Distinct_Mastodo",

It\u2019s called <strong>Skies we Buried</strong> and it follows a kid named Maverick trying to rebuild after the world collapses but not in a clich\u00e9 way. There\u2019s real heart in it. The setting is brutal but gorgeous, and the story hits this perfect balance between survival, sci-fi, and adventure. The writing reminds me of early <em>Wool</em> or even <em>The Martian Chronicles</em> in places. If this gets a full release, I can see it blowing up.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Electronic_Ad9158\"> /u/Electronic_Ad9158 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kxz75m/great_new_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kxz75m/great_new_book/\">[comments]</a></span>",
