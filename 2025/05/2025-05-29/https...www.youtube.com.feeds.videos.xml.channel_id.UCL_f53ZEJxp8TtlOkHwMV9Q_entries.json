        "description": "Is our planet doomed? Probably not, it turns out. Dr. Jordan B. Peterson joins geologist Scott Tinker to dismantle the myth of energy scarcity, exposing the flawed narratives that demonize coal, oil, and natural gas. Together, they reject the false binary of renewables versus fossil fuels, arguing instead for an abundant future powered by both. This conversation confronts the culture of fear that paralyzes progress and issues a stark warning: if the West continues to undermine its own energy and technological ambitions in service of an ideological green agenda, it risks ceding global leadership to authoritarian regimes like China. Innovation, prosperity, and freedom depend on confronting reality\u2014not retreating from it.\n\nThis episode was filmed on May 23rd, 2025.\n\nUnlock the ad-free experience of The Jordan B.
