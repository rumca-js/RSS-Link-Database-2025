I shared educational content to attract followers as it goes well on X and case studies to attract clients (in form of short stories with links to my blogs and use cases). One month later I ended up with 2 clients. Both paid initial set up fees and are paying monthly maintenance fees ($49/per month).</p> <p>I decided I want to scale the business so I set up n8n workflows to work for me, all in form of Telegram messages, so here is the flow:</p> <ul> <li>",

So I built an AI script that scrapes listings from 70k+ corporate websites.</p> <p>Then I wrote an ML matching script that filters only the jobs most aligned with your CV, you can try it <a href=\"https://laboro.co\">here</a> (totally for free). </p> <p>Last step: I built an AI Agent that can auto-apply to these jobs. In theory, I could apply to 1M roles with a single click.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t done it (yet)\u2026 but I\u2019m genuinely considering it.</p> <p>What do you think would happen if I actually applied to a million jobs at once?</p> <p>It could be chaotic , maybe even a bit destructive, but honestly, it might also be the best publicity stunt ever for me and my programming skills.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Separate-Breath2267\"> /u/Separate-Breath2267 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",
