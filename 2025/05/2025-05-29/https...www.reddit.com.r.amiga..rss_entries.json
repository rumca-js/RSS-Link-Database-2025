It also has some common improvements built in, like support for PS/2 mice and keyboards, up to 4MB ROMs, up to 112MB motherboard fast RAM, support for PC floppy drives, ATX power supply support (including pushbutton power switch), VGA connector for RGB output and 3.5mm audio out jack.</p> <p>It&#39;s been a fun built so far.

Maybe I\u2019m just dumb and can\u2019t figure it out but Has anyone managed to get this game running or know of a working adf version or something? Would really appreciate and help or advise.
