It\u2019s about a woman in her fifties trying to start over, struggling with romantic relationships. Alongside that, it tells the story of her childhood growing up with a mother who rarely showed affection and often abandoned her. Obvisously there&#39;s a connection between the two.</p> <p>The movie includes some flashbacks that I found succeeded in capturing the emotions of the child she was and how those early wounds still shape her adult life. It really struck a chord with me, as I have a complicated relationship with my own mother.</p> <p>But as usual, by the end of the movie, her mother, through one final gift after her death, somehow manages to mend some of the pain she&#39;s been carrying. This leads to a kind of posthumous forgiveness that not only brings healing in the present but, as the movie puts it, also transforms the past. I like part of the message ",
