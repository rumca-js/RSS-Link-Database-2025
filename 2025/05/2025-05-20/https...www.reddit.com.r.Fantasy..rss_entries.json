I believe this was the earth book. </p> <p>The third or fourth book I believe was fire, with a male protagonist and lives in a realm thats incredibly hot and has very little water. </p> <p>The second book I believe was water with a female protagonist (but I might be confusing this with the Air book). </p> <p>That\u2019s all I got.

I wanted to open a discussion that&#39;s both curious and a bit cathartic: what fantasy books have been particularly hard for you to get through? Which ones disappointed you the most or felt like a real slog?</p> <p>In my case, I&#39;ve had a few frustrating experiences with some very popular authors. George R. R. Martin, for instance, became unbearable for me starting with the fourth book of A Song of Ice and Fire. The series ended up feeling completely aimless to me\u2014like a house of cards that collapses under its own weight.</p> <p>I also struggled with The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss. I only read the first book and couldn&#39;t go on; it felt too clich\u00e9 and hollow. The Magician\u2019s Apprentice by Trudi Canavan might have been the single most boring book I\u2019ve ever read in my life. And as for Brandon Sanderson\u2019s Mistborn trilogy, it started with an original premise, but by the end it felt pretty generic and underwhelming to me.</p> ",
