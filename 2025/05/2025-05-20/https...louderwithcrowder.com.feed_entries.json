A Cuban guy, only a little older than me, whom I had seen on the internets. He was the main reason I went to the CPAC in 2009.

Chris Van Hollen, back from being overseas and sharing daiquiris with illegal immigrant gang members, is a prime example of why. Seriously. Go get yourself a Diet Dr. Pepper from the fridge and enjoy the next 4:12 minutes. It starts with Van Hollen saying he regrets voting for Rubio as Secretary of State. It ends with Rubio going beast mode on USAID cuts and his desire to deport even more anti-American illegals.</p",
