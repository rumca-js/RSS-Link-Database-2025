Support my work: https://www.patreon.com/thehatedone \n\nIn this essay, I want to argue that you should not feel sorry for pirating from a media conglomerate, or a big tech streaming service, or a giant game publisher. And not only should you not feel sorry, you should feel proud to do it. Even if piracy is illegal, it as an act of rebellion so important doing it is your moral and civil duty. \n\nI want to reveal to you that copyright is not about protection of authors and artists. That used to be its original idea in the 18th century but today, copyright serves a much greater agenda at the behest of giant publishing corporations. What is that agenda? And how does copyright harm your ability to own anything at all? And should you always feel good about pirating? I\u2019ll answer all of this and provide my long term solutions to this problem that I think you\u2019ll want to hear. \n\nThis is a topic that will get this video suppressed by Y",
