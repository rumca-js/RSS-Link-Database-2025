        "description": "Sponsor: Thermaltake TR100 mini-ITX Travel Case on Amazon https://geni.us/Yn9DXb\nThermalright's CPU coolers at Computex 2025 continue to take the strategy of absolutely overwhelming the market with a crazy amount of coolers at cheaper prices, but the company has something new: It's also making its first Thermalright Case, the TR M10 MATX case. It's also experimenting with fans of all kinds, ranging from high-end all-LCP and metal fans to more modest PPT fans. The company also unveiled a number of new AIOs / closed-loop liquid coolers. We'll review these as they come out, but for now, this video will recap the news while also getting our first interview with the Thermalright CEO on camera (although brief).\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
