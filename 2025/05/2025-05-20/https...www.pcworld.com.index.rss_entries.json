Why? Because I live in a Brooklyn brownstone rental, and while I\u2019m lucky enough to have a backyard, there\u2019s no power or wireless connectivity out there.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whenever I get offers to test outdoor lights from Philips Hue, Enbrighten, or other smart lighting manufacturers, I usually pass them off to other writers. But not this time.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nanoleaf\u2019s new Solar Garden Lights are, strictly speaking, not so smart. Unlike Nanoleaf\u2019s other lights, the Solar Garden Lights don\u2019t connect to a network via Wi-Fi or Thread, and while they can be put on timers or run on sunrise/sunset schedules, all those processes must be configured on a remote control, not the Nanoleaf app.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s disappointing for those with outdoor setups that include power outlets and wireless connec",
