In my field, we tend to talk about &quot;coordination&quot; and this term tends to mean that people do things together to achieve a shared goal. However, coordination can also occur between parties with opposing goals\u2014this happens frequently in scams whereby scammers present themselves as collaborators (e.g., helping to &quot;fix&quot; a compromised bank account), but their true objectives diverge sharply from those of the person they are targeting. I feel like this dynamic is well-documented in social engineering, which is why I turned to this particular subreddit. </p> <p>To elaborate on this idea, I\u2019m conducting a study on digital interactions involving older adults and online scams. I\u2019m looking to speak with individuals who may have previous experience or familiarity with the processes, techniques, ",

I&#39;m not very computer-literate and my relationship with my uncle isn&#39;t that close (or trusting), so I&#39;m not 100% comfortable with this. He insists it&#39;s easy to setup and it won&#39;t impact my internet connection at all or cost me anything extra.</p> <p>Is it really necessary to attach a WiFi hub to my router for something like this and what can happen if he gets my router&#39;s password?
