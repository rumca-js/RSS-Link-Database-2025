Then I moved and didn&#39;t have enough space for it, so it went in a box until now. </p> <p>I&#39;m finally able to use it again, but I&#39;m almost a decade behind on VR development. Is it still powerful enough for today&#39;s games? Do any rely on newer features, or can you not see important details with the lower resolution? I remember reading text in a web browser was hard. I just ordered a pair of prescription lenses that also claim to improve FoV, are there any other useful mods?

What brands typically have the best graphics nowadays? Do headsets come with their own inbuilt headphones, cause I\u2019d rather use my DT990s, so I don\u2019t want to accidentally get one that I can\u2019t wear headphones over. Also, can you keep battery fed ones plugged in the duration of use? A lot of the meta quest ones seem to have a battery life of only a few hours and I\u2019d rather they don\u2019t die constantly while I\u2019m trying to game or watch movies or whatever. Mostly interested in games like beatsaber, Pavlov, etc and watching nature documentaries while I trip balls, so good graphics would be preferred. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kerosenedreaming\"> /u/kerosenedreaming </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
