I struggled for the life of me to try to get any SD card library to work with my Pico 2, only to discover, the reason is that they were all written for the 2040 processor and that I have the 2350 processor. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? I like the performance of my 2350 for the purposes of floating point arithmetic so I would prefer not to use a 2040 for the project. Not sure if there&#39;s a way I can just slightly alter the old libraries or if someone has found a newer library.

I am using raspberry pi 5 with i2s mems sphy0645 but the problem that sound is too low. I have to speak directly to the mic to recognize voice. </p> <p>I need the range to recognize the voice of a person from the arm level (imagine the mic is on the table and the speaker is standing up).</p> <p>I tried usb mic but there was alot of background noise. I had to lower alsamixer but still noise is there altho the mic works fine in my computer. Someone said to me that the reason due to not have powered usb hub. But it&#39;s expensive already to have it.</p> <p>I am thinking to use Bluetooth earbuds but I don&#39;t know how this can work with the pi.</p> <p>Can you please give me any recommendations to enhance those mics or what should I get?
