        "description": "Blades of Fire is a new action RPG, and it\u2019s a well polished game brimming with interesting ideas and new mechanics. Top of that list of unique mechanics is the forging process. You fully develop and create the weapons you use in this game, and it impacts gameplay in wonderful ways. \n\nThough, if you\u2019re not fond of weapon durability, be warned, weapons do break. It\u2019s not frequent but it happens. Besides just forging weapons, you\u2019re fighting enemies using four directional attacks. The protagonist, Aran, can also sharpen his blade at the cost of durability, further giving him an edge in a fight. \n\nThe level design is open-ended but not truly open-world. And there\u2019s even a tried-and-true Souls like bonfire system here with the anvils scattered across the map. Blades of Fire releases on May 22nd on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.",

        "description": "It took a little over nine months for Bungie to land in another cluster of increasingly awful proportions. Eight, if you count the month that Marathon, its upcoming extraction shooter, was revealed, promising a whopping three maps, six playable characters, and a yet-to-be-revealed price tag. You would think the company would become more stable after eliminating 220 roles in August 2024, or at least keep its head down and not make any more poor decisions to drag itself in the public light.\n\nYet, here we are, with Marathon art director Joseph Cross apologizing on a recent livestream for the game using assets taken from an independent artist in-game without her permission. He said there was \u201cabsolutely no excuse for this oversight\u201d and the team is \u201c100 percent committed\u201d to its review process to ensure this won't happen again, both for Marathon and at Bungie.",
