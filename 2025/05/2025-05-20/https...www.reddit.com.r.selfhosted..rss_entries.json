I&#39;m happy to say I finally pulled the trigger and joined the Self-Hosted family after being extremely frustrated with the alternatives. I&#39;ve got my Jellyfin and Arr stack all set up and fully automated, and I&#39;ve been spending hours upon hours trying to find ways to improve it and it&#39;s been a super fun project to dive into.</p> <p>That being said, one of the next improvements I wanted to make required me to go look at the specs of my machine to figure out the best setup. I guess this post will be a 2-part advice request.</p> <p>My confusion starts here. I bought a Beelink S13 Mini PC with 500GB SSD, 16GB RAM, with the N150 CPU, a decision I made after hours of research and many recommendations from Reddit, including this sub, so thank you! Anyways, I wanted to add a second M.2 SSD and went to find the specs for my pc.... Now I don&#39;t even know what I bought, and let me elaborate.<br/> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/",

This seems to work ok, but one major flaw I see is one of my VM&#39;s is running docker and it has 10 or so docker containers running within that VM. If I had an issue with a single application on that machine the only way I am able to recover is by restoring the whole VM from backup. This obviously could potentially be an issue because I would roll back applications without needing to. </p> <p>Another thing I am struggling with is I currently have a few SMB shares on TrueNAS that Me and my family connect to if we want to have files/pictures stored in a safe location.

I&#39;ve been interested in the concept of having websites, or web-services, that can be hosted by many individuals at once. (Do note that I understand why this isn&#39;t trivial, but I&#39;m assuming that there *has* to be something that exists already for doing this because there&#39;s no way I&#39;m the first person to want this). I&#39;m looking for the kind of framework where someone can contribute to the project simply by spinning up a docker container or vm on their existing server, and allocate whatever resources or bandwidth they&#39;re willing so that a website can be hosted somewhat stably without a single person needing to host everything themselves. There&#39;s probably several ways to do this but, what&#39;s the best/right way?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spicymayo",

Decided to invest the money to upgrade from my ISP provided router to a Firewalla Gold SE(this compulsive need to improve your setup feel relatable?). Got the Firewalla added to the mix, but now I can only connect to my Pangolin services for the first 2-3 minutes after starting the docker container on my local machine. After that I lose connection in the browser. My hunch is the Firewalla is finding the tunnel and killing the traffic. I didn&#39;t have to do any setup on my old router for Pangolin so didn&#39;t instinctively think about what configs might be relevant for the Firewalla given it attempts to block intrusion. Has anyone set up Pangolin on a home network running a Firewalla? What steps did you take to allow the Pangolin tunnel?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Flashmobshortsqueeze\"> /",

Each PC has great (ram 64gb+ cpu intel 12/24 cores) specs and gpu&#39;s like 4070/80/90. Whenever we would need another processing unit we would just buy another pc and put it with the others, on a big pallet with all of them basically piled up. We&#39;re asking ourselves if there is a better way to do this. Maybe via a dedicated server with some intense processing power that runs multiple VMs? This should be a nice scalable option I guess. I just want to know if this is the way to go or if there are other options we can explore. Of course cloud processing would be an option but seems like it can get really expensive really fast. Of course the same goes for buying a dedicated server, but running everything in house is something we would prefer.</p> <p>Hopefully someone knows what the best course of action is.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br/> HJ</",

I bought a VPS 3 days ago and I can&#39;t stop looking for services to put through Pangolin.</p> <p>As someone who&#39;s been self-hosting for roughly 3 years now, I&#39;ve become obsessed with making everything I host remotely connectable. For awhile, it was solely done through Tailscale. I had it on my phone, my girlfriend&#39;s phone, my friends&#39; phones, my parent&#39;s phones. (All on my account too LOL.)</p> <p>Now, Pangolin&#39;s just made life so much easier. I moved &amp; now am stuck behind what seems to be a double-NAT configuration, which I don&#39;t know how to fix, and hardly know anything about, so now that I can finally make my services publicly accessible WITHOUT the headache of trying to understand my janky networking, I just feel good.</p> <p>P.S: Sorry if this doesn&#39;t really belong in this sub, I just wanted to share how amazing Pangolin has been for me, and hopefully bring more users to this lovely r",
