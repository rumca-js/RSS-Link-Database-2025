Without The Internet, I Wouldn't Know What's Going On!\" /></p>On this edition of HEY DT:<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:19 Why not have a look at Nobara?<br />1:32 You showed how to swap out sudo with doas, but you didn't tell us why we should do this. <br />3:22 Am I you or are you me?<br />4:43 Have you considered hooking into the tail end of archinstall and applying all your non-installation configurations at the end?<br />7:31 I am very glad to hear your plan to create a \"video man pages\" project.<br />9:17 Absolutely love this! Would be great if you also add an option for Artix linux repos to turn DTOS to an artix-based distro as well.<br />11:49 Without the news, I wouldn't know what's really going on.<br />15:57 I agree we need to reduce doomscrolling but I think the opposite is as dangerous when people have NO idea what's going on the world.<br />24:34 Thanks to Patrons<br /><br />W",
