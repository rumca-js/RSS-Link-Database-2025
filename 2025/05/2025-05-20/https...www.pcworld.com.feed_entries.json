Right now, Acer\u2014by way of eBay\u2014is selling a refurbished Aspire 15.6-inch laptop with 16GB of RAM, a touchscreen display, and an AMD Ryzen 5 processor <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/266875723246\">for just $287.99</a>. For a laptop that\u2019s normally $500 retail, that\u2019s a certified banger of a deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is definitely a budget design, so keep your expectations in check. The Aspire 3 has a plastic body and its 15-inch screen isn\u2019t going to impress anyone, even if the touch panel is an impressive find at this price point. With 53 watt-hours of battery, this laptop won\u2019t be a longevity champion either. But even with these specs, it\u2019s actually much better-equipped than the model <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1989517/acer-aspire-3-review.html\">we tested and reviewed back in 202",
