Because i think my GPU is triggering the PSU overdraw protection, and my computer resets mid gameplay.

I&#39;ve been using Linux mint for about 2 months now and it&#39;s been fantastic. I rly enjoy Linux and want to keep it as my main OS. The problem is certain games I miss being able to play on windows. So this is sort of an opinion based question that will hopefully be informative for other new users who come across this same problem.</p> <p>For games that can&#39;t be played on Linux is it more efficient to use a virtual machine, or dualboot?</p> <p>I&#39;ve watched some tutorials and setting up a virtual machine seems abit intimidating for someone without much experience. I&#39;m not really sure of the pros and cons of using a VM for gaming vs dualbooting.

Both copies of Titanfall 2 were installed on SSDs. I&#39;ve tried several different Proton versions. Not sure what the issue could be. The lag/low framerate is very prominent right after the beginning neural link scene during the beginning of the tutorial. Any help in getting to the bottom of this issue would be very much appreciated as this is incredibly frustrating. If anyone could also confirm/replicate the framerate issue (especially at the beginning of the tutorial after the neural link) that would also be appreciated.
