Motivated by the increasing success of recovering input data from the gradients of classical models, this study investigates the analogous challenge for variational quantum circuits (VQC) as quantum machine learning models. We highlight the crucial role of the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) in determining privacy vulnerabilities. While the DLA has been linked to the trainability and simulatability of VQC models, we establish its connection to privacy for the first time. We show that properties conducive to VQC trainability, such as a polynomial-sized DLA, also facilitate extracting detailed snapshots of the input, posing a weak privacy breach. We further investigate conditions for a strong privacy breach, where original input data can be recovered from snapshots by class",

Let\u2019s examine each of these points one by one.</p> <p>First and foremost, AI cannot, will not, and will never replace humans. Why? Because AI fundamentally requires guidance and is not autonomous. If you instruct AI to \u201cwrite,\u201d it won\u2019t generate anything unless you provide context. It won\u2019t create a novel, a speech, a report, or even a sentence without direction. AI doesn\u2019t comprehend the purpose behind the prompt; it reacts to structured input. For instance, if you say \u201ccode,\u201d it won\u2019t randomly generate a program. It needs a goal: what language, what purpose, and what is it coding for? Without instruction, AI is powerless. It\u2019s a system, not a mind, and like any system, it functions without someone to operate it.</p> <p>Secondl",
