A dragster, motorcycle, F1 type, and various others I can\u2019t quite remember. They all handled wildly different, dragster fast but couldn\u2019t turn, motorcycle had large turning circle\u2026. I think I got my copy from a compilation pack. </p> <p>Thanks in advance </p> <p>SOLVED by OoT-TheBest; Super Grand Prix.
