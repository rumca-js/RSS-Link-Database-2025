Young cricketers Abhishek Sharma and Digvesh Rathi engaged in a confrontation after Rathi dismissed Sharma. BCCI Vice-President Rajeev Shukla intervened, mediating a reconciliation between the two players. Abhishek, despite not reaching his peak performance in IPL 2025, has maintained better batting statistics compared to his SRH teammates. He aims to finish strong in the team's final two matches of the season.",
