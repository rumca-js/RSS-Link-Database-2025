However, I\u2019ve noticed there\u2019s a strong tendency among my teammates to leave lots of comments and suggestions, not just on my PRs but on each other\u2019s as well. It almost feels like there&#39;s an unspoken competition to provide feedback.</p> <p>On top of that, during our sprint retrospectives, we track the number of PRs that had no comments as a kind of productivity metric \u2014 the fewer untouched PRs, the better, supposedly.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure how to feel about this. On one hand, feedback is valuable. On the other, it sometimes feels like nitpicking for the sake of leaving a mark.</p> <p>Have any of you experienced something similar? How does your team approach PR feedback and metrics? Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Miserable-Fill8551\"> /u/Misera",
