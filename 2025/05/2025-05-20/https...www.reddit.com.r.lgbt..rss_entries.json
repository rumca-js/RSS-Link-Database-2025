I\u2019m just worried about respecting the spaces and the people who go there, and I don\u2019t want to make anyone uncomfy by being some kind of interloper, so I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has thoughts on such a scenario, and whether a boyfriend of a bisexual woman would be a disruption of the vibe.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TangerineChickens\"> /u/TangerineChickens </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1krgcuo/going_to_gay_bars_as_a_straight_guy/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1krgcuo/going_to_gay_bars_as_a_strai",

I hasten\u2014 O, how I hasten, to point out none of this bullshit came from Rockstar.

They take GREAT anticipation of this.</p> <p>So I wrote a post wondering why Reddit would allow these comments, if similar fantasies about shooting all the black or women NPCs would have been insta-banned. And hoo boy, did the Phobe Phone ring off the hook!</p> <p>I actually got some reasoned, even sympathetic comments.

I wasn\u2019t expecting it at all, she brought it up gently, said she\u2019s been curious about it, and that she thinks it might be fun to explore. I\u2019m not against it, but I\u2019ve never tried anything like that before, and I\u2019m trying to understand what it means for her, or what it might feel like for me.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts where people say they love strapping or being strapped, and I guess I\u2019m just wondering\u2026 what exactly does it do for you? Not just physically, but emotionally or mentally. Like, if you\u2019re the one wearing it, what\u2019s going through your head? Does it make you feel powerful, connected, masculine, dominant, sensual, or just like\u2026 hot?
