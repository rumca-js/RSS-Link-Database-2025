Narrated by Nick Maillet.\n\nWhere the weakest Disney remakes feel like they\u2019re parroting the original without capturing any of their genuine emotion, Lilo & Stitch retains and often amplifies the most stirring aspects of the rightfully beloved animated film. Director Dean Fleischer Camp and screenwriters Chris Kekaniokalani Bright and Mike Van Wae understand that the innate joy and humor of the mischievous Stitch work just fine (and can still sell plenty of merch) in support of a story about an alien chaos agent falling into the laps of two grieving sisters and helping them figure out their next step together. All of which is to say, yeah, it made us cry.\n\n#LiloAndStitch #Movies #IGN",

Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.\n\n\"In its best moments, Deliver At All Costs is as entertaining as it is uneven. For every truly creative cargo haul twist there\u2019s another that\u2019s uninspired or lacking in intensity and urgency, and although there\u2019s certainly fun to be had crashing through its many structures like a bully through a sand castle, the novelty wears off long before it ends all you\u2019re left with is an impressively realised 1950s world with depressingly little else to do in it. Throw in a silly, slapdash story and some toys for your truck you\u2019re largely forbidden from playing with, and Deliver At All Costs is one shipment that\u2019s far from the complete package.\"",

        "description": "The anthology story follows three of the fiercest warriors in human history: a Viking raider guiding her young son on a bloody quest for revenge, a ninja in feudal Japan who turns against his Samurai brother in a brutal battle for succession, and a WWII pilot who takes to the sky to investigate an otherworldly threat to the Allied cause. But while all these warriors are killers in their own right, they are merely prey for their new opponent \u2013 the ultimate killer of killers.",
