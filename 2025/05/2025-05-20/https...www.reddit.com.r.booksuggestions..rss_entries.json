When I search for similar books I often get recommendation of Narnia (Which I&#39;ve read and loved) and LOTR which has too complex of a worldbuilding for me to fully get into it (with exams looming). </p> <p>I want something that is lighthearted at first, with an easier grasp of the worldbuilding. I do not want Fantasy book that are based on female main character being very strong and very capable who take down full armys (nothing wrong with that - just not my taste). I also do not like books where alot of people die and stakes are extremely high (in the first book). I want something that builds and things are slowly introduced. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mean-C",

But I\u2019m open to anything interesting. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Adventurous-Ad8397\"> /u/Adventurous-Ad8397 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kr4rx2/audiobook_recs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kr4rx2/audiobook_recs/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Basically I&#39;m in my early 20&#39;s, and since a couple of years ago I&#39;ve realized that I have not lived my life to the fullest. I sometimes compare myself to other people my age and they seem to have experienced much more in life than me: intimate relationships, friendship, socializing, going to college, going out. So since I don&#39;t have the good social skills to put myself out there, or a good/stable economic situation to help distract myself. I&#39;ve decided to turn to books which I think will open my mind and will help me experience different situation through someone else&#39;s fictional or maybe real life. Do you think it would be beneficial to me?? Sometimes I think I would be living life through someone else and it makes me a little sad but I don&#39;t know what else to do. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#",

I feel like I missed a whole chunk of important thinking\u2014stuff about purpose, meaning, how to approach life intelligently, and how to deal with the chaos of it all. I\u2019m not much of a reader but definitely think I need to start to help me figure things out.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for book recommendations that can help me think more clearly about life\u2014things that explore philosophy (old or modern), how to find direction, and how to approach life with some kind of mindset or framework that makes sense.</p> <p>Not really looking for super emotional self-help or productivity hacks. More like real, thoughtful books that help you understand how to live better and think deeper.</p> <p>Open to classics, modern takes, or anything in between. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",
