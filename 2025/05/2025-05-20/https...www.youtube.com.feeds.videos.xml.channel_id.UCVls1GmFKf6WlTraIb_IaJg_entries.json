Would be great if you also add an option for Artix linux repos to turn DTOS to an artix-based distro as well.\n11:49 Without the news, I wouldn't know what's really going on.\n15:57 I agree we need to reduce doomscrolling but I think the opposite is as dangerous when people have NO idea what's going on the world.\n24:34 Thanks to Patrons\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n\ud83d\udcb0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n\ud83d\udcb3 Paypal: https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=channel_banner&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazNocEhiaGFBT1l1MnRHbnlIcHFKbXJWVnpQd3xBQ3Jtc0tsLVZJc19YeFlwZ2Jqb",
