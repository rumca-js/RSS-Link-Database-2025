I played it once with some friends a while back and can\u2019t find it anywhere. </p> <p>It\u2019s a category game where each person within the time limit writes down as many items that fit the category (to their own imagination sometimes). Then after the time is up each person goes around picking what they think is their most unique answer saying it aloud. If another player has that answer they say so and the person who called it out gets a point. So on and so forth. The goal is to have as few points as possible after \u2018X\u2019 amounts of rounds. </p> <p>Somewhat like scategories but I know it\u2019s not that.
