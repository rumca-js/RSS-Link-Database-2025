Best observed in May, M63 is visible between the stars Arcturus and Dubhe. This celestial beauty lies 27 million light-years away, and Brecher\u2019s efforts offer a mesmerizing view into deep space from right here on Earth.",

Named after the Japanese monster Mothra, this ancient radiodont had a highly segmented body and unusually long gills on its rear, possibly adapted for breathing in low-oxygen environments. It also featured a mysterious third eye, thought to aid in navigation. The find highlights unexpected diversity among early arthropods and offers critical insights into the evolutionary traits that led to modern invertebrates like insects, crustaceans, and arachnids.",
