There's also a bonus tutorial on painting Sekhetar Robots at the end.  </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/05/showcase-thousand-sons-sekhetar-robots-inc-painting-guides/\">Showcase: Thousand Sons Sekhetar Robots (inc. painting guides)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
