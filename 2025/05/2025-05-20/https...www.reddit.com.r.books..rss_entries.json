I tried The Way of Kings (ambitious I know), but the dialogue was awful. Shallan was written like she has this top-tier humor and wit, but what she said were corny dad jokes. I tried Mistborn but again the dialogue and characters weren\u2019t interesting or awkward for me. </p> <p>I was reading Martyr! by Kaveh Akbar, and while I really enjoyed the first 200 pages, I noticed I lost motivation finishing the book because the constant PO",

Where Reasons End is about an imagined conversation between a mother and her 16 year old son after his suicide.</p> <p>I felt that there were lots of emotional passages but lack of vulnerability. I feel for the author, but this book is too polished. The title is called &#39;Where Reasons End&#39; but the book undermines its thematic core \u2014it focuses so much on rationalization and seeking to understand the irrational.

The author&#39;s apparent perfectionism conflicts with the core of what it means to be vulnerable. Perfectionism sets a standard that denies the humanity that vulnerability embraces.</p> <p>Has anyone",
