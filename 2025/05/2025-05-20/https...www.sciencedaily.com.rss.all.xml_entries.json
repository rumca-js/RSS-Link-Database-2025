Scientists have now discovered that in certain materials it is not only preserved but can even be actively controlled. This is due to a property of the crystal structure called chirality, which also influences many other processes in nature. The discovery has the potential to lead to a new class of electronic components capable of transmitting information with exceptional robustness and energy efficiency.",

After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, scientists can now finally see how shark cartilage works at the nanoscale -- and learn from them.",

In this case, the solar cells are installed in spaces used for agriculture -- such as on pastures or as a canopy over grapevines.
