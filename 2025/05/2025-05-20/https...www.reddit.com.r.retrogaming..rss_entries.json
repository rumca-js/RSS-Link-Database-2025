However, the price for the case + manual for a lot of these games is almost equal to the price of the game itself, if not more, and it would honestly be more worth it to just buy a 2nd copy of each game Complete In Box and then sell the discs from the binder. But that&#39;s a huge pain to do for 200+ games, so I am thinking of getting reproduction cases for all of them.</p> <p>Tldr; I want to bulk order reproduction cases (no manual needed but would be cool I guess) for 200+ games, mostly PS2 and Xbox.

It was only a demo version, but we were absolutely hooked in it.</p> <p>The game was for pc and it was first person RPG (maybe with multiple characters). I think location was some kind of city, there were enemies like wasps, gnolls, and maybe mimics and &quot;minx&quot; or &quot;jinx&quot; or something. It was possible to buy a castle for yourself, which was awesome. </p> <p>I&#39;ve tried to search with these pieces of information I can recall, but haven&#39;t found anything familiar. Does this description ring any bells?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/These_Suit_1593\"> /u/These_Suit_1593 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1kqz64w/searching_for_rpg_from_the_past/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1kqz64w/searching_",
