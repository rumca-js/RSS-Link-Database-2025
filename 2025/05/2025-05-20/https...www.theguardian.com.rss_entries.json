If the 2024-25 Premier League season has faced accusations of featuring far too little jeopardy, the result here mattered little but will be remembered for ever as the night Crystal Palace brought the FA Cup home to south London.</p><p>For the record, Palace celebrated a win via two goals from Eddie Nketiah, a deflected free-kick and a late, glorious Eberechi Eze strike. In truth, the main event did not arrive until after full time with the end of Selhurst Park\u2019s 101-year wait to show off a major trophy to fans. Eagles supporters can now dream of next season\u2019s European tour, with the hope and expectation the precise but emotionally charged leadership of Oliver Glasner will lead them into that promised land.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/20/crystal-palace-wolves-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",
