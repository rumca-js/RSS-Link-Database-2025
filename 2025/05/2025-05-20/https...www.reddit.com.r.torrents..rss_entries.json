        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>if this was true wouldnt the industry have been ruined a long time ago from in theater bootlegs and whatever the first torrent site was? i was just wondering this since torrent is so frowned upon despite the fact that it has made movies that are not available on legal platforms available on a site that has more accessability world wide. why does it get demonoized eventhough its the only source to access tv shows, games, movies and such that may not be otherwise available to you? I understand the theory of &quot;if everyone did this then the industry would cease to exist&quot; but not everyone does as many are still willing to pay theater prices, wont cut the cable cord, and have several streaming service accounts.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Forward-Fishing-9498\"> /u/Forward-Fishing-9498 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1krhtsg/why_do_people_think_torrent_wi",
