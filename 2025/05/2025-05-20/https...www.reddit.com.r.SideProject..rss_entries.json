We\u2019ve been building Switchpoint AI, a framework for reducing LLM inference costs while maintaining SOTA-level output quality. It works by orchestrating multiple providers (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Qwen, Gemini, etc.) and models (both open and proprietary) in an orchestration based on cost, latency, and quality thresholds. It is available through a unified, OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. For bigger customers ($50+), we offer even more features like custom routing logic, and configurable fallbacks between models based on confidence or model failure.</p> <p>We\u2019re offering a tiny amount in free credits for those who are interested in trying and reach out, but for members of this community, if you DM this account, we\u2019ll increase that to $2.50 in free credits and match up to $100 in credits after your first purchase.</p> <p>More at: <a href=\"https://www.switchpoint.dev/\">https://www.switchpoint.dev/</a><br/> Happy to answer technical questions or g",

I wanted something that\u2019s dead simple to use, even for non-techy folks, and has a free basic version to mess around with.</p> <p>Basically, it\u2019s all about keeping your data yours. Unlike ChatGPT, where your prompts might ping servers halfway across the globe, CogniSelect runs everything on your device. Nothing gets sent out, and once you download a model, you can even use it offline, as much as you want. No limits, no subscriptions breathing down your neck :D</p> <p>I\u2019ve got a demo set up on the site if you wanna give it a spin. It\u2019s already integrated into landing page website (Where you can also click on demo and get to know more!), so you can see how it feels",

All the films are hand-picked, and some of them are pretty tricky!</p> <p>If it feels too tough, there\u2019s also an easier version with films from 1990 to today:<br/> \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://easy.monerdle.com\">easy.monerdle.com</a></p> <p>I\u2019m going to keep working on this project \u2014 both in terms of content (new movies, new features maybe) and also from an SEO/marketing angle",

This is a simple accountability service for people with ADHD, burnout, or chronic procrastination. If you\u2019ve ever rewritten the same to-do list for days and still felt stuck (happens to me a lot), this is who we\u2019re building for.</p> <p>The idea is pretty straightforward:<br/> 1. You tell us your goal<br/> 2. We help break it down into manageable steps<br/> 3. A real human checks in with you during the week </p> <p>We\u2019re testing a <strong>7-day free trial</strong> to learn what kind of support actually helps. I&#39;ll be really happy if you could give me some ideas and recommendations to help my project get better. Thank you!</p> <p>\ud83d\udd17 <a href=\"https://chillcheck.carrd.co\">https://chillcheck.carrd.co</a><br/> \ud83d\udcdd <a href=\"https://forms.gle/7NviK1zBLX3NUpqS8\">https://forms.gle/7NviK1zBLX3NUpqS8</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
