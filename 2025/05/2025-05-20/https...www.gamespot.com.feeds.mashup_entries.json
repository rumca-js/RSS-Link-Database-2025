Aiming to do things differently, Lost in Cult is kickstarting its preservation effort with three games that will \"redefine\" what a physical release can be.</p><p>What's immediately noticeable here is that each of the games--Immortality, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, and Thank Goodness You're Here--are being presented with original artwork, and they'll come packaged with a variant game cover, an essay booklet, poster, and more. More importantly, each game is up-to-date with its latest version and they're all playable offline. As for the price, these are listed for roughly $80 each on the UK-based site.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4497826\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" da",
