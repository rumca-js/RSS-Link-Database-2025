The company just announced <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9FE2Wr-YRg\">Fender Studio</a>, an all-in-one music-creation software platform. It's basically a digital audio workstation (DAW) but one that's intended for newbies. Think GarageBand and not Pro Tools. Just like GarageBand, Fender Studio is free.</p>\n<p>The software looks perfect for going straight into an audio interface without any complications. Players can select from a wide variety of digital amp recreations. These include some real icons, like the '65 Twin Reverb guitar amp, the Rumble 800 bass amp, the '59 Bassman, the Super-Sonic, the SWR Redhead and several more. More amp models are likely on the way.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"f6a982df1e9d4e21b6c15ce523e2b3b0\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9FE2Wr-YRg?si=dTaSLubRh0bKsTiU\" title=\"YouTube v",
