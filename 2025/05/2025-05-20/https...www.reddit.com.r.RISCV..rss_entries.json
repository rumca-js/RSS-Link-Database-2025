However, I still prefer working with Ubuntu, which did not have AI capabilities enabled at that time. A couple of days ago, I discovered that ESWIN had updated an AI-enabled Ubuntu image. I proceeded to install and test it. This new image supports NPU and video hardware codec functionalities and includes support for DeepSeek 7B. In terms of features and performance, there is not much difference compared to the Debian image. But finally, I can now experience AI capabilities on Ubuntu, which is good news for me.^_^</p> <p>If anyone is interested, you can also install and try it out. Here is the download link for the AI-enabled Ubuntu image: <a h",
