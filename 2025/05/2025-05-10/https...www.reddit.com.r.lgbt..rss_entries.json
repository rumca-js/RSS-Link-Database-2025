Hoping to get some outside opinions.</p> <p>So I officially came out publicly as trans about six months ago, after years of taking bunny hops in and out of the closet. I&#39;ve been looking forward, for years, to the day I can finally march in the pride parade and be out and proud.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s been some controversy with my local parade and how it&#39;s being run, and now I&#39;m feeling really conflicted. </p> <p>The problem is that the police will be marching in the parade, in uniform, and they&#39;re gonna be armed. Because of this, the local chapter of the NAACP, a community social justice organization, and the biggest nonprofit for queer youth have all pulled out of the parade.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been set to march with a church my partner and I joined when we came out. They&#39;ve been marching in this parade for decades and have the biggest pride",

Which means i don&#39;t like being touched in my private parts. Lots of girls have rejected me for this and I have... thought of taking my life, I can&#39;t anymore. After being abused by a close male friend, I don&#39;t want to be touched. I forced myself for a while, but it felt wrong, I felt unhappy, I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m so tired.
