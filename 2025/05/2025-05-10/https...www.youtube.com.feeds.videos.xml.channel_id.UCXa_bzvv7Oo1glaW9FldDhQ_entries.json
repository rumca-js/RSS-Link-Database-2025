        "description": "Spirit of the North 2 seemingly contains all the ingredients for an emotionally compelling adventure. A nature-focused fantasy setting and a journey to cleanse the world seemed just the cream on top. Or so it would seem.\n\nThe first impression anyone will have, at least when playing on PS5, is the sheer amount of pop-in when trying to play in 60 frames per second. Throw in a hackneyed set-up and Spirit of the North 2 is off to a wobbly start. \n\nIts exploration offers some solace with Zelda-like tropes and some decently designed locations, but they're let down by a desolate world and tame puzzle-solving.\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the \"guided\" aspect of jumping hinders the platforming. Spirit of the North 2 has exceptional potential, but while patches could improve the visuals, it needs some serious rethinking in numerous other areas.",

        "description": "Rockstar Games\u2019 titles have always been known for their incredibly obsessive level of attention to detail, with each new game pushing the envelope visually and technically with the hardware and technology available to it. \n\nUnsurprisingly, it is looking like the upcoming and long anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 will continue that tradition. Though the open world crime epic has been delayed by several months as many expected it would be, Rockstar did also recently release a new story and gameplay trailer for it- and as is usually the case with Rockstar trailers, it is packed full of tiny little details. \n\nHere, we\u2019re going to go over a few such details.",
