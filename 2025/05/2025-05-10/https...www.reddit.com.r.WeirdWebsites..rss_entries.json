It\u2019s an interactive map where you can anonymously pin personal memories to real-world locations. There\u2019s no login, no feed, no likes just quiet stories dropped across the world by strangers.</p> <p>The idea came from this feeling I couldn\u2019t shake: how do we experience the memories that never make it into a photo? I wanted to build something that wasn\u2019t about performance or perfection, but about presence. So I created a grayscale map with a single ambient track playing in the background. As more people leave memories, the map slowly gains color and shifts, no two visits look exactly the same. It\u2019s not meant to give you directions. It\u2019s meant to help you feel oriented again.</p> <p>I built it solo: design, code, debugging, late-night cursing, all of it. It\u2019s definitely clunky in some places, and I\u2019m still refining things. But it\u2019s alive, and I\u2019d love for people to t",
