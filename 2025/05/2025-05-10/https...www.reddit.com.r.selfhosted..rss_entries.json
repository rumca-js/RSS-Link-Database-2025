I swapped A1 and A5 to see if the problem followed and also made sure all the other cards were fully seated. </p> <p>Now, I am getting a B1 DIMM error on boot that I can not make go away no matter what cards a swap around. Went from 96GB memory on the first boot to 128GB memory on current boots. </p> <p>The server has a warranty and was &quot;fully tested&quot; prior to going out the door. I am waiting to hear back from the seller but not being an expert with Power Edge servers, is there anything else I should be looking for or troubleshooting to fix this RAM issue? Luckily all the cards are identical so I have some freedom to move them around a bit but I&#39;m not sure the correct slot order I should be going down for testing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chadw",

If it works, anyone who imports your root certificate may be at risk of MITM attacks for domains beyond the ones you are selfhosting. In that case, you may want to add something like this:</p> <p><code>nameConstraints = critical, permitted;DNS:.home.arpa</code></p> <p>to your v3_ca and v3_intermediate_ca extensions in openssl. As I understand it, the CA will still be able to <em>generate</em> certificates for other domains (i.e., besides *.home.arpa, per the example), but most browsers <em>should</em> block them as being invalid. From my googling, it seems like not all brrowsers or apps will actually block them, but it worked for me on Edge and Chrome.</p> <p>If you have any other SSL and selfsigned certificate / certificate authority tips, please comment!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ve",

Should be accessible via mobile (smart phones). Plus I would like to have exactly that kind of UI from WhatsApp. For me as writer I got an link for creating posts and the viewer/visitor just have a webpage to see the posts. Sorted as the newest posts are on the top and for older ones you just scroll down. At that point I was not able to find a solution for that. WordPress might be an option, but would be total overkill and the media upload is a pain, even from the mobile App. </p> <p>Thanks everyone for feedback.
