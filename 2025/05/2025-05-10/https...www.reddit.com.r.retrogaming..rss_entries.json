I havent use my snes for almost 2 years so some nostalgia hit me and i hooked on my tv. The problem its that the everdrive doesnt hold my saves every time i run a new game. For example if i start a new game in a link to the past and save, and then start super mario world and save again my previous save dissapears. (it only holds the save of the last game i play).At first i thought maybe it was the battery dying after all these years so i change it but still nothing. Has anyone had a same problem?

Despite downloading the latest version it came with an outdated version of fbneo (1.0.0.1), which is impossible to find a romset for.
