        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The idea is, basically, to create a WYSIWYG workspace for AI-generated code: to preview and easily add targeted comments for further iterations as well as to make quick adjustments to text, duplicate/remove elements, change / add CSS for Wordpress, custom widgets, static pages etc., especially if someone is not comfortable with reading and editing dense html for things like tables, nested elements, text buried in JS and so on. Intended to make work with AI in chat interfaces a little easier (it&#39;s cheaper than API + a page builder or a coding environment like Aider/Cursor, certainly with the two leading coding models - Sonnet 3.7 Thinking and Gemini 2.5 Pro). It also includes a prompt generator and the ability to save presets as JSON - to produce consistently styled content.</p> <ul> <li>Github <a href=\"https://github.com/lukaszliniewicz/notes2llm\">https://github.com/lukaszliniewicz/notes2llm</a></li> <li>Live version: <a href=\"https://notes2llm.li",
