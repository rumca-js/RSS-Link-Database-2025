I&#39;ve been tempted to jump in Mistborn (never read any Sanderson and am a little daunted by the volume), I&#39;ve had a friend recommend Mists of Avalon too and am considering it, but wanted to see what you all thought first!</p> <p>Excited to hear what you think :-)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MattyP211",

I love reading new voices and discovering content that\u2019s outside the mainstream.</p> <p>Does anyone know of any platforms or websites where I can read stories written by people my age or discover new authors? I\u2019m looking for a place that\u2019s not too formal but still offers some great, authentic content. Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Humble_Software4560\"> /u/Humble_Software4560 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kjhrib/looking_for_places_to_read_original_storiesany/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kjhrib/looking_for_places_to_read_original_storiesany/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone! Back in 2009-2011 I was inpatient in a psych ward, and they used to read a book as a part of a time for meditation. The book contained 365 thoughts/texts that invited us to meditate about them and compare them to situations in our life&#39;s, and then a small prayer. The book followed the 12 steps, each step was a month, and also a subject. I remember &quot;letting go the drama&quot;, for example. Many days were about letting go the need of having strong emotions in life. Something that I recall from that writer is that she was an ex-drug/alcohol user (I don&#39;t remember which one), and that she was a skydiving instructor. Many of her thoughts and meditations came from moments while skydiving, being a student herself or already an instructor. </p> <p>Does somebody know the name of the book? I want to find it, buy it and share it with my partner. Thank you for reading me!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
