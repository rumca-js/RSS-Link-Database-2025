I\u2019m very green in this space but my strategies for gaining testers/users are I\u2019ve documented my journey through youtube and tiktok, and posted on reddit in specific communities where my users would be. I\u2019ve gotten a lot of interest in these last 2 days (30 people signed up for my waitlist on my landing page, couple DMs on here and tiktok). I also send users a feedback form after trying it which they don\u2019t seem to be doing as much 5/18 users have done it and I also have a support the project buymeacoffee link on the landing page and in the app to help generate any kind of revenue. I guess my main question is based off where i\u2019m at and my situation what should my goals and focuses be?

It&#39;s Firefox/Gecko engine right now and I would be happy for you to download it and test it, and tell me about any bugs you find or features you would like either in here or on GitHub. Practically it&#39;s a summarizer for ToS about all the services we use in our daily lives. Some years ago I saw a guy printing all the ToS from very famous and well known companies (like Meta) and rolling them out on the street. Instagram&#39;s ToS was 2km long! User&#39;s agree on the Terms of service without never reading them something in the lines of 98% of the time. I created this extension (which uses Google Gemini) so you can read a summary of what you agree and highlight potential misconduct towards the end user. To any ones who download thank you and stay safe!</p> <p>Link to Firefox store </p> <p><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tos-summa",

I have worked with tools like Supabase (the most), firebase, MongoDB, express. I do not have experience with AWS so far (I know I should work on it to get edge). I am also skilled in React and other similar technologies. Till now I have got some titles like Movie/any reservation system, Database utility, JS Obfuscator CLI utility from googling.</p> <p>Based on the same please suggest some project titles. Thank you for reading.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Classic_Advertise\"> /u/Classic_Advertise </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1kj8wpr/require_project_title_suggestion_related_t",

Sometimes those cloth fit them, sometimes they don&#39;t like its colour/fit.</p> <p>So, I&#39;m thinking of building this product where a user can enter and generate his own replica model by sending a image with his height and weight(or maybe a 360\u00b0 video also). Further they can add any link/image(with their size specs) of the cloth. By ML these will generate a 3D replica of the model with the perfect fit of the cloth on the model. I will target high accuracy of this model(still researching on the tech stack). Additional features would be chat bot that can provide them outfits as per they input the destination they want to visit like(party/casual/formal). Plus a wardrobe would be provided where there would be the existing clothes that they have and ultimately suggest them outfits as per mood and environment.</p> <p>Later accessories, footwear would further be implemented.</p> </div><!-- S",

Was the idea itself likely flawed from the start, or is it more about the (lack of) marketing/visibility?</p> <p>Should I try to iterate based on these 4 users (if I can even get feedback from them), pivot, or just chalk it up to a learning experience and move on?</p> <p>Any glaring mistake",
