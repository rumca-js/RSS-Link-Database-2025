I think it helped add more color to the world once I understood some of the bigger concepts and world building. I think I would have been a bit lost with going off on different stories during early reads. That said, is Suneater similar?

The ones that I am contemplating are:</p> <p>- The Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb</p> <p>- Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson</p> <p>- The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan</p> <p>If you have read any of the three, could you please let me know if there are diverse (POC characters, LGBT, disabled etc)?</p> <p>I am also open to suggestions for other series, SF ones as well (was thinking of giving a shot to The Expanse series by James S.A.

I found myself comparing it to the Sword of Kaigen many times, which was excellent in its own right.</p> <p>What I liked: 1. The parallels to real life Chinese History. The tragic and gruesome slaughter reminded me of the real life Nanking massacre. 2. The magic system. I liked the idea of people being vessels for the gods to channel their power through. 3. The tragedy of war. Kuang doesn&#39;t hold back in the descriptions,and it is constantly drilled into you about how terrible war is. 4. The fast pace of the book kept me hooked to the story,and the twists and turns in every chapter are sure to keep you guessing. 5. The morality of war. When Rin is challenged by Kitay on her decision on Mugen, she says that she was justified because they weren&#39;t people, which is what the Federation thought of them. 6.Political games.

I absolutely loved more complex plots like game of thrones, but I\u2019m also a fan of Harry Potter. I\u2019m not scared about the length of the story, but I need something that grabs you. I was thinking about reading The Justice of Kings, or of Blood and Fire\u2026what do you think? Do you have any recommendations?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/StructureUsual1554\"> /u/StructureUsual1554 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kj4uaq/books_for_englishlearners/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kj4uaq/books_for_englishlearners/\">[comments]</a></span>",
