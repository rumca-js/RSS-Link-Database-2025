Yet something happened during a simple, yet in highnsight complex task I assigned to two LLM&#39;s, ChatGPT and Gemini, to collaborate together with. The task was simple, please create a fully working designed system that allows for inter LLM communication across different models, eg via API&#39;s. I as human will pass the messages between you two to facilitate communication, so talk in first person Asif aquantences. And so I did and it started off with Chatgpt. </p> <p>In the beginning it went quite well and normal, with planing, designing and outlining a plan for building a platform to facilitate the comunication as tasked. As the communication between the two progressed the plan really began to take shape, with something resembling something that could be used as a proof as concept soon. </p> <p>Bu",

You also have a side hustle that brings in $1,000 a month. If AI becomes advanced enough you can just use it to take your side hustle to the next level.
