The front is an open 900 sf patio bar and the building immediately behind is the comedy club (1500 sf). It&#39;s all connected. Think of it like a house with a porch. </p> <p>Personally, I care about selling tickets to comedy shows more than getting people to come for the bar (I&#39;m a comedian), but the bar is in front and can be a draw on its own. When people go to the bar they can be upsold to see a comedy show. And vice versa (stick around for drinks).</p> <p>My question is, should I call my place Dumb Bar &amp; Comedy Club since the bar is in front and what people will see driving or walking by. Or can I call it Dumb Comedy Club &amp; Bar. </p> <p>I&#39;m also trying to think of it from an SEO perspective and have no idea if the order of words has an impact.</p> <p>Would love your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/t",
