I installed RetroPi and bought the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06W2JXLSK\">AdaFruit Composite Cables</a>. I configured the config file and am able to get video, but it looks like garbage. Its almost like whites flicker and I can see some light rainbow patters going across the screen. That is if I set it to sdtv_mode=0. If I change it to sdtv_mode=16 (240p) and at this point I can&#39;t even read the text on the screen. Even the large text in RetroPi is so blurry and washed out.</p> <p>All of that to say, any ideas on what I should do to make this look better? I keep tweaking settings like turning overscan on/off, forcing the resolution, forcing the aspect ration, changing the display resolution in the OS. Everything so far has looked pretty awful.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
