I've seen so many beginnings they've all begun to merge into one, and because of it, they've begun to collectively fade from view. A game will begin and a loved one will be taken, and then I'll probably utter a vow of revenge and set about trying to realise it. Something like that. Honestly, I've stopped paying much attention. I don't know who the characters are at the beginning, or the places we're in, so I let myself be swept along until things start to make sense, to sink in, and sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-gets-it-a-strong-and-simple-hook-goes-a-long-way\">Read more</a></p>",
