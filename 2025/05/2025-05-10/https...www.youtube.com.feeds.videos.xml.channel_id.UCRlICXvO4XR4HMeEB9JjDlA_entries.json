        "description": "Over 70 years ago, something crashed in the desert near Roswell, New Mexico\u2014and we still don\u2019t really know what.\n\nIn 1947, a rancher stumbled across strange debris. The military first claimed it was a \"flying disc\", then quickly changed their story to a weather balloon. Odd, that. Witnesses later described the wreckage as made from a strange foil-like material that couldn\u2019t be bent, dented, or scratched.\n\nSome even claimed to have seen alien bodies. But decades later, the US government said it wasn\u2019t aliens, just high-tech spy balloons from a classified project called Mogul. And those supposed alien bodies? Just crash test dummies dropped from planes\u2014except those tests didn\u2019t happen until years later.\n\nThe government explanation? Everyone misremembered.\n\nTo this day, documents from the time of the crash are mysteriously missing. Whether it was a weather balloon, a top-secret project, or something more\u2026 extra-terrestrial, one thing\u2019s certain: someone, somewhere, doesn\u2019t want us to know",
