We&#39;ve seen the initial reports, but what are some of the more creative or nasty ways you think this could actually be used against people before patches are widespread? Especially if attackers find clever ways to sidestep some of the built-in Android protections.</p> <p>Feels like this could be a pretty big deal for a lot of users. Curious to hear what the community here thinks about the potential fallout and any less-obvious attack vectors.

For example, the service would start by scanning for open ports, then check each one for potential security issues. I\u2019m thinking of charging a modest fee\u2014around 50 cents per IP address.</p> <p>Before moving forward, I\u2019d love to get some input from the community. What features or capabilities would you find most valuable in such a tool? I want to ensure that the product meets real needs and doesn\u2019t end up being redundant if there are already better or cheaper alternatives out there.</p> <p>Your thoughts and feedback are much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impossible-Fact-4797\"> /u/Impossible-Fact-4797 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1kiyupy/planning_a_penetration_testing_saas/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://",
