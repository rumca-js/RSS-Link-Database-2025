Each class costs a certain amount of credits and you can reserve different classes. I am currently interested in making a prototype but I want to know how much is involved into building the backend system for that..Sorry if this is might be a newbie question and thanks in advance! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wide-Clerk-120\"> /u/Wide-Clerk-120 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1kj6g1c/urban_sports_app/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1kj6g1c/urban_sports_app/\">[comments]</a></span>",
