Let\u2019s say the way pentesters are affected is AI generates reports based on data pentesters already have found by doing the hacking. </p> <p>So in this case, wouldn\u2019t that mean pentesters would be free to do more hacking and less report writing? And pentesting wouldn\u2019t pentesting just become about who\u2019s the best hacker and not the best report writer if AI can generate better reports based on the results if the pentest than humans can? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/notburneddown\"> /u/notburneddown </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1kjhq5x/is_this_a_possibility_for_penetration_testers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1kjhq5x/is_this_a_possibility_for_penetration_testers/\">[comments]</",
