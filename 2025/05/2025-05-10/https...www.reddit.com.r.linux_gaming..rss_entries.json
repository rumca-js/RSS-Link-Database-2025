Across many different distros (Manjaro, Garuda, Fedora, Bazzite, Kubuntu), I have been getting an issue after about 45 minutes of gameplay where I get sudden framerate drops from 100+ to 18-20 for a second every 10 seconds or so. This happens in every game I&#39;ve played, whether native or using Proton. If I restart the game, it&#39;s fine for another 45 minutes. </p> <p>I finally narrowed this down to being tied to input from my mouse and keyboard. If I&#39;m just sitting there, not touching them, no matter how much is going on on the screen, no drops. So today, when it started happening, I decided to plug in my PS5 controller. Absolutely no issues whatsoever when using that. However, that doesn&#39;t work for all the games I play, and, frankly, I&#39;m pretty awful on a controller, so it&#39;s not really a solution for me.</p> <p>Things I&#39;ve tried:</p> <u",

The controller is connected via Bluetooth and works just fine in the OS (correctly recognized as dualsense controller, I can use the integrated trackpad too) and in Steam (correctly recognized and testable in the controller section).</p> <p>When starting the game though it is as if the controller does not exist. I tried both with steam input enabled and disabled, seems to make no difference.</p> <p>In the game I see that the controller options section refers to &quot;xinput&quot;. Is this because the game does not support Wayland? Could anyone kindly guide me around the troubleshooting?

However my Ubuntu system (24.10, all AMD now) seems to be getting slower and slower (I probably should have installed it again at some point, I tend to copy from disk to disk over years). And I would probably enjoy a more up-to-date distro.
