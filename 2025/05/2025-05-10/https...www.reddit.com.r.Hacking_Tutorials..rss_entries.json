And it&#39;s limited, cause a lot of tools doesn&#39;t work on phone for example wireshark and others. Another problem is instead of learning networking your learning theory cause you can&#39;t see the &quot;how does that work irl/background&quot; because wireshark isn&#39;t available in mobile. </p> <p>The point of commenting about this, is I want you&#39;ll guys opinion.
