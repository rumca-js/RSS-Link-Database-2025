It&#39;s Firefox/Gecko engine right now and I would be happy for you to download it and test it, and tell me about any bugs you find or features you would like either in here or on GitHub. Practically it&#39;s a summarizer for ToS about all the services we use in our daily lives. Some years ago I saw a guy printing all the ToS from very famous and well known companies (like Meta) and rolling them out on the street. Instagram&#39;s ToS was 2km long! User&#39;s agree on the Terms of service without never reading them something in the lines of 98% of the time. I created this extension (which uses Google Gemini) so you can read a summary of what you agree and highlight potential misconduct towards the end user. To any ones who download thank you and stay safe!</p> <p>Link to Firefox store</p> <p><a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tos-summar",
