I have to hold the power button to force shutdown and then turn it back on again every time, which kinda defeats the purpose.</p> <p>I just upgraded the firmware and checked logind.conf to make sure HandleLidSwitch = suspend. I also installed GnomeTweaks, but I couldn&#39;t find a General or Power option in there anywhere.
