At first, I thought it might just be typical of films from that era, but after watching a few other sci-fi movies from the same time, it still feels unusually slow. What\u2019s especially surprising is that Kubrick\u2019s other major films, like Full Metal Jacket and Dr. Strangelove, are much more tightly paced. What&#39;s more is that even in some contemporary reviews Kubrick got a little flak for this, despite how amazing the effects are.</p> <p>Perhaps there is a greater meaning to this in some way that maybe someone can point out?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tricky_Witness_1717\"> /u/Tricky_Witness_1717 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kj7ki9/what_was_the_intention_of_the_length_of_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/com",

It had a super small release, a friend randomly invited me and I had never heard of it or seen a trailer. We had to see it in our town&#39;s little boutique theater, but it just came out on streaming. The film is a love letter to Oakland, CA, specifically in 1987. You do not need to care about Oakland or 1987 to love this movie. It&#39;s so goddamn good.</p> <p>Anyways, pleaaase, do yourself a favor and see this film. It has Pedro Pascal (why get him and then do no advertising??) and I audibly groaned when he came onscreen, just because he is in everything.

It\u2019s actually a brilliant piece of surrealist comedy and deserves way more credit than it gets.</p> <p>First off, let\u2019s talk about Mike Myers&#39; performance. It\u2019s absolutely unhinged in the best way. He takes the Cat beyond the page and turns him into a manic trickster god, bouncing between vaudeville humor, adult satire, and slapstick. He <em>knows</em> how ridiculous the whole thing is, and he leans into it hard. That self-awareness is what gives the film its edge.</p> <p>Next, the set design and cinematography are insane in a good way. The film looks like a Dr. Seuss book exploded on a soundstage. The colors are bold, the architecture is twisted, and everything is slightly off-kilter. It creates this dreamlike, almost dystopian suburbia that mirrors the chaotic energy of the Cat himself. It\u2019s visually unique in a way most kids\u2019 films would",
