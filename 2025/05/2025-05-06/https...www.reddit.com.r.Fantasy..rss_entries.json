He&#39;s been my favorite author for most of my life, someone whom I&#39;ve been reading for nearly 20 years, but the front cover looks to be AI generated and he released a promo video that used AI videos. It&#39;s disappointing to see that shift that some authors seem to be okay with AI cover art.</p> <p>Edit: based off of his reply to a comment in his Patreon page, the artist who created the cover and the AI video fed the ai program only her own art to create everything.

I think because of this, reading more modern interpretations of fantasy, going back to a more classic form I deeply appreciated. Guy Gavriel Kay is a great author, but many fans like his later books more than Fionavar, and some consider it a lesser work of his. I won&#39;t debate that, but one of the things I most enjoyed was the language of the descriptions. Kay wrote this series after editing and helping work on Tolkien&#39;s later published works, and the influence shows in the language even in simply ways &quot;very tall she was, and beautiful.&quot; That language is everywhere in the books, and I loved seeing it again, it gave me some Tolkien vibes, despite the books being more a modern sensibility than Tolkien. I would recommend the trilogy to anyone fondly recalling their Tolkien love. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
