We place 5 and 3 on the engine spaces (5+3=8), we move the Approach track by one. One of us, uses a coffee token to modify one die. E.g. 5 is modified to a 6. The new total is now 9. Do we move the Approach track by an additional one space or by two spaces?</p> <p>Also, side question, does the track move if the new sum is in the same range? So, if the orange aerodynamic marker was at 8, our dice total was 11 (we moved by 2 already), we then modified the sum to be 12, do we move by two again?</p> <p>Thanks in advance :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/maneshharish\"> /u/maneshharish </a> <br/> <span><a",

I personally find collecting games exciting, and the group that attends my board game nights has now grown to 8 people, with 4-6 showing up on average.</p> <p>Some in the group, including me, really enjoy the process of discovering new games together, exploring different themes and mechanics. But then there are a couple who prefer playing the same games over and over again, because they like getting into the nitty gritty of making the most optimal decisions during their turn and developing an intricate understanding of the games mechanics.</p> <p>So now I&#39;m in a bit of a tough spot, because it feels impossible to please everyone. Any time I announce that we&#39;ll try out a new game, the &quot;min-maxers&quot; are a bit disappointed because they have to learn another new game from scratch, while others get tired of playing the same game every time we meet up and are excited whenever i get a new game that i th",
