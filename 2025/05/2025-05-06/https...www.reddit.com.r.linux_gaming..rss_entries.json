One of the steps was to put the following line in my Steam Launch Options:</p> <p>WINEDLLOVERRIDES=&quot;winmm=n,b&quot; %command% -dataPath &quot;ModData/Default&quot;</p> <p>All of this worked, and I was able to play my modded game. Then I installed ProtonTricks, for a purpose wholly unrelated. My game no longer launches when I\u2019ve got that Launch Option set. I did a clean install of my game and it works, but as soon as I put the above Launch Option in, it stops launching. My assumption - because installing ProtonTricks is the only technical or DLL-related thing I\u2019ve done recently - is that installing ProtonTricks somehow messed up the Wine DLL Override, but I honestly don\u2019t have the knowledge to fix it. I\u2019m not normally a Linux user; my Steam Deck is my only Linux device. Can anybody help, in basic languag",

Then i got it only to work on my iGPU, after a driver update it also started working with NVIDIA. Now recently when i also wanted to play, i noticed the game was lagging. Found out it was running on the iGPU. But why? Because NVIDIA drivers decided to fucking crash for no reason.

Look at resource monitor shows it to be ~50-60% CPU usage, and barely any on GPU, with temps almost always maxed at 100C. Tried Cyberpunk, another CPU heavy game, and it keeps temps around 50-70C, with similiar CPU load. Idling temps are also around 20C. Any tips? I&#39;m fresh on linux gaming, never tinkered with wine.
