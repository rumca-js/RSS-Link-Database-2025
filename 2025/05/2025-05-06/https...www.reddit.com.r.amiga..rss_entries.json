I am still relatively new here and after big problems on the weekend with LHA and stuff I got my Amiga at least working now and was able to play some games. But the big thing is &quot;SOME&quot;. I have a few questions because of that, because I fear that the seller MIGHT have sold me a somewhat defect unit. Or I am simply missing something.</p> <p>I have an Amiga 500, Rev 6 (if the seller is to be believed). I played games with the original CPU as well as a PiStorm, with varying results. There is also a GOTEK in there. I dont think its the newest (no Dial) but it should not be the oldest either (OLED screen). There is also one Ram-Thingy in the Expansion below that trap door.</p> <p>Over the last few days I played the following games without any problem whatsoever, using either the PiStorm or the original CPU (all through the GOTEK): <strong>The Settlers, Wing Commander, Secret of Monkey Island, The Lemmings, Vroom</strong>. Some of them",
