But I don&#39;t trust politicians or corporations to do the right thing.<br/> <strong>Introduction</strong><br/> So, what is narrow AI and what is AGI? Where is the distinction?<br/> A narrow AI is a probabilistic (not hard coded) algorithm that can either do one task or a group of tasks in a fully automated manner. An AGI is any type of probabilistic algorithm that can do all the tasks that humans can do, at least as good as humans can do them.<br/> An LLM is ususally based on Transformers and trained using Reinforc",

I know it was just some odd algorithm coincidence but no idea why the AI overview would choose that response. It gives no link like most AI overviews do. If you look up the phrase in english it come with a normal AI overview type response. I dont know any other languages so i didnt bother trying another language. Just a curious situation and thusly im curious what other people get as a response and in different languages. Its very interesting the difference in complexity between english and spanish AI im guessing because of the lack of originally spanish context.

In a perfect world, someone could be replaced by an AI, and everything would be the same except that they don&#39;t have to work anymore.

Now, if an AI can do what you can for cheaper, then they have no reason to pay you. </p> <",
