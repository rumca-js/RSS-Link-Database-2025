Pretty much restarted from scratch. </p> <p>Now it\u2019s just this:<br/> - You log your daily screen time<br/> - You lose 1 point per minute (starting from 300)<br/> - Your score shows up on a public leaderboard<br/> - Accountability &amp; community are the whole point</p> <p>It lives in a google form + GitHub-hosted leaderboard, and I am (as the title says) looking for someone interested in cutting screen time to test out this idea with me (I&#39;m of course participating too). </p> <p>Here is the link to the form: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvFpiWskKc1VLzz89O-x_W-ZNQ_dScIUhSrsC4pNhb",

But truthfully... it just wasn\u2019t fulfilling. After a while, it felt like shouting into the void.</p> <p>I think I underestimated how much human connection matters in this process. Building in public is powerful, but if there\u2019s no real dialogue, no back-and-forth, it starts to feel hollow even if the code is solid. You understand.</p> <p>I\u2019m not giving up on building. Not at all. But I want to shift focus toward people, not just products. Tools should serve humans, and I think I\u2019ve been focusing too much on the tools and not enough on the humans.</p> <p>To anyone who followed along: thank you.
