        "description": "Now that console prices are soaring, building your own gaming PC is a smarter move! In this video, we'll show you how to build a budget-friendly, Small Form Factor (SFF) gaming PC powered by Official SteamOS. This compact build is perfect for your living room setup or any space where a traditional tower won't fit. We're featuring the capable AMD Ryzen 5 5600 (Note: The original prompt mentioned 5660X, but the 5600 is a more common and likely intended budget option - please verify your actual CPU) and pairing it with the AMD Radeon RX 6600. This combination delivers excellent gaming performance, proving you don't need to break the bank to play the latest titles.\n\nUsed Radeon RX 6600: https://ebay.us/gPTJpX\nUsed AMD Ryzen 5 5600: https://ebay.us/E3lI6B\nUsed B550 motherboard:https://ebay.us/upGBTh\nUsed DDR4 Desktop Ram: https://ebay.us/YWitm\nNew SFF case: https://amzn.to/3RTERbf\n500W PSU: https://amzn.to/4k8CehW\nM.2SSD: https://amzn.to/3Z6vEjE\n\n#BudgetGamingPC #SFFPC, #SteamOS #ConsoleAl",
