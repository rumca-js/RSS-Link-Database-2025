I wear glasses, which is what I suspect has caused them. I do make sure to space out the facial interface so glasses are not touching but i guess maybe taking it off or adjusting my glasses while wearing the headset has caused this.</p> <p>I can&#39;t find any protector for the lenses.

I&#39;m having an issue where after installing the app, I open it up, and it is permanently stuck on &quot;downloading models from servers&quot;. They never download! I can create a new drawing from scratch but can&#39;t access pretty much anything else. Feels like a major waste of twenty dollars. I def have a solid internet connection, so that isn&#39;t the issue. Can&#39;t join in games, etc. Any suggestions would be great.

Personally, I have a significant distaste for Meta as a company, so I decided, for the pricepoint, the Pico 4 Ultra was the way to go. I am a US citizen and am finding it very difficult to even find them for sale online. I saw some video at one point that recommended purchasing the headset from Amazon&#39;s UK website because they werent selling in the US. Has anyone bought one recently? Are they even available? Does this have to do with the whole TikTok/bytedance ban in the US? What&#39;s the sitch?
