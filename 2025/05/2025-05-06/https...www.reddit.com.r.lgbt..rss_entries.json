He turned 18 earlier this year and wrote an email to the school staff (UK school) to let us know that he was trans and that he would like to school staff to now use his male name and pronouns. We met that request to be as supportive as we could but recently the parents have written to us asking us to use his birth name and pronouns. Some colleagues seem to support the idea that although he is 18 he remains a student at school and we need to meet the parents&#39; request.</p> <p>The Safeguarding Team in my school will look into it but I was wondering if the law was clearer about this ?</p> <p>Thanks !</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Blueskymondays13\"> /u/Blueskymondays13 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1kgblxg/help_student_over_18_came_out_as_trans_and_the/\">[lin",

Her eyes filled with tears and she cried as she questioned me if I was really sure. I could see the disappointment in her eyes and could tell she was grieving the idea of me ending up with a man. The next few days she kept pressing I had to come out to my dad- he\u2019s homophobic. I feared his reaction and was sad about hers- and so I ended up just discarding the orientation out of means to survive with my dad and keep the love of my mom - pushing myself into being straight. Years passed- I\u2019m currently 22 and a recent dating experience with a man made me realise I just can\u2019t be into men. After years of trying nothing ever worked out- and I\u2019m coming to terms I\u2019m into girls and not men. Also im severely experiencing comphet. I don\u2019t know how to handle any of this- I\u2019m keeping it a secret, my two closest friends know but that\u2019s about it.</p> </div><!-",
