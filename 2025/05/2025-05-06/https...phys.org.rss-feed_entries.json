        "description": "Coastal waters around the world are increasingly losing oxygen, with dramatic consequences for both ecosystems and the people who depend on them. The Baltic Sea is a well-known example: with the consequences of spreading hypoxic or anoxic zones evident in fish kills, the decline of spawning grounds and toxic blue-green algae blooms. So why not introduce oxygen into the sea where it is most urgently needed?",

For some time now, researchers have been working on alternative models that are free of singularities.",
