It was initially intended as a private tool to support my existing clients in the IT/Cyber support space. I built it based on things I would have wanted when I was in IT management. I figured other professionals out there responsible for IT or security could make use of it too, so I decided to make it commercially available. </p> <p>Its had a good uptake over the last 12 months and we now have quite a few active users. I have some time and resource now to focus on developing new features or enhancing existing ones but I want to focus on building out the parts that people really want to see. A lot of our users have come from reddit, so my questions to you are - </p> <p><strong>1</strong>. <strong>If you&#39;re an existing user.</strong> What additional features would you like to see or what enhancements to existing tools would you like?",
