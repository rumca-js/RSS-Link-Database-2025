The one-of-a-kind custom motorbike is themed around Doom's new dragon Serrat, and will be given away to one lucky Australian fan later this month.</p><p>The Sportster S features heaps of decals inspired by Doom: The Dark Ages, but the highlight of the custom motorbike is the dash, built to resemble the dragon Serrat, with the headlight shining out from Serrat's jaws. The bike is covered in glowing red LEDs to complete the effect.</p><div data-embed-type=\"tweet\" data-src=\"https://x.com/bethesda_anz/status/1919150099122344447?s=46\" data-has-image=\"true\"><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-mce-disable-toolbar=\"true\"><p dir=\"ltr\">RIDE IN HELL \ud83d\udd25 Check out this INCREDIBLE custom <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DOOM?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc^tfw\"",
