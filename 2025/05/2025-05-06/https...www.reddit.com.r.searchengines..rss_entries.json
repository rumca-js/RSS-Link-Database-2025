It was useful bc the first result was the official US gov\u2019s NHTSA website on vin decoder and it gave me all my car\u2019s detail specs. Now Google gives me TWO search results!! TWO!! Both I had to pay for a \u201creport.\u201d I just wanted my car\u2019s specs. </p> <p>Anyways, I am not very knowledgeable about ALL the new search engines out there except for Google and Bing, tbh. </p> <p>I tried Bing and boom! I got what I needed. And many, many results.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Equivalent-Cup-9831\"> /u/Equivalent-Cup-9831 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1kg4pmp/my_experience_searching_for_my_cars_vin_number/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1kg4pmp/my_experience_searching_for_my_cars_vin_number/\">[comments]</a></span>",
