As far as i read, this should have very little performance overhead. Unfortunately, it seems to be quite slow. From what I read, on an almost empty drive, it should more or less be able to saturate the Gigabit link, even on these older drives. (Like Seagate Barracuda Green). They are all 2 TB, and after exchaging one they even all have the same PE size. (before one was 512 while the others were 4k) Still, speed when for example copying a file with scp from a laptop is around a 1/10 of the drive speed and the gigabit link, if I am lucky. When I copy to the boot drive, which is on an nvme ssd, none of this slowdown applies. Any hints appreciated.</p> <p>Edit: F.e. when copying some files from the nvme to hdd and streaming a file, according to htop reading is at around 1.8-2 MiB/s, writing at 3.8-4.3 MiB/s</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I\u2019m currently building a tool called <strong>BringYourServer</strong> that aims to simplify Django app deployments. The idea is to help you quickly get your Django app running on your own AWS EC2 instance, taking care of Docker setups, Nginx configuration, and automatic SSL with Certbot.</p> <p>My goal is to remove the DevOps hassle so you can concentrate on coding, while still keeping full control of your infrastructure. I\u2019m gathering feedback from fellow developers to see if this approach resonates and to better understand your needs.</p> <p>If this sounds like something you might find useful, consider joining the waitlist. It\u2019s just a way for me to track interest and gather input as the project takes shape.</p> <p>You can learn more and sign up here: <a href=\"https://bringyourserver.com\">bringyourserver.com</a></p> <p>Thanks for taking the time to check it out, and I\u2019d welcome any feedback or suggestions you have!</p> </div><!--",
