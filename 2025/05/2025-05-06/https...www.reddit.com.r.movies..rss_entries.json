My god I never expected to be rattled this much. Not by the actual events that take place but the fictional ones. The initial scene where Tony&#39;s (Edward&#39;s book character/self) family gets run off the road by a couple cars full of seemingly drunk losers and the events of that whole portion have stuck in my mind more than any movie scene has in a while. Aaron Taylor Johnson absolutely stole the show and managed to make me despise his character more than any villain I&#39;ve seen in the past year or two. Just the pure evil behind his eyes and the way he toys with Tony and his family is absolutely terrifying. He haunts this entire movie. I&#39;m struggling to describe the way it makes me feel but God damn if this movie wasn&#39;t great. I enjoyed the irl portion as well but the book scenes blew me away. </p> ",

From the initial scene in the forest village, the defense of the Hall in the night, to the battle in the cave, These Warriors fight with such familiarity with combat tactics, they signal to one another without words, fight with deadly precision, and stack more bodies that this runon sentence has commas. </p> <p>The 13th Warrior may not have the largest scale scenes of medieval combat tactics, but in my opinion, it has the most squad level organized cohesiveness. I&#39;m serious about saying it reminds me of Predator, Medieval era.</p> <p>What is your favorite Medieval Combat film and why?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",
