        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys! So unfortunately, I\u2019m dnf\u2019ing the book Daisy Darker on chapter 8. I hate dnf\u2019ing books, i rarely do so, but i feel like this one is just insufferable to me. This is the first book by Alice Feeney I have picked up reading, and i\u2019m still not sure if it will be the last. To me, the writing in this is just horribly pretentious, i dislike all of the characters, and i don\u2019t feel connected to any of the plot. I\u2019ve already read all the spoilers to this book after i decided to dnf it and all of it just feels so\u2026 unsatisfying? Please feel free to talk about the book in the comments! So I\u2019m personally wondering, because i have a few of Alice\u2019s books in my tbr, are her books really that good? Are they all written like Daisy Darker, uninteresting and way too detailed/poetic on things that simply don\u2019t need it?</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry in advance if people loved this book! Thats totally okay! But for me personally, i just couldn\u2019t seem to fully enjoy it :/</p> </d",

What draws me in is how well the world is built and whether the characters and plot feel believable within that world. I think creativity and originality often matter more than sticking to real world science and laws of Physics but if there is scientific accuracy, that\u2019s even better like in The Martian by Andy Weir. Also, we only have a finite set of physical laws so our imagination shouldn\u2019t be limited by them. If we stuck strictly to what\u2019s scientifically possible a lot of fiction would end up feeling boring and predictable.

Allow us to introduce you to our new Simple Questions thread! Twice a week, every Tuesday and Saturday, a new Simple Questions thread will be posted for you to ask anything you&#39;d like. And please look for other questions in this thread that you could also answer! A reminder that this is not the thread to ask for book recommendations. All book recommendations should be asked in <a href=\"/r/suggestmeabook\">/r/suggestmeabook</a> or our Weekly Recommendation Thread.</p> <p>Thank you and enjoy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator\"> /u/AutoModerator </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1kfzugq/simple_questions_may_06_2025/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
