But Google Drive has been downloading my folders in separate 2.1gb zip files. So of course, I&#39;m spending more time unzipping into the master folders. But then before deleting from my drive I am double checking that I have the same number of files downloaded and on the drive. Of course of course Google can&#39;t tell me how many files I have in a folder. I have to sit there and scroll to the bottom of the page for it load in increments of 10 files at a time.
