Microsoft is announcing smaller, less powerful revisions of the Microsoft Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop, all built around a more conservative version of Qualcomm\u2019s battery-sipping Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller doesn\u2019t necessarily mean cheaper, however. And while earlier <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2649614/smaller-surface-pcs-may-arrive-soon-with-snapdragon-chips-inside.html\">reports</a> said Microsoft would ship both devices with 12-inch screens, that\u2019s not quite what we\u2019re getting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new $899 13-inch Surface Laptop is very similar to the existing 13.8-inch <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2375677/surface-laptop-2024-review-a-new-era-for-windows-laptops.html\">Surface Laptop 7</a>, which actually ships for as low as $799.99 with a Snapdragon X Plus chip insi",
