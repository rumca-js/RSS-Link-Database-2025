That insight led me to create Jobvix \u2014 a tool that sends daily alerts for new job postings at companies you&#39;re interested in.</p> <p>It makes sense: recruiters often receive 1,000+ applications, so the later you apply, the lower your chances of getting noticed.</p> <p>Unlike other job portals, Jobvix sends you alerts only for new jobs <strong>posted today</strong>, so you can apply early and stay ahead.</p> <p>Check it out: <a href=\"https://jobvix.com/\">https://jobvix.com/</a></p> <p>Love to hear your feedback! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Enough-Chipmunk-9374\"> /u/Enough-Chipmunk-9374 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comment",
