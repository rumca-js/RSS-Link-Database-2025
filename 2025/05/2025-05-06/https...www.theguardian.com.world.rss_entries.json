While a form of the metal had previously been used in smaller quantities by the Mycenaeans and Egyptians among others, bronze was now abundant \u2013 but how?</p><p>Most bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, but while the former was widely available in antiquity, tin is a rare element, with no large sources within thousands of kilometres. This left one big question, referred to by archaeologists as the \u201ctin problem\u201d. Where were the bronze age societies of the Mediterranean getting the tin for their bronze?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/may/07/",
