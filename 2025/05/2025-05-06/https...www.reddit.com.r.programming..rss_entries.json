The project consist of an mobile app, which will be an alarm that wakes up the user guaranteed by making the user do a task of his choice. I found my idea a really good solution for people who can&#39;t wake up easily, since i made an research using google forms and got around 50 answers.Most of the answers have at least 3 alarms ringing every morning which is insane for me personally. My question is how do i raise awareness to my project and how should i promote it? The mobile app is in development and i am still brainstorming ideas for many features in the future. I am also developing website for the app but it will probably take awhile since im the only developer of the app. I would appreciate any great tips for how should i proceed with the development stage and any prior experience of any member here!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
