Japan and Nintendo, however, have actually taken this a step further and created the Pokemon Fossil Exhibit. The exhibit featured sculpted Pokemon \"skeletons\" displayed alongside real dinosaur fossils, and has been traveling across Japan since its creation. The Pokemon Company has confirmed the exhibit is coming to <a href=\"https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/pokemon-fossil-museum-to-debut-in-north-america-at-chicagos-field-museum\">North America in May 2026</a>.</p><p>The exhibit is heading to Chicago's Field Museum on May 22, 2026. It'll be the first time the exhibition will be seen outside of Japan. It is currently at Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum in Katsuyama, Fukui.
