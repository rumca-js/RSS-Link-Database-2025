        "description": "Sponsor: Thermalright Frozen Prism 360 on Amazon - https://geni.us/FUqbQC\nThe Fractal Meshify 3 case has finally shipped. This review and benchmark of the Fractal Meshify 3 looks at build quality, cable management, thermal performance, acoustics and noise, and value. We test the Meshify 3 vs. the prior Meshify series cases, talk about the Meshify C and Meshify 2 that it replaces, and cover alternatives to the Meshify 3 from competition, like the Lian Li Lancool 207, Corsair Frame 4000D, Antec C8, Antec Flux Pro, and more. The Meshify 3 is the best performer in a couple of our charts. Not all of them, but enough that it has dislodged some of the other top performers from the number one slot. Fractal is also launching the Meshify 3 XL today. It is a scaled-up version of what we're reviewing, so you can consider our commentary as overall similar between them. Thermals will slightly differ due to size and pricing is different, but many design elements are shared (and scaled up).\n\nThe best",
