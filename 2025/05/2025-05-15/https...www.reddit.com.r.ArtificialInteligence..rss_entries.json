I\u2019m working on an app that helps people in my country prepare for our university entrance exam. The idea is to let users practice with actual test questions, see the correct answers, and read an explanation of why each answer is correct.</p> <p>Originally, we planned to have all these questions and explanations written by teachers. We finished the app itself and agreed with several teachers to provide content, but they ended up charging extremely high fees\u2014way more than expected\u2014so nobody took their offer. Now we\u2019re trying to create the entire pool of questions ourselves using AI.</p> <p>My plan is to somehow train AI on all available school materials and test banks so it can generate questions, answers, and detailed explanations. The issue is that I\u2019m not very experienced with AI. I\u2019ve looked into finetuning, but I only have a MacBook M4 Pro and couldn\u2019t get far. I",

From there, the behavior is often built out with things like prompt engineering, maybe some function calling, or reinforcement learning.</p> <p>But beyond that, much of what\u2019s often described as \u201cagentic behavior\u201d seems to rely on classic software logic\u2014things like selecting actions, repeating reasoning steps, chaining tasks, and using conditional flows.</p> <p>I\u2019m not questioning the usefulness. It\u2019s just that after seeing a few agentic apps, the mystique starts to wear off. Like once you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve kind of seen them all. Maybe the ones I see at work are just simple implementations. </p> <p>Is that too narrow of a way to think about it? Am I oversimplifying it?

This has proven to be very demanding and leaves me little time to socialise, exercise and generally just chill out. </p> <p>To cut to the chase I have been behind on assignments due to struggling with a previous module and had to request multiple extensions. Things got on top of me and I was close to the deadline, with little time to spare I wrote a prompt and had ChatGPT write my full 4000 word assignment. The assignment is mainly literature and not much mathematics, nor is it relevant to my job role. </p> <p>I have used ai for a year or two and am familiar with it\u2019s structure and phrasing.
