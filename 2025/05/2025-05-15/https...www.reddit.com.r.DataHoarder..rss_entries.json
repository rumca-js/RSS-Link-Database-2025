My friend told me I would never need any added storage - ever! Of course, I agreed with him, he was right.

Just two 360K floppy drives. Pathetic.</p> <p>Over the years my addiction has only grown worse. Thousands of floppies (to backup, at the time, very expensive, to me at least, hard drives). Fortunately, over the years hard drives became cheap so bankruptcy was avoided and the floppies were chucked to save space. Then a few hard drives failed. Data lost.
