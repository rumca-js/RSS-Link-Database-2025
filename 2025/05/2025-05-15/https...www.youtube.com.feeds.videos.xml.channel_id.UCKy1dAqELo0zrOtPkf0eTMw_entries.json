Credit where credit is due: the writing and voice acting are still strong. There are a few inspired and memorable plot moments among the largely simple fetch quests. And I felt satisfied with the way Voyta's canvas turned out. It's not bad at all, it\u2019s simply a bit threadbare as a standalone experience, and it didn\u2019t feel like a strong follow-up to what had come before. I wish I had waited until Henry's big adventure wasn't so fresh in my mind and experienced it woven into a brand-new save file instead, or at least until there\u2019s more than one DLC to split my attention between and make it feel like there were more new stones for me to turn over. That's how I'd encourage you to approach this and the remaining two announced ",
