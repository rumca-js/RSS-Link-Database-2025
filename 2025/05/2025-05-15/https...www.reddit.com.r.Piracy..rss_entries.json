The only real pirating I&#39;ve ever done is use xManager for Spotify.</p> <p>But now that&#39;s not working any longer. I used antisplit to turn spotify into an apk and then revanced to get spotify without any ads. Worked great for a few weeks now. Not anymore. Every few days I get that stupid no songs, even though I disabled auto-update on the playstore. I delete the app, start all over again, and get maybe a couple of days of ad free music, and then repeat the cycle</p> <p>Is there any reliable way to get long term, quality ad free music now through Spotify? Or is it a lost cause now? If so, what are the steps to take to get ad-free music?

I can use books but the kwiz feature of this website is absolutely phenomenal and the structure of courses is also pretty good. I do not have enough cash to get the 2 yr subscription because I am joining college soon.<br/> Anyone who knows how can I access courses on it for free? Free tier is limited to 10 quizzes per month only, which is very less as I go through 10 quizzes in like 10 minutes...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DeadManCameAlive420\"> /u/DeadManCameAlive420 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1kn2b9a/any_way_to_pirateenable_more_quizzes_on_kwiziq/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1kn2b9a/any_way_to_pirateenable_more_quizzes_on_kwiziq/\">[",
