Back in school, I remember computers being setup with active directory (windows) where you can log into your account on any computer connected to server. </p> <p>I know what you&#39;re gonna say &quot;pfft, yeah so ldap?&quot;, here&#39;s the catch not quite. LDAP allows for login on all systems with single login which I&#39;ve done and its quite great but on windows you would get your wallpaper, desktop settings and all the files.</p> <p>And that gave me an idea. How about tapping into login process, with ldap, so that after successful ldap authentication, home directory is mounted via nfs from server. So that home directory is kept on server and you can log in on any machine and you get your entire home directory.</p> <",

Last few years, been gaming on Steam Deck, but it&#39;s getting older and deck 2 is not here yet. So I&#39;ve started looking for laptop options. </p> <p>as I mentioned linux manufacturers don&#39;t ship to my country ( I could use third party for shipping, but there are whole separate caveats there ). </p> <p>Big oems are all available though, Lenovo, Asus, Msi, etc. So if anyone has tested, are there gaming laptops by big oems that work well with linux ? </p> <p>I&#39;m not picky and have no problem getting my hands dirty and setting it up myself, but if there are no drivers... well then there are no drivers :))</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/grandy_1955\"> /u/grandy_1955 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1kn5o9a/linux_compatible_gaming_laptop",

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, codenamed &quot;Precise Pangolin,&quot; was released in April 2012 and reached its EOL in April 2017. This means that it no longer receives security updates, bug fixes, or any form of support from Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu.</p> <p>Using an unsupported version of Ubuntu can expose your system to significant security risks and vulnerabilities. Without regular security updates, your system may be more susceptible to attacks and malware. Additionally, many software packages and dependencies may no longer be compatible with such an outdated version, making it difficult to install and use modern applications.</p> </blockquote> <p>From the sound of ",
