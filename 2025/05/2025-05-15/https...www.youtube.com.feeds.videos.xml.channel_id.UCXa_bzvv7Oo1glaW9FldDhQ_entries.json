        "description": "FromSoftware\u2019s Elden Ring Nightreign is an upcoming standalone, co-op multiplayer experience nestled within Elden Ring\u2019s nightmarish universe. It looks like Elden Ring, with combat very reminiscent of the skirmishes you\u2019ll have overcome in The Lands Between, but the overall experience is something different: rapid-fire exploration, loot gathering, streamlined upgrades, and a cast of pre-determined characters. \n\nCharacters whom we\u2019ve dubbed heroes for this feature as assessing Elden Ring Nightreign at face value it appears FromSoftware are trying their hand at the hero shooter, potentially rivalling Apex Legends or Fortnite. \n\nAs Elden Ring Nightreign is landing close to a host of other upcoming co-op games, ARC Raiders, Marathon, etc,  there\u2019s a lot resting on its shoulders if it\u2019s to climb to the top of the pile.",
