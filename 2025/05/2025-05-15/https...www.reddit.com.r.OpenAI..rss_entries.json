Since previous model would make things up but this thing seems to reply to people who aren&#39;t even there? </p> <p>I&#39;m curious if the legacy o1-pro model would still be the worth the subscription alongside unlimited access to both o4-mini-high and (near) unlimited access to GPT-4.5. </p> <p>I also would like to know what realistic benefits any of you have gotten from the subscription as well.
