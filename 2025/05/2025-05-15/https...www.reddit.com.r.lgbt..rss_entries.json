The first time we made eye contact was when she entered the college, but I ignored it because I didn\u2019t want to seem like a creep. Later, she and her friends crossed paths with me again and stood nearby, laughing and staring in my direction. I caught them doing this several times. Eventually, that girl started walking past my classroom multiple times, seemingly checking if I was inside. This consistent behavior made me suspect she might be watching or following me out of curiosity or interest. What you think is she Interested in me ? I don&#39;t even know if she is gay or not, And most importantly I don&#39;t know if I am ready for the relationship or not too much confusion.

I acknowledge that I was born a girl, I thought I was nonbinary for like two years, then landed on demigirl. But recently I\u2019ve just been thinking like\u2026 why do I need to call it anything? Some days (like today) I feel really feminine, others I feel really masculine, and the rest I feel somewhere inbetween. Maybe you could argue that\u2019s somewhere along the genderfluid spectrum, but it\u2019s not like I actually want to be a boy or be nonbinary, or even be a girl. I just want to be a person who can change depending on the day. I\u2019m sorry if this is all confusing wording but it\u2019s had me thinking.
