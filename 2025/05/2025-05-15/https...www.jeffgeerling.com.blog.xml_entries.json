Of course, it doesn't help that my studio has a metal roof :)</p>\n      <span class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><span>Jeff Geerling</span></span>\n<span class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">May 15, 2025\n</span>",
