I\u2019m not a big reader like at all \u2014 I own a few true crime/biography-style books, but even the ones I\u2019m genuinely interested in take me ages to get through. What I really enjoy about Fry\u2019s storytelling is how he weaves fiction and myth with real-world references and historical context. I also love how rich and expansive his vocabulary is \u2014 I\u2019m constantly looking up words I\u2019ve never heard before, but I find that part really engaging. I\u2019d love some suggestions for books (fiction or non-fiction) that are written in a similar style \u2014 blending storytelling with insight, humour, and interesting language \u2014 perhaps on a different topic than mythology maybe law or something i&#39;m not sure.

My mental health has been in the dump lately, and I feel absolutely no motivation to do anything in life. I feel like my life lately has become somewhat of a sad, long black and white film where the protagonist has lost her purpose in life. I feel like my dreams and goals are too far out of my reach and I&#39;m too scared to even go after them. So yep, not a pretty state to be in.

So, as a girl who read the entire trilogy, I will be sharing if it&#39;s something you wanna read or not.</p> <p>About:</p> <p>This series is of three books and it&#39;s about a girl named Jude Duarte (Human) who&#39;s parents were murdered when she was a child and her murderer (Faerie) is now her foster parent. In the first book, it tells about her school life in Elfhame and her life, love, losses, etc.</p> <p>Recommendation:</p> <p>So if you&#39;re wanting to dive into fantasy, definitely look into this book. And about age rating, I think a mature 10 or 11 year old can read this just fine. There is a subplot of romance but it&#39;s extremely mild. There is no sexual scenes in the first and second book. The third book, however, does have one sexual scene and it&#39;s is not very describing so a mature pre teen or teen can read it.</p> <p>Note!!: D",

I am a grade 8 English teacher at an international school where most of my students are Japanese natives (meaning a bit lower of a reading level, on average.) In an effort to get them to enjoy reading in English more, I&#39;ve been revamping the year 8 curriculum. We usually use set text, but for our unit on biographies, I want to have on offer around 6 different options to choose from that they can then form a &#39;book club&#39; around. Ideally, I can get a wide range of topics and special interest to cover (athletes, musicians, artists, etc.) but I, as someone that doesn&#39;t read many biographies myself, don&#39;t have many things that immediately come to mind as good choices. Also, a lot of things I find are all too long or too short for my purposes. It would be best if everyone&#39;s book were around the same length (250-300 pages.)</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",

I have given it time and still I can only feel what\u2019s missing, an empty place where they should be, an empty future where they should be.
