However, as I played Harmonies more, the little things started to annoy me.. I guess the honeymoon was over. I started to appreciate how forgiving Cascadia was. Getting bad draws is less annoying in Cascadia because of the nature tokens. In Harmonies, there is such an imbalance from animal to animal and spirit to spirit that drawing the good ones can really swing a game. Also, when drafting disks, the dreaded 3rd tile that has nowhere to be placed can sometimes drive me up the wall because space is limited. Another thing is when the disk market goes dry of tile that you need.</p> <p>So one house rule that I&#39;ve been using is a refresh mechanic. The rule that I&#39;ve been using is that a player may dump 1 of their 3 disks that they draft to that turn to the side in order to refresh the animal market or the disk market... t",
