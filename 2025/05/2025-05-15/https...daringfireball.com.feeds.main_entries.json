The original ImageWriter had a higher resolution than\nmost: 144 dpi. And this led to the interesting feature.</p>\n\n<p>You may have noticed that the 144 dpi resolution of the\nImageWriter is exactly twice that of the Mac\u2019s 72 dpi screen. The\nImageWriter printer driver on the Mac took advantage of that. If\nyou were writing a document using a 12-point font, and your Mac\nhad a 24-point version of that font, the Mac would send the\n24-point font\u2019s bitmaps (all Mac fonts were bitmapped in those\ndays) to the printer so it could render smoother text.</p>\n\n<p>The upshot of this was a very slight breaking of the WYSIWYG\nprinciple.
