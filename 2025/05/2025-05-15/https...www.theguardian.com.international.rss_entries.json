Then perhaps you\u2019ll be pleased to learn they\u2019re not all German and dry</p><p>I\u2019ve been drinking <em>a lot </em>of riesling lately. There is, naturally, quite a bit of variety in a drinks writer\u2019s liquid diet, so to have the same thing twice in one week is a sure indication of a fascination developing, or of a habit forming. There\u2019s not much psychoanalysis required as to why that might be the case: the sun is out and, by the time this column comes out, it will (hopefully) be here to stay. And, for that, I simply must have a glass of white wine in my hand.</p><p>Or maybe I need to dig a bit deeper. Why riesling specifically? I like my riesling how all the other freaks do \u2013 namely when it tastes as little like wine as possible. When petrol and wax abound on the nose. And with an acidity that slaps you round the face a little, as well as generous fruit that soothes. Riesling is a wine that feels like a meal. And, just maybe, after a haggard winter ",
