There\u2019s no other way to explain how they keep disappearing! So, if gremlins visit your house too, or if you just need some high-speed charging cables to take advantage of your high-speed charging plugs, then you might want to grab <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charging-iPhone-MacBook/dp/B09LCJPZ1P/\">this two-pack of Anker USB-C cables for just $10 on Amazon</a>. This flirts with the lowest price they\u2019ve ever been, more than a year ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part about these USB-C cables is that they deliver charging speeds of up to 100 watts. That\u2019s more than most power blocks can even output, so you\u2019re good to go for several years at least. You can use these to charge your phone, laptop, or anything else th",

And while some cables have specific connections, like USB-C, my wired network (such as it is) is just a random collection of colored Ethernet cables with tiny little markings telling me what they can or can\u2019t do. How much data can that cable transfer? I had no idea. And that\u2019s bad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had never really thought about which Ethernet cables were being run between my cable modem, router, Xbox, and desktop PC. But I <em>had</em> performed speed tests more than once, and worried that my network was running slower than usual. And I also knew the problem: my network would run only as fast as its slowest segment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If my Ethernet cables were transferring less data than my router or gateway, I was po",

But that hotness comes with a price! So when you see a great discount on a great piece of equipment, it\u2019s worth jumping on\u2014especially with tariffs threatening future price hikes. And right now, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-27-Gaming-Monitor-AdaptiveSync/dp/B0F146MYKD/\">Alienware AW2725DM gaming monitor is $220 on Amazon</a> for the first time ever.

It has the gaming sweet spot resolution of 2560\u00d71440 on a beautiful and color-accurate IPS panel, with a wide viewing angle and a fast 180Hz refresh rate. The 27-inch diagonal works well as either a primary or secondary display, and it has a 1ms response time plus support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync.</p>\n\n\n\n<p",

Discovery and led to a new name for its flagship streaming service.

But over the past few years, pretty much everything the Warner-Discovery merger was supposed to accomplish has failed. Now, the company can no longer articulate <em>what </em>it\u2019s aiming for, other than to squeeze a little extra profit from a flailing enterprise.
