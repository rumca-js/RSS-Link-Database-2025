You can also scan logs, run search queries, and store results locally for later analysis. </p> <p>If you&#39;re into open source threat intel or just want to get quick insights into suspicious IPs, I&#39;d love your thoughts on it! </p> <p>Article: <a href=\"https://www.crowdsec.net/blog/introducing-crowdsec-ipdex\">https://www.crowdsec.net/blog/introducing-crowdsec-ipdex</a><br/> GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/crowdsecurity/ipdex\">https://github.com/crowdsecurity/ipdex</a> </p> <p>Happy to answer any questions or hear your feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/InstanceUsual\"> /u/InstanceUsual <",
