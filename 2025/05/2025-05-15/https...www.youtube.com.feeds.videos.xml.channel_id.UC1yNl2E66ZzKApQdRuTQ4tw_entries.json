In a new paper, researchers claim they\u2019ve proven the experiment wrong, and that light is just a particle. Instead of light also being a wave that interferes with itself they say that there are both light photons and dark photons. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.134.133603\n\nThis video comes with a quiz which you can take here: https://quizwithit.com/start_thequiz/1747052420027x902014842341768200\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links",
