        "description": "Shower electrical tips\u2026I installed an LED niche in this shower and needed to drill holes through the studs. I used @greatstufffoam Fireblock foam because it impedes the spread of fire and smoke through those penetrations. Also I like the Smart Dispenser because it allows me to use the Fireblock for up to 30 days - many thanks to Great Stuff for partnering with me and making products that keep homeowners safe \ud83d\udd25#greatstufffoam #electricaltips #homerenovation #homerepairtutor",
