It\u2019s truly a fascinating subject to look into and explore, but it\u2019s also led me to realize just how much genre writing goes under appreciated due to not being in line with the current hot topics. </p> <p>With this in mind, my question is, which fantasy subgenres have the post potential to grow into something major in the future? What is most likely and what do you hope will gain popularity? Think how Grimdark exploded in popularity among the general population with titles like Game of Thrones, the Witcher, Elden Ring, etc. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr_Mike013\"> /u/Mr_Mike013 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1knkyv4/what_fantasy_subgenres_do_you_think_have_the_mo",

This one has been on my radar since I first saw it advertised based on my reading preferences. I&#39;ve been meaning to return to Tad Williams&#39; Last King of Osten Ard, but I simply had to dive into this series first. So, does it deliver? Let&#39;s find out! As always, no major plot spoilers ahead, and I&#39;ll include a TLDR section at the end for those wanting something more concise:</p> <blockquote> <p>Epheria is a land divided by war and mistrust. The High Lords of the South squabble and fight, only kept in check by the Dragonguard, traitors of a time long past, who serve the empire of the North.
