Chapter 8.</p> <p>From the text, Cathy does the following:</p> <p>She collects chicken blood in a jelly jar and hides it.</p> <p>She burns her apron in the stove.</p> <p>Her mother is out for about 10 minutes during all this.</p> <p>Cathy then walks into town, cheerful and unnoticed.</p> <p>The house fire itself doesn\u2019t occur until 3 a.m., hours later.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what confuses me:</p> <ol> <li><p>How is the fire delayed until 3 a.m.? Cathy burned the apron in the stove in the evening. How does that lead to the entire house going up in flames hours later?</p></li> <li><p>Wouldn\u2019t her parents notice her absence? If the fire started while they were asleep, surely they would have noticed Cathy was gone long before.</p></li> <li><p>Why didn\u2019t her mother notice the smell or the burning",

Its 6 books in total and is probably my favorite series ever. Since no on asked, here are my thoughts in order of reading them:</p> <p>&quot;March to the Monteria&quot; (book 3): First book read. Brutally defeatist but amazing adventure of one destitute native. Epic western</p> <p>&quot;Carreta&quot; (book 2): Not much plot, all vibes. And the vibes of that time are not good. The parts detached from the narrative describing how the carretas went around and the dangers of the road/jungle are amazing but again, not much plot.</p> <p>&quot;Trozas&quot; (book 4): Frustrating throughout with great villains in the three &quot;brothers&quot; and all of the characters in the same place to move towards the conclusion. Simple narrative but incredibly engross",
