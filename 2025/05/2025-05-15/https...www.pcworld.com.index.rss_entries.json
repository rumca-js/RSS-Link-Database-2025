We\u2019ll probably learn exactly how it will all work at Google I/O 2025, which will be held on May 20 and 21.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From what we know so far based on leaks and rumors, the new feature is called GLIC (which stands for \u201cGemini Live in Chrome\u201d) and it comes with a new \u201cGlic\u201d section in ",

Aside from the usual stuff about keeping your security updated, you really shouldn\u2019t be logged in as an administrator if all you\u2019re doing is watching Netflix. An upcoming tweak to Chrome will keep it from launching with administrator privileges, and that\u2019s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft\u2019s own Edge browser, which is based on the open-source Chromium project, has been doing this since 2019. The code that attempts to relaunch Edge without the (typically unnecessary) elevated permissions was recently committed <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6515318\">back into the base version of Chromium</a>, which means we\u2019ll see it in a future update to the world\u2019s most popular browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running a browser with elevated permissions ",
