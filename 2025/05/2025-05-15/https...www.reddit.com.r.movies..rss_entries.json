But I was struck by how bad of an actress Abigail Breslin was. She no longer had that natural acting ability she had as a kid where she&#39;d just disappear. As a grown girl/woman, she came off as wooden and whiny. And I&#39;ve seen the same on some other movies she was on as an adult. It would explain why her fame dried up. Because child actors can cross over if they can adapt. I mean, the Fanning sisters are doing well. </p> <p>Another one is Corey Feldman.

Because again, I just felt sorry for her. </p> <p>Towards the end, the film alludes to her character taking the bedroom techniques that she learned from Samuel, and incorporating them with her husband\u2026but it didn\u2019t feel like Kidman gave a shit about her husband.
