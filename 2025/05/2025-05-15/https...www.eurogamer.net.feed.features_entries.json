The launch version manages to achieve a high level of fidelity even without the path tracing feature that's set to arrive later, and perhaps unsurprisingly the game can be relatively heavy when simply pushed to its maximum settings on low to mid-range hardware. Therefore, optimised settings are worth exploring to strike a better balance between graphical niceties and a responsive HFR experience. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-doom-the-dark-ages-optimised-settings\">Read more</a></p>",

It's not just the focus - this is a game about creating places you might like to live, and specifically, as the name suggests, rather contained ones. It's also the clear-eyed emphasis on how most people actually live in the modern city. In New York, whose real estate market I am a complete expert on thanks to heavily sculpted reality TV \"documentaries\", apartments are sold by the square foot and space is at an absolute premium. Even a multi-million dollar pad can look a little pokey.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/this-indie-interior-design-sim-might-accidentally-make-you-the-landlord-who-puts-the-toilet-inside-the-kitchen\">Read more</a></p>",

I don't mean Jack Black has swapped a baggy teal T-shirt for corset and suspenders, or that Jason Momoa has traded tight denim jeans for golden hotpants, although what a film that would be. But I do mean it's close to establishing the sort of baked-in rituals that make a cult classic. A Minecraft Movie becoming a cult classic - who would have thought?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-chicken-jockey-feels-like-an-unlikely-rocky-horror-moment-for-gen-z\">Read more</a></p>",
