I&#39;m looking for some inspiration from others on how you go about testing your self-hosted / homelab remote access solutions?

I could use my work laptop with VPN connected to connect back to my self-hosted services but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;ll work with the restrictions it has. </p> <p>What are others doing in this scenario?

MKV flags, such as &#39;default&#39; and &#39;forced&#39;, are automatically set for the highest-priority tracks (e.g., 5.1 surround and ASS subtitles), while lower-priority tracks (e.g., stereo audio and PGS subtitles) are deprioritized. You can override the default preferences by creating a custom configuration to define track filters by name and assign scores by property.

I have had navidrome setup and have been having a decent time using it. Problem I ran into now is my wife needs to get on it. We do not share music and I want seperate stores for our files. We have some dupes this way but I really dont care her library is 600 tracks and mine is like 1600 so its not a big deal. Problem is it looks like navidrome doesnt have multi user support that will work for me. The options I am looking at currently are a second navidrome instance just for her. Or checking out another product. AI recommends ampache&gt;airsonic advanced&gt;funkwhale for me and I am curious what you all think. The seperate navidrome would be simple but thats another URL that I have to generate just for her so its a barrier. Also of note my cars android head unit is android ",

Sorry \ud83d\ude05.</p> <p>I&#39;m relatively new to the self-hosting and sysadmin world. Currently, I\u2019m running a few services like Jellyfin, SFTPGo, etc., in Docker containers on my homelab (host OS is Debian). These services are accessible either through my local network or via Tailscale when I\u2019m away from home (Tailscale is installed on the host, not in each container).</p> <p>I\u2019ve purchased a domain name and linked it to my host\u2019s Tailscale IP. I use Nginx Proxy Manager with subdomains to access each service.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019d like to share access with a few tech-savvy friends. The simplest way seems to be using Pangolin, combined with CrowdSec and Fail2Ban for security, plus an authentication provider like Authelia or Authentik. I already have a VPS that I could use for this purpose.</p> <p>However, I\u2019m concerned about exposing my services to the open internet. The old good world WILD web.</p> ",

Say, if in the internal network made accessible via newt, there is a service called &quot;app1&quot; being served at &quot;app1.server1.lan&quot; which can be accessed locally by devices within the LAN network, in Pangolin can I use &quot;app1.server1.lan&quot; as the target? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tbisgn\"> /u/tbisgn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1kn8m1m/pa",

I found one telegram bot that will do it but i need to pay each month to use it and it requires downloading zip files. I also found metube that works if i transfer the Spotify playlist to YouTube music and then copy the playlist link in YouTube music and paste it into metube. I had to modify the file naming to ensure the track index numbers were used in the output file names. Although this method works decent, i really wish i could just paste a Spotify playlist directly into a program and it would download at 320kbps. Every other app i look at (like spotdl) downloads at lower quality and i really want to keep my library below 320kbps. Does anybody know of a better way? Or does anybody know why more apps don\u2019t use 320kbps downloading from yt dlp? I\u2019m very confused why metube downloads 320kbp",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I wanted to share my project I&#39;ve been working on, called Doorman. It&#39;s an open-source API Gateway written completely in Python. It supports REST, SOAP, GraphQL, and gRPC at the moment. Some features are managing apis, endpoints, users, roles, groups, handling rate limits throttling, AI features, and more.</p> <p>I know Python isn&#39;t the &quot;idea&quot; language for a gateway, but thats kind of the point. There are tons of dev teams already using Python that don&#39;t know lower-level languages.</p> <p>I\u2019m building this solo, so it\u2019s not perfect yet, but it works. If you\u2019re looking for something lightweight and simple this might be for you! It&#39;s much simpler than Kong, Tyk, and some other the other bigger gateways.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/apidoorman/doorman\">https://github.com/apidoorman/doorman</a></p> <p>Thanks! Oh, and feedback is much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>hi all,<br/> I am part of a small running group (think exercise/athletics) and each week we all submit a time, for a certain distance, as part of a little on-going league. We have a little script from the 80&#39;s (literally written in Basic) that calculates our pace, and compares that to our average pace over time. Points are dished out according to performance in a handicap style. The person in charge of this system has maintained the code for decades, and each week he emails the text output from the script (I have no intention of attempting to re-write the script :-P ).</p> <p>I would like to self-host a dashboard that tracks our performance over time. I have the ability to write a python code to extract results from Text file. I am looking for suggestions of Self-hosted software solutions, that would provide a nice user interface to display results over time. Ease of use, and a simplistic GUI are a must. Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",
