        "description": "Transfer of charge is a process in which electrons move within a molecule or between two molecules. It is a crucial chemical process that can be applied to a wide range of technologies. Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) occurs when electrons are exchanged between donor and acceptor groups within a molecule via a series of overlapping electron orbits. This exchange creates a shift in light wavelength toward the red end of the light spectrum (redshift). This observable color shift due to ICT has applications in dye manufacturing and organic LEDs (OLEDs).",
