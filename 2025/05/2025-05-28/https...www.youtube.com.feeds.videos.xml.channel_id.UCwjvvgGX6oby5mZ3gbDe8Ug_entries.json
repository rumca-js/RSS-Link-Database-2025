        "description": "In today's China, \"brain death\" might not mean what you think. Healthy teens and even toddlers are being declared brain-dead\u2014just before their organs are harvested for profit. This expos\u00e9 uncovers chilling real cases: a 15-year-old martial arts student found dismembered and missing kidneys; a college student\u2019s organs removed hours after a hospital visit; a 2-day-old baby made \u201cChina\u2019s youngest donor.\u201d\n\nHospitals, police, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are working together in a massive, industrial-scale organ trade operation. Kids are vanishing. Blood tests in schools may be used for secret organ matching. And the so-called \u201cbrain death\u201d loophole is their legal shield.\n\nThis is not science fiction. This is happening. Right now.\n\nWatch the full investigation to understand how ordinary Chinese families are being targeted\u2014and why no one is safe.",
