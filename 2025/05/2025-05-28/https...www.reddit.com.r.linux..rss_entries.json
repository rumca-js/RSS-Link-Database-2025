Since he&#39;s also a gamer, I&#39;ve thought that a rolling release distro would fit his needs, but in that case something like the built-in snapshots from Opensuse TW would come in handy -but I&#39;m afraid that a btrfs distro might wear out the HDD a bit too fast.</p> <p>Or perhaps I could use something like non-LTS Ubuntu, which feature reasonably recent packages and still use the good ol&#39;, tried and true ext4.
