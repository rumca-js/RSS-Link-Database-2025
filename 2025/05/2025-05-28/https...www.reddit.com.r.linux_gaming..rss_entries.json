My Nvidia GPU just works, games via Steam using Proton just work, and I can even take a Windows installer of a Windows game and stuff it into Bottles, install it, run it, and it just works.</p> <p>This experience really makes me wonder what even is the point of a &quot;gaming distro&quot; like Bazzite? Did I get outrageously lucky with my experience? Does installing drivers and prerequisite shit for gaming suck on other distros like a Fedora or Arch which is why a curated distro makes sense?

Unfortunately I cannot upgrade the RAM, so I&#39;m using zram to have 8GB of swap memory</p> <p>My specific usecase is playing Minecraft with some shaders like BSL at 1080p native resolution with Distant Horizons at 32 DH chunks and 8 vanilla chunks, and I get around 30-35 FPS average, which I can get used to, but without DH, I get around 40-50 FPS at 12 chunks of vanilla render distance. I heard it&#39;s supposed to dynamically allocate as much RAM as your system has free, but how do I really know? MangoHud nor &#39;intel-gpu-tools&#39; can show me. I also dunno if zram actually helps with freeing up the VRAM for my iGPU.
