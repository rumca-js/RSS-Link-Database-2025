        "description": "He hacked the FBI, wiped his arrest record, and outwitted the police with nothing but a modem and a vendetta. Kevin Mitnick wasn\u2019t your average keyboard warrior. In 1988, alongside his mate Lenny, he stole a major source code from Digital Equipment Corp\u2014except Lenny was wearing a wire. Classic stitch-up.\n\nAfter a dramatic takedown and a wildly exaggerated trial (no, he couldn\u2019t whistle-launch nuclear missiles), Kevin served time\u2014but couldn\u2019t resist scratching that hacker\u2019s itch. Cue round two: hacking Pacific Bell, dodging snitches, and rigging his flat with an FBI-detecting scanner and a box of doughnuts labelled \"FBI Doughnuts\", just for laughs.\n\nWhen the Feds finally came knocking, Kevin was ready\u2014but they found nothing. Realising the net was closing, he did what any self-respecting hacker would do.\n\nHe vanished.",
