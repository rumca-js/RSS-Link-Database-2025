Except for one book, but it is a collection of short stories and there is no ending in principle. I do not know what others think on this issue, but I decided to speak out. I love the Strugatskys&#39; books, whether with faith in communism or with hopelessness, in any case, you try on the image of this world and think about how you would feel and exist there. Therefore, this is clearly not a hate post. The first book was Roadside Picnic, to be honest, I did not understand at what point the main character decided to become a virtuous person. Like, he had not been an evil and cynical bastard before, but somehow, just a couple of pages before the end, he, so to speak, changed a little, came to the right idea. But it happened too quickly, in a couple of pages and too chaotically. Personally, I did not even understand how he came to this idea. It",

A lot of the material in it consists mostly of his stories and articles, most of which have never been published before. There are some pretty interesting in this one.
