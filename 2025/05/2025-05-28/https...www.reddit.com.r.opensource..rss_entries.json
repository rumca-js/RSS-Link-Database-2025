It can automatically adjust for Tax just as GST, VAT etc (currently supported for UK, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Canada or custom values) </p> <p>It&#39;s quite simple at the moment but I have a pretty good idea of some cool features that can be added and hopefully be a nice little time and money saver for someone who might need it. I have built a previous version as an executable is there is any interest in that and plan on turning it into a web app soon.

Instead of hand-coding table UIs, we just drop in a fully interactive spreadsheet. For example, in Capalyze, users can ask &quot;What are the best-selling headphones on Amazon?&quot;\u2014the AI scrapes, analyzes, and returns results as a live Univer sheet right in the chat. No context switching, no extra UI.</p> <p>Would love to hear how you handle tabular data in your own AI products.</p> <p>What&#39;s worked (or not worked) for you?</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/dream-num/univer\">https://github.com/dream-num/univer</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dushusir\"> /u/Dushusir </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1kx8whq/opensource_spreadsheets_the_golden_gateway/\">[",

I have connected a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse combo that allows me to work on both by pushing numbered keys on the keyboard and a button on the mouse. How can I connect both machines with an open source app so that I can copy and paste info from the desktop screen to my laptop? Its annoying to keep toggling machines thru a button, I want to drag and drop stuff between both machines as if they&#39;re one machine.
