Just running plex for movies, plex amp for music, and plex photos. </p> <p>So I need some suggestions. Is getting a nas unit for it? Seems overkill since I have the mini running the programs I need. Also considered building a mini pc with a bunch of drive bags but also feels like a waste since I have the mini. Would the best option be to get a das with a bunch of bays? W",

Like I can hear it cranking every time I access it. I&#39;m wondering if bigger hard drives are naturally louder, or if it&#39;s the case. My 1TB is in a case with a standard Hard Drive bay, and I have to press my ear against the case to hear it at all. My 24TB is mounted on the back area of the PC, and is pressed against the back cover, and I&#39;m wondering if that&#39;s why it&#39;s so much louder. The case is a Corsair 3500x, so it doesn&#39;t have a hard drive bay.</p> <p>If so, is there anything I can do? Should noise dampening sponges? Anything like that?
