I recently got hold of some ISO standard documents, and I&#39;m looking to have them organized neatly in my home server for easy access. At first I thought I could just lob them in my paperless-ngx instance like any other PDF, but some of these documents come in the form of interactive HTML sites, and some have related files that aren&#39;t supported by paperless. This means that I can&#39;t really use paperless for accessing <em>all</em> documents from the same place, I&#39;d have to split the documents apart in different systems.</p> <p>Do you know of an alternate self hosted solution that would work best for this kind of document management?

So, after some pondering and thinking for quite a while, I think I found a combination of NAS + Hypervisor software that I think I will be going with in the long-term. Is this setup going to be a bit complex? Somewhat, but I&#39;d say a self-hosting setup can get way more complicated with things like manually configured Ceph and utilizing Kubernetes clusters for deploying applications. So, this meets a nice balance between being flexible and robust enough, but also still relatively simple and easy to expand using this exact combination of software in any case that I want to grow my home lab by adding new hardware.</p> <p>The exact combination of software that I am looking into using is the following:</p> <p>- UnRAID + TrueNAS VM for the NAS/Storage Server</p> <p>- XCP-ng/Xen Orchestra as my choice of hypervisor and VM/Host Pool Management</p> <p>Why this setup in particular?
