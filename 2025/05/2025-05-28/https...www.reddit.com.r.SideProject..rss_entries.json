We outsourced the t-shirts and printing, focused on quality (100% cotton, solid print quality), and initially aimed to grow it as a brand.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t have much money, so we bootstrapped everything \u2014 from getting our first inventory to launching a basic website and Instagram/Facebook pages. We offered custom prints, handled all customer requests manually, and even shipped across India. I designed everything; my friend managed operations. We sold mostly through word of mouth \u2014 to friends, family, and their networks. Ended up doing 300+ orders in 2 years.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t charge for customization and kept our margins low to attract customers. Unfortunately, online traction was minimal, and we couldn\u2019t scale. Event",

Not only this you can use multipe models at one place like Chatgpt , Claude ,Grok , Gemini etc and you dont have to pay for them separately. The agent can hold memory, chat with people, and evolve into a kind of smart digital identity.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen interest from folks using it as a brand bot, personal AI, or even a mini storefront rep. Still exploring what direction has the most value, so I figured it\u2019d be great to share it here.</p> <p>If you\u2019re building something yourself, I\u2019d really appreciate your perspective.
