I have a Raspberry Pi 4b and a <a href=\"https://www.waveshare.com/10.1-dsi-touch-a.htm\">waveshare 10.1 inch screen</a>. The screen looks to need .8 amps. I believe the RPi has a max of 3 amps with USB peripherals, and 1.8 amps for the pi alone.

Im very new to this stuff and need a little help trying to find something comparable to the PowerBoost that can handle the load. Im comfortable soldering an using separate boards/products to make it work if needed. Any advice? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#3",
