        "description": "We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Twenty-Three! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\n\nDEAD GODS is a Short Format Pay-What-You-Want indie game designed for the kitchen table and a dark hopeless world of relic hunting. Think Dark Souls or Elden Ring on the tabletop. Paired with its expansion to add new scenarios and unit types to the game, you'll get lots of replay and bang for your buck out of this rules-light Head to Head adventure game. Let's dive in. \n\nCheck out the DEAD GODS Rulebook HERE: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/439995/dead-gods-miniatures-skirmish-game?affiliate_id=210041",
