Fine. </p> <p>BUT, she likes watching these on the TV. So the process is usually to use Chrome to Cast the Chrome TAB to our Chromecast with Google TV. </p> <p>However, it turns out casting a tab is highly inefficient and forces Chrome to do the processing on the go, which causes that many times the stream gets down scaled to 240p resolution, which is terrible. </p> <p>Chrome has another way of casting, which is casting the stream itself. That&#39;s how you cast in YouTube for example, and that&#39;s way more efficient since the stream is played directly on the TV, removing the Chrome tab processing. BUT only some video players support this Cast button. I&#39;ve checked all the starred Live Sports options from FMHY and none of them uses a player with Casting support. </p> <p><stro",

I set up my VPN, changed DNS settings, and got a couple movies and TV shows downloaded and working locally. But when I tried to use Plex remotely, I just couldn&#39;t get it to connect. After that I poked a few extra holes on my firewall and tried to set up split tunneling until eventually I got nervous that I had bypassed all of the safety measures I put in place before. My next idea is to set up a VM on this server using a bridged network connection and a single shared media drive with the host OS that I use exclusively for torrenting, that way I can lock it totally down and ensure it can&#39;t possibly talk without the VPN, but the host OS can be safe and open to the world.</p> <p>I am far from knowledgeable on networking or cyber security, so is this plan legit and safe?

All of my searches recommend the following:</p> <p>Chunky, Panels or some variation of some other paid app (YACreader is one). </p> <p>I am trying to use Google Drive. Chunky says account block and won&#39;t let me access Google Drive. I can find no work around for this online. Panels, I cannot open the CBR files I&#39;ve downloaded so far.</p> <p>Is there a program that I can open CBR files with on iPad from Google drive?
