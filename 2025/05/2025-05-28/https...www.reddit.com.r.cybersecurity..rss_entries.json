I have been working as a DevOps/SysAdmin for this company over a year now (on call, AD, CI/CD, etc), and I got to do some dev and found that I liked the Admin/operation side of tech! I find more enjoyment in saying &quot;No&quot; to people rather than slaving away writing crap code. While others say to just major in CompSci and switch to security, I really don&#39;t like programming and just enjoy learning IT or Technologies, and using it. Now that I switched to cyber, the classes seem WAY more enjoyable and applicable. There are oppurtunies for me to move into a security role in my company, but I am curious about other Cyber professionals.</p> <p>What are your &quot;bread and butter&quot; in your jobs as a cyber professional?

This is something that, if exploited correctly by an attacker, can dismantle any Blue Teamer&#39;s work. A long time ago, I summarized the &quot;Picus Active Directory Handbook&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share/1C1knfi8nR/?mibextid=wwXIfr\">https://www.facebook.com/share/1C1knfi8nR/?mibextid=wwXIfr</a>), which was really helpful when I was starting out. However, when I began to dive deeper, especially when solving AD-related machines, I encountered a problem. I might know many attack techniques, but I couldn&#39;t execute them, either not in the way I wanted or I couldn&#39;t execute them at all due to weak enumeration. Since then, I started gathering notes and cheat sheets, adding my own insights, and refining them until I reached a very satisfactory result. This gave me an idea",
