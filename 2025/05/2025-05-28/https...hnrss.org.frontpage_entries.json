It's a Mac app we built with Electron that uses CLIP embeddings to search photos and videos locally with natural language. We got positive feedback from HN and our first paying customers, but the app was almost 1GB and clunky to use.<p>TLDR; rebuilding in Rust was the right move.<p>So we rewrote the app with Rust and Tauri and here are the results:<p>- App size is 83% smaller: 1GB \u2192 172MB\n- DMG Installer is 70% smaller: 232MB \u2192 69.5MB\n- Indexing files is faster: A 38-minute video now indexes in ~3 minutes instead of 10-14 minutes\n- Overall more stability (old app used to randomly crash)<p>The original version worked, but it didn't perform well when you tried indexing thousands of images or large videos. We lost a lot of time struggling to optimize Electron\u2019s main-renderer process communication and ended up with a complex worker system to process large batches of media files.<p>For months we wrestled with indecision about c",

I've been obsessed with the subtle details of enterprise software ever since. For example, I wrote an implementation of SAML in the early days of the COVID pandemic because I thought it was fun.<p>Over the years, I've felt frustrated that too few people have seemed interested in making auth obvious for developers of business software. Auth really doesn't need to be so confusing.<p>We made Tesseral to help software engineers get B2B auth exactly right \u2013 and focus their energy on building the features that users want.<p>You can use Tesseral to stand up a login page, authenticate your users, and manage their access to resources.

To address this, I created Wetlands \u2013 a lightweight Conda environment manager.<p>Wetlands not only simplifies the creation of isolated Conda environments with specific dependencies, but also allows you to run arbitrary Python code within those environments and retrieve the results.

I was running it on a python script and unix services. To add music, people had to SSH into the unit so you can imagine how painful that was for some.<p>However customers loved it!

Your API definitions, docs, and tests all live together.<p>It came out of years of frustration: cloud sync lock-in, paywalled basics, bloated UIs, and lag on even simple requests. So the team built the opposite: an offline tool with no login, no telemetry, no lock-in. Just markdown and hotkeys.<p>It behaves like code: local files, git branches, no cloud nonsense. Terminal is built-in, so you can commit, diff, and push changes right from the app.<p>Docs stay close to your requests, so that API spec and what the API actually does never drift apart. No more scattered Postman, docs, and test files everywhere. A single source of truth.<p>A minimalist GET request looks something like this:<p><pre><code>      GET\n      https://dummyjson.com/posts\n</code></pre>\nJust hit /endpoint, paste the URL, and run it with Cmd/Ctrl + Enter.",

In this short Loom demo (link above), I walk through how:<p>Users create a profile by uploading 3 videos: an intro, their mental health journey, and their likes/dislikes<p>LLMs analyze each video for emotional tone, key themes, and psychological markers<p>Based on this, Kuky intelligently connects users with similar experiences and emotional alignment<p>We're passionate about creating a safe, empathetic space for authentic conversation\u2014especially for people dealing with mental health challenges.<p>For more background, here\u2019s a feature on Kuky in Women Love Tech:\n<a href=\"https://womenlovetech.com/kuky-the-mental-health-app-",

        "description": "<p>I built AutoThink, a technique that makes local LLMs reason more efficiently by adaptively allocating computational resources based on query complexity.<p>The core idea: instead of giving every query the same \"thinking time,\" classify queries as HIGH or LOW complexity and allocate thinking tokens accordingly. Complex reasoning gets 70-90% of tokens, simple queries get 20-40%.<p>I also implemented steering vectors derived from Pivotal Token Search (originally from Microsoft's Phi-4 paper) that guide the model's reasoning patterns during generation. These vectors encourage behaviors like numerical accuracy, self-correction, and thorough exploration.<p>Results on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B:<p>- GPQA-Diamond: 31.06% vs 21.72% baseline (+43% relative improvement)\n- MMLU-Pro: 26.38% vs 25.58% baseline\n- Uses fewer tokens than baseline approaches<p>Works with any local reasoning model - DeepSeek, Qwen, custom fine-tuned models. No API dependencies.<p>The technique builds on two things ",
