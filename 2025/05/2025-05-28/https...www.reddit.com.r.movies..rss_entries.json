Now we\u2019re in the middle of the swamp. There\u2019s the seedy motels. The downtown courthouse. The posh private school. The jalousie windows. The incessant cricketing of crickets. The music does a good deal of the heavy lifting. That base line alone is both tongue in cheek and moody. Just like the movie. The script is full of twists and turns. None need to make sense when you\u2019re having this much fun. The cast is more than game. If Bill Murray graces your set you must be doing something right. You also get a vintage Denise Richards on full display. I saw this in the theater and couldn\u2019t believe these mainstream actors were going all out exploitation on us. Find this flick and make it your next movie night. You may have to shower after this one\u2026. Enjoy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",
