I\u2019ve heard of Carl Sagan over the years, and I am very excited to finally be diving into his work, because I admire his work in the science world...but I am struggling through this particular book. I love astronomy, aliens, sci-fi, musings about the Universe, so I thought Contact would be perfect.</p> <p>It got me wondering if perhaps there is a different/fan favorite book that is a better introduction into his writing. Any recommendations?</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Brattypinkbunny\"> /u/Brattypinkbunny </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kxt1i8/carl_sagan_recs_worried_i_am_reading_his_work_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kxt1i8/carl_sag",

The book explores how we lose that connection, how external influences breach our inner space, and how to consciously build emotional resilience to stay rooted in who we are.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently offering Advance Reader Copies (ARCs) to anyone interested in reading the book before its official release. In return, I&#39;d love your honest feedback or a review (on Goodreads, Amazon, or wherever you usually share your thoughts).</p> <p>If this resonates with you or you\u2019re interested in emotional wellbeing, inner boundaries, or personal growth, please comment below or message me",

Ideally the events/facts are accurate so that the reader is able to learn while also getting sucked into an exciting story. The main characters don\u2019t have to be 100% real just as long as the main story and other characters are (think the movie Titanic, Jack and Rose were created to tell a better story but the events were real). Can be from any time in history, I\u2019m just trying to learn more but its hard for me to get into anything that isn\u2019t written like a thriller.

Recently I was having a conversation with a friend about how horror fans are totally spoiled when it comes to movies -you can get very deep into arthouse territory and pretty easily find even very famous high brow directors doing stuff in the genre- but there&#39;s not really an equivalent in literature. I&#39;m curious to hear what books people have read that scratches that itch of striking prose <em>and</em> full on scares. Especially interested in novels, since short stories actually seem to have this covered pretty well. A few that come to mind for me are The Blind Owl, House of Leaves, Our Share of the Night, and The Haunting of Hill House.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheExquisiteCorpse\"> /u/TheExquisiteCorpse </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kx4r1p/books_that_are_really_literary_and_real",
