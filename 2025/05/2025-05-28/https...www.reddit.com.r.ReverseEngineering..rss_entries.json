Every part of the cheat (from reversing to the code) was made by myself only (except minhook/imgui).<br/> The github sources are included in the articles and we go through the process on dumping, reversing, then creating the cheat and running it.<br/> If you have any questions, feel free!</p> <p>Part1: Step-by-step through the process of building a functional external cheat (ESP/Aimbot on visible players) with directx9 imgui.</p> <p>Part2: Step-by-step through building a fully functional internal cheat, with features like Noclip, Silent Aim, Instant Kill, ESP (external overlay), Aimbot, No Recoil and more. We also build the simple loader that runs the DLL we create.</p> <p>Hopefully, this is not against the rules of the subreddit and that some finds this helpful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",
