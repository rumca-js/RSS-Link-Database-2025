        "description": "Sponsor: Lian Li O11D Evo RGB on Amazon https://geni.us/B3OD\nIn our second installment of \"Is AMD (Radeon) Actually Screwed,\" in an homage to our \"Is Intel Actually Screwed?\" series, Steve and Steve talk about AMD. Steve agrees with Steve, and Steve thinks Steve has some good points that Steve has raised. In this video, Steve from Hardware Unboxed joins us to talk about AMD's positioning with its Radeon GPUs and whether it has improved from last year -- prior to the RX 9070 series. We spend time talking about the MSRPs and prices, AMD's lack of a high-end GPU (like a 5090 competitor), and AMD's history of panicked price drops shortly after launch.\n\nWatch us talk more in the video on the @Hardwareunboxed channel here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5I9adbMeJ0\nWatch Part 1 from 2024 here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grvBNip77tY\nCheck out our variant of this with Wendell, \"Is x86 Screwed?\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxP6B2HZ_IY\nWatch our \"Fake MSRP\" video here: https://www.you",
