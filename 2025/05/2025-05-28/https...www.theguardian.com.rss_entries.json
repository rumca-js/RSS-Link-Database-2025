But Virgin Island obscured the real truth about intimacy</p><p>Channel 4\u2019s latest attempt to straddle the line between televised humiliation and light titillation came to an end this week. Virgin Island documented a two-week bootcamp for 12 \u201ccourageous virgins\u201d, whisked off to Mamma Mia!-style surrounds and delivered into the hands of self-proclaimed experts with job titles such as \u201cemotional intimacy coach\u201d, \u201csurrogate partner therapist\u201d and \u201csexological bodyworker\u201d.

How much money do you need to fill this?\u201d It reminded me of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/may/26/larger-than-life-duane-hanson-hyperreal-sculptures-serpentine-in-pictures\">Duane Hanson\u2019s hyperreal sculptures</a> of American families but also how his art reflected his time.
