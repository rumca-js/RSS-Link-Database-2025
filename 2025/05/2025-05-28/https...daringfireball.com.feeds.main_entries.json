In 2024, Apple terminated more than 146,000 developer\naccounts over fraud concerns and rejected an additional 139,000\ndeveloper enrollments, preventing bad actors from submitting their\napps to the App Store in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Apple also rejected over 711 million customer account creations\nand deactivated nearly 129 million customer accounts last year,\nblocking these risky and malicious accounts from carrying out\nnefarious activity. That includes spamming or manipulating ratings\nand reviews, charts, and search results that risk compromising the\nintegrity of the App Store.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This report isn\u2019t something new that Apple is doing in the face of increased regulatory scrutiny over the exclusivity of the App Store\u2009\u2014\u2009they\u2019ve been issuing these reports <a href=\"https://www.apple.co",

That means the current iOS 18 will give\nway to \u201ciOS 26,\u201d said the people, who asked not to be identified\nbecause the plan is still private. Other updates will be known as\niPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26.</p>\n\n<p>Apple is making the change to bring consistency to its branding\nand move away from an approach that can be confusing to customers\nand developers. Today\u2019s operating systems\u2009\u2014\u2009including iOS 18,\nwatchOS 12, macOS 15 and visionOS 2\u2009\u2014\u2009use different numbers\nbecause their initial versions didn\u2019t debut at the same time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now that they\u2019re on a consistent annual schedule, this supposed new version-numbering scheme makes a lot of sense. It\u2019ll certainly be helpful to anyone trying to figure out what\u2019s up-to-date or not, and it\u2019",
