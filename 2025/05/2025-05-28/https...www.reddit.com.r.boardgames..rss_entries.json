Here is the rundown of games I personally played with a quick summary, purchased, and won:</p> <p>-----Thursday-----</p> <p>Babylon - 2p - build a 3D point salad. Great table presence. Be careful not to drop a piece on your board.</p> <p>Kyoto no Neko - 2p - Cute, simple play, die roll dependent. Over and under produced at the same time.</p> <p>Mesos - 3p - Card drafting, tableau building to prepare for event cards and get points. Lovely art.</p> <p>Captain Flip - 5p - Push your luck tile drawing family fun. Good laughs and drama.</p> <p>Panda Royale - 5p - Dice chucking roll and write. Build from 1 to 10 dice of different scoring powers.</p> <p>Moon Colony Bloodbath - 3p - Build building ",
