Then I figured it was something to do with my wifi here.<br/> Turns out some Wifi companies filter data and these data filtering was what was leading me to get the retry errors. Soo our goal is to first check whether it is truely a filtering problem. We can do this by customizing out DNS. Basically it&#39;s what filters out the Data and we can either (a) change our devices DNS (b) change our routers ",

But I have realized that if I Started using the AI I could train it to automate, simplify, and speed up a lot of professional tasks and I also recognize that it\u2019s not something that is going to just die out so I would like to try to use it. However, in order to do that I have to give it my email and I know that AI has used a lot of sneaky ways to get a lot of data off-line and I am concerned that if I connect my email to the software that it will be able to read all of my emails. Is there a way to tell if this is happening and protect the data associated with my accounts?</p> ",

My mother struggled deeply with drug addiction. She passed away when I was still a child. My father was a felon, and I haven\u2019t seen him since I was 17. I grew up without guidance, without a safety net, and without the kind of stability most people take for granted.</p> <p>School was never easy. Not because I lacked potential, but because life kept pulling the rug out from under me. College was a dream I couldn\u2019t afford to chase\u2014not when survival came first. And yet, in the middle of all that chaos, I found something: computers. They gave me a way out. A light in the dark. Through them, I found purpose, a career, and a path forward. Despite everything, I like to think of myself as a decent, well-rounded person. I have a girlfriend. I pay my bills. I\u2019m a good neighbor. I respect the people",
