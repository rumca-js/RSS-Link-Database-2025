So many recent titles seem to rely heavily on popular tropes to drive the story, but don\u2019t offer much depth or emotional complexity beyond that. The most recent example for me is God of War by Rina Kent. While it was an enjoyable read, it ultimately didn\u2019t check the boxes I\u2019m looking for in terms of layered character development or meaningful growth between the leads.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for something with more emotional weight, messy dynamics, flawed characters, and a relationship that unfolds with depth. Something in the vein of Still Beating by Jennifer Hartmann. I wouldn\u2019t even necessarily call it a romance, but I loved how it explored complex trauma and connection.</p> <p>Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/olivia-amore\"> /u/olivia-amore </a> <br/> <s",

Love The Fifth Wound by Aurora Mattia. </p> <p>I am also open to something intense like Hurricane Season and Paradais by Fernanda Melchor. </p> <p>Nothing that fits too cleanly within the American fiction, fantasy, or sci fi genres, though I loved Titus Groan by Mervyn Peake which some would argue falls within fantasy. Right now I am having a hard time focusing on narratives that are a little too heavy in dream sequences or are too abstract (examples: Disembodied by Christina-Tudor Sideri, The House of Jericho by Unica Zurn, and Passages by Ann Quin, though I love those authors in general). </p> <p>Lastly, I am open to short story collections (recommendations are welcome) but would prefer novels.

I have been a bookworm my whole life and majority of my life I\u2019ve stuck to the romance genre. I dabbled into reverse harems a few summers ago and loved it but I think I\u2019ve romanced myself out. I recently read the Empyrean series(Fourth Wing) and was pleasantly surprised. But I don\u2019t think im really into much other fantasy romance books I\u2019ve tried looking at other series and none seem really that interesting to me. I don\u2019t have a single clue what genre I should try to go for now? I finished onyx storm recently and am in a book rut. I have always had an interest for ghost stuff growing up so maybe I\u2019d be into spooky/horror books? Or maybe some like books where it\u2019s like solving a mystery? Idk but I am in need of some books.

I might be in the wrong place but I\u2019ve read 50% of this book already and I\u2019m wondering, does the pace pick up at all??</p> <p>I don\u2019t mind a book that doesn\u2019t have a lot going on as long as it\u2019s telling a decent story but I feel like once I got to the 40-45% mark with this book (where she just keeps hanging out with Raymond and gushing over this musician), I\u2019ve been having a hard time getting through the chapters.</p> <p>It feels like it just got so slow. </p> <p>I enjoy the writing, humor, foreshadowing, etc. but I\u2019m just curious about the pacing from here on out.. </p> <p>Without spoilers (I\u2019m only at the part where she\u2019s Raymond\u2019s plus one at that party), is the book a slow read? What are your thoughts overall?</p> <p>Thank you in advance.. I\u2019m really trying to finish this but I\u2019m struggling.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spicypretzelcrumbs\"> /u/spicypretzelcrumbs </a> <br/> <span><a",

My wife and I love to read and he has shown that he will read for hours on end, but it\u2019s gotta be something that gets him. Mostly what gets him is wimpy kid books and big Nate, which is fine, I liked that kind of thing when I was little too. But he has recently torn through a series of novels. The Academy Series by T.Z. Layton. It\u2019s a five book series about a soccer academy prospect and he\u2019s so into them. They\u2019re chapter books, they\u2019re all over 200 pages and there aren\u2019t any illustrations. He\u2019s almost done with the last one and I would like to encourage him to keep reading chapter books like that his series, but I don\u2019t really know where to look. </p> <p>I don\u2019t want people to think I don\u2019t want him to keep reading graphic novels, or books like wimpy kid and big Nate. I\u2019m fine with that. I just want to encourage him to keep reading stuff that\u2019s at his level and beyond, in addition to that stuff. I",

The stories are always so rich in wisdom, world building and character. Honestly there should be much more Greek mythology stories told in media but that\u2019s another conversation lmao. Anyway it got me wanting to dive back into reading greek mythology related things. I used to read Rick Riordan\u2019s books when I was a kid. </p> <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> What are some Greek Mythology books you\u2019d recommend reading? <strong>They can be fiction or non-fiction</strong> </p> <p>I want to read as much as I can, might even use some of it to put in my writing.

I&#39;m looking for some books to purchase as I&#39;m trying to read more :) I like sci-fi and fantasy books, basically anything that isn&#39;t in our normal world with a twinge of romance. I want romance but I don&#39;t want it to be the entire story/plot, but a nice thing going on on the side. For reference I really like The Lunar Chronicles and The Forgetting like Sharon Cameron. The character banter and interesting main plot were just up my alley, so something like them! I did read the Mortal Instruments series as I was recommended it, !but I hated it so I don&#39;t want to read anything like that, (It was TOO descriptive for me and made me want to give up by book 3, especially because of the you know what), but I did love the character banter in it.
