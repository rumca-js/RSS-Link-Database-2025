Now that I&#39;m a little older and I&#39;ve been able to invest in a new TV, I want to get a higher-end upscaler to play these older systems, like the Retrotink 5x, 4K CE, or OSSC Pro. While I do want a high-quality video signal, I don&#39;t want to be breaking the bank, especially considering the number of systems I own is rather small (For analog signals, I own a PS2, OG Xbox, SNES, Genesis, @ N64, all unmodded.) Considering this, I&#39;ve decided to mainly stick with Component for a few reasons (Cable consistency with PS2 and Xbox, and lower cost splitters &amp; cables). I plan on using HD Retrovision cables for these systems to allow for said cable consistency. With that all being said, here are my questions:</p> <ul> <li>Given that I have the 5 Inputs listed, with 4 being component and 1 S-Video, what low-c",
