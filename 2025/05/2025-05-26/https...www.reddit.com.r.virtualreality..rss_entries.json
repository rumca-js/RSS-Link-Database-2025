Thank you all for your input! </p> <p>But let me try this a different way. I want to get another headset because I\u2019m having a hard time seeing things clearly. I\u2019m new to VR but I hear terms like \u201c screen door effect\u201d, \u201csmall sweet spot\u201c, and \u201cghosting.\u201d Those sound like my problems with the headset. Is this just something I need to accept?</p> <p>Assuming I don\u2019t want to upgrade my computer, what headset would you recommend I get? I\u2019m into VR Sim racing but, I would like to get into games like half-life Alyx. Here are the current specs for my computer. I would love your suggestions:</p> <p>Cpu: Ryzen 7 5700X3D Mem: 32GB @ 3200MHZ MB: Asrock B550M GPU: Gigabyte RX 7800XT (16 GB) Current headset: HTC Hive Cosmos 2Q2R100 Elite</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",

Well my question may be a bit simple to some of you but I got cluelesss bout this even after looking at the meta shop. So lets say I would like to play Lone Echo 1 &amp; 2, but I have no pc to link to VR system, then is there a way to play it with standalone system? if so which one? or it works only with the pcvr solution? sorry if question sounds silly, I got clueless about this as I read that some games work in standalone and pcvr too just with different performance.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I realize I&#39;m late to the game but I can&#39;t find an answer anywhere on this. What is the difference between the DPVR E4C and E4?? Everywhere I read says the E4C isn&#39;t for personal use, only commercial. Why? From where I&#39;ve priced out the E4C is $425.00 cheaper than the E4. So what&#39;s so different??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrWhite604\"> /u/MrWhite604 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kvgtqg/dpvrwhats_different/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kvgtqg/dpvrwhats_different/\">[comments]</a></span>",
