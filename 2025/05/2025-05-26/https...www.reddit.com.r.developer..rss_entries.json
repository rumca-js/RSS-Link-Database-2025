He\u2019s in the trenches. He\u2019s built AI tools that companies like Netflix use in production. He open-sourced India\u2019s first voice foundation model. And he\u2019s been shortlisted for both the WTFund and Thiel Fellowship before turning 25.</p> <p>What I\u2019m looking forward to in this session:</p> <p>- What keeps breaking in real-world GenAI projects</p> <p>- How teams are solving problems like latency, hallucination, and infra bottlenecks</p> <p>- What lessons devs are learning the hard way</p> <p>If you&#39;re building anything in GenAI, or just want to learn what actually happens behind the scenes, this will be worth your time.</p> <p><strong>Here\u2019s the link to register:</str",
