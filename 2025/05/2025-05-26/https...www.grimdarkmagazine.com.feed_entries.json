        "description": "<p>Paradise is a 2025 political thriller that shockingly diverts into a science fiction one after the first episode. It&#8217;s one of those things that is best experienced without spoilers so if you want to enjoy Paradise in the best manner possible, you should go and watch it without reading any further. It&#8217;s a good series.
