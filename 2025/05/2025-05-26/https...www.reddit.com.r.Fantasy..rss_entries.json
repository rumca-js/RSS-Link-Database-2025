After which, somehow I wound up starting the wandering inn series about 10 days ago? I am halfway through the 4th book and have had to stop because these books are loooong and I am a little fatigued by the world. Not to say I don&#39;t like the books or won&#39;t continue the series but I need to read something else or I will fall into a slump.

I have read some of the classic series - LotR, the Shanara series, the light-read Xanth stuff, the Riftwar saga, Thomas Covenant, some DragonLance, and the Belgariad/Mallorean (with the former probably my all time favourite as a teen). And I tried Wheel of Time but couldn\u2019t do it. I know - it is apparently worth it if you grind through book one, but I just won\u2019t. </p> <p>Now I am wondering about a couple of excellent series to pick away at.
