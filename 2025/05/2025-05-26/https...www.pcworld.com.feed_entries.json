There\u2019s no other way to explain how they keep disappearing! So, if gremlins visit your house too, or if you just need some high-speed charging cables to take advantage of your high-speed charging plugs, then you might want to grab <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charging-iPhone-MacBook/dp/B09LCJPZ1P/\">this two-pack of Anker USB-C cables for just $12 on Amazon</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part about these USB-C cables is that they deliver charging speeds of up to 100 watts. That\u2019s more than most power blocks can even output, so you\u2019re good to go for several years at least. You can use these to charge your phone, laptop, or anything else that connects via USB-C. And these are excellent for use with fast-charging ",

This Anker model is compatible with various device types, with two AC outlets for conventional plugs, plus two USB-C and two USB-A for your phone, laptop, and other day-to-day gadgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this Anker charging station is also slim and rectangular.

You can score the special price <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\">with a 30-day Prime trial</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great device with solid performance for work, web browsing, streaming Netflix, and some moderately demanding tasks like photo editing.

It\u2019s a close call, but for most people I\u2019d recommend NordVPN. It\u2019s our pick for best VPN overall thanks to its unmatched feature set, lightning-fast speeds, and exceptional streaming support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Nord and Proton are top-notch services, but be sure to check out our picks for the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\">best VPNs</a> for even more great options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure ",
