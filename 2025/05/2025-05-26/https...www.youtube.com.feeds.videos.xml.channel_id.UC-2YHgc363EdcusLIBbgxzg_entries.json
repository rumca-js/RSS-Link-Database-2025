Shut out of international space missions for 14 years, they have built their own program, with a strong commitment to the moon in 2029. And their track record has been beyond impressive. \n\nToday we\u2019ll discuss the Chinese space program, plus topics relating to tragedies in Kpop, ancient wisdom around meteorites, and the future politics of Mars on today\u2019s lightning round video.\n\nWant to support the channel?
