        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson is a work of fantasy that stands as one of the greatest achievements in fiction. Perhaps that\u2019s a huge call and perhaps I\u2019m also incredibly wrong. But I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ve experienced anything like it ever. Its epic scale, intricate world-building, and deeply complex characters put it above anything I\u2019ve ever read, watched or played. The series weaves together a vast array of storylines and themes in such a complex and intricate way. It has a surprising amount of philosophical depth to it as well. It\u2019s so emotionally powerful and yes it is really challenging at times but man is it so rewarding. It\u2019s such a satisfying experience and is not only a fantastic story but a fantastic reading experience and journey. I seriously think Malazan is unrivaled in its grandness and complexity. I\u2019m calling it now, tell me if I\u2019m insane but Malazan is the greatest piece of fiction I\u2019ve ever experienced.</p> </div><!-- SC",

The story is a mystery/thriller involving the disappearance and reemergence of a teen girl. It also dives into the life of the detective working with the girl. It felt a little slow to build and dragged on quite a few times imo. But the story is well written and highlights some unfortunate realities faced by women. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the plot twist with <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">lydia being serendipity. It felt a little too unrealistic for me, based on how realistic everything else is in the book</span> but that&#39;s really my other only complaint.
