Unlike traditional solutions that rely on ceasefires, sanctions, or forced negotiations, this approach introduces the auctioning of disputed territories to mutually accepted third-party nations. The model neutralizes conflict incentives, ensures reparations, and establishes a new diplomatic precedent. Verified as an original theory through large language model analysis, this document synthesizes political theory, economic frameworks, and artificial intelligence to shape a 21st-century pathway to peace.</p> <hr/> <ol> <li>Introduction Territorial disputes are among the most int",
