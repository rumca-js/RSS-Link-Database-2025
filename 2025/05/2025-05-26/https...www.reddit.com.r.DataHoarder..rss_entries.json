Quick question from a tech novice.</p> <p>I used to use two USB flash drives to store my video &amp; photo files, &amp; as you can probably guess, both of them spontaneously died, &amp; I lost everything. I have learned my lesson since then &amp; I am now using two external hard drives for storage. I did read that their life expectancy only last about 3\u20135 years, so I\u2019m trying to take better care of them so they last as long as they can. For example, I only just learned that I should be safely ejecting them instead of just unplugging them (rookie mistake, I know). Now I want to organize my files better, things like renaming them, adding tags or comments, maybe even rating them with stars (I noticed some files can be rated out of 5 stars), so that I can find some files easier. But I came across a post saying that doing stuff like this to USBs can make them fail faster. </p> <p>So here\u2019s my question: Does organizing or editing metadata (like renaming",

Through my research, I\u2019ve read in many places that it\u2019s a wise idea to run smart long test and/or badblocks as an initial burn-in. </p> <p>I understand that because badblocks was not originally intended for modern HDD\u2019s, it\u2019s best practice to adjust the block size (-b 4096) to match the HDD. My confusion comes into play here:</p> <p>If these drives are showing Logical Size = 512 and Physical Size = 4096, am I only concerned with the Physical Size? If I was to use a block size (say -b 8192) that was not the same as the HDD, would that harm the drive in anyway? Does badblocks have the capability to unintentionally reformat a drive?</p> <p>With all of that said, is badblocks still worth it in 2025?

It allows downloading content from Kemono.su and Coomer.party with a simple yet clean interface (PyQt5-based). It supports filtering by character names, automatic foldering of downloads, skipping specific words, and even downloading full feeds of creators or individual posts.</p> <p>It also has cookie support, so you can view subscriber material by loading browser cookies. There is a strong filtering system based on a file named Known.txt that assists you in grouping characters, assigning aliases, and staying organized in the long term.</p> <p>If you have a high amount of art, comics, or archives being downloaded, it has settings for that specifically as well\u2014such as manga/comic mode, filename sanitizing, archive-only downloads, and WebP conversion.</p> <p>It&#39;s open-source and on GitHub here: <a href=\"https://github.",
