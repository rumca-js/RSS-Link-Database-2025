Do this trip at this link https://themongoliatour.com/tours/mongolia-winter-offroad-tour/\n\nWe drove over 3,000km across the wild heart of Mongolia in a rugged 4x4 mission to reach the remote Tsaatan reindeer herders of the north. Along the way, we lived with nomadic families, crossed vast steppes, deep river valleys, and endless mountain passes. This wasn\u2019t just a journey\u2014it was a raw, immersive experience into one of the last surviving nomadic cultures on Earth.\n\nIn the final stretch, deep in the taiga, we were invited to witness and take part in a rare Tsaatan rite of passage\u2014an honor few outsiders have ever experienced. This is the story of endurance, culture, and connection in one of the most untouched corners of the planet.\nBig love to LIQUI MOLY Extreme for hosting us. You can do this trip too.
