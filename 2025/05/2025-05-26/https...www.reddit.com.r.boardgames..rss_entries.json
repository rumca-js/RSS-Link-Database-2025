I recently started doing playthroughs and want to &quot;tell a story&quot; as I&#39;m playing games, while providing screenshots for visuals. It&#39;s not going to be a play-by-play of each game turn and individual mechanics but rather the main highlights with some thematic flavor.</p> <p>I just posted the first two parts of a Formula GP playthrough on my Patreon (content is Free). I discovered this game about a year ago on GF and have gotten to know the devs after I did a playthrough and review on my YT channel. Its pretty much the closest thing to a modern Formula 1 simulation on tabletop. It&#39;s very different from other racing board games like Heat and Formula D and really ups the depth and complexity for true racing fans.</p> <p>The physical game isn&#39;t out yet so this playthrough is on TTS.

Favorite among these? If you&#39;ve played a few of them, how would you rank them? Do you think any of these really stand out in the genre?
