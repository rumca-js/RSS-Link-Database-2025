        "description": "SRH head coach Daniel Vettori addressed Mohammed Shami's inconsistent IPL 2025 performance, attributing it to a long T20 layoff. Shami, a 2023 Purple Cap winner, struggled with lengths this season, taking six wickets in nine games at an economy of 11.23. Vettori also clarified that Nitish Kumar Reddy's limited bowling was due to a pre-tournament side strain, which impacted his all-round contribution despite being a breakout star last season.",
