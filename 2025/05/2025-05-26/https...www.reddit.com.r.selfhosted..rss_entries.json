I recently bought a 5TB VPS from InterServer (details below) and want to run NextCloud AIO with Docker, Portainer, and Nginx Proxy Manager. I\u2019m aiming for near 100% uptime and need to ensure our files are safe since they\u2019re critical for the business.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the VPS I got:</p> <ul> <li>5 Slices, $15.00/mo</li> <li>3 Cores, 10GB Memory, 5TB SATA, 10TB Transfer, 10Gbps Port Speed</li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m planning to install it on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 Server. I\u2019m not very experienced with VPS\u2014my current setup is a home server (Optiplex) with 40+ containers, including NextCloud. It works fine, but I often have to fix things, which is okay since no one depends on it. For a business, though, downtime or data loss isn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>A few questions:</p> <ol> <li>How reliable is NextCloud AIO in this setup for a small business?</li> <li>What\u2019s the best way",

Hope you are having a good day.</p> <p>Today I released ZaneOps v1.10 introducing a web terminal for deployments and a web terminal to the server.</p> <ul> <li>Web terminals to deployments allow you to connect to a running container of your deployed applications using a shell and user of your choice. It\u2019s essentially a <code>docker exec -it &lt;container&gt;</code> process running directly in the browser </li> <li>Web terminal to your server allow you to connect directly to the server where ZaneOps is installed, via SSH. This is done by generating ssh keys from the web UI associated with a user on your server, and using that key to access the server from the web UI.</li> </ul> <p>Apart from these features, we also made some QoL improvements:</p> <ul> <li>We added a persistent cache on the frontend. This way between each new version, navigation will be very snappy after the first load even if you refresh the browser.</li> <li>ZaneOps app do",
