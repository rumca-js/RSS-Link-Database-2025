        "description": "As policy makers in the UK weigh how to regulate the AI industry, Nick Clegg, former UK deputy prime minister and former Meta executive, claimed a push for artist consent would \"basically kill\" the AI industry. From a report: Speaking at an event promoting his new book, Clegg said the creative community should have the right to opt out of having their work used to train AI models. But he claimed it wasn't feasible to ask for consent before ingesting their work first. \n\n\"I think the creative community wants to go a step further,\" Clegg said according to The Times. \"Quite a lot of voices say, 'You can only train on my content, [if you] first ask.' And I have to say that strikes me as somewhat implausible because these systems train on vast amounts of data.\" \n\n\"I just don't know how you go around, asking everyone first. I just don't see how that would work,\" Clegg said. \"And by the way if you did it in Britain and no one else did it, you would basically kill the AI industry in this count",

        "description": "Newark Liberty International Airport has suffered six radar and radio outages in nine months, with the most recent occurring May 9th when controllers told pilots \"our scopes just went black again\" before handing off flights to other facilities. The outages have forced flight cancellations, diversions, and delays lasting over a week as airlines repositioned aircraft and crews. \n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration created the problem by relocating Newark's air traffic control operations from the understaffed N90 facility on Long Island to Philadelphia in 2024. Only 17 of 33 controllers accepted the move despite $100,000 relocation bonuses, leaving operations short-staffed. Rather than build new STARS servers in Philadelphia, the FAA opted to send radar data over 130 miles of commercial copper telephone lines. \n\nThe remote feeds have experienced approximately 10 minutes of downtime over 10 months -- exceeding the agency's reliability standards and occurring 200 times more frequently tha",

One engineer said his team was cut roughly in half but still expected to produce the same amount of code by relying on AI tools. \n\nThe shift mirrors historical workplace changes during industrialization, the Times argues, where technology didn't eliminate jobs but made them more routine and fast-paced. Engineers describe feeling like \"bystanders in their own jobs\" as they spend more time reviewing AI-generated code rather than writing it themselves.

This marks the end of an emoji era that first began in 1999, even though the set hasn't been updated since 2013. \n\n[...] Unlike these earlier systems, Docomo's emoji set in 1999 was explicitly tied to mobile internet use and would become the template for emoji standardization in the 2000s and 2010s, alongside emoji design sets implemented by Softbank and KDDI on their own versions of i-mode (J-Sky and EZweb, respectively). Docomo's set would receive several updates between 1999 and 2013, introducing color support and additional concepts to the keyboard. But now, as per this week's announcement, it will finally be discontinued. Spanning 26 years, it's undeniable that Docomo's emoji set played a foundational role in emoji history, even if its last incarnation remained unchanged for almost 12 of those 26 years.<p><div class=",

        "description": "It's America's biggest box office for a Memorial Day weekend ever, reports Variety. \n\nAnd it's been more than a decade since this many Americans went to see a movie during a three-day weekend...\n\n\nFamilies turned out in force for Disney's live-action \"Lilo &amp; Stitch\" remake, which collected a blockbuster $145.5 million in its opening weekend and an estimated $183 million through Monday... Meanwhile, older audiences showed up to watch Paramount and Skydance's \"Mission: Impossible &mdash; The Final Reckoning,\" which earned a series-best $63 million over the weekend and an estimated $77 million through Monday's holiday. This eighth installment just narrowly beat 2018's \"Mission: Impossible &mdash; Fallout\" ($61 million) to score the top debut of the 29-year-old franchise... \n\nThanks to effective counterprogramming &mdash; and a huge assist by holdovers like \"Final Destination Bloodlines,\" \"Thunderbolts*\" and \"Sinners\" &mdash; this weekend delivered the best collective Memorial Day wee",

[T]he recipient will only see the \"dot dot dot\" animation for several seconds, and it will then eventually disappear. They will never get the audio message. \n\"The issue was first spotted on the podcast Search Engine...\" according to an article in Fortune:\n\n\nRambo's explanation of the curiosity goes like this. \n\n\"When you send an audio message using the Messages app, the message includes a transcription of the audio. If you happen to pronounce the name 'Dave and Buster's' as someone would normally pronounce it, almost like it's a single word, the transcription engine on iOS will recognize ",

        "description": "AI's downside for software engineers for now seems to be a change in the quality of their work,\" reports the New York Times. \"Some say it is becoming more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced... The new approach to coding at many companies has, in effect, eliminated much of the time the developer spends reflecting on his or her work.\" \n\nAnd Amazon CEO Andy Jassy even recently told shareholders Amazon would \"change the norms\" for programming by how they used AI.\n\nThose changing norms have not always been eagerly embraced. Three Amazon engineers said managers had increasingly pushed them to use AI in their work over the past year. The engineers said the company had raised output goals [which affect performance reviews] and had become less forgiving about deadlines. It has even encouraged coders to gin up new AI productivity tools at an upcoming hackathon, an internal coding competition. One Amazon engineer said his team was roughly half the size it was last year, b",
