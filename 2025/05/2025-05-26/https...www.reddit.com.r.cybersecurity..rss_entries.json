Now, I&#39;m really interested in getting involved in research, but I don&#39;t have formal research experience yet. I&#39;m looking to see if anyone here is currently working on a research project and might be open to having someone with a strong industry background join in a supporting role. I&#39;m very eager to learn the research process and believe my hands-on skills could be useful. My goal is to contribute meaningfully and gain experience. Does anyone have an ongoing project that could use an extra pair of hands, or perhaps know of such opportunities? I&#39;m open to discussing how I could help. Thanks for any leads or advice!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyber_consultant\"> /u/Cyber_consultant </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1kv",

Yes, they did announce this change in advance for many many years, but rolling it out on New Year\u2019s Day? Very thoughtful, Google. Soon after that rollout, they also removed the old reCAPTCHA configuration interface. So, when you logged into reCAPTCHA, you were redirected to the much more confusing Google Cloud Platform. And there is no way to get v2 keys anymore.</p> <p>However, my colleague just noticed last week that the old interface seems to have returned (we\u2019re not sure exactly when it happened).
