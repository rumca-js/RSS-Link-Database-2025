Currently, the AI landscape is booming, with tens of thousands of companies globally, ranging from nimble startups to divisions within tech giants, all vying for a piece of the AI pie.

For instance, AI therapist avatars could provide support between sessions by offering continuity, a calming presence, or even basic guidance when a human therapist isn&#39;t available. They could also help reinforce coping strategies, monitor mental health trends, or assist with psychoeducation.</p> <p>One of the most promising aspects, in my opinion, is how AI might expand access to mental health care. In regions where therapists are scarce or care is unaffordable, AI tools could provide scalable and cost-effective alternatives. As a French and European citizen, this interests me especially. In France, mental health services are often covered by public healthcare, sometimes entirely. But in many parts of the world, such services remain out of ",

Also most AI models are trained only on most popular stuff. More niche things are being picked up by AI much slower (I even use some exotic frameworks that AI has almost no idea about, despite being open source and on github, just not so popular as for example React - it knows these things exist, but it just can&#39;t work with them as there was no optimized training for it).</p> <p>In the future of AI agents I think this could be one of last things that would keep humans relevants.
