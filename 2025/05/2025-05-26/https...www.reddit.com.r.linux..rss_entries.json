The Q&amp;A session was also interesting: from a few of the replies, he doesn&#39;t seem to be as phased by the dilemma of LLM training data as much as by the uselessless of LLMs, and he explicitly declared he&#39;s completely fine with free (though not necessarily copyleft) software from big tech, such as the Microsoft .NET runtime.</p> <p>Recordings should be available soon!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chic",
