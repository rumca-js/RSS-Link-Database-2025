        "description": "<p>This was another triumphant day for south London in Wembley. Sunday brought <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/25/leyton-orient-charlton-league-one-playoff-final-match-report\">Charlton promotion to the Championship</a>; Monday took AFC Wimbledon back to League One after three years away, a bullet hit from Myles Hippolyte in first-half stoppage time enough to deny Walsall.</p><p>The contest was low on thrills but style is not what makes this occasion grand. Until Hippolyte found the bottom right corner, it had looked a match set for sudden death, likely to be decided by either Tommy Simkin or Owen Goodman, two impressive young goalkeepers. And while Walsall were shaken into action in the second half, Wimbledon\u2019s solidity shone through, Joe Lewis impenetrable in central defence. They celebrated victory and a clean sheet, just like they\u2019d done at this venue nine years ago, when they last advanced to the third tier.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/",

It\u2019s a thrilling yarn, featuring a tiny boat rented under the false pretences of a picnic on the Catalan coast, a bunch of guys who didn\u2019t really know how hard it would be to fix a giant sticker to a luxury yacht, and a chase scene at the end, as they raced back to their van, pursued by security guards.</p><p>But the original idea had been to requisition the boat and sail it all the way back to the UK, up the Thames, and deliver it to His Majesty\u2019s Treasury. There was an intake of breath in the book-loving audience, because this was the best idea anyone had ever heard. It had everything \u2013 audacity, symmetry, justice, spectacle, the lot.<",

It starts out as a serious well-researched drama about an army veteran with PTSD sleeping rough in Dublin, and ends in bloody revenge, with Aidan Gillen in ultraviolent mode and gangsters drilling holes into each other\u2019s kneecaps.</p><p>The movie is grounded by a rock solid performance from the film\u2019s co-writer Luke McQuillan as former soldier Danny, who loses his family and home after a tour in Afghanistan. There\u2019s a scene early on that feels horribly truthful about the day-to-day reality of being homeless: late one night, three lagered up youths humiliate Danny for a laugh \u2013 forcing him in front of the camera as they shove a coin into his hand.

While Sporting have won the Primeira Liga title without Amorim, United have fallen down the table to 15th since the Portuguese took the reins from the interim coach, Ruud van Nistelrooy. Much of the ire towards United has been directed at the owners but on the pitch Amorim has failed to adapt his squad of expensive, experienced internationals into anything approaching a cohesive unit. The Europa League final defeat by Tottenham showed how much work is left to do.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/26/premier-league-2024-25-review-flops-of-the-season\">Continue reading...</a>",

The book painted a thrilling picture of life among the Parisian <em>haute boh\u00e8me</em> in the early years of the 20th century. Picasso, Matisse, Scott Fitzgerald and Ezra Pound all made repeat appearances at the apartment in Rue de Fleurus which Stein shared with her partner Toklas. After decades of pushing language to its limits, Stein had written The Autobiography in a comparatively accessible style with jokes and anecdotes and full sentences. Or, as one relieved critic noted at the time, Gertrude Stein had finally started making sense.</p><p>In this thoughtful and deeply researched book, Francesca Wade explains that the success of The Autobiography had the unintended effect of moving the focus from Stein as a writer to Stein",
