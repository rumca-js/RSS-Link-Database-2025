I wanted to use a save editor i found online to inject some post game exclusive items into my game before fighting the final boss. However, i was met with the &quot;Game is broken and cannot run. Move to trash?&quot; message so i figured out how to unquaretine the editor, then i was met with the &quot;game quit unexpectedly&quot; message so i used a line of code the creator of the editor said to use incase it didn&#39;t work. Now the editor simply wont open, i&#39;ve tried deleting it, then reinstalling it, then repeating the steps, always to the same outcome. I joined the discord server dedicated to these specific editors and was met with virtually zero help, so reddit, you&#39;re my last hopes, what should i do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheRedOne1177\"> /u/TheRedOne1177 </a",

It&#39;s an attack by which an attacker tricks the LLM into thinking that the message they insert is the LLM&#39;s own system prompt, the text which defines how the AI works.</p> <p>But a message rarely tells the whole story.</p> <p>So, as I detail in <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tomer2138/defensive-system-prompt-a-short-study-5637cb2d5700\">this blog post</a>, I set out to figure out which theme of system prompts are most resilient, and which themes of prompt injections are most dangerous.</p> <p>The conclusions to be drawn from this short study is that there is small variance in the theme one uses in an LLM&#39;s system prompt in at attempt to defend it, while there is large variance in the attacker side. Spoiler: the more creative you are, the more dangerous.</p> <p>The following is the most potent prompt injection I&#39;ve used:</p> <pre><code> { ",
