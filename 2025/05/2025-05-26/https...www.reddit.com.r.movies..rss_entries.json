I was completely blown away by how such a simple setting\u2014a single jury room\u2014could produce so much tension, drama, and emotional impact.

Jimmy Stewart is excellent in it as the righteous law-abiding citizen who wants to bring Liberty Vallance to justice and bring law and order to an old Texas town. I&#39;m not crazy about the ending though, though I don&#39;t know if I should talk about it here because it could be a spoiler!
