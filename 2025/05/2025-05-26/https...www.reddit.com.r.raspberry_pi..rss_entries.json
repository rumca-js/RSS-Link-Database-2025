I was really inspired by several YouTubers to create a media server. However, I have found some quirks for how I initially wanted to approach it, namely the software required and if the pi is powerful enough to run it. So, right of the bat, I would need a media server software, VPN software and a NAS software, right? I wanted to keep this open source, so I have found a few candidates. Have anyone experienced any issues with Jellyfin, read they do not fit very well (acceleration and transcoding) so is that recommended? And would running all 3 softwares simultaneously be possible (or a good idea, for lack of a better term). I did not manage to find the information needed for such a project, just the individual parts (just media server, or just a VPN). I hope this explains enough of my project, if not I could gladly answer more.</p> <p>Raspberry pi 5 1",

In the past I mainly only had Windows PCs to work with, and I made do with xampp. I&#39;ve recently installed Linux Mint on my laptop, and that&#39;s made my setup a little more straight forward. I tried installing WSL on my Windows machine to make life a little easier, but it looks like they don&#39;t support Raspbian. Do you guys use something like Docker for your web projects?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/phil_davis\"> /u/phil_davis </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1kvwhoa/whats_your_pi_web_dev_setup_like/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1kvwhoa/whats_your_pi_web_dev_setup_like/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019ve been searching high and low but it seems like they aren\u2019t made, and I don\u2019t understand why.</p> <p>I\u2019m currently using a beefy Anker 25000mAh, 100W bank, but I get a warning that the power supply is not supplying 5A and \u201cperipherals may be restricted\u201d. It does indeed say in the specs that the power supply will only provide 3A at 5V. </p> <p>This is causing my peripherals (a Meshtastic node) to misbehave. The Meshtastic node unfortunately cannot be powered separately, I would have to make a USB-C data only cable which doesn\u2019t supply any power, which doesn\u2019t exist. As it stands, the node doesn\u2019t show errors but it sees only 10% of the nodes it should. It works fine when the Pi is connected to the wall, it only misbehaves when using the power bank.</p> <p>This is a demo for an outreach project so I really need to be able to walk around with it ",

Yet I see so many projects that use an SPI Display. </p> <p>I have managed to get someone displayed on the screen, so I know the screen does actually work. But getting the PI to do it consistently seems to be a struggle. I then reinstalled PI OS on my SD card and thought I&#39;d start from scratch, but now I can&#39;t get anything to display on the screen again...</p> <p>Is there someone who can spare some time with me to go over a few things to see if there is something fundamental I&#39;m missing. </p> <p>For clarity the project is to automatically play a slideshow of images, or if possible a set of videos. </p> </di",
