I got rid of windows from my PC. Last night I tried my using my Index. That was rough. Constant screen tearing, I couldn\u2019t figure out how to set the audio to the headsets built in headphones. It was rough, and reading about other\u2019s experiences. I think I have to go back to windows \ud83d\ude2d it\u2019s been real everyone. I\u2019ll definitely be back if and when it gets fixed. I understand VR isn\u2019t really built for Linux. Maybe someone knows a way around it. I Distro hopped as well. Started with Mint, went to Bazzite and I even built my own Arch Setup. If anyone knows a way to get VR to work nicely with Linux I\u2019d greatly appreciate it. I could just dual boot but I\u2019d rather just have the one OS on my PC tbh </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/toxicman768\"> /u/toxicman768 </a> <br/> <span>",
