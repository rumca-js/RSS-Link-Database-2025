Besides the environmental hazards of fire tornadoes, lava ponds, and explosive volcanoes, Moriana will also have six new enemies to contend with, culminating in a showdown with the Lord of the Underworld himself: the Devil. Not to worry, though, the introduction of three new abilities\u2014Frost Nova, Frost Bolt, and Blizzard\u2014will help her keep her cool. This update also introduces the skill tree mechanic, where",

Moriana and her undead minions will have to battle new enemies and survive the severe hazards of the underworld. Fire tornadoes, lava ponds, and explosive volcanoes all stand between Moriana and her destiny.</p><p>As you may have noticed, Moriana's p",
