If the package is presented to the Presidency of the Turkish Grand National Assembly in this manner, it will be made more difficult for LGBTI individuals to change their gender, those who change their gender without permission will be given a heavy prison sentence, it will be made a crime to hold a marriage ceremony among themselves, and the way will be paved for LGBTI+ individuals to be thrown into prison on the grounds of &quot;immoral behavior&quot;.",
