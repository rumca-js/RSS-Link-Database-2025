While it was failing to boot, <code>adb</code> was accessible. I decided to try <code>adb shell</code> in it. Android apparently has <code>vi</code> preinstalled, because of course it does. And while I was realizing I couldn&#39;t access <code>su</code>, I SOMEHOW typed <code>vi</code> and hit Enter. In one moment I realized what all these &quot;Can&#39;t exit vim&quot; memes were about. In one moment my ego shattered. Ctrl+C didn&#39;t work, Ctrl+Q didn&#39;t work, Ctrl+X didn&#39;t work.
