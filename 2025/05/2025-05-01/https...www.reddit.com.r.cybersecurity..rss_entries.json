I proceeded to ask more questions about the role but instead we setup a call for today, which was an hour ago. I regretfully sent him my resume at end of it all and now I have pie on my face. I reached out this morning because we never exchanged contact info, but he\u2019s been silent since I sent my resume.

I&#39;m ~6-7yrs into my cyber career so a hard pivot to something super hands-on will just get harder at this point. There are parts of GRC that I love, or I wouldn&#39;t be doing it.

If someone gains access to your OAuth token through any method, such as a browser exploit or device-level breach, ChatGPT will continue to accept that token silently for as long as it remains valid. No challenge is issued. No anomaly is detected. No session is revoked.</p> <p>Unlike platforms such as Google or Reddit, ChatGPT does not monitor for unusual token usage. It does not check whether the token is suddenly being used from a new device, a distant location, or under suspicious conditions. It does not perform IP drift analysis, fingerprint validation, or geo-based security checks. If two-factor authentication is not manually enabled on your ChatGPT account, then the system has no way to detect or block unauthorized OAuth usage.</p> <p>This is not about what happens after a password change. It is about what never happens at all. Other platforms immediately invalidate tokens",

I\u2019ve been thinking about making the jump to the reserves in the military as an officer with a cyber focus but getting into law enforcement as a full time career. I know the long term salary potential is lower than in cyber but the benefits are good and I wouldn\u2019t be sitting around all day.

I observed a similar situation when it comes to the use of header files. Instead of using the ones that already exists people make their own.
