It wasn&#39;t difficult to find the scammer&#39;s ID, and tomorrow I&#39;m going to the police station in my country to report it as a cybercrime.</p> <p>(The scammer threatened me because she knows my address. But I also know my address who cares lol)</p> <p>I know it probably isn&#39;t a big deal to people here, but for me this is a huge milestone, now I want to continue learning hacking. It&#39;s satisfying.</p> <p>And for those who are wondering, I didn&#39;t do anything illegal, I just used tools to find information that already existed and was hidden by VPNs and fake MPnn.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SomethingLikeCoxinha\"> /u/SomethingLikeCoxinha </a> <br/> <span><a hr",
