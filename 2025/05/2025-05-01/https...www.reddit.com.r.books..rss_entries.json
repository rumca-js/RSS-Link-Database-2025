Braffet\u2019s writing is beautifully unsettling, capturing the tangled, suffocating bond between the siblings as they navigate a world filled with secrets, neglect, and violence.</p> <p>What makes the book so compelling is its emotional complexity, neither Josie nor Jack is entirely good or bad, and as a reader, you\u2019re pulled into their world, feeling sympathy, repulsion, and confusion in equal measure.

The tone is strange, almost uncomfortable in a way. The story isnt really there, it&#39;s just one absurdist situation after another.</p> <p>I fully understand that it is intentionally so. Every scene is made to illustrate how pointless, inhuman and absurdist large bureaucracies can be and how disjointed from the everyday reality they can be. I get that, but I feel like it&#39;s doing it too much.</p> <p>If I had to say exactly why I dislike it, it would be that it feels like someone trying to reach a word count on an essay. A few situations at the start illustrate the main thesis of the book really well, and from then on it&#39;s just repeating and hammering on the same point, in the same way for another 2/3rds.
