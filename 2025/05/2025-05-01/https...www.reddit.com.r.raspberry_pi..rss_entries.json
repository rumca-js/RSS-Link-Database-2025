I\u2019m needing help. I got a Raspi4 the other day to allow me to stream games from my PC and PlayStation to anywhere in the house. Steam worked great! Issue I\u2019m facing is when I try to set up my PS5 on it via chiaki. </p> <p>As the title shows, I\u2019m successfully registered to the PS5, PS5 acknowledges when I connect to it via chiaki. After a few moments of opening the PS5 on chiaki i start receiving play station audio. But even 10 minutes later I have no video playback anywhere. When I press the D-pad on the PS5 controller connected to the raspi4, I can hear the movement from the PlayStation via menu noises. But again, no video playback.</p> <p>The error I keep getting, when ran in terminal, is \u201cAVCodec internal buffer is full removing frames before pushing\u201d repeating over and over.</p> <p>Ever so often I\u2019ll get \u201cctrl received heartbeat.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am trying to plan a Raspberry Pi project to allow me remotely control my pool&#39;s heat pump. Turning the pump on and off remotely is pretty straightforward - you simply connect to two terminals and open or close that circuit. But measuring temperatures is more complicated. There are terminals on the heat pump that allow me to measure the input and output water temperatures. They do this by providing me access to the electrical resistance of various thermistors. So when I put my multimeter on the contacts, I can measure the resistance, look that resistance up on a table, and determine the temperature. My understanding is that the Raspberry Pi can&#39;t directly measure analog signals. Do they make sensors compatible with Pi that measure electrical resistance? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tomvalois\"> /u/tomvalois </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1kbxpq",
