Although performed by a single actor, Krapp\u2019s Last Tape is not quite a monologue. It becomes a kind of dialogue between the 69-year-old Krapp and his recorded 39-year-old self, who in turn reflects on how he behaved in his late 20s.</p><p>It is, then, a tale of three Krapps. I\u2019ve sailed past two of those ages: next stop, 69!

The repatriation of a fictional 12th-century statue of a Chinese deity, carved in stone, forms the central dispute in Singaporean Joel Tan\u2019s play.</p><p>The Bodhisattva Guanyin reclines in the \u201croyal ease\u201d pose at one end of a traverse stage, designed by TK Hay, with a combination of screens and mirrors. The drama is formed of 12 distinct scenes, loosely connected around the statue. It begins choppily inside the British Museum with patronising or incendiary debate by protesters and curators, sometimes set beside flashes of 19th-century imperial history. The tone switches from serious-minded to satirical to gnomic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/may/01/scenes-from-a-repatr",

This year the runes will be harder to read because so many of the councils that are up are Conservative councils in Conservative areas. Few of the big cities are up, although some university cities and towns will be voting.</p><p>In contrast, the results will probably be read as judgment on the performance of the new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch.
