It\u2019s always some combo of sending a Google Form, Calendly link, Stripe invoice, and a bunch of emails\u2026 and it just feels unprofessional.</p> <p>So I built <a href=\"https://www.onboardsnap.com\"><strong>OnboardSnap</strong></a> \u2014 a free tool that lets you create a <strong>branded onboarding portal</strong> in 2 minutes. You can customize the intake questions, add your brand color, drop in your Calendly + Stripe links, and share a single, clean link with clients.</p> <p>The free MVP is live now and I\u2019d love feedback from other builders:</p> <ul> <li>What\u2019s confusing or missing?</li> <li>Would you actually use this yourself or recommend it to a freelancer?</li> <li>What would you need to upgrade to a paid plan later?</li> </ul> <p>Thanks in advance \ud83d\ude4f happy to give fe",

Walk 10,000 Steps a Day \u2014 It\u2019s Not Just a Buzzword</strong><br/> You don\u2019t need a gym membership to move. Take calls while walking. Do mini laps between tasks. Use movement as a way to de-stress instead of doom-scrolling.<br/> I try to do it daily \u2014 and yes, I use a fitness watch to track it.</p> <p>It\u2019s boring advice because it works.</p> <p><strong>2. Work Out 3\u20135 Times a Week (Even If It\u2019s Just 20 Minutes)</strong><br/> No 6-week program. No pressure. Just move your body.<br/> Pushups, squats, resistance bands \u2014 whatever fits your energy level that day.</p> <p>Done is better than perfect.
