        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nLooks like the damn has burst. Microsoft has announced that prices for Xbox hardware\u2014including consoles and peripherals\u2014will be going up, along with first-party game prices. The new prices vary, but if you haven't already purchased an Xbox Series X or S, expect to pay at least $100 more. It also places the very premium Series X 2TB Galaxy Special Edition at a higher price point than the already expensive PlayStation 5 Pro, without any enhanced hardware specs to show for it. And you can expect to pay around $80 for new first-party Xbox games like the next Call of Duty and the Perfect Dark reboot. In other news, the Epic Games v Apple saga might be coming to a close. A federal judge has ruled in Epic Games' favor, which paves the way for Fortnite to land back on iOS devices after a five-year hiatus. And finally, Helldivers 2 has plenty of updates planned, and developer Arrowhead's CEO is teasing that they'll make you s*** your pants. That's a direct quote.\n\n#IGN #G",

Here's your look at the vibrant world of Silicone Heart in this announcement trailer for the upcoming adventure sandbox game. \n\nSurvive on a mysterious scrap planet, where rusted machinery and broken robots are your only neighbors. In this adventure sandbox, you'll recycle resources, repair machines, invent new devices, and even cultivate bizarre plants to uncover the secrets of this strange world.\n\nYou are the last human on the planet. To survive, you must pretend to be a robot\u2014or be destroyed. You are the only mechanic, which means you'll become a \"healer\" for machines\u2014and for some, even a necromancer. After all, who else can bring robots back to life from piles of scrap? Will you find a home here? Build a workshop, unravel the planet\u2019s mysteries, and perhaps save your missing wife\u2014it\u2019s all in your hands.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

        "description": "La Quimera's Early Access version reviewed by Justin Koreis on PC.\n\nLa Quimera is bad, but it\u2019s also a perfect example of how even something bad can have a bit of charm. The writing is cringey, the acting is embarrassing, and the middling but serviceable action tends to follow the same basic loop on repeat \u2013 but if some friends are riding this partially derailed train with you, there is still some fun to be found here. It doesn\u2019t quite hit \u201cso bad, it\u2019s good\u201d levels of jank, but it could still be a decent candidate for an evening of goofs.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
