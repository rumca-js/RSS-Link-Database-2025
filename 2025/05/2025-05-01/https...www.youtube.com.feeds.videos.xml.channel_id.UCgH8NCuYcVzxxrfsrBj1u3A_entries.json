        "description": "This is the second part of my foray into the artist that is Benson Boone. I've reviewed one of his songs before, but my Producer wanted me to listen to his latest work, \"Mystical, Magical\". Maybe I'd done something to upset her. It's too 'Pop' for my liking, but it reminded me of the classic 80's hit, \"Physical\". I later discovered that its writers were credited on this. Who knew? Well, I do now. \n\nTo hear the whole track, visit: https://youtu.be/U8QhB8_0t2g?si=6ITUiROUtU8gJK--\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe new Darkness \"Dreams On Toast\" is available now: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #musicreview #bensonboone",
