The only flaw i&#39;ve found is the speed of the browser compared to chrome or in rare cases when i&#39;d use Edge. Something about it has always caught my attention and made me question &quot;why is it going slower than normal?&quot;</p> <p>After recent posts about which browser is the fastest I now see where Firefox stands and although it isn&#39;t bad, it still pains me that there&#39;s a faster competitor. Thoughts on Brave? What would be pros/cons leaving Firefox for brave, if any at all.</p> <p>I see much praise for Firefox and even more for its community in other browsers running on Firefox engine.
