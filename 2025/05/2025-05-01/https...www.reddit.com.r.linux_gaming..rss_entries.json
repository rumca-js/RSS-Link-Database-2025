I recently learned about duel booting and had a question here. I would solely install windows for maplestory. Typically when i game i watch youtube (which is fine). Other times i download videos, mods or games. </p> <p>Would it be possible to acces my linux side from the windows side? As in download videos for the linux side or download games. If i were to interact with linux like this it would mean i can main linux and simply switch for maplestory and return when im done (or want to play another game). </p> <p>With kind regards, Martijn</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lightykiller\"> /u/Lightykiller </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1kclfef/manage_linux_side_from_windows_in_duel_boot/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre",

I received great feedback on that post that helped guide additional troubleshooting steps and of course, that led to more questions.</p> <p>To provide a specific example, I&#39;ve been playing Guild Wars 2 and I noticed that there&#39;s a difference of approximately 30-50% in areas that stress the CPU. When comparing CPU usage between Windows and Linux, I noticed that the overall CPU utilization is down in Linux (GPU is not 100% because this is a CPU-limited game). In Windows, the top two threads that are being used by the game are pegged at approximately 80% whereas in Linux, the top two threads are pegged at just under 50%. What options are available to force the system to leverage the CPU more?</p> <p>System: Linux Mint 22.1, Kernal 6.11, CPU 7800X3D, Nvidia 3060Ti (driver v570). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#",

However, I really like DLAA.</p> <p>My PC has a Ryzen 7 5800X, and I play at 1440p. I am interested in getting an AMD graphics card because I have noticed that DX12 games perform poorly on Linux. Additionally, I hope this will help me finally get VR working on Linux.</p> <p>Is it worth selling my 3080 Ti to buy a 7900 XT in the next few months? If so, how much should I sell my current graphics card for, and what would be a fair price for the 7900 XT? Will my configuration be bottlenecked at 1440p or at 2880 x 1600 in VR?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/reivb\"",
