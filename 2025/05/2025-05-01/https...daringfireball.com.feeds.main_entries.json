It is excoriating. I\u2019ve read few legal decisions quite like it. But it\u2019s also incredibly cogent and plainly written.</p>\n\n<p>From the start:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To summarize: <em>One</em>, after trial, the Court found that Apple\u2019s 30\npercent commission \u201callowed it to reap supracompetitive operating\nmargins\u201d and was not tied to the value of its intellectual\nproperty, and thus, was anticompetitive. Apple\u2019s response: charge\na <em>27 percent commission</em> (again tied to nothing) on off-app\npurchases, where it had previously charged nothing, and extend the\ncommission for a period of seven days after the consumer\nlinked-out of the app. Apple\u2019s goal: maintain ",
