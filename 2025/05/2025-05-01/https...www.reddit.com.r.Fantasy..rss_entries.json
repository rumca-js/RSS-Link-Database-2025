In Realm of the Elderlings, Fitz bonds with the wolf Nighteyes and their relationship is one of the highlights of the series.

I am not sure what i can add to conversation but its a fun but sad story about the end of earth and Carl and his girlfriends cat, Princess Donut, journey into an video game like intergalatic reality tv show. The set up and humour gave me Hitchhikers Guide vibes in the best way possible. The audiobook and narrators did a great job of voicing Carl and the Princess. Deffintely a recommend and look a credit just dropped on audible for me so maybe my next one will be part two. </p> <p>This is my first time actually participating in the Bingo. I think this qualifies for both Impossible Places (characters get pulled into a mmo style dungeon) and Stranger in a Strangeland (the dungeon certainly is strange). I also think its hard mode for both as they enter dungeon almost immediately and are running from the literal end of earth. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",
