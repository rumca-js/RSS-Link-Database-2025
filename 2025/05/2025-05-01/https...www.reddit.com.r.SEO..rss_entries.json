First of all, thanks everyone who replied -- this has been very helpful. Without going into all details again, the question was about possible reasons for the search traffic dropping to zero on a new (4 weeks old) site after the initial spike. I thought that it was related to republishing of a few articles. But I just realized today that I also have a couple of places where I show headers (news, jobs) pulled from external RSS feeds. Just headers, no text excerpts. One of these places is my main page, others - two standalone page.
