To take her mind off labor pain, we watched one of her favorite cheesey movies - <em>50 First Dates</em>. As we watched it, I picked up on something I hadn&#39;t noticed in previous viewings.</p> <p>There is a scene where Drew Barrymore&#39;s character Lucy invites her dad and brother to watch <em>The Sixth Sense</em>, which is new to her but not them (due to her memory problems). When talking about it afterwards, Lucy says something like &quot;I can&#39;t believe Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time!&quot;, thus spoiling the ending of that movie. </p> <p>It caught me off guard because it was so blatant. But that got me wondering: are there other examples of a movie spoiling a different, completely unrelated movie? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/G_Force\"> /u/G_Force </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

If you as an actor are the one beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak ocean of mediocrity, you have done your job ten times over. </p> <p>So, what are the best examples?</p> <p>I will die on this hill but Rami Malek as Freddy Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody absolutely deserved every single ounce of praise that he got. The movie as a whole is wildly inconsistent and definitely is not a great film especially in terms of honouring the legacy of a band as iconic and truly legendary as Queen, but Maleks performance I will to the hilt defend because he put everything he had into the portrayal.

But if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m pretty sure we all can agree on, is that zack synder is a visual fx genius. Rewatching all the action scenes in crisp 4k is a very breathtaking and immersive experience. It blows my mind on how everything went downhill after the release of BVS. I do however think it\u2019s fair to say, synder had a pretty good run with DC though.
