Should I just play Skull King? Also, I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on some of the other games in their line-up in the Wizard family, particularly Druids and Witches. Are they worth getting? They both are evasion style trick taking games. Witches seems to be a Hearts variant where witches are similar to hearts with some scoring differences (i.e. you don&#39;t want to win witches, but you can shoot the moon if you win them all). In druids, for every trick you win, you sort them by color and lie them in-front of you. You lose as soon as you have a pile representing each color.

It feels kind of unbalanced. Like, there\u2019s no real way to stop other players from completing their objectives, and sometimes I end up helping someone else win without meaning to.</p> <p>Also, isn\u2019t the whole game basically decided by the captain picking the missions? The captain just chooses the easiest or best ones for themselves, and then that\u2019s it. There&#39;s no point in playing out the round.</p> <p>Is this secretly some me",

The good news is that the estimated manufacturing completion date is May 25th. The bad news:</p> <p>\u201cAt the time of our last update, US tariffs on goods imported from China stood at 20%. Since then, they&#39;ve risen dramatically to 145%, and the situation remains unstable. As a reminder, this means that all goods shipped to the US that were made in China will be charged an additional 145% (based on the manufacturing cost of the goods being shipped).</p> <p>We had originally planned to absorb the full tariff costs ourselves. However, with this new, much higher rate, it&#39;s unfortunately not possible without severely impacting the future of Roc Nest Games. If the tariffs remain at the current level, we intend to move forward with shipping Chroma Arcana to the US while passing on a portion of these tariff charges to our US customers.\u201d</p> </di",

I&#39;ve found a strategy that works 90% of the time and it involves selling your fields... Well 2 of them, right at the beginning. Basically I try to get good vines, a 3 red and a 3 white is excellent, but I&#39;ve also done it with a singular 1red 1white vine card too, just takes longer. Basically the strat is to sell your fields early to get both cellar upgrades, then fish for champagne or blush orders as they give the most points. Harvest every year and combine them into the higher quality champagne/blush to make orders. You just don&#39;t need 3 fields. 1 is absolutely enough and money earlier is like gold. I played a 4 player game the other day and I won before 2 players got off the start. I was very lucky in my draws though in that game.</p> <p>Now to get the expansions and see if it still holds up</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",

Monsters (in this box they are not from classical horror movies, but instead a weird mix: sphinx, yeti, jiangshi, Cthulhu - why specifically those ones? They have nothing in common) terrorize town, so you need to pick items all over the map and deliver them to certain locations to defeat them. And rescue civilians along the way, of course.</p> <p>The only really interesting element of Horrified are antagonists: pretty thematic monsters, each with its own mini-game of how you can defeat it. For example, to defeat sphinx you need to &quot;solve the riddle&quot; by laying out numbers (items have numbers on them) in certain order to fit sudoku-like math puzzle. To defeat yeti you need to pick her children stolen by humans and bring them to her.</p> <p>Otherwise however mechanics are very simplistic and nothing special to write about.</p> <p>This part of Horrified series is significantly ",
