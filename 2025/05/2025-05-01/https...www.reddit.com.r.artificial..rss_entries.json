They scrape by at the last minute to get something together and struggle to ship it, and even then there are glaring errors in their codebase? And meanwhile the strongest developers on your team only occasionally run a prompt or two to get through a creative block, but almost never mention it, and rarely see it as a silver bullet whatsoever? I have a theory that a lot of the noise we hear about x% (30% being the most recent MSFT stat) of code already being AI-written, is actually coming from the wrong end of the organization, and the folks that prevail will actually be the non-AI-reliant developers that simply have really strong DSA fundamentals, good architecture principles, a reasonable amount of experience building production-ready services, and know how to reason their way through a complex prob",

As a programmer (and someone who&#39;s written a few unpublished books myself!), my main drive for building Varu AI actually came from wanting to <em>read</em> specific stories that didn&#39;t exist yet, and knowing I couldn&#39;t possibly write them all myself. I thought, &quot;What if AI could help write some of these ideas, freeing me up to personally write the ones I care most deeply about?&quot;</p> <p>So, I ran an experiment to see how quickly it could generate a novel-length first draft.</p> <h2>The experiment</h2> <p>The goal was speed: could AI generate a decent novel-length draft quickly? I set up Varu AI with a basic premise (inspired by classic sci-fi tropes: a boy on a mining colony dreaming of space, escaping on a transport ship to a space academy) and let it generate scene by scene.</p> <p>The process took about 30 minutes of act",
