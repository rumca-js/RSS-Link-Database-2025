It\u2019s more like \u201cok nice, looks cool, but nothing more\u201d and then prefer the normal monitor. I don\u2019t have the feeling being inside the game / room. Tried different games like MsFs, X-Plane, Subnautica, Alien Isolation. But still the same problem\u2026 Does anyone have the same problem? Do you have any recommendations for improvements?

I really want an upgrade or atleast something with really high build quality. Since it seems the whole industry is leaving lighthouse tracking behind interms of controllers atleast, its been pretty hard to find replacements. My dream controller is the meta quest pro ones tracked with base stations. I found the flipvr ones which does look pretty good, however i don&#39;t know, so if theres anyone out there that actually have them and use them, pls tell me your expierence.

Got a Meta Quest 3 and in the frist two days I was very excited, I was impressed by the immersion. After a few days I really like watching movies in cinema (bigscreen beta), but gaming standalone mode just meh..... Mostly like you in a nintendo game. It&#39;s cool do not get me wrong, but after 30 mins I&#39;m just not interested. (ofcourse the immersion still amazing). Sim racing was the idea why I wanted start PCVR, but now I realized as I don&#39;t want to participate to buying expensive hardwares. For me it just not worth that money to play VR 2 (max 3) hour. I was always a PC player never had console. These days I just woke up playing one round warzone then leave, then later one round Apex/sim racing then leave and that&#39;s it for a day.<br/> Can not decide maybe good idea to switch console(PS5) or just gaming not for me ? BUT !! Important because all my life I sat down to play (35yrs old ) I can",
