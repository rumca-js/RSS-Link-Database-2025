Last week, thanks in part to messages from EFF supporters, the Washington legislature passed a strong consumer electronics right-to-repair legislation through both the House and Senate. The bill affirms our right to repair by banning restrictions that keep people and local businesses from accessing the parts, manuals, and tools they need for cheaper, easier repairs. It joined another strong right-to-repair bill for wheelchairs, ensuring folks can access the parts and manuals they need to fix their mobility devices. Both measures now head to Gov. Bob Ferguson. If you\u2019re in Washington State, please urge the governor to sign these important bills.</p>\n<p class=\"take-action\"><a href=\"https://act.eff.org/action/washington-speak-up-for-your-right-to-repair-a3bfb558-8996-47d6-8780-7f24c4dc0778\">TAKE ACTION<",
