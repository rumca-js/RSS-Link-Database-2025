Don&#39;t get me wrong, i would be happy if a solar storm destroyed all forms of technology, i would know what to do and how to defend myself if necessary, but the fact that the masses are romanticizing this thing is laughable, they would absolutely not be able to survive if not by killing each other in a case similar to the one that occurred on September 1, 1859. I think that blackout was a social experiment, like covid, to see the response in the short term of the people. What do you think about it?

The contents are as stated, but I believe there is a good reason to believe that this note is either not the real deal or that they forced her to write it during the event. Here is my reasoning:</p> <p>1) The photo of the note is cut off before a third paragraph would be seen. It seems like they either intentionally cut off a third paragraph or else they would have included more context. If it was a ripped off piece of a page, they&#39;d have shown the rest of the page.</p> <p>2) There is no signature. Who puts out a suicide note with no signature? Seems odd at the least.</p> <p>3) Getting into why I think they may have forced her to write this note, the characteres &quot;we&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are all crossed out. Considering &quot;wet work&quot; refers to paid assassination, it seems maybe she left us a hint.</p> <p>Even without these clues, this case seems extrem",
