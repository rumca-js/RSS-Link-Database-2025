Unfortunately I only downloaded a few comics from it I was interested at that time and now I am very interested reading some more of the early Marvel comics, but I care a lot about authenticity when reading older comics and so Marvel Unlimited is no option since many things are changed.</p> <p>I searched around for a while now and am unable to find this torrent again and don&#39;t know the name of it anymore, so could someone give me some hints if something like this is still out there and what to look for? If not a whole Marvel archive also individual series like Fantastiy Four from 1961 on and the same for X-Men, Iron Man and so on would also be a good start.</p> <p>Thanks :-) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
