I have been single for years now and I am starting to feel less motivated to even try to date or find someone because I haven&#39;t been asked out in 5 years. I used to get attention but once I gained some weight from a new medication I became invisible and I can&#39;t seem to lose the weight. My confidence took a hit and now everyone&#39;s advice to me is to be more confident to be attractive but it feels impossible to be confident when no one wants you (the cycle keeps going). </p> <p>I would like a self-help book but I would also take fiction recomendations. </p> <p>I really appreciate any suggestions because I have browsed the popular self-help books and I never found anything that mixed self-love with dating.

Long ago I read the novella &quot;Elder Race&quot; by Adrian Tchaikovsky about a human scientist in the far future stranded on a remote, primitive world where the locals regard him as a &quot;wizard&quot; and it was a fantastic story with a nice twist at the end on the concept of &quot;aliens&quot;.</p> <p>More recently I&#39;ve picked up the Intergalactic Wizard Scout Chronicles by Rodney Hartman, about a magic-using human soldier from an intergalactic empire who deals with magic, elves, demons and so on from other galaxies. It&#39;s decent, but not really the great writing I&#39;m looking for.</p> <p>Do you have any good suggestions in this sub-genre?
