This includes a home page, metube, freshrss, tandoor and a few more. After all of that was done, I thought it&#39;d be a great idea to gather all of the logs &amp; metrics from the separate LXC&#39;s and docker containers together and aggregate them for alerting when errors go off or any other rules I need to setup there. </p> <p>I&#39;ve searched through this subreddit and a few others and can&#39;t seem to find a solid way to get started. So the question: how can I gather logs and metrics from multiple sources in the scenario listed above? &amp; as a bonus, what self-hosted application(s) would help display all this information and include alerts? </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I built yet another ticket and project management called FlowInquiry. At the beginning, it is a ticket management tool with workflow SLAs and notifications (email + WebSocket), based on my own frustrations trying to manage team requests and collaboration at work.</p> <p>Later, after getting feedbacks from others, I added a project mannagement module with simple Kanban view. FlowInquiry is still young, and I would love to hear your feedback to improve, what features are essential for you to consider using FlowInquiry? I would like to keep FlowInquiry simply, clean UI, user friendly and constant adding the new features per customer&#39;s feedback.</p> <p>Here is my github project: <a href=\"https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry\">https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry</a></p> <p>PS: You can self-host it with Docker using a single command. More deployment options will come.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",

I am using a self hosted Netbird instance in the cloud and I am only able to achieve relayed connections. I believe this is because my ISP is blocking something, because on different ISPs I am able to achieve a P2P connection no problem, including those that use CG-NAT.</p> <p>The relayed connection is surprisingly fast and I wouldn&#39;t mind sticking with that; however, it will drop connection every 30 minutes or so and during that time my management service URL will be blocked for approximately 5 minutes and then be accessible again.</p> <p>Is there any type of obfuscation I can apply that would work? I&#39;ve tried a shadowsocks proxy using v2ray hosted on the same server, but I&#39;m not sure how to go about routing all the Netbird client traffic through that.
