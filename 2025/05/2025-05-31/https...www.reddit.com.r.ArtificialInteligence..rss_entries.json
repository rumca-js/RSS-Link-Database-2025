The people I know that smiled when they saw Midjourney art in 2022 have their jaws drop when they see what it can do today. That is in less than 5 years. With chatgpt its like you have a lawyer, doctor and a therapist all in one place. Its going great so far. The way I see it. In the right hands, AI will make the world better.

The problem is that proving something is not an outbreak is difficult, because an investigation into something like this will be led by law enforcement or military agencies, not public health or technology teams, and they may be incentivized to believe an attack is more likely to be real than it actually is. <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/artificial-intelligence-bioterrorism-deepfake-public-health-threat/\">https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/artificial-intelligence-bioterrorism-deepfake-public-health-threat/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mysterious-Dig-6928\"> /u/Mysterious-Dig-6928 </a> <br/> <span><a h",

Can it predict what our lineages would look like? What if we gave it all of our market data? All of our space data? Maybe we may not have enough data for the AI to get truly good at predicting those things but at what point will it? Is that what we are? A bunch of patterns?

It\u2019s hard to imagine robots running into burning buildings with the same effectiveness and judgment as trained firefighters. But what if fires become far less common? With smart homes that use AI to monitor temperature changes, electrical anomalies, and even gas leaks, it\u2019s not far-fetched to imagine systems that detect and suppress fires before they grow.

However the more I work with AI, the more I realize how essential philosophy is to the process. I\u2019ve often thought about going back to finish my philosophy degree, not for credentials, but to deepen my understanding of human behavior, ethics, and how intelligence is constructed.</p> <p>When designing an AI agent, you\u2019re not just building a tool. You\u2019re designing a system that will operate in different states such as decision making states, adaptive states, reactive states. That means you\u2019re making choices about how it should interpret context and many other aspects. </p> <p>IMHO AI was and still is at its core a philosophy of human behavior at the brain level. It\u2019s modeled on neural networks and cognitive frameworks, trying to simulate aspects of how we think and do things. But even before the technical layer, there\u2019s a philosophical layer.</p> <p>Anyone else here with a STEM backgroun",
