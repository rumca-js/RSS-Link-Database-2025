I installed Linux Mint, went to the Driver Manager, installed the 570 version of the driver and then setup my screens (I have dual monitor setup but the bug is not related). I set my main screen 144hz on 1920x1080 and then the screen went very pixelated and in 30hz at most. If I set the screen to 120hz it works fine, no issues whatsoever. So I can keep it like that, but here comes the other issue: wanted to try Bazzite being a gaming distro, this one came with the driver preinstalled, set the monitor, same issue: pixelated and 30hz, but here if I set the screen to 120hz it just goes no signal, everything between 60 and 144 doesn&#39;t work, and 144hz is broken.</p> <p>Anyone had this issue before?
