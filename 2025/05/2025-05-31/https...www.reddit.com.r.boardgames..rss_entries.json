When it was built, they thought they would get 10 Victory Points, because the color of the VP symbol on the tile is purple, which matches the purple on the 10 victory point chip. </p> <p>I personally think it&#39;s supposed to be just 1 VP, but I can&#39;t deny that the colors match, and the VP icon on the bottom card for example is a different color. So that led us to believe that maybe the colors of the VPs do mean something? But if it was supposed to be 10 VP, why wouldn&#39;t they print a 10 over the icon, like the 3 on the icon at the bottom of the tile?</p> <p>Hopefully someone has some insight here! Thanks!</p> </",

Just have a couple of questions folks with some playtime may be able to answer for me.</p> <ol> <li><p>Normal rules are that win conditions equal 6 classes. In the xpac rules it states you add 1 class to win condition. If you own both xpacs, do you just add another (thus 8)?</p></li> <li><p>I&#39;m having a get together tomorrow with 7 people and have read some house rules to help speed up play. I&#39;d love any thoughts on house rules to help with this. One of them was to reduce the number of action points to make turns go faster.. not sure how this would work with the ability to swap out your hand for 3 AP.</p></li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Great_Veterinarian19\"> /u/Great_Veterinarian19 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kzm0gk/here_to_slay_new_player_w_questions_about_7/\">[link]</a",
