        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi y&#39;all, I enjoy fantasy and sci-fi and have only heard good things about The Broken Earth series. However, I have a little pet peeve: I love complex universes and mozaic storytelling, but detest the Boredom Trifecta\u2122 of dreams, flashbacks and visions. One dream to show the subconscious of a character? Sure. A flashback to explain a characters actions? I&#39;ll deal. A single vision to foreshadow the plot or mislead the reader? Fine. But some books are speckled with them. To give examples (without spoilers) Bran&#39;s chapters in the Game of Thrones series killed me and, (despite the first book recieved a 5-star rating) it took me months to get through Brandon Sanderson&#39;s third book of the Stormlight Archives and I have put the series on hold for this reason. </p> <p>So, before I invest time and energy into the Broken Earth trilogy, can you tell me how prevelent dreams. Visions and flashbacks are in this series? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",

It feels like one to me though. It\u2019s set in a fictional medieval town, there are improbable events, and there\u2019s a witch. It\u2019s my favorite book I read last year. It\u2019s also extremely twisted. I picked it up because LOTR obsessive Airplane Facts With Max sang its praises on Instagram. He didn\u2019t address his thoughts on whether he considered it a fantasy though. Maybe it\u2019s a folk horror book? Or historical fiction? The fact that it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into an established category is part of the appeal, but I\u2019m curious if anyone here that\u2019s read it has thoughts about what this book even is. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Exquisitr\"> /u/Exquisitr </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1kzyp81/any_thoughts_on_lapvona/\">[link]</a></span> ",

The moment someone voices support for one or criticizes the other, the comment section explodes with tribal loyalty.

(in Europe)</p> <p>I looked at Kobo Plus and Everand/Scribd, but neither is a good option for me (Kobo seems to have no books from my TBR, and Everand is limited to like 2 books a month before it locks the other books away). I&#39;d like to try Kindle Unlimited next, but it is unclear whether that will work (living in Europe, but would like the US version because of the books in English).</p> <p>Do you have any other good suggestions? I&#39;m moving to France, and I don&#39;t know how good the English collection is in the local libraries. I prefer legal options. I read a lot (usually 10-20 books a month, currently mostly from the local library), so buying individual (e)books would be a bit pricey.</p> <p>To give an idea of the books I&#39;d like to read, here&#39;s a part of my TBR:</p> <ul> <li>Malazan</li> <li>Powdermage</li> <li>The black company</li> <li>Red rising</li> <li>Gentleman bas",

Some people described the ending being one of the best etc. etc. and while I do agree that it was good, I think midway across the 3rd book, I got kind of tired of it. Just wanted it to end.</p> <p>Now onto the spoilers.</p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">The good</span></p> <ul> <li><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">A really big thing theme of this series is forgiveness, because understanding that people might do bad things for good reason is important. We saw it when Wirr understood why Aryn controlled Elocien. Btw, The Arryn and Elocien reveal literally made my jaw drop. It was so good. And it made so much sense, and extremely realistic as people don\u2019t suddenly just change. The forgiveness theme is the most obvious in the story with Caeden obviousl",
