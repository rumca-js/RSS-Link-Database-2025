But that&#39;s okay, the ending is still very much satisfying.</p> <p>But still a very great movie with beautiful animation, emotionally driven story, and powerful message about learning to work together and not let prejudice get in the way that I think is very important right now.</p> <p>RIP Judith Barsi.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Minute-Necessary2393\"> /u/Minute-Necessary2393 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1l0a3b8/the_land_before_time_is_a_classic/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.r",

Apart from it being a bloody amazing blockbuster, I\u2019d forgotten just how great Bill Paxton is in the everyman role.</p> <p>It got me thinking about how you don\u2019t really see that kind of actor in cinema these days. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014Bill Paxton was a good-looking guy\u2014but a lot of actors today are too manicured, shredded to the absolute lowest body fat percentage, and just don\u2019t feel like someone you&#39;d see on the street who could pull off the same role.</p> <p>Obviously, Glen Powell was the male lead in Twisters, and he was really good, but he wasn\u2019t aiming for that everyman role\u2014instead, he went for the YouTube influencer type.</p> <p>There&#39;s still everyman actors out there, but they&#39;re from generations before and a lot older now (Costner, Keaton, Quaid, William H. Macy, for example). So who do we have as the next crop to take the mantle?</p> <p>EDIT: There&#39;s a lot",

A good example of this might be Batman vs Superman\u2026.or maybe someone might have a better example. </p> <p>But movies like the dark knight have an epic OST from beginning to end, anything with \u201chans zimmer\u201d attached to it, is already going to be good. Another film that comes to the top of my head is \u201cface off\u201d with John travolta and cage.

Such a fabulous character for her - I can&#39;t recall ever seeing her in a similar role previously.</p> <p>Everyone involved with the film should be proud of what they created.
