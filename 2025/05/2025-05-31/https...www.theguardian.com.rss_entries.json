Until summer starts knocking, that is. The sun makes me want to slow down, and I find myself wanting a variation of vegetables <em>agrodolce</em> on repeat. Agrodolce is Italian for sour (<em>agro</em>) and sweet (<em>dolce</em>), which in my kitchen translates to a pile of meltingly soft vegetables, all slick with olive oil, sweet with onions, and cut with vinegar and capers. Often, this takes the form of my husband Hugh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/22/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-caponata\">oven-baked caponata</a>, but I also love the comfort of squash and the liquorice sweetness of the cooked fennel here.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/31/squash-fennel-agrodolce-",
