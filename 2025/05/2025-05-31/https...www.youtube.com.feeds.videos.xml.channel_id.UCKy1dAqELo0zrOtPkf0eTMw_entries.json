Whether it\u2019s the compelling job grind while hanging around town, building your own community, or the more action-packed exploration and combat, I found myself continually surprised by what this adventure threw at me the longer I played. I was happily sinking hours into chopping down trees and picking flowers, and got oddly invested in its goofy but compelling story. As far as having your time stolen goes, you could do a whole lot worse than Fantasy Life i.\n\n#FantasyLifeITheGirlWhoStealsTime #Review #IGN",

        "description": "Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch! This week, Logan is on a very special assignment, so it's just Daemon, Max, and Ryan. The topic: their biggest hopes and deepest fears for the Nintendo Switch 2. We're hoping the Switch 2 can maintain momentum with third-parties, especially considering the Switch 2 is closer in parity to the other current-gen consoles, than the Switch 1 was to the PS4 and Xbox One. And we're all worried that everyone Switch owners biggest fear could return: Joy-Con drift. We also ahve last week's poll results, and a new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.\n\nAnd don't forget to buy tickets to IGN Live happening in Downtown Los Angeles next week, June 7-8.
