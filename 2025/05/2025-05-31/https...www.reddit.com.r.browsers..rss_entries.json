        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve recently found out that Microsoft has a rewards system with Edge which allows you to earn points for searching in the browser, and you can gather these points to redeem rewards. I mainly use Chrome since it was the only one I was aware of, but I&#39;m wondering whether it&#39;s worth completely switching to Edge, as I would earn significantly more points and gain more rewards, given that I receive nothing when searching with Chrome.</p> <p>Are there any browsers out there like Edge with a similar rewards system, perhaps even better?

Either because of the excessive consumption of computing resources or because of additional features that I don&#39;t use. I ended up using Safari lately, and since I&#39;m a web developer I&#39;ve been using Brave because it&#39;s Chrome based for programming. But at the moment, although Safari is in theory very optimized, I&#39;ve been having some difficulties using Safari for some work tools. It seems to create a certain stuttering, and it doesn&#39;t load some things properly. And there are certain things I don&#39;t like. So I&#39;m here looking for a browser. Light, without unnecessary features. I&#39;m only interested in support for extensions and multiple profiles. And if possible, Chrome based.
