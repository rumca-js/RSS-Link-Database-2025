I am in canada last five years I have worked as a .net developer for a year then I got laid off After that I am supporting my husband\u2019s small business. Now again I am thinking to go back to my IT field. But I don\u2019t want to do more coding side. So I am thinking to start Cybersecurity learning so from facebook I reached some paid courses. And they suggested me to go for Business analyst as well now I am confusing what should I choose. I just need future Job security and good career. All paid courses team suggesting me go for BA some others are go for CS. Can you guys please help me here? If there is anyone from Cybersecurity please suggest me how to start from scratch, do i need certification from very first, how\u2019s the job market for junior positions or what should I do ? Which one should i choose for quick job ?</p> <p>Same suggestions for BA as well. Thank you\ud83d\ude42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

He&#39;s just about to go into high school. I&#39;ve done some quick searches and have seen some such as springboard or one week camps. However, I am looking for something that could occupy a majority of his summer and directed to maybe intro to maybe spark a interest in something technology related. I am open to other courses as well, such as python, sql etc. </p> <p>Thank you for the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Leather-Screen7263\"> /u/Leather-Screen7263 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1kzopev/online_courses_for_teens/\">[link]<",
