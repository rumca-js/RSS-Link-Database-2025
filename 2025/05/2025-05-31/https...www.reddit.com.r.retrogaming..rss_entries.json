When I&#39;m playing NES games and suddenly switch to GBA game, it feels overstimulating. GBA games are more addicting. I will play a NES/SNES game for 1 hour and I&#39;m done and I&#39;m satisfied. But GBA games I can play for hours. It&#39;s like there were as many psychologists as programmers working on those games. You already have those addicting mechanics there which are making you hooked on the game: rpg-like elements, gaining coins in order to buy power-ups, spending more time in menu instead of playing in order to setup this and that, etc. Also because it&#39;s a 32-bit console, there will be more visual effects which is also kind of narcotic.</p> <p>Just want to highlight this is more in comparison to older games (NES/SNES/GB/GBC) which give that contrast. If I played solely GBA games I wouldn&#39;t even notice it probably.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has similar tho",
