I didn&#39;t know where to post this, so I decided to do it here; sorry if it does not fit the subreddit&#39;s &quot;atmosphere&quot;. Anyway, I have been recently thinking about buying a tablet which I&#39;d use to read my comics/books, since I am definitely neither a fan of reading on a phone or on PC. Though I have actually thought of buying a Kindle, but the main problem is that most are sold for 100\u20ac+ on any local marketplace and I am certainly not ready to spend that much on something I can only wonder whether it works. I read that due to having different display, Kindle does not cause one to have eye-strain, which is, considered by many tablet users, a regular thing when using a tablet for reading. I am kind of stuck in position now, but want to somehow change the situation I am in. Thanks in advance for any comment!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/banjaninn\"> /u/banjaninn </a>",

I can&#39;t walk, stand or drive for long periods and thanks to my job firing me for getting injured on the job I haven&#39;t had much money coming in (thankfully workers compensation is at least helping) so everything has to be rationed. I&#39;m also going in for a back infusion this June so things are going to get even tighter for me.</p> <p>Enough of the sad backstory shit though, I joined this sub not to long ago once I couldn&#39;t afford all my streaming services anymore thanks to my injury. But I studied this sub as much as I could, read old posts, checked the Megathread, learned about SoulSeek, learned about FitGirl/Others and learned even more about VPNs and Internet safety and security while torrenting. I&#39;ve finally today learned about Stremio and Real-Debrid which finally is my replacement for how things used to be with the added benefit of Live TV.</p> <p>All of you, pa",

He would go into the browser&#39;s network view and use a tool to download the delivered video file. Eventually one of these sites wised up and this no longer works. Now the browser still requests those files, but for whatever reason a direct request to these files results in a 403 and there&#39;s no indication if the browser is sending a modified request with specific headers to allow the embedded video to play without issue. My thought is the server is reviewing a user agent string but like I said, even a direct request in the browser doesnt display the video.</p> <p>Also this isnt one of those times where they split the stream and you can see the individual requests but you cant download them piece by piece.</p> <p>I figured i&#39;d ask here as im sure someone know how this works.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/realKevinNash\"> /u/realKevinNash </",
