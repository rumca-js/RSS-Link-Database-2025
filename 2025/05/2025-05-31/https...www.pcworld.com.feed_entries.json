I\u2019m not a fan. They\u2019re eye-catching, sure, but they\u2019re also distracting (especially when they\u2019re not working properly, which happens frequently), they mess with the perceived picture color, and they\u2019re expensive.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a far better and cheaper way to boost the picture on your TV, and as a bonus, you\u2019ll be easing the eye strain that comes from watching a bright image in a dark room. This product\u2014the <a href=\"https://www.techhive.com/article/1355365/scenic-labs-lx1-bias-lighting-review.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scenic Labs LX1 Bias Lighting strip</a>\u2014is one I\u2019ve been using for years, and I swear by it.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s still a light strip, but instead of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2767771/philips-hues-sibling-brand-unveil",

That last one is a problem with the growing prevalence of USB-C because there just aren\u2019t that many good USB-C flash drives around. But right now, you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Type-CTM-Transfers-Compatible-Waterproof/dp/B09WB2RPS4/\">Samsung Type-C flash drive for only $18 on Amazon</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re getting 128GB of storage space for the price of a couple fancy coffees, which is pretty impressive when you look at the big picture. As the name suggests, this one has a USB-C connector so you can plug it into your laptop, smartphone, tablet\u2014nearly any modern device. It\u2019s also fast, with transfer speeds up to 400 MB/s. When you need to quickly back up files or move them between devices, this is the one to rely on.</",
