For instance, my wife could put it on and look like whatever she chose. Then we could share the same virtual space. Like, if one of us puts a new VR picture on the wall then we both see it, and whatever AR augments that space has are shared. You could both put it on and have a bank of pinball machines against the wall, it would be sweet. It would be nice if it was right when we put it on, but is there a similar game or app that could do this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jokong\"> /u/Jokong </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1l085c9/what_is_it_like_when_a_quest_headset_sees_another/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1l085c9/what_is_it_like_when_a_quest_headset_sees",

I don&#39;t realy care about the integrated functionalities since I plan on using it connected to my pc (probably just for blade and sorcery) and I saw it in a couple of lists, but, reading under various posts i saw people complaining of connection issues, troubleshooting ecc. So i wonder if there are alternatives for a similar price that don&#39;t require to set up a lightroom or buy controllers.

You can put a virtual pinball table right in your real room. I placed mine on my coffee table, and it just worked. No strange setup or tricky adjustments. Felt like the classic arcade days, but with bright effects and floating visuals in mixed reality. Fun.</p> <p>The tracking felt smooth, the game ran without any problems, and I didn\u2019t feel dizzy even after playing for 40 minutes. Which was a surprise for me. Honestly, I did not think I will like it this much. I thought it would just be a gimmick, but I ended up playing way longer than I meant to.</p> <p>Anyone else tried it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OliverIn_Motion\"> /u/OliverIn_Motion </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kzr07w/just_tried_pinball_fx_vr_on_quest_3_hone",
