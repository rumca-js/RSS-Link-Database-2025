And it should be able to help you with tasks like a personal agent would but in a form of an everyday AI companion like tony stark&#39;s jarvis or batman&#39;s alfred (I know alfred isn&#39;t an AI, I meant their relationship with each other). </p> <p>now my problem is I don&#39;t know how to get started with this project.

Putting those multi-slide posts together can take a bit, right?</p> <p>My super raw idea: What if you could just tell a tool the topic you want (e.g., &quot;5 tips for better sleep,&quot; &quot;travel guide to Bali&quot;), and it somehow makes the whole carousel for you - content, visuals, ready to post?</p> <p>Does that sound like something genuinely useful for anyone? Or am I just daydreaming a solution to a problem nobody really has? Seriously trying to figure out if it&#39;s worth pouring my soul (and time) into.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LuckyDayDreams\"> /u/LuckyDayDreams </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideP",
