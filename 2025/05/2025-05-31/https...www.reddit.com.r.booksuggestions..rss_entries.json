I&#39;ve always enjoyed reading but in the past few days I&#39;ve found that reading has been a great distraction from my anxiety. Also, I would love to have some great books to read during my recovery. I just flew through &quot;Go as a river&quot;. Some other fiction books I have read and loved throughout the past few years are &quot;whistling in the dark&quot;, &quot;catcher in the rye&quot;, &quot;where the crawdads sing&quot;, &quot;secret life of bees&quot;. Some of these are romance/coming of age, but I am very open to other genres as well. I typically gravitate toward dramas/thrillers. I also really enjoyed &quot;the worst hard time&quot; and &quot;indifferent stars above&quot;. Although they are nonfiction, I would also be interested in something like historical fiction. </p> <p>So far on my list to read is &quot;lonesome dov",

Sometimes I feel like novels are just spinning a web of human drama, and dragging me down with them. So what is like that, but maybe natively in English (preferably).

I did very much relate to the characters and their feelings of loneliness, even when they are with others, and then the restorative quality of the natural landscape.</p> <p>Similarly on You Are Here is about two lonely people who embark on a multiple day hike.

I LOVE slow burns, romance with a lot of tension but no smut (I\u2019m getting tired of the books where they meet and start doing it every 3 pages after the 10th chapter).</p> <p>also, I love books with dark settings, disturbing storylines and especially things that can revolve around murder or crimes with an actual interesting plot. BUT it\u2019s even better when the relationship in itself between the MCs is healthy.</p> <p>I\u2019ve read Anatomy : love story and this is EXACTLY the kind of book I\u2019m looking for. romance with a plot that is not entirely linked to the relationship of the two MCs.</p> <p>I know my request might seem difficult, but I\u2019m fr desperate I tried to search around tiktok but all I find is way too spicy and without any real slow burns \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sastery\"> /u/sastery </a> <br/> ",

Really in the mood for the niche cliche genre of stories involving apprentices/average nobody-to-hero trope/etc. The problem is, most of these are too juvenile as far as reading level or captivation. I want to be pulled in and feel like I&#39;m in too deep in another world. Also, id like them to be not TOO long in length (don&#39;t mind series, I just dont want to be sitting there with each one being an obnoxious 450-600+ pages). I have ADHD as well as full-time life responsibilities so I literally do not have the time or attention span for novels too large.

From the scene with the boat you can already tell she is kind of crazy and very extreme. She is also kind of blunt/brash or just plain rude. Believes she is kind of perfect and is very demanding towards others a (wants to get own way). She can come off as very fierce and scare people off and just loves to argue or drive them insane. She has her own set of priorities and doesn\u2019t seem to care about conventions. But it goes both ways she doesn\u2019t care how others might see her and is very confident, unapologetically so.</p> <p>I would really love it if there were books with FMCs like her. I would also like for her to stay that way and not learn to become a more palatable character or acceptable conventional female character. (I read ACOTAR and Nesta wasn\u2019t perfect by any means but she was even worse after her so called redemption)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",

Long story short, I feel that life could be like that sometimes for some people and it left me with a question on my mind: why do some people let a traumatic part of their lives determine their entire life afterwards? Are they weak? Was it too much for them to bear at that point? Anyway, that is another discussion.</p> <p>Currently I am looking for very good books to read and I would love your recommendations. To me, a very good book is the one that makes you very emotional/ sad/ happy, that makes you go through so many feelings and after you finish reading it, you have to take a pause to let it sink in before reading something else. </p> <p>Some of the books that gave me the same feeling: Les miserables Beartown by fredrik backman (1 &amp; 2, I think 3 was too politically correct) The kiterunner When nietzsche wept The reader The book thief Wuther",
