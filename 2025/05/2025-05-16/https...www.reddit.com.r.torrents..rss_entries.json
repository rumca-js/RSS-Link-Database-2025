A lot of the websites I&#39;m seeing have great resources for finding individual books (Anna&#39;s Archive, Ocean of PDFs, etc.), however I&#39;m trying to find a relatively expansive collection/library for torrenting. I&#39;m coming up pretty blank there, and the collections I do find are all out of date by around ten years, so I was hoping some other literature enthusiasts here would be able to point me in a better direction there.
