It&#39;s a chrome extension which captures the entire tab and sends it to AI, with solution to whatever problem you&#39;re looking at displayed on the dashboard (which you could put on another device, the &#39;teleprompter&#39;)</p> <p>The vision was just to be the de facto seamless, real time AI teleprompter app, maybe add azure speech to text and do split suggestions on the dashboard half from spoken word and half from the contents of the tab.</p> <p>but I loved all of your suggestions, currently there are 4 users who actually use the tool enjoy it which I know is peanuts but 4 is better than 0. <a href=\"https://interviewmaverick.com/\">https://interviewmaverick.com/</a></p> <p>Thoughts?
