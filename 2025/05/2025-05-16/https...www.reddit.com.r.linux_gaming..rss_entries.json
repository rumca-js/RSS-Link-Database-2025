I&#39;m running CachyOS (Arch based) with Gnome (Wayland). After an hour or two of playing my game will suddenly freeze for like half a second before all three of my monitor screens turn black. It stays like that for like 2 seconds with just a white blinking underscore at the top of my main monitor. It then kicks me to the login screen. I&#39;m using Proton Experimental and have the Engine Tweaks mod. Game is installed on an SSD. I thought it was a VRAM problem (which would be odd considering I have an RX 7900 XT with 20 GB) so I limited the streaming pool size in the Engine.ini file yet the crash still happens.

I am planning to build a new PC, and am quite interested in switching to Linux from Windows, and would need a bit of advice from users. </p> <p>Basic gist of the build: - AMD processor and GPU - at least 1 m.2 and another SSD. Maybe will go for 2 m.2, will see what I can afford. - 32gb dual channel ram</p> <p>What I want to do: - gaming. Not hardcore gaming, i don&#39;t need ray tracing and shit. I mainly play RPGs. Either steam or GOG. Sometimes piracy (yarr) - various document/ppt/spreadsheet creation and editing. I can do just fine with Google docs, since the collaborative/sharing part is useful. For ny personal notes I use Obsidian - Nord VPN is essential.</p> <p>My questions: - which Distro would be fitting? I don&#39;t really have the time to dive deep from the start, I would like a simpler/user friendly option. - would Google Drive work normally? - besides Proton, what else would be an essential? - do I need antivirus and antimalware softwa",

Nothing.</p> <p>I start to feel the oncoming headache of 6 hours debugging. I decide to try ProtonGE, cuz why not?</p> <p>BOOM! WORKS OUT OF THE BOX!

So, I <a href=\"https://youtu.be/eRVL9Tymg8A?si=DIn6PEBXF4xhWT5x\">installed it</a> and added the <code>PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1</code> flag to the launch options. It ran, but then I noticed that the game had mouse acceleration enabled by default.</p> <p>Now the reason why I am saying this is that I love having mouse acceleration on during my time on the desktop, but in games, you can imagine how bad it can be. Proton gave me an experience which was better than Windows in that regard.</p> <p>I know where this issue is possibly coming from. Back with no Wayland driver there was the X server running, which possibly had the function disabled (because it was only assigned to that window), now with a unified Wayland driver for the game and the desktop you have a unified setting for the acceleration being on and off",

The fix seems to be to update Wine versioning to Wine-Staging-Tkg 10.6+ or Proton 10 beta. I&#39;ve tried both and they both do address the breakage from the patch but as a result of updating it now appears gaming performance has taken a huge hit. When I am in combat in game the game becomes extremely laggy &amp; choppy, <em>appearing</em> as if it&#39;s dropped down to ~20 frames per second even though the game is still reporting to me ~140 fps. It makes the game nearly impossible to play. </p> <p>I&#39;ve tried playing the game through Lutris as well as CrossOver and the issue seems to occur for both options there. I honestly don&#39;t know what else I can try to do to fix this. I",
