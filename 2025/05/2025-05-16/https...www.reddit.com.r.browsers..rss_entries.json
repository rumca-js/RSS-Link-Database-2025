My personal experience with Firefox was terrible, from what I understand it is because a large part of the web today is developed for the Chromium Engine, the pages that I need to access on the company computer are impossible in Firefox and when I started using Edge on the work computer it improved fluidity a lot, my personal browser I am using Vivaldi and I really loved the experience but it is also Chromium and I notice the difference in it especially when using YouTube which in any Chromium browser runs much better than in Firefox, most browsers use this technology, if the anti-trust law passes, Google will be prohibited from paying any browser to use its home page by default, this would kill Firefox, in my view Firefox is breathing for devices, what keeps you loyal to Firefox?

I have tired brave browser, liked it, in fact fell in love with it on pc but in mobile it&#39;s just trash. Non of my sign in attempts work on most websites on mobile (it just says pass is wrong although I sure its right). Haven&#39;t tried Firefox before but I heard it&#39;s harder to use for average users and for more day to day activities? Is it also hard to sign in their on websites or do most website don&#39;t work because of the cookies blocking? And someone do a quick Firefox vs. Brave comparison for me if you have experience with them both so I know what to do? I desperately need a browser for my mobile other than chrome! It will be nice if it&#39;s good on pc too so I can make it my default browser and get rid if chrome for life. Pls help free a slave here qwq! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Uglypota",
