I first became aware of so-called \u201celectric scissors\u201d when I saw an influencer hawking them on the TikTok Shop. The basic promise is that you can break down cardboard boxes quickly \u2013 and without the safety risks of using a box cutter, Stanley knife or whatever else you call those slicey things in your neck of the woods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t click the TikTok link, but I did begin researching this product category, and discovered that, wow, electric scissors may be more useful than I expected. The most obvious benefit is that the cutting blade is fully electric-powered and attached to the end of a hand grip. This alone makes breaking down boxes for recycling a safer proposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a box cutter, unless you\u2019re laying the cardboard flat on a level surface, you\u2019re likely wielding the sharp blade in a manner where it could potentially sna",
