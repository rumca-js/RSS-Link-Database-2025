The port would be the first for a Nintendo console, with the first Red Dead Redemption getting a Switch 1 port in 2023, 13 years after it first debuted on the PS3 and Xbox 360. The RDR2 Switch 2 port would also coincide with a current-gen PS5/Series X|S port. In other news, Fortnite's Star Wars crossover event just dropped an AI-powered Darth Vader that reacts to what you say to it. And of course, gamers have found a way to make Vader make some NSFW words (which was quickly patched out). And finally, Hideo Kojima doesn't want mortality to stop him from releasing games. He's setting up a plan to leave his studio, Kojima Productions, with some unfinished game ideas in the event of his passing.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #NintendoSwitch2",

        "description": "Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch! This week we speak with Nintendo Voice Chat host Logan Plant about visiting the new Nintendo Store in San Francisco, and interviewing Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser. In that interview, Bowser explained the benefit of having game-key cards that don't actually have the game on them, and we discuss how Nintendo is setting up the Switch 2 for success in its first year. Plus we have last week's poll results.\nAnd don't forget to secure your tickets to IGN Live, our second annual in-person event being held in downtown Los Angeles next month.
