One promising method is radiative cooling, which works by reflecting sunlight and releasing heat in the form of infrared radiation into space. But despite its potential, this method is limited by natural laws that cap how much heat can be emitted. Now, a proposed theoretical model has the potential to boost the power of radiative cooling, potentially changing the way we manage heat in a warming world.",

These ice clouds typically occur near the North and South Poles, but are increasingly being reported at mid- and low latitudes. Observing them helps scientists better understand how human activities may affect our atmosphere.",
