(I dropped it twice)</p> <p>It&#39;s definitely my favorite headset strap for the Quest 3 so far. You just need to remember to be EXTRA careful when adjusting the headset from behind so you don&#39;t drop the battery. But overall, I definitely recommend it, especially if you&#39;re looking for something comfy that does what it&#39;s supposed to. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",

We have the quest 2 and Unity and started getting infrastructure set up but, and maybe it\u2019s just me, but wow is it slow going and pretty frustrating. I was wondering if you all have suggestions on the best development environment to use for newcomers. Is there a platform that is more straightforward than Meta? Is Unity the way to go over UE? Any advice is appreciated. Trying to keep the spirits high over here. Just want to get a shitty little app to deploy to our headset to start with.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just completed The Burst after 28 hours and I\u2019ve gotta say, it was a lot better than I expected! </p> <p>There were a handful of epic moments that really surprised me and lead me to create this post, as I genuinely feel it deserves more recognition. </p> <p>That\u2019s not to say this is a AAA game or anything on that level. This is very much an indie game with Quest level graphics. There is also a ton of laughably bad AI with enemies that just stand there waiting to be shot. The driving sections which are significant, are a bit boring and the game suffers from odd level design combined with bugs/glitches that may have you reaching for a walkthrough. </p> <p>That said, there is plenty here to like and the good far outweighs the bad!</p> <p>Definitely check this game out when it goes on sale especially if you like single player, first person campaigns that take you on long adventures with a decent story, a ton of weapons, a few puzzles and a variety of game",
