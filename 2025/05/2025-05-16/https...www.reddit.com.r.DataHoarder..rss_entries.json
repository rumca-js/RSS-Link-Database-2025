For this task, I considered using an HDD, as I understand they tend to last longer than SSDs when left untouched, assuming they&#39;re kept in good conditions (And I don&#39;t want to store data on tape). I need the HDD to be portable, around 4TB in capacity, and ideally dust and water-resistant.</p> <p>While I&#39;m pretty skilled at researching tech (it&#39;s part of my job), I find it challenging when it comes to physical hardware. On top of that, storage is a topic full of conflicting opinions, which makes sorting through all the information a bit overwhelming.</p> <p>So far, I&#39;ve narrowed it down to the ADATA 4TB HD710 Pro (AHD710P-4TU31-CBK), but I&#39;m still unsure about its reliability. The specs provided by ADATA don\u2019t offer much detail, and while the reviews are generally positive for the drive itself, ADATA seems to have a mix of good and bad feedback overall.<",

I bought two WD recertified Ultrastar DC HC310s on eBay for a good price ($12.50/TB). When I received them, I was happy to see that one was covered under a five-year warranty from WD.
