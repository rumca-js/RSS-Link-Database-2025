I did enjoy the 7 husbands of Evelyn Hugo, where the crawdads sing and a few similar fictions, but I\u2019ve had plenty that I could not stand and could not finish. Just reading dark books gets heavy sometimes and I\u2019d like to find something a bit more light and \u201cfun\u201d to read over my few weeks of free time from my masters degree courses, I suppose!</p> <p>I have tried Pulitzer Prize winning literary fiction like Trust and they were just meh. Not a fan of fantasy (or at least I haven\u2019t found anything I liked with the ones I\u2019ve tried). Colleen Hoovers books are usually either meh or DNF because it was too cringey for me at times aside from Verity. </p> <p>Let me know your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",

I tried to read Stephen king couple times but it was not for me. the story is important but how the writers writes, describes emotions, feelings, environment is more important of course. I really like how Blake crouch writes. So have you guys any suggestions on books writed like him which have similar stories (doesn\u2019t have to be sci fictin). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/reban-3\"> /u/reban-3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ko1eu0/book_like_recursiondark_matter/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ko1eu0/book_like_recursiondark_matter/\">[comments]</a></span>",
