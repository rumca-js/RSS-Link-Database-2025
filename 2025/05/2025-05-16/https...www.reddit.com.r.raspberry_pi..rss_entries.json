I wanted to plug it into my tv so I can watch netflix, youtube anime etc (this will be its only use case for the time being). My tv is very slow and I figured this would work a lot better. I was wondering, is it possible for me to use my phone as like a wireless keyboard? Where I could have something like a trackpack and keyboard on my phone so I can type in urls and click on videos I want to watch.

Its assembly was bought on amazon, as part of an RC boat. The two MG996R servos are connected to a PCA9685 which receives I2C communications from an RPi 4b. The PCA9685 has an additional power source of 5V at Ainput.</p> <p>My first project was to place it on my top shelf and have a remote operated RPi camera stand for time-lapse videos. It is a severe inconvenience having two power cables for it- one powering the Pi, and one powering the PCA9685 (controlling two MG996R servos). </p> <p>Is there a way I can power this project with ONE power cable?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u",
