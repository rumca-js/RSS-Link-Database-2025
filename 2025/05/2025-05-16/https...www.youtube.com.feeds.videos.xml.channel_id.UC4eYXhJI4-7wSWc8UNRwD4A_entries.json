        "description": "Felix Contreras | May 16, 2025\nCar\u00edn Le\u00f3n is an old soul. There is no other way to account for the power of the emotion in his voice. His 16-piece band tests the limited space behind the Tiny Desk, but when the brass takes over to punctuate a performance, Leon's commanding presence shows why he's one of the best at what he does.\n\nRegional Mexican music is based upon song forms from another era, but Le\u00f3n's lyrics add a new spin on heartbreak and love lost. This set opens with \"Ese Vato No Te Queda,\" followed by two songs from the 2024 album Palabra De To's. Previously, Le\u00f3n premiered \"Primera Cita\" for his Tiny Desk (home) concert, which became a major hit. That song \"left a mark on our lives and completely shaped our careers,\" he shares. For good luck, Le\u00f3n here premieres \"Por la Suave,\" which was also written by Alejandro Lozano. \"A poem that I love,\" Le\u00f3n says.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Ese Vato No Te Queda\"\n\"Lado Fr\u00e1gil\"\n\"El Amor de Mi Herida\"\n\"Por la Suave\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCar\u00edn Le\u00f3n: vocals\nArturo G",
