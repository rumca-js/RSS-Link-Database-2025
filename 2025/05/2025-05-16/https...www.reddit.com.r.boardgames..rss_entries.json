So what I did if you\u2019re familiar with the game is used all the playing tiles to build the map. Did not stop after 6 rounds because the game usually ends after 6 rounds.

So basically what I did was make the game veryyy long.</p> <p>It was a colossal experience, that took multiple days to finish, but I loved it.

Make it so each turn runs for 5 minutes and retreats and builds only last 60s .. the diplomacy would be loud and chaotic and that rush to submit orders in just 5 minutes would be super hectic. It couldn&#39;t ever work without an app though. The time to adjudicate the table&#39;s moves and the time to table talk negates the hectic 5 min turns. A few add ons, Maybe when an empire taps out it adds 1 min to turns since there will be more armies for the single person to command. Players could have a certain number of &quot;extensions&quot; to use to add a little bit of time (like 30 seconds) to the clock too. And you earn one each year but can only have 2 or 3.

They can help build a world worth exploring in other formats.</p> <p>For example, imagine playing a board game about political tension or resource competition, and then reading a novel that offers more insight into the characters and events behind that conflict, or reading a story first and later stepping into that world through a game.

I love the feeling of building an empire, defending it and expanding. I like the dice-roll mechanic, meaning that victories are never a sure thing. However it all becomes a chore long before the end. The armies get too big, the battles get too long and any progress is often undone in the next turn. There\u2019s also not much room for tactics.</p> <p>I tried Smallworld, which is very fun. But it doesn\u2019t scratch that empire-building itch for me. I don\u2019t get attached to my empire because it will be gone in a turn or two anyway, and each territory is just a means to an end. There&#39;s no &quot;Yes! I&#39;ve conquered North America!&quot; moments. Also the combat is just a case of the bigger force wins, so there\u2019s no tension there.
