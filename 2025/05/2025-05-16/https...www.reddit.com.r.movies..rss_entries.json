Antonio Banderas repeating to himself \u201cit\u2019s a man\u2026\u201d while he is mowing down savages dressed as bears alongside a bunch of Vikings while a village burns is just top tier action filmmaking. They just don\u2019t make movies like they used to. I couldn\u2019t name a single other actor in this flick but the whole cast is just draining 3\u2019s from the logo. Not much of a surprise though. Saying McTiernan is good at directing a monster movie in the jungle/woods is like saying Spielberg is good directing kids or Tom Brady is good playing football. The dude is in his element. </p> <p>\u201cLo there do I see my mother and my sisters and my brothers. Lo there do I see the line of my people back to the beginning. Lo they do call to me.

Sort of like a book club, but for movies. Like renting out a small private theatre, having snacks and drinks, popcorn etc. Maybe meeting once a month or so to watch a movie that is voted on by the group. (Thinking maybe provide the group with a few options to vote on each month to select one). Then we watch it together, and spend the after hours discussing anything we think of it. Sounds like a fun and cool concept to me, just curious if anyone else has done anything like this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PomeloResponsible122\"> /u/PomeloResponsible122 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1knnhm1/anyone_startedorganized_a_movie_watching_group/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1knnhm1/anyone_startedorganized_a",
