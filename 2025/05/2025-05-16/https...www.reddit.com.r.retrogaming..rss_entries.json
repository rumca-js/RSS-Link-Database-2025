Basically any games that are really excellent or really influential are ones I&#39;d be interested to look at, as well as anything RPG / RPG like. I wasn&#39;t around in the 70s but my list so far consists of:</p> <p>- Asteroids<br/> - Pong<br/> - Space invaders<br/> - Galaxian<br/> - Breakout<br/> - Zork<br/> - Colossal cave adventure</p> <p>- Wander and Adventure (other early text adventures)</p> <p>As well as the early RPGs (mostly from PLATO):</p> <p>- Pedit5 / The Dungeon<br/> - Orthanc<br/> - Moria<br/> - dnd<br/> - Oubliette<br/>",
