Some evidence that proves that she may be bisexual is the following: 1) She reportedly had a husband 2) It\u2019s said Baron vordenburg\u2019s ancestor was a \u201cfavoured\u201d and \u201ccherished\u201d lover of Countess Karnstein (Carmilla before she died) putting this evidence together one could assume the Vordenburg ancestor was Carmilla\u2019s hus",
