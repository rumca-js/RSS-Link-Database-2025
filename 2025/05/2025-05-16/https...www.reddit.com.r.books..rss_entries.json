In comparison I was severely disappointed in this book. </p> <p>I don&#39;t know what it was but I felt like this story was all over the place. I also felt like it kept ramping up just to have a really lackluster ending with no better indication as to what was going on. I mean, is it just supposed to be left up to some interpretation? </p> <p>So the ghost kids Dad was some killer and the kid, Issac was crazy too. What happened? He disappeared into the woods and died? Was he a demon baby as well? Was Issac trying to take over Aaron&#39;s body? What did he mean he used to need him but he didn&#39;t need him anymore? And than Cheri was pregnant with the next ghost baby? </p> <p>Just so unsatisfying literally took me twice as long to read because I was so bored.
