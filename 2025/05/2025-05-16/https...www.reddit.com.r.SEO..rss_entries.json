I switched my site from SS to Format late last year and have been slowly trying to get things up and running but I am, admittedly, horrible at taking time to focus for extended days at a time. </p> <p>At the moment I&#39;m happy with the galleries that are there (I&#39;m a photographer) and the images that are in them. Now my focus is on going through and hitting the image descriptions. In the past, with SS anyway, I was always told to rename the images with a bunch of keywords I want searched but here it looks like Format is pushing the &#39;describe the image&#39; route, which is fine but I just want to make sure I&#39;m doing this right and hopefully having it work out. </p> <p>So my questions, I guess, are 1 - should I still rename each image with keywords or is that not a thing anymore? 2 - Is there a right or wrong way to do the descriptions? For example an image of a musician would just say his or her name, venue and leave it at tha",
