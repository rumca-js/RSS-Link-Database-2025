        "description": "Marathon (Bungies upcoming extraction shooter backed by Sony) is facing criticism now for its admitted usage of stolen art assets across multiple aspects of their website, marketing material and game world. \n\nWith copied and pasted graphics where even memes and hidden Easter eggs begin showing up, the company has a lot to answer for on why their apparent use of artwork that they don't own, continues year after year. \n\nFor a game already struggling to get ahead in a competitive market, scandal over creative asset theft is the last thing that Bungie needs. \n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nAntiReal: https://ko-fi.com/4nt1r34l\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https://linktr.ee/upperechelonsecurity\n\n\n\nODYSEE INVITE: https://o",
