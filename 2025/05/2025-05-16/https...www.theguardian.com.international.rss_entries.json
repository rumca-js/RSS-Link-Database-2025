The deal includes $181m in guaranteed money, solidifying Purdy\u2019s role as the franchise quarterback moving forward.</p><p>Purdy, 25, was the final pick of the 2022 NFL draft \u2013 familiarly known as \u2018Mr Irrelevant\u2019 \u2013 but quickly defied expectations. After stepping in as the starter midway through his rookie season, Purdy led the 49ers to back-to-back playoff appearances, including a trip to the Super Bowl in February 2024. He was also named to the Pro Bowl and finished fourth in MVP voting that season.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/16/brock-purdy-contract-extension-san-francisco-49ers\">Continue reading...</a>",
