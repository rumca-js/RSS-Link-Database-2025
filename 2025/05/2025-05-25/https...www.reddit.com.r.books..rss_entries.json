He flat-out refuses to accept she\u2019s gone. In that famous scene where he holds her lifeless body, it\u2019s not just pain; it\u2019s a desperate rebellion against the rules of life and death. It\u2019s a total rejection of the reality that forced them apart forever. Freud, in Mourning and Melancholia, calls this \u201cthe shadow of the object falling upon the ego\u201d\u2014when someone doesn\u2019t just grieve but becomes so consumed by the person they lost that their own sense of self starts to dissolve.The energy Heathcliff once poured into loving, desiring, and merging with Cathy turns, after her death, into hatred, revenge, and a drive to destroy:<br/> He ruins Hindley, taking Wuthering Heights, humiliates Edgar and claims Thrushcross Grange, mistreats his son Linton, and manipulates the next generation.Freud explains, and we see ",

While it may be wishful thinking, the cliffhanger at the end, the fact that Eilis has specifically lived abroad for 20 years (and no less) and the idea of Mrs Lacey coming with Eilis to Long Island all gives hints that maybe there is a potential for a third book. I am probably looking for any clue of this because I hope that there might be. But there seems some intent in that 20 year gap. Eilis would now be a naturalised citizen in the US. I don&#39;t know about anyone else but if in the end she doesn&#39;t have Jim, the fact that her mum has decided to move out with no definitive return date beyond the default given by the travel agency is really promising. And the specific timeline of things too. 20 years would mean that legally Jim could marry and move too. It has meant Eilis is established in America.

I have only read one other Wharton book before, <em>Summer,</em> so I am aware that she is fine with bleak endings, but still. Anyway, I kept thinking throughout how this book could VERY easily be written from Maddie or Zenna&#39;s POV or even both SPOILER that demonstrates how Ethan fell out of love with his wife when she got sick, and then preyed on a younger dependent in his house. Zenna sending Maddie away could be to get her out of her predator&#39;s way, and Maddie&#39;s agreement to the suicide pact could be to save the next girl from his unw",

Naturally I picked up The Song of the Lark and, well, I&#39;m only 60 pages in and it&#39;s got some elements in it that don&#39;t seem to align with the other two. Dr. Archie seems way too into Thea. Okay, maybe I&#39;m just reading something into it that isn&#39;t there. But then when it&#39;s mentioned that Ray intends to marry her once she&#39;s of age, I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m probably reading it exactly as it&#39;s intended. </p> <p>Is it just me? Should I stick with it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/swhall72\"> /u/swhall72 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1kusk5e/willa_cather_the_song_of_the_lark_questions/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1kusk5e/willa_cather_the_song_of_the_lark_questions/\">[comments]</a></span>",
