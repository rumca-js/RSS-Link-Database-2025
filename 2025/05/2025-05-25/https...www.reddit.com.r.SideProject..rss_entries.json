Then I came across a post on Reddit by (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/marchidus/\">u/marchidus</a>) - I&#39;ll leave the link here, maybe someone else will find it useful too. No hype, just clear steps. I decided to give it a try</p> <p>On the very first day, I earned $230. I was shocked. In a week, I earned enough to pay for all the repairs.

Notra, allows you to slow down and reflect on your notes with AI that will give you input heavy response rather than always spouting output and directions of what to do all the time.

It generates consistent character pics between different image gen models (epicrealism, dreamshaper, etc) without any dev time needed. you can also set up chats/conversations with your characters and it handles all the memory automatically. We have a playground on the website to try it all out. </p> <p>Made this after launching an app in the AI character space and realizing how much work goes into piecing several different APIs/platforms together to get a functioning AI character up and running. finally switched over our backend infrastructure on that app to use Glazed and thought it would be a good time to share here.</p> <p>feedback welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Emergency-Octopus\"> /u/Emergency-Octopus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://glazed.ai\">[link]</a></span> &#",
