My guess is something may be bottlenecking the data speed from the PC to the Headset via the cable. It&#39;s running on a USB 3.1 and when I tests the speed it says 3.5Gb/s (If I remember correctly it&#39;s Gb) but it for sure doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p> <p>I have fiddled with the Oculus Debug tool as well and I have only seen minor improvements.

Perfectly smooth image, inside-out body tracking, hand tracking, it&#39;s incredible.</p> <p>However, yesterday I&#39;ve finally upgraded my PC from an old Intel Xeon to a 9800X3D (yet still on RTX 4060, my 9070 XT is still en route), and did immediately notice that Virtual Desktop latency has become quite low and games like VRChat have become overall way more responsive.</p> <p>Yet, I&#39;ve decided I want to try and get even more out of this thing, by running VR natively on my Linux host through ALVR. And the impression is... terrible, really.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know what it is, but very often I see previous &quot;ghost&quot; frames? I randomly get this effect when turning my head irl, and consistently when I strafe with a controller.</",

I got it tried it, but this thing actually sucks because if you\u2019re more than a foot away, it loses tracking I\u2019ve tried it from multiple different directions and with settings as well, and it either fails to properly and consistently track my hands and arms or worse from certain angles will pick up things that aren\u2019t even my hands as hands completely screwing up the tracking</p> <p>I was thinking about getting full body vive tracking, but when I looked at the dongle, I could understand how it could track my arms or wrist, but not my hands or fingers. (Unless im missing something)</p> <p>So now I\u2019m just stumped. Does anyone have an idea of anything that allows me to track both my hands/finger\u2019s arm and face? </p> <p>Btw if",
