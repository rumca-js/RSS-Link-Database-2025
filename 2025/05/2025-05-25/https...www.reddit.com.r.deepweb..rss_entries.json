A few months ago I discovered the privacy world, and how much we are exposed not only for ISPs, but every website and app are searching every file, traffic and move we are doing. So iam writing this post not only for me but to be a reference for all non technical friends who appreciate, respect and want privacy. I hope you guys help me and them by providing some real steps which we can do to achieve and enhance it, I also discovered that some Operating systems are ploted with apps and registry files that scan and send our activities to the big companies, so first step we can do is to use a privacy based OS like whonix or tailsOS or even Linux that is not ploted like windows. So I hope you guys help us with what to do after installation them What to do, also I saw that using proxy chains is also good, so where to get the proxies, are they paid or free?. Also I see that Firefox and tor are built in",
