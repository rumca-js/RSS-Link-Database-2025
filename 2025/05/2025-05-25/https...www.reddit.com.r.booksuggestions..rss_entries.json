They changed how I see life, death, and everything in between. What stuck with me most was how universal the message is: that we choose this life, that love is what matters, and that we\u2019re light at our core.</p> <p>And I kept thinking\u2026 why didn\u2019t I hear this as a kid?</p> <p>So I wrote &quot;The Light You Are&quot;. It\u2019s a children\u2019s book, but really it\u2019s a soul story\u2014gentle, poetic, and rooted in the kinds of truths I wish I grew up with. It\u2019s not religious or preachy, just a simple message for anyone still trying to remember who they are underneath it all.</p> <p>If that resonates, I\u2019d be honored if you gave it a look or shared it with someone it might speak to. You can find it on Amazon. </p> <p>Just search Amazon for: The Light You Are: A story about where you came from, why you\u2019re here, and where you go next.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

I stopped after the 3rd book. Ultimately a bit too flowery of prose and YA for me, but I still enjoyed it.</p> <p>I will be listening to the audio books (Audible) so the narration is important and in a best case scenario there is also a movie or TV series already created or in the works.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I really want to read the book, but I am not okay with nsfw (for example, I don\u2019t like \u201clights out\u201d or \u201cicebreaker\u201d) I know it might be weird to some but I\u2019m just not into it. My question is \u201c against the rules\u201d a spicy read, I\u2019m okay with it a little bit, but I don\u2019t want it to be the primary focus of the book. If it is too spicy could I please have some recommendations of a fluffy clean romance?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Iwellsendtoepics\"> /u/Iwellsendtoepics </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kupk0j/has_anyone_read_against_the_rules_by_bree_hayden/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kupk0j/has_anyone_read_against_the_rules_by_bree_hayden/\">[comments]</a></span>",
