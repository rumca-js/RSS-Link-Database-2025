        "description": "MindsEye is the debut sci-fi action-adventure from Build a Rocket Boy, a studio comprising Rockstar alumni with game producer \u2013 and once of Rockstar himself \u2013 Leslie Benzies at the helm. Coming on June 10th, MindsEye is the gripping, thematically heavy story of Jacob Diaz, an amnesiac soldier searching for clues amongst the technocratic streets of fictional US city Redrock as to the origin of his mysterious neural implant. \n\nWith a deep, evolving storyline, awesome set pieces, highly polished cinematography, and dynamic gameplay, the comparisons to Grand Theft Auto \u2013 apt, given the team\u2019s track record \u2013 don\u2019t appear to be doing the game justice. This is very much a more tightly focused, narratively curated experience more so than the types of stories Rockstar tells. This video dissects fifteen things you need to know before you buy MindsEye.",
