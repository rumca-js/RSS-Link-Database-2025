I\u2019d like to preface this by saying I have nothing against trans people and I have lots of trans friends and have nothing but respect for yall. I think I\u2019m comfortable in my gender but I have my doubts. I like very feminine men and sometimes I like dressing feminine sometimes as well. I sometimes wonder if deep down I want to be a woman and I\u2019m just in denial. I don\u2019t think I want to be trans but what if I secretly do? Im not sure if this is a common feeling or not. Do yall think Im just in denial or what? I think a small part of me is intrigued by the idea and that\u2019s just adding to my confusion\ud83d\ude2d. I honestly think a small part of me kinda wants to be a woman. But I think Im happy being a guy. I&#39;m bisexual btw.

However, when she reached out to the academy\u2019s director, Lisa Morgan, she told Barger that honoring her son\u2019s request to be called by his chosen name would violate school district practice and \u201cbe a big hassle\u201d since some students may use inappropriate nicknames, Barger <a href=\"https://www.pnj.com/story/news/local/education/2025/05/19/escambia-schools-says-n",
