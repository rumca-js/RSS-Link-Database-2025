Don't buy new (lease or buy a recent car instead...unless you're rich)\n2. Don't buy range without considering your use\n3. Don't charge at fast chargers when you don't need to\n4. Don't charge to 100% all the time\n5. ESPECIALLY don't charge to 100% at a fast charger...charge to the amount you need to get to where you need to go. \n6. You do still do need to do maintenance...just not as much. \n7. DONT DRIVE FASTER IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT RANGE \n8. Don't rely on the in-vehicle navigation for figuring out your route. Use \"A Better Route Planner.\"\n9. Efficiency still matters!!\n10. If you're a 2 car household, you don't need 2 road trip cars!",
