It can do the basics but to get to a real bot you have to \u201cchat with an agent\u201d. Then they give you some Indian name (racist much?) for the AI agent. The agent has a limited number of prescripted responses that are totally obsequious. But it may convince some people. </p> <p>There needs to be a way to ask the ai agent to reveal that they are a bot. If you do this with Xfinity\u2019s agents they avoid the question. But they could just lie. So there needs to be a hefty fine if a company is falsely representing people with bots. They need to identify proactively as an ai agent or at the very least expose that they are ai when asked. </p> <p>What do you think about this idea?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
