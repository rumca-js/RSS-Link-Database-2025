Computers used keyboards, so what was this strange \u201cmouse\u201d device? Computers showed text on a screen. So what were these windows and menus? The truth of the matter is that in August 1981, the computer software described in this magazine was far, far ahead of the software most of us had installed on our work or (relatively rare!) home computers.\n\nWas this the most significant computer magazine ever published? In my view, I think it probably was\u2026\n\nObject Orientation (the influence of Smalltalk): playlist\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHx5heVfgEvuveKG1T7BBSuDOTHl1eLl\n\n\nMORE VIDEOS\n=============\nI have hundreds of videos and even complete programming courses on my YouTube channel. They cover everything from low-level programming in C to coding an adventure game in C# or Java. I cover languages as varied as Ruby, Object Pascal and Smalltalk.
