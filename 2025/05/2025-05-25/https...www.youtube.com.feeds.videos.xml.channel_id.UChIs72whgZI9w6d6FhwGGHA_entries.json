        "description": "Sponsor: Thermaltake TR100 mini-ITX Travel Case on Amazon https://geni.us/Yn9DXb\nID Cooling is the next company to go after Thermalright, adding the A720 AD and A720 TD reworks of its air coolers to try and fix acoustic problems while competing on price. We'll be testing these as soon as we get them in. ID Cooling also has a range of liquid coolers from low-end to high-end, with its CLC / AIO options starting around $80 to $100 for 360mm coolers. Their SL360 V2 Plus interestingly uses a larger radiator than it does fans, making space for LEDs on the side but attempting to compensate for cooling loss by adding water channels and liquid capacity.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
