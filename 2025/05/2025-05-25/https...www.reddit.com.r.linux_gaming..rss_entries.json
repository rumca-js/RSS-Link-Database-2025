But sometimes I want to make game windowed to check browser/discord quickly on floating window which works but game starts stuttering/ghosting on windowed mode. It looks like same game renders multiple time. It&#39;s not a performance problem, fps is still locked to 165fps, in game UI mouse movement feels and looks great but the game itself has this issue.

I already checked if I had a driver installed and the Hardware Probe said yes, and I don&#39;t know what else it could be. I use an AMD RADEON RX 7600, so maybe it has something to do with that? Edit: I forgot to add that the games do actually work, as I can hear them as well as see them when I&#39;m alt-tabbed or launching them in windowed mode. Some simpler games like Balatro or Cookie Clicker actually do work while in full screen, but it takes like 5 seconds after starting that I actually see something </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vermicelli__\"> /u/Vermicelli__ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1kv4lo4/black_screen_when_gaming/\">[link]</a></span",

With 2016 I can&#39;t even load into a game, but with Eternal it happens every 7-10 seconds and lasts about the same amount of time.

I created it because I couldn\u2019t find any existing solution that met some specific needs I had for managing non-Steam games on the Steam Deck.</p> <p>While I really liked how Heroic Games Launcher adds games to Steam, I didn\u2019t like that it didn\u2019t run them with the system\u2019s native compatibility tools \u2014 among other things, it took noticeably longer to launch and I suspected it could have worse overall performance (even if it wasn\u2019t always obvious). Also, save files for non-Steam games were easily lost, making it hard to continue PC saves.</p> <p>NoSteam2Steam <strong>automatically detects all games in a designated folder</strong> without any user input, adding them to Steam complete with configuration, images, and icons ready to go. It also syncs and automatically backs up save files, with an option to restore lost saves.</p> <p>",
