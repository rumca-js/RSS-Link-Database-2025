        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"https://www.getsinglefile.com/\">SingleFile</a> allows for saving out an full HTML of a webpage on the client side from browser and it also supports hitting a REST API to upload that data. This means the only thing I want from the server-side software is to:</p> <ol> <li>Show a list of all pages saved with title and other metadata</li> <li>Allow searching through all webpages (maybe after extracting the text)</li> <li>Render the saved webpage properly inside a HTML frame (or however else)</li> <li>(optional) Also show a Pocket-like version of extracted text</li> <li>(optional) Allow tagging, highlighting, etc.</li> </ol> <p>This seems like a much simpler software compared to the likes of Linkwarden and ArchiveBox, and yet I can&#39;t find any that does this. Either they don&#39;t save full pages, or they don&#39;t render them, or it&#39;s just a storage backend with no frontend for listing. Is there anything out there like this?</p> <p>Thanks<",
