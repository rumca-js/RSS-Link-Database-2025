Clearly it\u2019s going to be based on tourist attractions. Everything from a soccer ball, to an ice cream stand, to a shrine can bring in new visitors types. They spend a bit of money visiting their favorite attractions, which you can then use for more customization.

A dark, fast 2D action game built around a combat system inspired by American football\u2019s four-down rule - limited moves, no room for error, only forward momentum. You play as a former American football pro - bruised, broken, suffering from concussions and battling through a criminal underworld to rescue your daughter.</p> <p>A public demo is live on Steam: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930270/Tackle_for_Loss/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930270/Tackle_for_Loss/</a></p> <p>Trailer: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/RjLPq0t_iIg\">https://youtu.be/RjLPq0t_iIg</a></p> <p>Would love to hear what you think!
