The shield parrying is a welcome addition to the FPS space, and each of its weapons \u2014 a personal favorite being the evergreen shotgun \u2014 is both useful and fun. <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/impressions/598214/doom-the-dark-ages-early-review-impressions\"><em>The Dark Ages</em> is extremely my thing, too</a>. What\u2019s not working for me, however, are the few sections where the Doom Slayer pilots a giant mech or rides on the back of a dragon-like creature with mechanical, neon wings. Though these sections hit and miss for different reasons, they both don\u2019t seem to fit well alongside the rest of the game\u2019s pa",

Users can submit text prompts or give Veo, the AI model that Flow uses, the digital equivalent of a mood board in exchange for eight second clips. From there, users can direct Flow to patch together different clips to form a longer stream of footage, potentially allowing for the creation of entire films. Immediately, people experimented with asking the AI to generate gameplay footage \u2014 and the tools are shockingly good at looking like games that you might recognize.</p>\n\n<p c",
