That&#39;s not me saying it was a bad ending, or wanting to argue for or against it. It was a proper downer ending that fit the story well. It just wasn&#39;t for me. I was hoping for catharsis, for the awesome character development to result in real final change for the characters. I&#39;m the kind of reader who was hoping for Bayaz to get some comeupperance, for Logan and Ferro to get together again, and for Jezal to really own the spine he grew, and not be forced to rule in fear and under Bayaz boot. That would have made for a very different story altogether and I get that it wasn&#39;t the point.</p> <p>But I really loved the character development, the dynamics ",

A few minutes ago I got reminded of something I remember hearing about maybe a year or two ago, at the time I believe it had just gotten announced and a bunch of people were getting super excited about it.

All I remember was that it was super brutal, medieval (fantasy) and there were these things that would walk around that looked like mini castles with legs but it was actually a knight that was inside operating it, but to attach him inside and for him to actually pilot it caused him incredible pain.

He complained about The Last of Us TV show not having enough zombie fights and it mostly being about Ellie and Joel instead hahah.

So I&#39;m super keen to hear from others since I&#39;ve not seen much on Reddit or YouTube at all. </p> <p>But for my personal assessment from this one trilogy. Top tier story telling that connects and wraps up itself well, not leaving major loose ends. Characters are written really well too, but the villains, not as interesting. I think his biggest weakness is prose and pace. The writing style is just very dated and, especially in the first book, characters get to know each other and connect in unrealistically short periods. Although it definitely improved over the 3 books. </p> <p>Also, what&#39;s with multiple characters with the same name? I know Samuel is a common name in real life but we really need 3+ Sams?</p> <p>Either way I&#39;ve ordered the Limit",
