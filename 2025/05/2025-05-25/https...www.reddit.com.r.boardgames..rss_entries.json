(This JUST Happened with Dead Below Deck game ). </p> <p>I remember I played a mystery game ONCE where instead of reading the background, ect ... There were videos with actors.it was an online link. It was like this was a cold case file, and the suspects were interrogations on tape. So we had to match up all of the evidence, and rewatch the tapes.<br/> I can not figure out what game this was or any similar games. </p> <p>Any help?

Dragominoes?\" title=\"Dragonimoes? Dragominoes?\" /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>My wife found these in a box of childhood stuff and can\u2019t remember how to play, and it isn\u2019t immediately intuitive like regular dominoes. Does anyone remember this game, or know the rules? It\u2019s either so simple we are stupid or we are missing something. Searching for what I think they\u2019re called \u201cDragominoes\u201d returns a newer game Dragomino so isn\u2019t an easy search. Any help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nofunxnotever\"> /u/nofunxnotever </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/1dv44ty8oz2f1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/",
