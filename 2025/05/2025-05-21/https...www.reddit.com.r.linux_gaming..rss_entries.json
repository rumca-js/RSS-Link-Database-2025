I have one gsync monitor which is 1440p 165hz and another monitor which is 1080p 60hz non gsync. I started with Mint, discovered there was an issue with X11 and gsync when operating two monitors but using gsync on one. This made me try Kubuntu and KDE Arch because KDE uses wayland and I thought this would allow me to play a game with gsync and then have discord on the other screen. I then discovered that because I use nvidia i can&#39;t use gsync <strong>at all</strong> if using two screens because this is something nvidia need to fix, but AMD has already sorted this out. So now i am basically back at square one. Is there an alternative set up that people use? I have read a lot of posts on forums and reddit about this but no one says what they end up doing in the end as the next best alternative.

As far as I understand, that&#39;s a Wayland session.

But I don&#39;t know the advantages vs disadvantages of it. Nor why it seems like a game like Counter Strike 2 runs just fine without gamescope. Furthermore on the Arch Wiki for gamescope, it says I need to use a command to &quot;expose the Wayland session to gamescope&quot;. I don&#39;t really underst",
