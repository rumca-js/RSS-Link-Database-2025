The book is nothing to boast about in terms of writing if I am being completely honest (in my humble opinion) but it did make me cry rivers by the time it ended while I had a constant smile on my face. It is immersive and I felt like I was a part of Ove&#39;s world, especially in the latter half. Cent percent recommend it to seasoned as well as new readers. I would call this book a Mac Ruby Woo of the literature world. Liked by all and universally flattering. </p> <p>Some highlights of the book for me were:</p> <p>-Ove! The man is reliable, dependable and made of steel it seems. Life was never easy for him but he kept going through it till the love of his life, his wife, passed away.</p> <p>-The equation of the kids",
