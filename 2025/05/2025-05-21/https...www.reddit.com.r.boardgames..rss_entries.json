I really don\u2019t think this game is luck based and whenever I lose I can find a mistake I made. When I play well it\u2019s extremely satisfying.

I remember individual elements being important you would get these emelemnt cards and spend them on different character abilities. It had an elemental counter system where fire beat water ice beat fire etc... and light and dark were neutral. It had a campaign mode with solo options and then a versus mode as well. This campaign functioned on a track. You&#39;d go from event to event choosing the path, and then fighting enemies or making skill checks against various other threats. As the campaign progressed you&#39;d get new cards and abilities. The versus mode was a pretty standard pvp affair but still looked pretty slick.</p> <p>Let me elaborate on the theme slightly: It",

It comes down to either having an event that can manipulate the cards drawn, or praying that you don&#39;t hit the nasties, instead of having at least one turn of reaction time.</p> <p>I understand it&#39;s going to bring the difficulty way down, but the game has self levelling for that in the funded events.

For our final, our teacher is making us get in a group of 5 to build a board game and connect it to a work we researched about. Since we have to look at non-literary work for our English class (I&#39;m in IB), our group decided to be based off of Calvin and Hobbes. Can you guys give me any ideas or suggestions please?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hurtiw\"> /u/Hurtiw </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1krm0yv/need_help_creating_a_board_game_for_my_english/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1krm0yv/need_help_creating_a_board_game_for_my_english/\">[comments]</a></span>",
