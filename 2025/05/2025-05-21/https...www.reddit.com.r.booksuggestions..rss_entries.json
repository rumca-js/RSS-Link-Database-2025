In high school I loved reading YA romance but most book recs in that genre have main characters that are a little too young for me to relate to nowadays. I&#39;m looking for 19-26 year old main characters, F/M or F/F, and ideally a love interest with similar vibes to Levi from Fangirl by Rainbow Rowell or Reid from Upside of Unrequited by Becky Albertalli. Anything with good banter and a cute romance, I&#39;m not particularly interested in dark romance or anything.

Some of my favourites were <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>The Last Apprentice</em> series. These days, I\u2019ve been feeling overwhelmed and stressed and clearly have a phone addiction. I\u2019ve been trying to reconnect with reading, hoping to spark that same feeling I had as a kid when I couldn\u2019t put a book.</p> <p>Recently I read <em>Blood Meridian</em>, thinking I might be drawn to something darker or more literary, but it didn&#39;t really grab me. I was thinking I might try <em>No Longer Human</em>. I\u2019m also starting to wonder if I enjoy fiction as much as I used to or if maybe I just haven\u2019t found the right kind of story yet.</p> <p>I\u2019d love some recommendations.
