That not only undercuts Nvidia\u2019s avoid-at-all-costs 8GB RTX 5060 Ti by $30, but it means the 16GB 9060 XT is a whopping <em>$80</em> <em>cheaper </em>than <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2688597/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-tested-a-great-gpu-for-1080p-gaming.html\">Nvidia\u2019s actually-pretty-good 16GB 5060 Ti</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hot damn.
