Ive been using semrush, gemini, perplexity, contenshake AI, originality AI and many other tools for the SEO, but lately Ive been asking myself some real questions if all of this is really worth it. </p> <p>I feel like doing keywords research, filtering the KD, looking for the keyword gaps, writing them on blog posts and stuff, is just BS and what actually matters are backlinks. A website having more backlinks, good quality or not will rank better than those who dont have any even if they don&#39;t work on their keywords ? Btw i also dont believe backlinks have any toxicity levels but its purely made up by tools</p> <p>I just dont see big brands or big blogs using those keywords tools and play with them to hope they rank higher. Backlinks and networking are by far the most important factors, am I wrong or missing a piece of puzzle ?</p> <p>Maybe SEO",
