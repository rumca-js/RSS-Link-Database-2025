        "description": "Blades of Fire reviewed by Jada Griffin on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.\n\nBlades of Fire\u2019s blacksmithing burns bright, but it doesn\u2019t forge a sharp enough edge to put its customizable weapons to good use. The combat is serviceable but overly simplistic, and the mediocre story often failed to evoke any kind of emotion in me at all, positive or negative, as it just goes through the motions from start to finish. The unintuitive map also frequently left me\u00a0running in circles, making what could have been a fun hunt for worthwhile secrets feel more like a chore. And when those pain points are compounded by unflattering comparisons to the games it so clearly took inspiration from, Blades of Fire just can\u2019t cut it.",
