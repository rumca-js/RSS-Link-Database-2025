To the final whistle then, and a chance for the FA Cup to be run round Selhurst, hopefully with a bit more care than when Graeme Souness and Liverpool chums were lobbing around the old Football League Championship trophy like they were Orrell back-row forwards. The silverware took a while to arrive but when it did, it was in the arms of Joel Ward, making his final appearance as a Palace player, his 364th game. So long, Joel, and thanks for all the fish.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/football-daily-email-high-concept-farewells\">Continue readin",

Brought to life in a bestselling memoir written with Basque poet Amets Arzallus Antia, it follows his trek from Guinea, west Africa, as a teenager, across the Sahara and Mediterranean to Europe as he goes in desperate search of his runaway younger brother.</p><p>A story about the horrors of migration, it has so many gut-punch moments alongside flashes of levity that it should make for dramatic viewing on stage. Balde undergoes hunger, human trafficking, torture and ransom as well as a terrifying ocean crossing. His voice is clear, distinctive and full of natural poetry. So why does this production, adapted by Timberlake Wertenbaker, who translated the book from its original Basque, feel so lifeless?</p> <a href=\"htt",

He explained:</p><p>We expect services inflation to rise to 5.1% (from 4.7% in March), with the increase driven by firms passing through additional costs from the hike in employer national insurance contributions (NICs), a significant Easter effect on airfares, and larger price resets for sewerage bills, vehicle excise duty, and some telecoms services. Our forecast is 10bp above the Bank of England\u2019s projection.</p><p>A significant increase in water prices is likely to raise core goods inflation to 1.53% (from 1.11% in March). This implies that core inflation will rise to 3.79% (from 3.38% in March), broadly in line with the level implied by the BoE\u2019s forecasts.
