We didn&#39;t have a dedicated security team, so I started looking into 24/7 cybersecurity monitoring services to catch threats before they became problems. After testing a few options, we finally found one that gave us real-time alerts, clear dashboards, and fit our budget. Not worrying about unnoticed vulnerabilities or compliance risks has been a huge relief. The onboarding was surprisingly simple, and now I sleep better at night knowing someone\u2019s watching our back. Has anyone else here gone this route for continuous security monitoring?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sharp_Beat6461\"> /u/Sharp_Beat6461 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ks474b/our_experience_with_247_threat_monitoring_as_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www",
