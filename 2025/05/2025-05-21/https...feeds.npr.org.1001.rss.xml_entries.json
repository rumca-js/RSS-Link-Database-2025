        "description": "What's it like to get bit by a venomous snake? \"It's like a bee sting times a thousand,\" Tim Friede says. Tim would know. Over the past few decades, he's let himself be bitten over 200 times by all kinds of venomous snakes \u2014 black mambas, taipans, cobras, kraits and more. With time, he's gradually built immunity to multiple types of venom. Could scientists help him share that immunity with others? <br><br>Science reporter <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/297147967/ari-daniel\">Ari Daniel</a> joins Short Wave to explain how antivenom works, what scientists discovered and where the research may lead. Plus, what does Tim Friede have in common with <em>Princess Bride?<br><br>Want to hear about more medical discoveries?
