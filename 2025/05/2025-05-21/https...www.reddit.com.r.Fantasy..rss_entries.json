Hoping for a fantasy read with a tight group of friends/comrades where there is a heavy dose of banter/gallows humor, especially of that vaguely British type.</p> <p>Specifically, I\u2019m imagining scenes where something horrific and gruesome happens and a character says something like, \u201cAh, now that\u2019s rather poor form,\u201d before jumping into the fray, or foiling an attempted assassination and commenting to the villain dryly, \u201cThat\u2019s very bad behavior.\u201d</p> <p>The last series I read that was close to this was Redwall. All the hares on the Long Patrol had this energy and I loved it!

Every book in the series is better than the previous, and it\u2019s a complete book series.</p> <p>Am i late to the hype? maybe, but i couldn\u2019t avoid recommending you it. It has romance, but just a little, no smut, and a so good complex world and a very very gripping prose.</p> <p>When i ended it i was so sad, but chat gpt (i asked it for an advice) recommended me Strange, the dreamer. And it was also so great. A little romance and a nice world building.</p> <p>What i mean, if u are looking for something to read, easy and absorbing, i 100% recommend A winter\u2019s promise and Strange the dreamer.</p> <p>if u have already read it, what did u thought? did you find it as compelling as i do? </p> <p>I also accept any recommendations based on this. Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",
