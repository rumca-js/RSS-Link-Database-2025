I don&#39;t want to play, &quot;roll the dice&quot; if my 900 bucks gpu go&#39;s up in flames if the buggy 16 pin connecter isn&#39;t 100 procent right... Or the drivers problems , hotspots and missing Rops... It&#39;s all downhill this last launch of gpu...</p> <p>But the 5060 Ti 16 gb zotac does have a 2x 8pin connector so that problem would be averted... Still it&#39;s only a 5060 Ti..</p> <p>AMD .... Well there definitely in a uplift , the Rx 9070 xt really looks great , and AMD did allot of progress on Raytracing support but VR support is still a bit on a last effort side....</p> <p>Intel .... Does not support VR yet... But is also to low in raw performa",

I remember being immediately impressed with the improvement the higher res screens and the lighthouse tracking made to my experience. No longer did my hands float away whenever I tried to use a shoulder holstered weapon. Though admittedly I did find the lenses on the index to be a slight downgrade from the Rift.

Ive seen videos comparing the 5090 to the 4090 but none comparing it to the 5080, so the decision is even more difficult.</p> <p>Currently the PC ive designed for the 5080 costs 3.3K euros whilst the 5090 PC costs 4.6K euros. Trying to see if the 1.3K extra is worth it if all I want is to run iracing, MSFS and DCS. If the increase in performance is 10fps then I dont think its worth it, right?</p> <p>Also, the BSB2 has a lower resolution so the 5080 would be able to run it at native res?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SupRCarlos\"> /u/SupRCarlos </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1krtlcp/5080_or_5090_bsb2_or_pimax_super/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/com",
