To offer an idea of the scope, the vulnerability involves a piece of cloud-based software running on a datacenter computer. Through a very simple process, I can break &quot;containment&quot; on the cloud environment and access the rest of the computer. I can install and run programs and even view some of the reporting generated by other hotels. A bad actor could easily run a keylogger and scrape credit card data from thousands of hotels. As a test, I created a text file on one of the datacenter computers and waited a week and then repeatedly reconnected until I got that same computer again. Sure enough the text file was still there, so I know nothing is being wiped between sessions.</p> <p>Given the implications of this exploit, I tried to take it right to the company. I opened a ticket and explained the",
