        "description": "Beneath the streets of London lies the UK\u2019s gold vault, the second-largest in the world. Over 400,000 bars sit quietly on wooden pallets, worth more than \u00a3200 billion \u2014 though most of it doesn\u2019t even belong to Britain.\n\nForeign governments, like Germany\u2019s Bundesbank, store their reserves here and in New York\u2019s Federal Reserve, simply because moving half a million gold bars is, well, a logistical nightmare.\n\nAlthough the gold standard is history, nations still hoard the stuff \u2014 not for spending, but as a shiny safety net. It props up economies, impresses investors, and secures loans. Everyone\u2019s in on it \u2014 the US, Germany, France\u2026 except Canada, who sold off the lot and bet on the markets instead.\n\nBut gold\u2019s not as pure as it looks. Much of it has changed hands through war, theft, and shady deals \u2014 from Nazi loot to Romania\u2019s missing stash in Russia. So next time you see a gold bar, remember: it might be polished, but its past rarely is.",
