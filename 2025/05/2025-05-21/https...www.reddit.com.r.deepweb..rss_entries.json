The person said they learned how to access hidden sites because their IT cousin taught them. They said there&#39;s a site that had unseen photos of several foreign celebs taken by photographers and that the agencies of these celebs had paid to keep the photos hidden. They said if you share the photos and it&#39;s found out who did, they could be sued, also that if you take a screenshot on there and open the image, it doesn&#39;t show it. I wanted to ask, does this have to do with the deep web? I&#39;m not sure what they meant by &quot;hidden sites&quot;, does anyone know what they mean by that? Does this sound fake? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/eunssui\"> /u/eunssui </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1ks0kvy/does_the_deepweb_have_this/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",
