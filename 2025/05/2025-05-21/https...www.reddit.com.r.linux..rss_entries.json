So, I installed exa because I think it looks a little bit nicer rather than the standard ls command. (Sorry, I&#39;m entering this on my phone so I can&#39;t do any special tricks with the text here... I may edit this later).

It just looks a lot nicer than the standard &quot;ls&quot; or &quot;ls -lha&quot;. </p> <p>My other favorite alias is the type where I change a standard commands and make it shorter. I use yt-dlp to download videos. But I created an alias where all I have to do is type &quot;yt&quot; then paste the link and it downloads it to my computer.
