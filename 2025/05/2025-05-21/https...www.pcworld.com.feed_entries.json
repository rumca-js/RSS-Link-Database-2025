Even its latest \u201cbudget\u201d models have left a lot to be desired, starting with a lower price tag. But right now you can get a Surface Laptop 7 with a super-efficient Snapdragon processor <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/226714780969\">for just $599 on eBay</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the 13.8-inch 2024 model, which uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus 10-core processor. The Arm processor design means that it\u2019s not great for gaming\u2026but does everything else really well, especially lasting forever and a day on battery. It\u2019s also rocking a touchscreen, Windows Hello-compatible webcam, and 16GB of memory, which is the minimum I recommend for a Windows laptop, and an admittedly paltry 256GB of storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more info on this laptop design, <a ",
