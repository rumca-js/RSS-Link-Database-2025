The church\u2019s associate pastor, Joe Rigney, discussed during a recent podcast appearance how its mission is to embed a stronger anti-LGBTQ+ agenda into national politics.</p> <p>Rigney praised the White House for dismantling trans rights but said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cAll the sodomites are still there,\u201d he said, adding he is looking for politicians to commit to going after the 2015 <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> Supreme Court decision legalizing marriage equality. He said he wanted to \u201ccalibrate the Christians in D.C. by the word of God and not by whatever the present administration can tolerate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna come for feminism,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go after sodomy. Those are the sins in that town. Those are sins that are acceptable among both parties in that town. And we want to plant that flag and say the Bible has so",

(I hope they won&#39;t) Now Apple&#39;s fine and its anti-LGBTQ+ moves that are too many to list? I don&#39;t understand exactly why it did it?

I&#39;m coming on here because I&#39;ve been struggling with some gender related issues and I wanted to know if anyone has any similar experiences. </p> <p>First off, I am a girl from birth. Some days I LOVE my body and feel very pretty and sexy in it. But other times I don&#39;t. Some days I get this STRONG wish I had the body of a boy. I&#39;ve thought, ok maybe I&#39;m trans, but I don&#39;t feel like I want to be a boy for the right reasons to be called trans. I care less about the pronoun I am called and more about how I want to see myself. I definitely like guys (maybe girls too) and I have a heavy preference for twink looking guys. Yet at the same time I want to LOOK like that. When I think of myself as a boy I KNOW that&#39;s what I&#39;d want to look like. I enjoy gay porn, but so do many cis girls. I fantasize about getting to have a penis to fuck my bf with too. I&#39;m just so confused because some days I feel totally fine with my assi",

I basically told her i was having top dysphoria and I also told her about my body dysmorphia and she said &quot;that&#39;s normal&quot;. Then when i revealed my dysphoria she just plain didn&#39;t believe me because i didn&#39;t have the &quot;typical trans experience&quot; of wanting to be called a boy at 4 years old and getting upset at 12 when my chest started developing and having to wear a bra. I didn&#39;t even know i was queer until 15. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m crazy or if the concept of late bloomers really exist. Plus transitioning means changing my name again which would frustrate my mom. So basically I need advice on how to get my mom to accept me. Or give whatever support a redditor could offer.
