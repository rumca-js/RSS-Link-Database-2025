That means I can&#39;t apply different blocking rules or groups for each user.</p> <p>Ideally, I\u2019d like something like:</p> <ul> <li>Me \u2192 full blocking</li> <li>Friend A \u2192 minimal or no blocking</li> <li>Friend B \u2192 custom blocklist</li> </ul> <p>I don\u2019t need anything super fancy \u2014 just a simple way to separate users so they get different DNS filtering.

It started as just testing stuff for fun, but now I find myself trusting the local setup more.</p> <p>It\u2019s not about raw power. It\u2019s just I\u2019m getting tired of sudden changes in behavior, random filters, and the weird feeling of not knowing what\u2019s happening to my data. I\u2019ve started running things through Ollama and messing around with basic photo tagging and offline RAG stuff on my NAS. It\u2019s not perfect, but at least it\u2019s all mine and under my control. Been hearing a bit about AI NAS lately and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s worth looking into. Is anyone else trying this route? Or is it all just a buzzword?
