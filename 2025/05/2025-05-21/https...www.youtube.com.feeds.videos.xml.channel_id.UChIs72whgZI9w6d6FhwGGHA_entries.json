The FLP02 will be sold for around $220, if all things go as planned, or just under 200 EUR. The FLP02 case is Silverstone's latest in its now growing lineup of (actual, non-joke) retro-themed computer cases. It includes modern features, like 360mm radiator support, but also mixes in old throwbacks. The lock key actually works, as does the power toggle, and the turbo button even boosts the fans to 100% PWM on press. We're excited to test this ATX case and use it in a throwback build. This is easily our favorite case of the show. Silverstone also had modern cases and home server hardware on display.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?

        "description": "Sponsor: Thermalright Frozen Prism 360 on Amazon - https://geni.us/FUqbQC\nCorsair had a lot to show at Computex 2025, but the first thing that caught our eye was its improved i500, now called the i600, which has a totally overhauled GPU cooler and CPU radiator. We haven't tested it yet (but will as soon as it's available), but these are objectively large improvements. That doesn't mean the i600 will be good yet, but it's certainly on its way to being an advancement on last generation after our review.\n\nWatch our prior i500 review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqm4V-8F-7k\nCooler Master had some pretty cool stuff also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7_nt28w9yc\nWatch our NVIDIA coverage here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiekGcwaIho\nWatch our Intel B60 GPU coverage here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8MWbPBP9i0\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
