So, I built an app that allows you to easily modify data, in an OLAP context, wherever it is. Think remote or local files, which may be massive. You can mix excel-style transformations with SQL.</p> <p>I&#39;m using a whole bunch of optimization techniques to make things stupidly fast.</p> <p>It&#39;s a paid app, with a 14-day free trial. We&#39;re trying to unify the process of working with data. Ideally we replace the need for clunky apps like Tableau Prep, AWS Glue Wrangler, or interacting via manual code.</p> <p>The idea is to save around 1-2 hours per day (obviously depending on the task), but so far, it&#39;s holding up :)</p> <p>Btw, you can load massive CSVs, Parquet, or connect to a huge data warehouse with billions of rows.</p> <p>Let me know what you think :)</p> <p><a hr",

I\u2019m part of the team behind enrichx.io, a platform we built to solve a problem we constantly saw in the fintech space: raw transaction data is messy, inconsistent, and borderline useless for real analytics or customer-facing experiences without heavy lifting.</p> <p>So we built an API that enriches financial transaction data in real-time. It identifies the merchant, categorizes the transaction, and cleans up ambiguous strings like \u201cPOS 123456 CAIRO EG\u201d into something readable and insightful (e.g., \u201cStarbucks - Coffee Shop\u201d).</p> <p>Some cool stuff we\u2019ve implemented: \u2022 Real-time enrichment with &gt;95% accuracy \u2022 Local merchant recognition (especially useful in MENA) \u2022 Easy REST API integration \u2022 Scalable for banks, PFM apps, and analytics platforms</p> <p>We\u2019re already seeing great results with partners, and would love feedback or thoughts from the Reddit community.

As a student with a moderate social life, I&#39;ve always run into the problem of not knowing what to do or what to eat with my friends, and there would be a lot of back and forth in decision-making.</p> <p>Recently I&#39;ve been thinking about building an activity/place recommendation system for students that can be directly added to iMessage and SMS group chats. The idea is that once the bot is added to a conversation, it gradually picks up different people&#39;s preferences, so whenever we&#39;re trying to hang out, the bot would give us personalized recommendations that work for everyone in the friend group.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear your guys&#39; thoughts on it!
