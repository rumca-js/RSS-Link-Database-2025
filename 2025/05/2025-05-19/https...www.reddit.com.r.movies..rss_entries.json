Something about the pacing, camera movement, tight storytelling and a pretty consistent rotation of actors always makes this era and genre of movie stand out to me, with the benefit of hindsight.</p> <p>No they\u2019re not particularly smart or compelling in the traditional film sense, but in an age where everything is franchised it\u2019s interesting to look back to an era when popcorn movies were original and stood alone.
