I think she picked a topic that many people were unaware of (or maybe that is just me in my ignorance or total lack of interest in horse racing?). But the ending of the storyline between Theo and Jess just...still isn&#39;t sitting right with me. At first I thought...well, maybe that was point? That I, in my safe little bubble, never thought Theo would get shot by the cops. I thought he would get arrested, not that he was going to die. But I can stop thinking about whether or not Brooks went a little too far and used that very real American event (that happens all the time) as just a way to create shock value? I don&#39;t even think that was her intent, but it sort of feels like that was the result. She could have made the same point and had the same character growth with Jess without killing off his character. And then the dialogue between Jess and",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I read Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka this morning and it hit home. </p> <p>The novella is a beautiful metaphor for how society gauges our worth as one of its elements. As long as we are making positive contributions to the society, the latter is happy and validates our existence. The moment we undergo a crippling change that is considered unpleasant or renders us unable to serve it in the same way, we are discarded to rot away and ultimately die. They can even partake in plotting our demise if needed, as shown by Gregor&#39;s parents at the end of the book. Truly depressing, but a true state of affairs!</p> <p>Like most of Kafka&#39;s works, the book is open to interpretation and the above is my take on it. If you have read the book, please share your views on it and what is your understanding of the text. \ud83d\ude0a</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Waste_Project_7864\"> /u/Waste_Project_7864 </a> <br/> <span",

The first few stories in this one revolves around the mad cap adventures of Svetz, an expert in time retrieval, and of the things that he has to put up with.</p> <p>Now these stories I would definitely think of as science fantasy, especially when you consider the things that Svetz has to bring back with him like unicorns and such. I actually read one of the stories featured in here in another of Larry Niven&#39;s collections &quot;Playgrounds of the Mind&quot;. The stories are not only fantastical but they are also pretty funny! Poor Svetz can never seem to get a break as he has to deal with one crazy situation after another, and I kinda feel bad for him.</p> <p>The last two stories in this collection are both novellas.

If you enjoyed Catcher In The Rye, then I think there&#39;s a decent chance that you&#39;ll like this one, as its protagonist Lucia and her story is sort of a homage to Salinger&#39;s book. If you hate that book, then you probably won&#39;t dig this one.</p> <p>Lucia, a high school student, has difficulties in her life that are at least equal to Holden&#39;s, and of course she is struggling to cope. Like Holden, she&#39;s cynical and opinionated. She&#39;s far more humorus than Holden, though, and is more intellectually confident than him. But I loved both characters equally, for different reasons.</p> <p>I won&#39;t say much about the plot because I&#39;m incapable of doing it without spoiling, other than to say that we meet Lucia at a time of crisis. </p> <p>It&#39;s a short ",
