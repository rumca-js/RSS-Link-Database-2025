Probably wanting a 4-bay enclosure, with the best port-connectivity speeds possible. Will be using it on a monthly, sometimes weekly basis, transferring 10&#39;s of TB of massive video files on the regular.</p> <p>Will be using this DAS with an M2 Macbook Pro. </p> <p>Additionally, not sure which RAID configuration to use. I&#39;m aware and familiar with the 3,2,1 rule, and it seems that RAID 1 is my best option for a 4-disk setup. If I have this correct, if I used four 20TB drives, i&#39;d have access to 40TB, ,as the other 2 drives would be mirrored for redundancy.

That means if you have 300GB available and paste a 20GB file, you should have 280GB left, but no, I&#39;m down to 239GB, and I don&#39;t know why. I have some very important information and I&#39;m willing to invest a little money in an external SSD, but the 8TB SanDisk externals don&#39;t seem to be available, even though I&#39;ve been waiting for them for over a month. So, I started reading this Subreddit and kept reading that it&#39;s better to buy an internal SSD and buy a case/enclosure for the SSD. I was about to buy the Cable Maters Enclosure, but I read on Amazon that it says it&#39;s not compatible with double-sided SSDs, and they list SSDs that aren&#39;t compatible, even though they&#39;ve recommended them here.

They&#39;re each 60 - 320 GB in size and have ext2 or ext3 filesystem. I&#39;ve so far checked 6 disks. They are all full of multigigabyte<code>.tar.gz</code> files with md5sums. Not a single file has been corrupted. All of these disks have been bought, filled, put in a box and never powered up until last weekend. This makes me wonder: How common is data loss due to magnetic decay on hard disks? I&#39;m genuinely baffled by my findings; I didn&#39;t even expect them to power up. </p> <p>On the other end of the reliability spectrum, I have CDROMs burnt in the late 90s that became mostly unreadable after 10 years.

I&#39;m setting up my system in a raid 5 with 7 drives and have 1 cold spare.. i only have the option for raid 5 or raid 10 so I&#39;m going raid 5 with a cold spare as it is the best option here for more storage...

The main thing to note is that I encrypted the drive without any protectors, which means the drive technically wasn\u2019t protected.</p> <p>But anyway, the drive was around 28 percent and then locked up.

For the personal vault I want a mirror pool, so I can have 1 drive fail, in that vault the really important stuff will be backed up multiple places at home and abroad.</p> <p>For my needs I chose to go with a 20TB media pool and 10TB personal vault.
