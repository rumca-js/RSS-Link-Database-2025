I have used various different launch options (including trying both Vulkan and DX12), and switched between proton hotfix, experimental, and 9.0-4. The game files are stored on a BTRFS file system, and I have verified them multiple times. When I launch the game with a new version of Proton I have not tried before, it will process shaders for about three minutes, and still not launch. However, when I opened the game files in file explorer and opened FactoryGameSteam.exe with Wine Windows Program Loader, the game launched instantly. I have been able to play other games such as Arkham Knight and Marvel Rivals. I have also had this exact issue on an Ubuntu-based distro I used previously. In that case, I was able to launch the game with integrated graphics",

Sometimes it happens at launch; sometimes after I tab out from the game; sometimes just randomly when playing.

I\u2019m thinking of building a PC and installing Bazzite or SteamOS. Console game prices get expensive in the long run, and I already have a big library on Steam, Epic, and GOG \u2014 not to mention \ud83c\udff4\u200d\u2620\ufe0f.</p> <p>Right now, I have a laptop with a 3060, but gaming at desk is not enjoyable on weekdays. Plus, the constant Windows 11 updates make me lose interest in gaming altogether. I\u2019m okay with tweaking and modding stuff on weekends. Surprisingly not many guides on youtube about this.</p> <p>I\u2019m comfortable playing with either a keyboard and mouse or a controller from the sofa / recliner. So, is this setup feasible?

Modding the game on Linux apparently requires a case-insensitive filesystem, and I was told that VFAT was a good option. Luckily I had a 512 gig drive on hand that I was not currently using, and so I formatted and then went to set Steam to recognize it as a valid installation location. However, whenever I went into the menu to inform Steam of its existence, it does not seem to want to do that. I clicked &quot;Add Drive,&quot; and it brought up my file manager, and then I clicked select on the drive, and it just created an empty &#39;steamapps&#39; folder. Attempting to select it again creates, humorously, another empty steamapps folder inside the first one. Does anyone know a good way to fix this? For reference, I am running Linux Mint 22.1 x86_64, and I&#39;ve made sure in both the GUI and the Terminal that my whole system is up-to-date.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
