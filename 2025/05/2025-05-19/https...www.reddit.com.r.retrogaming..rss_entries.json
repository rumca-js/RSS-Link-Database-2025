Not for how it feels, because yeah, the later one is better in almost every way, but for how it looks. That boxy design feels so unapologetically \u201890s. It\u2019s kind of like the original Xbox Duke controller, clunky, a bit of a mess, but oddly iconic and still loved by a certain group of us. (Although I was never a fan of the Duke, which is odd as I\u2019m using at as a comparison)</p> <p>It\u2019s not always about usability.

These characters would then move and animate, almost like short video clips or skits with your face on them.</p> <p>\u2022One very vivid theme I remember was space or aliens. There may have been a spaceship scene, and you could appear as a crew member or alien with your photo face inserted.</p> <p>\u2022The characters looked a bit like bendable dolls or colorful cutout figures with your face in a circle on their head (similar in style to those bendy photo frames with holes for ",

There\u2019s a whole litany of hurt to relate, but for a start consider this: for each of the three Shining Mega Drive games, Sega gave Takahashi\u2019s team the bare minimum funding offered to out-of-house developers. Shining In The Darkness was a success, but apparently not enough to merit a raise for the development of Shining Force; and although Shining Force was a hit, there was still no raise forthcoming when it came time for a sequel to be built. There is more, but in the interests of chronology let\u2019s return to the story of the series\u2019 conception.</em></p",
