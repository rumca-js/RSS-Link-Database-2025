Everything from basic to more advanced. I had a project going with esp32 strain gauages kinda a basic scale thing. Fooling around with AI etc etc. One such project is we have some basic iNterest in hacking wifi. </p> <p>So I followed an online tutorial got Air crack Ng running and found a good target wifi. It&#39;s great because its a guest wifi of one of the local buisnesses. Therefore as close to the legal side of the street as were gonna get. </p> <p>Amy way i got a bunch of cap files on my desktop now. I know I need to run them threw some sort of cracking program like jack the ripper or hash cat. the only question is where do i get the word lists like rock you etc. I know i can can dig threw a kali image and there is one in there. However i think this buisness may be run by vietnames, chinese or perhaps even korean ",

I am thinking about resetting my Mango and giving this project a go. </p> <p>However, i am unable to find very many reports from anyone who has actually used this software as &quot;Frieren&quot; seems to be the name of a heavily simped over anime lady and i am not really sure if it is a worthy of diving into, or if i should just continue to try and make my mango apple work properly. </p> <p>What are your thoughts? Have any of you used this software and if so, how does it hold up to a real wifi pineapple and would it be a worthy replacement for the WiFi Pineapple cloner software that i am currently using? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jo",
