I\u2019m developing a new board game called DealMaster, and I\u2019d love to get some early feedback from the community before launch.</p> <p>It\u2019s a strategic, money-management game where every property is auctioned, and each player gets a unique role with its own power \u2014 making for lots of decision-making and long-term planning.</p> <p>Although it has some familiar mechanics from classic property-trading games (like being able to build houses only after completing a color set), DealMaster branches off into its own direction with these core ideas:</p> <h1>\ud83d\udd11 Key Features:</h1> <p>\ud83c\udfe0 Full Auctions:<br/> Every property goes to auction when landed on \u2014 not just unowned ones. That means every player must decide: spend now, or save for something better? It keeps the money flowing and the tension real.</p> <p>\ud83c\udfad Role System:<br/> At the start of the game, each player chooses one of 7 unique roles. A few examples:</p> <ul> <li>Rent Lord \u2013 Takes double rent on ",
