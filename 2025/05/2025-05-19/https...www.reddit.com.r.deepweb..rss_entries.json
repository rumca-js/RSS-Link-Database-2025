It was about experiments and tests done on babies to record their development, stuff like how they would starve the baby of human touch. Anyways, i was wondering if anyone could suggest any topics or things i could search related to these topics (human experiments/testing). Id be very gratefull, also if you could reccomend me some reddit communities where i can find more internet rabit holes\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f Thank you :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kit6666\"> /u/kit6666 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1kqpt2y/can_you_help_me_find_some_specific_topics_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1kqpt2y/can_you_help_me_fi",
