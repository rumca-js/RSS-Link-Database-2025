Finding someone who not only wants sex is very hard, but when you do, you hear that he is dating someone else. It means being forever alone. It&#39;s very sparse here. I barely have made any positive experiences with queer communities, and I cannot move because of health issues. Many gays are just awkward to me or incapable of a bit more intellectual capacities</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hungry-Wealth-6132\"> /u/Hungry-Wealth-6132 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1kq8odg/i_hate_being_gay/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1kq8odg/i_hate_being_gay/\">[comments]</a></span>",
