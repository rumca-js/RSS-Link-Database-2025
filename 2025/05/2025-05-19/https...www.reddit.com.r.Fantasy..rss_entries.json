So I&#39;m a relatively new reader and i wanted to read some fantasy novel.. while I was searching for what to read i came across something called the storm light archive.. and after a bit more digging I got to know about the cosmere.</p> <p>And i started binge watching book tube to find where to start the Cosmere. The most common answer was to start from the mistborn trilogy... I started it but didn&#39;t completed it... Left it around the mid way point...</p> <p>This was 3 months ago </p> <p>Few days back i thought of reading something else to get into the cosmere again... This time I started Elantris.. i read a few pages and again went to book tube... And again the general opinion was to read Elantris after the mistborn trilogy and so i tried to read it (The final empire) again </p> <p>This time it clicked and today guys I&#39;m happy to say I&#39;ve finished the final empire!! </p> <p>And i am dying to read more and talk more about i",

I&#39;m only on chapter 5 and I&#39;m trying to take notes but I&#39;m not retaining it in the way I&#39;m doing it. I&#39;m mostly looking for simple diagrams, infographics, glossary (something in one place so we don&#39;t have to stop and Google every term/name), notes that either go chapter by chapter or start very basic without spoilers. For example, the history covered in the first bit...there&#39;s a lot of names of different peoples/races and I know I want to make sure I&#39;m following so I don&#39;t get confused later on. I&#39;ve tried Googling this but everything I find seems to cover the series as a whole like for a reread or people to refresh before subsequent books and I don&#39;t want to be spoiled or overwhelmed. This is also part of a book club and I&#39;d like to have links available for people to reference who may not be note-takers at all. Any help is appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",
