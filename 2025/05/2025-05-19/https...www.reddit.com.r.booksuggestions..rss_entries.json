Basically other aspects doesn&#39;t matter as long as it has good story, is based in some sort of medievel time(I like pirates, knights, samurai, Spartans, etc) and lots of action. My most recent book was pirates lattitude by Michael Crichton.

I loved the book mostly because of the deep character development and how connected I felt/ how well I thought I knew the characters. The college setting and dark academia was also really engaging (as a college student myself), though my next book does not need to be set in the academia again, just a book that maybe I can connect with. I\u2019m definitely dealing with a Secret History book hangover, so I\u2019d love any recommendations to help with that. ALSO i don\u2019t want something like super similar. I know this is a bit broad, but I\u2019d appreciate any suggestions\u2026</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FeistyCod7731\"> /u/FeistyCod7731 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kpy73v/i_need_a_book_recommendation_after_reading_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bo",
