When I made my first lava generator, I accidentally set alight the entire top floor of the tower base my friend and I spent around a week building. Avoid my early mistakes by following this guide on how to create a lava farm safely.</p><p>The basic concept of a lava farm is using <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-pointed-dripstone-stalagmites-and-stalactites-guide/1100-6526748/\">Minecraft dripstone</a>, cauldrons, and non-flammable materials to allow lava to drip down the pointed dripstone and collect in the cauldron. The entire process takes around 19 minutes to fill one cauldron with lava, so it's easier to have multiple cauldrons and dripstones set up.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large",
