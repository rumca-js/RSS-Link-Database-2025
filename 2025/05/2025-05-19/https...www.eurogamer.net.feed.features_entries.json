I'd arranged to be there for three days to see what a moment like this would be like from the inside. I was there the day before release, the day of release, and some of the day after, talking to the team about how they made the game and getting answers to pressing questions about controversies like the graphics downgrade while I was there.</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-cd-projekt-red-when-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-launched\">Read more</a></p>",
