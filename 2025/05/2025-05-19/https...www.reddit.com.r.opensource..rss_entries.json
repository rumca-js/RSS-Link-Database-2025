It\u2019s built on top of <strong>Backtrader</strong> in Python to find the patterns, then it stores all that info in a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database. On the frontend, I built an interactive candlestick chart using <strong>Canvas</strong> with <strong>React</strong> to visualize those patterns in real time.</p> <p>What\u2019s cool is that the whole thing is designed to be flexible \u2014 right now it finds ABCD patterns, but eventually anyone can plug in their own pattern detection scripts or feed their own data points to the canvas chart to visualize whatever they want. So it\u2019s kind of a platform for pattern detection and visualization, not just this one pattern.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking of open-sourcing it and would love to bring some folks on board to help build it out, improve the UX, add more pattern detectors, or whatever folks are interested in.</p> <",
