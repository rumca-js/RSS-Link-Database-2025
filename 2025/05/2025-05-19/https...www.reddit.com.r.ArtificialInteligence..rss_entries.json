So there is a 20 min video rundown: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/X37tgx0ngQE\">https://youtu.be/X37tgx0ngQE</a></p> <p>Paper itself: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335</a></p> <p>And tldr:</p> <p>Paper introduces Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a self-training model that generates and solves tasks without human data, excluding the first tiny bit of data that is used as a sort of ignition for the further process of self-improvement. Basically, it creates its own tasks and makes them more difficult with each step. At some point, it even begins to try to trick itself, behaving like a demanding teacher. No human involved in data prepping, answer verification, and so on.</p> <p>It also has to be running in tandem with other models that already understand language (as AZR is a newborn baby by itself). Although, as I understood, it did",
