While global climate models capture the big picture across the planet, they miss local high-impact weather events such as bushfires and extreme storms or the effect of mountains over the local weather. Regional models are like switching from binoculars to a magnifying glass, showing much more detail about what's happening locally.",

Recently, a team of scientists and engineers at Rice University discovered a similar phenomenon on a microscopic scale, where tiny magnetic particles driven by rotating fields spontaneously move along the edges of clusters driven by invisible \"edge currents\" that follow the rules of an unexpected branch of physics.",
