I&#39;ve currently got a Geforce RTX 2070 Gaming Z 8g card and so far have just played Half Life Alyx (and have been pretty happy with the performance). I wanted to play Alien Rogue Incursion, but noticed it&#39;s minimum card is a RTX 2080 Super. I&#39;ve got a friend who is selling a RTX 3060 OC 8gb; would this be an upgrade for me? I was surprised how much smaller and lighter this card was compared to my RTX 2070, which made me worried it was a cheaper/not as good build. Also, besides VR gaming I&#39;ll be re-encoding blurays, and doing some video editing.

At home it usually functions fine. I get a little under 500Mbps internet speed and it runs it off my 3D workstation that has a 13900k with a 4090. But whenever I&#39;ve tried to run Virtual Desktop somewhere else over their wifi, it lags so badly when I launch a game that I think the software is frozen. We&#39;re talking maybe a frozen frame every 15-20 seconds?</p> <p>My desktop is capable of handling higher resolutions but are there recommended settings when using wifi (of varying speeds) in the next town over? Any advice for getting it to work remotely like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",
