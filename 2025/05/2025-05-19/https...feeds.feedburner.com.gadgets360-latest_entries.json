Using stellar motion data from the dwarf galaxy Leo II and advanced computational models, the team ruled out lighter masses that cannot form observed structures. This challenges the popular fuzzy dark matter theory and paves the way for exploring mixed dark matter models, marking a major step in narrowing down the true nature of dark matter.",
