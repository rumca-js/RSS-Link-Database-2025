I&#39;m wondering how much you&#39;re involved, if at all, in the remediation process following a pentest. In my organisation, we register our highest risk findings in GRC tooling and after that we&#39;re involved as issue reviewers, so when teams put together an action plan we approve it, when they&#39;ve come up with a solution we retest/review it. We close issues, we change status if an issue is temporarily accepted, stuff like that. The whole process is messy and non-linear, and currently debates are underway as to what could be improved about it.</p> <p>Our feeling is, we should behave like an external pentest team. In other words, we perform the test, we deliver the report, and then people should basically consider us gone. We&#39;re willing to register these findings, just do the admin, but after that, it&#39;s up to the engineers and their managers to track the remediation proces",
