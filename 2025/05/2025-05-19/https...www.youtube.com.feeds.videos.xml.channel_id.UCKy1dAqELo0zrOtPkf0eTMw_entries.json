        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nGrand Theft Auto 6's delay disappointed a lot of gamers, but probably disappointed retailers even more. Analysts at Ampere are suggesting that the delay will cost the games industry around $2.7 billion dollars. The money isn't gone, however, merely moved to next year when GTA 6 drops on May 26. Speaking of that date, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick is confident that Rockstar Games can hit that date. Let's hope so\u2014there's $2.7 billion riding on it. And finally, Nintendo will make a return to the Gamescom show in Germany this year. Nintendo skipped last year's show, but with a new console and a handful of brand new first-party games coming this year, they have plenty to show off.",

When Zora\u2019s operation intersects with a civilian family whose boating expedition was capsized by marauding aquatic dinos, they all find themselves stranded",

        "description": "Whether you're wishing upon a star, partying under the sea, exploring a whole new world, letting it go, or feeling the love tonight, it's an accepted absolute truth that Disney films are pure magic. And that's where our list of the 25 best Disney animated movies comes in.\n\nBeasts and beauties, ladies and tramps, princesses and frogs - Walt Disney Animation Studios has been creating sublime ground-breaking entertainment for over 100 years and its feature films, starting with 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, have cemented a cinematic legacy.\nAs we now rank the top 25 Disney animated films - sorry, no Pixar on this list, folks (that's a different list) - please keep in mind that this was a Herculean effort (a hint based on one of the movies on the list, perhaps?) involving the weighing of time-honored classics, new upstart arrivals, the famed '90s resurgence/revival, and our own individual favorites. It's a blending of the best and brightest that Disney has to offer.\n\nMirror, mirr",
