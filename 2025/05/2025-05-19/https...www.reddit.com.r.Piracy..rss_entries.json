In fact, I\u2019ve come across a few articles from news outlets and some research from &quot;Muso&quot; and Deloitte discussing the connection between the rise in subscription prices and digital piracy, but nothing that qualifies as a peer-reviewed scientific study on the subject.</p> <p>Because ",
