        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden has terminal cancer. They expect us to believe that he was just diagnosed right after leaving office, but it\u2019s clear that he's been sick for a while\u2014and they covered it up. This is one of the greatest scandals in the history of American politics. Also, the Supreme Court demands that Trump stop deporting illegal aliens. The media are shocked to learn that, despite reports to the contrary, the pope is, in fact, Catholic. And a story goes viral of a young man who supposedly swiped right on Tinder 2 million times and landed only one date. Have things really gotten that bad on the dating scene?\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:31 Opening\n01:33 - 18:52 Joe Biden Has Terminal Cancer.
