While it can be used for various advanced thread-based operations, DLL injection is just a small example included to demonstrate its capabilities.</p> <p>The library emphasizes minimal footprint and low detectability, making it suitable for scenarios where stealth is critical. It avoids any common injection or allocation techniques that might trigger alarms.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in thread context manipulation or stealthy process interaction, feel free to check it out:</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Melodic_Nature_1748\"> /u/Melodic_Nature_1748 </a> <br/> <",
