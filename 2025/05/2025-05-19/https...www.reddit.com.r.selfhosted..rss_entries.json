The progress I made during this year is pretty impressive, at least to myself: from nothing, Dawarich is now a known and loved piece of software, that is being run on dozens and dozens of home labs, and so many people are tracking their geodata, I can&#39;t even imagine. I literally can&#39;t, since, you know, there is no way to know how many of you are using it. But almost 5k stars on Github and nearly 150 supporters across <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/freika\">Patreon</a>, <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/freika\">Ko-fi</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/Freika\">GitHub</a> says something, and I want to say thank you to you, my good people of <a href=\"/r/selfhosted\">r/selfhosted</a> and those who support or ever suppor",

Ideally what ever I use, I think I&#39;d like it to be a simple, energy efficient setup. I don&#39;t need it to stream media, only need it to replace cloud storage. Overall storage capacity would be 6-8tb (currently just over 1tb). I&#39;d rather not go with a pre built NAS and I don&#39;t want my data to be locked into some proprietary software.
