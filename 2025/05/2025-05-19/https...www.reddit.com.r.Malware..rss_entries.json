They send you emails from <a href=\"mailto:ahhcj@hjdqbthrvu.meko.pp.ua\">ahhcj@hjdqbthrvu.meko.pp.ua</a> .Their primary targets are Hungarians. The links in it direct to storage.googleapis.com to a /mastfox/masterxifo.html subdomain with a custom hash looking ID. There are multiple links in the email itself depending where you click in it but they reach the same target domains, namely open01.store and sunsettravels.com if I\u2019m correct. Only the hash(?) ID differs in the url&#39;s. I\u2019ve done many curl scans, app.any.run scans and Hybrid Analysis sessions on these links, basically it just redirects you to certain pages but does evil things during the redirection process. That\u2019s all that I could did with them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sea-Hat5746\"> /u/Sea-Hat5746 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/4raivo38vp1f1.jpeg\">[link",
