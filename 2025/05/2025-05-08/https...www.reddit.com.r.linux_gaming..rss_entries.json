Long story short, all my games launching from Steam using proton reported their max resolution as being 1080P even though I am using a 4K display, I use a 65&quot; TV for all my computing and gaming. I ran through some steps, and I could use gamescope to override the resolutions and it worked, but it&#39;s kinda crashy and unstable with my current config. After much faffing about I figured out it was my system scaling options. Turns out that when the plasma setting &#39;scaled by the system&#39; setting is used games report 1080P sincee I am using a 2X scale for the desktop and when it is set to &#39;apply scaling themselves&#39; games will properly report resolutions fine.</p> <p>is there any way to selectively opt something like Steam out of scaling so it launches all games just as they are supposed to be? Browsers and really a boat load of apps don&#39;t scale properly e",

I was intending on switching my gaming PC over to Mint or Fedora and then discovered the issues surrounding anti-cheat on Linux.</p> <p>Unfortunately about half of the games I play involve anti-cheat, so that is a deal-breaker for me. But before I move on from the idea of using Linux for my gaming PC (for a while at least), I want to ensure I&#39;m not missing anything.</p> <p>I know I can&#39;t use Linux natively. I thought maybe I can still run Linux but just run a Windows VM when playing those games, but my understanding is that the VM wouldn&#39;t have kernel access, which is require by the anti-cheat tools, and would also not work.</p> <p>This correct, anything I&#39;m missing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tonebastion\"> /u/tonebastion </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https",

I disabled my iGPU and have been running games off my 6600 for the past couple months. This has worked great until a few days ago. I was playing Marvel Rivals and my game kept crashing so I tried a few other games (Halo Infinite and Left 4 Dead 2) and they both crashed. Though when I switch to the iGPU it worked just fine.</p> <p>I realized at one point though that I could still hear, it&#39;s just there was no display. I think my GPU is crashing and not rebooting itself but I&#39;m not sure how to troubleshoot this. Any advice would be great. </p> <p>My Mesa version is 25.0.5-arch1.1</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hercislife23\"> /u/Hercislife23 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1khetvx/help_troubleshooting_gpu_crashing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",
