        "description": "Ah, the Cyberdemon. A classic monstrosity that has been one of DOOM's most iconic and formidable foes for literally as long as DOOM has existed, and one that, across the series' many different renditions across its long lifetime thus far, has never failed to make a strong and lasting impression.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Cyberdemon is set to return to the fray with the upcoming DOOM: The Dark Ages, so before we jump back into the medieval battlefield with this iconic demon, here, we're going to look back at its history across DOOM.",

        "description": "In its original form, the DOOM franchise was never too focused on lore or storytelling, but over the last decade or so, things have certainly changed. Make no mistake, DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal are by no means story focused games, with the combat and the action very much being the focus, but both games did add to the larger DOOM universe and its lore in significant ways. \n\nThe upcoming DOOM: The Dark Ages is set to not only continue down that path, but even take it a step further- though the upcoming first person shooter is obviously still going to be about ripping and tearing demons first and foremost - it\u2019s still DOOM, at the end of the day \u2013 id Software has also repeatedly stressed that it\u2019s upping the ante with its story as well. \n\nWith way more cutscenes and a prequel tale that makes jts narrative much more front facing than the  traditional storytelling that the series has adopted in recent years, DOOM: The Dark Ages is promising to be a much more story driven experience, even ",

        "description": "DOOM: The Dark Ages plunges DOOM Slayer into a techno medieval battleground, him being the supercharged weapon chosen to a wage war on demons. This is a prequel to DOOM\u2019s 2016 reboot, yet DOOM Slayer\u2019s abilities \u2013 despite canonically taking place before events of DOOM and DOOM Eternal \u2013 are more widespread than ever. \n\nA modified combat philosophy, crazy, never before seen weapons, redesigned monsters, unexplored biomes, dragons, mechs; id Software are throwing everything at DOOM: The Dark Ages. \n\nIn their mind, this DOOM title will be their magnum opus. Whilst some of the changes are proving controversial before release, it\u2019s hard to see DOOM: The Dark Ages as anything other than another rip-roaring success in what is a long line of incredible DOOM games.",
