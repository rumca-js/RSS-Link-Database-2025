It was beutifully written, the characters were amazing, and the story kept me hooked all the way through.</p> <p>That said, it was the single most depressing series I have ever read. It&#39;s hard to describe what this series made me feel. It kept me engaged enough that I couldn&#39;t stop reading the series, but there were multiple times that I considered putting it down for good because it almost always put me in a bad mood. I liked the series, but reading it was honestly not an enjoyable experience and I&#39;m relieved to be done with it. I really like the world of the series though and I&#39;m thinking about continuing on to the other Elderlings books.</p> <p>My question is this: are the other books as consistently depressing as the first three?

Some have men who crossdress to escape a difficult situation (e.g., A convict who escapes prison.) I&#39;m mainly not looking for that, but from how I (yes, I\u2019m a fellow MTF Crossdresser) use it to express often my concealed self. They\u2019re Cis, yet they love crossdressing as women, expressing a part of themselves, which many have to keep hidden, though some don\u2019t. Some venture past the door of their safe homes, bathrooms, or bedrooms and tell their friends and family. I&#39;d like the latter, where they freely express themselves without scrutiny and what TVTropes would call a Wholesome Crossdresser.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IDiskThing\"> /u/IDiskThing </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",

Does anyone have any recommendations for similar series? </p> <p>Other books I absolutely loved were One Dark Window, Defy the Night, The Hunger Games, Throne of Glass, and This Woven Kingdom. I love political intrigue and/or unique magic systems, yearning, and being emotionally wrecked. I am not the biggest fan of heavy smut or extremely tropey books like Powerless (I personally deem it 1 star). I also disliked From Blood and Ash for these reasons.
