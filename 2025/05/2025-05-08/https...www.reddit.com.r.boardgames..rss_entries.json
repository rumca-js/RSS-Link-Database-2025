My path was Catan \u2192 Agricola \u2192 All games. Now, 12 years later, I\u2019m the proprieter of a curated collection of maybe eighty games ranging from party to strategy; I\u2019ve consumed most of the available board game content on the internet; etc -- you probably know the story. Up until a year ago, I would have said that my favorites were Brass, Great Western Trail, Tigris &amp; Euphrates.</p> <p>I finally decided to buy an 18xx game a year ago after seeing SUSD\u2019s review of Shikoku 1889. For better and for worse, it has led to a paradigm shift in my gaming. I am fortunate to have a near-weekly game group, and -- folks, we haven\u2019t gotten anything but 18xx to the table since that fateful purchase. My poor other games, they gather dust! </p> <p>The level of strategy in 18xx is unparalleled; there\u2019s just so much dang meat on those bones that m",

Sleeved cards then get shuffled and revealed granting whoever sleeved that card a bonus/effect. I wanna say it had a medieval theme.</p> <p>Sadly that&#39;s all I remember.</p> <p>Do any of you know a game like that? </p> <p>Tried googling and looking through Reddit/BGG threads but it&#39;s all ads or people asking to sleeve or not to sleeve their cards. </p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> <p>Edit: it&#39;s not one of the &quot;upgrade your cards&quot; game with the see through plastic cards. In the game you would draft and sleeve cards to essentially claim them.</p> <p>Edit 2: It&#39;s &quot;For a Crown&quot;</p> <p><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/431248/for-a-crown\">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/431248/for-a-crown</a></p> <p>",
