Many global reviews miss local details, so I have been adding info about Moroccan payment methods, language options, and real user experiences from this region. The page is mobile-friendly, and I am working on improving usability in both Arabic and French.

Name yourself Bro, Sis, Queen, King, or just use your name. And instead of sending random quotes at random times, you pick the hours of your day when you\u2019re open to motivation like 9 to 6 or whatever fits your routine.

A few months ago, I started drawing coloring pages for my younger kids, simple stuff, just to keep them engaged while we talked about the world.</p> <p>From that came Luma, a tiny unicorn who travels from country to country. She quickly became a character my kids adored. They asked where she\u2019d go next, what she\u2019d see, what colors she\u2019d bring back. It turned into a nightly ritual.</p> <p>I kept creating, page after page. And eventually, I thought maybe other families might enjoy this too. So I turned it into a little book and self-published it on Amazon.</p> <p>It\u2019s not perfect. I\u2019ve learned everything along the way: formatting, KDP quirks, visual layout, even marketing. But honestly, I\u2019m just proud I saw it through.</p> <p>If anyone\u2019s curious or working on something similar, I\u2019d love to connect.

After seven months of effort it plateaued at $100 MRR, and I hardly used it myself. In February 2025, after a year of working on the project, I decided to reflect on what to do next and I also realised that I actually do use the app but only while traveling. So I niched down and rebuilt it as Spentrip. First week live: $100 in sales - already matching Receiptix\u2019s peak.</p> <p>Last July I shipped Receiptix, a <em>track-anything</em> expense app. I thought that, by entering into a very packed market, I could capture a slice of the pie. Nothing to validate, and the users were obviously out there. The reality check:</p> <ul> <li>Launch (July 2024) - first paid user a month later for $8.</li> <li>Seven months of iterations - max $100 MRR. Worse, I wasn\u2019t even using the app myself which should&#39;ve told me something.</li> </ul> <p>",
