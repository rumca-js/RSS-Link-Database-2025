I don&#39;t really see how to make this useful in an RSS reader - I feel like what you really want is a feed of new threads as they&#39;re created, like a subreddit rss feed. but these always seem to function as if you follow a subreddit rss feed and it contained every comment on every post in the sub in order.</p> <p>I&#39;m just curious if anyone has an approach to processing these forum rss feeds in their reader (I use freshrss fwiw). Is there an rss-bridge bridge I could make use of?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ambiance6462\"> /u/ambiance6462 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1khudzm/following_oldschool_forums_via_rss/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss",
