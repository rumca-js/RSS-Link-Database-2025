I currently use several RPIs + audio HATs as Roon endpoints (if you\u2019re not familiar with Roon it\u2019s an audio distribution system somewhat similar to Sonos but with a more sophisticated user interface). I bought a new home that has a very old Russound audio system with built in speakers, etc. It\u2019s a POS and its distributed amps are failing in several rooms. </p> <p>I got the idea to replace these with more RPIs. Fortunately there is already CAT5 cabling to every in-wall Russound amp location so my thought is I\u2019d replace each with an RPI + 7\u201dtouchscreen + digiAMP+</p> <p>Question: will PoE provide enough power to power all of this?

The volume level will have a separate display as well but I haven&#39;t found the right one yet.</p> <p>After working on this project trying to get the speakers to work I found out that phones have a specific way to transmit meta data through AVRCP Bluetooth but I can&#39;t find a receiver that would work with it. I saw some research that I&#39;ll need to use a blueALSA program to make it work but am skeptical. I really want this speaker to work with any phone ( android or iPhone ) and with any music streaming (apple music, spotify, or you",
