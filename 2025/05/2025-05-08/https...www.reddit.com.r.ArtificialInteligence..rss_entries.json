It draws inspiration from ecological principles of systemic health and the &quot;art&quot; of conscious, co-creative interaction. While employing evocative terminology for its broader philosophical goals, this specific &quot;Mechanistic Interpretability&quot; (MI) articulation focuses on translating these goals into more structured, analyzable, and potentially implementable components.
