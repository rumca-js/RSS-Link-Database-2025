While effective, this method can be cumbersome, especially if the changes are minor or if I want to avoid altering the Dockerfile for specific updates.</p> <p>I am therefore exploring an alternative method that would allow me to directly update layer 5 and all subsequent layers without the need to modify the Dockerfile or rely on the docker build command.

Forgive me if it seems a bit dumb, but I just need to check, as I have never used Docker and I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for. So, here goes:</p> <p>I returned to Windows in October last year after 7 years or so on ChromeOS. I loved ChromeOS, even though I now realise thatWindows is far superior in terms of sheer potential and possibility. However, one thing that ChromeOS had that I cannot believe does not exist in Windows is Desk Templates. You could configure a virtual desktop with everything you need, adjust the layout and then save it as a template. When you restarted the system, the template would be there, along with up to five others, complete with all the apps and windows in exactly the same configuration.</p> <p>This was fantastic. I&#39;m a language trainer, so to have one template with everything I need for student planning, another for follow-up, was incredibly usefu",
