It would be cool if the girl got hurt sometimes cuz for some reason writers and film writers are scared of doing that. I like action, adventure, supernatural, stuff like that.

So im a BIG fan of werewolf books, but good ones are super hard to find :( so i thought i\u2019d come in here and ask for some recommendations! Heres what the book NEEDS to have: - Werewolf mc/werewolf centred plot - pretty horror based - very angsty! Im a very gore/angst/whump heavy reader :3 - no spice! Heres just some of my preferences: - i dont like a lot of romance, but if theres romance, please have a small amount - also if theres any romance, id very much prefer it be queer - id prefer a modern setting - medium-long book - id prefer it being in third person</p> <p>Things i dont mind: I dont mind when it was written! I dont care how big/small the vocab of the writter is! I dont care what gender the main character is! I dont care how big/small the supporting cast is! I dont care about the setting (refering to magic world/non magic world)!</p> <p>Thank you guys in advance :3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",

When my interest in reading started to trickle out, the only storylines that kept me intrigued were crime mysteries, heists, and mafia or gang stories. I don\u2019t remember what the titles were, but now I\u2019ve decided I should find some new ones to read instead.</p> <p>During my pursuit of good crime books, I have found it\u2019s extremely hard to find novels that aren\u2019t \u201ccorny.\u201d Either the book is heavily slathered in stereotypes, weird romances, cliches that are unrealistic, or in general just not very well written. </p> <p>I\u2019m a pretty open minded lady, so I\u2019ll take any suggestions!! Nonfiction, like biographies, or true stories. Fiction, or even fiction based off real history.

And yes, I know this can be gained from YouTube, Podcasts or other online sources, but I want books (because ownership is also a big topic at the moment and, with everything going on, I don&#39;t want to get all of my information from a TikTok account).</p> <p>So, I would really appreciate recommendations on any topics mentioned above (economics, globalisation, history of countries, sociology). It can be background and history, commentaries on world events even biographies about important figures - I just really want to be <em>informed.</em> Books like <em>The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</em> or <em>Amusing ourselves to Death -</em> they don&#39;t have to be recent either!</p>",

I\u2019ve been deep into nonfiction books and podcasts (history, political, policy) mostly because of interest and also my work that it\u2019s honestly affecting my mood and making me upset seeing so many things wrong. Anyway, I\u2019m desperate to get some good books but have been out of the loop for the last few years on where to find said books and what is worth reading. The last good feel good fiction book I remember enjoying was The Devil Wears Prada and I think I\u2019ve read a few other books Lauren Weisberger wrote. I\u2019m seeking similar books - very 90s/00s girl power, fashion, light romance story books I can read to escape and get lost in the beauty of fashion and living a la Carrie Bradshaw days.
