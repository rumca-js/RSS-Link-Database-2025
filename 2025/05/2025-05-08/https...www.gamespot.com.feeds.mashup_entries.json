Not to be outdone by his co-star, Walter Goggins, who plays the mysterious Ghoul on the show, de-Ghoul'd himself over at the show's official <a href=\"https://x.com/falloutonprime/status/1920533288629792880\">Twitter page</a>, also sharing the news.</p><p>The bad news? Well, there's still no official release date, but it's safe to assume with a similar post-production schedule of Season 1, Lucy, the Ghoul, and Maximus could be back on our screens in a bit over a year.
