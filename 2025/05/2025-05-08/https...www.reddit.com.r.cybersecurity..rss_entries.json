My previous work was a SOC L1 and only had 1 month experience as a SOC L2 since they\u2019ve made me a backfill just to fulfill the L2 role for a month. Do you have any tips on how I can learn more on how to handle alert(Correlating logs, Threat hunting and etc) efficiently and effectively? Been stucked as a Tier 1 for almost 4 years and been comfortable (My fault for not locking in early) with my work and haven\u2019t really improved on how to be an L2. For now I\u2019ve finished ISC (CC) just to show my fundamentals are still there and currently checking for sec+ and cysa+ next. I know it\u2019s not too late to study again and focus on improving myself. I just want to know if you guys happen to know resources about how to investigate (SIEM/EDR) alerts from start to finish? or playbooks for this type of alert (ex. Multiple failed logins, Cred stuff, Priv escalation) or any common types of alerts from SIEM/EDR? I\u2019ve encountered the alerts that I\u2019ve ment",
