Despite being less than three minutes long, the trailer is packed with a huge amount of clues to the game's current technical make-up, including its resolution and frame-rate figures, as well as a look at some of the graphical techniques that will define its overall look. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-gta-6-trailer-2-tech-breakdown-incredible-realism-impressive-rt-astonishing-detail\">Read more</a></p>",

Its black walls are adorned with giant film posters for <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding\">Death Stranding</a>, with side routes leading to meeting rooms and facilities rather than screens. Along another section of wall are a series of signed plaques and polaroids from various stars of film, games, music, and beyond who have each visited the studio. It's as if the very walls themselves are taking us through <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima\">Hideo Kojima</a>'s mind - or are simply an extension of his social media feed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic\">Read more</a></p>",
