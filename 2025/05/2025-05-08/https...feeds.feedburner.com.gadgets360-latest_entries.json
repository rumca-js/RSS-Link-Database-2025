        "description": "Apple is said to have seen a significant decline in the demand for its smartwatches in most regions. As per a market research firm, 2024 was the second consecutive year where Apple Watch shipments declined by a striking margin. One of the most notable areas where shipments fell is North America, the Cupertino-based tech giant\u2019s home turf. This is attributed to the lack of new models, as well as minimal upgrades made to the existing lineup in the last year.",
