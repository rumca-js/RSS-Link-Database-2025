So, if gremlins visit your house too, or if you just need some high-speed charging cables to take advantage of your high-speed charging plugs, then you might want to grab <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Charging-iPhone-MacBook/dp/B09LCJPZ1P/\">this two-pack of Anker USB-C cables for just $12 on Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part about these USB-C cables is that they deliver charging speeds of up to 100 watts. That\u2019s more than most power blocks can even output, so you\u2019re good to go for several years at least. You can use these to charge your phone, laptop, or anything else that connects via USB-C. And these are excellent for use with fast-charging p",
