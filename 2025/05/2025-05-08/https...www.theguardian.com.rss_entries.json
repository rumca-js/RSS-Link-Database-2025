He flies up and down the left flank, defends well and whips in crosses. However, the Fulham defender was not at his sharpest during his side\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/03/aston-villa-fulham-premier-league-match-report\">defeat to Aston Villa </a>last weekend. He found it difficult to contain Morgan Rogers and his crossing was not up to its usual high standards. The concern is whether Robinson, who had missed Fulham\u2019s previous game, is in peak physical condition. It has been a long campaign but Marco Silva needs the USA international to be ready to go when Everton visit Craven Cottage on Saturday.

If you\u2019ve seen the newly released second trailer from GTA6 \u2013 somewhat cruelly released just days after we discovered the game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/may/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-until-may-2026\">won\u2019t be out until next May</a> \u2013 then you might know what I mean. The brand new thing is romance.</p><p>It\u2019s now clear that the key protagonists of the latest gangland adventure are Lucia Caminos and Jason Duval, two twentysomething lovers from the wrong side of the tracks. He\u2019s ex-army, now working for drug runners; she\u2019s fresh out of jail, looking to make a better life for herself and her beloved mom. They fall for each",
