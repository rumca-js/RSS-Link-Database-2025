        "description": "ZipDoor magnetic door kit\u2026I use a @zipwall_llc door on every bathroom renovation because it keeps dust out of the rest of the house. I love this option because it uses double-sided tape (three rolls come with the door) and creates a tight seal. The magnetic door is reusable and self-closes which is helpful when carrying tools or gear. This is a great option for any doorway. Many thanks to ZipWall for partnering with me on this tutorial and making products that keep people and pets safe \u2764\ufe0f#zipwall #dustcontrol #homerenovation #diy #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
