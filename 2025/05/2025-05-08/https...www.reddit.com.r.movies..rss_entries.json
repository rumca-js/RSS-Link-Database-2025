It showcases great BMX riding accompanied by an awesome soundtrack and if it weren&#39;t for these rockin&#39; tunes the movie wouldn&#39;t be half as enjoyable as it is. Right from the start you&#39;re hit with a killer BMX montage cut to &quot;Break the Ice&quot; by John Farnham (one of several songs he did for the film). Shortly after that you hear &quot;Get Strange&quot; by Hubert Kah as Cru (the lead character) evades the local sheriff through a lumber yard. Later on you&#39;re treated to feats of gracefulness as Cru and Christian (Cru&#39;s love interest) BMX boogie to &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot; by Real Life.

This wasn\u2019t just a tragedy of circumstance, but it was also a tragedy of pride. Seita\u2019s decision to leave the relative safety of his aunt\u2019s home wasn\u2019t just impulsive; it was fatal.
