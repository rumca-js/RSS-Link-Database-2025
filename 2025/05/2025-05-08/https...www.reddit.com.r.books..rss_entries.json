Their method of communication is kind of hard to explain, it would be like if one manipulated time and action to result in a creation of Stonehenge and the other would &quot;read&quot; that message and respond in turn by manipulating time and action to result in The Great Wall of China as a response. This book did give me that Vonnegut feeling of being small and ultimately insignificant in the great unknown universe and time, of feeling manipulated for a cause that I don&#39;t know about or signed up for.
