This is our live virtual demo session and it&#39;s a great way to get to know more about Wagtail because you&#39;ll have all the experts right there to toss your questions at. </p> <p>Don&#39;t know what Wagtail is? Wagtail is a Django-powered content management system. Some people think of Wagtail as a prettier Django admin that they don&#39;t have to maintain as much. Other people think of it as a highly customizable publishing system. Some people even bootstrap it for managing data entry databases. </p> <p>If you&#39;re curious at all, we have two live sessions next week.
