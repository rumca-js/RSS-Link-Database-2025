We are looking for someone who wants to become a partner for the long term, which means we would trade equity not salary payments. If wanted, we could offer a one time payment and a little less equity. This is a chance to build something meaningful together, with shared ownership and creative input from the start. Ideally we would want someone who us based in Melbourne so we can work and collaborate on this together!</p> <p>If you\u2019re someone who loves building innovative stuff, and wants to be part of something from the ground up, let\u2019s have a chat. Or if you know someone who fits the bill, feel free to point them ",
