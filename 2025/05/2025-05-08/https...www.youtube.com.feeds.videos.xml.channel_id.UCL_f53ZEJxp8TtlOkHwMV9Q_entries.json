        "description": "Dr. Jordan Peterson breaks down what the media has framed as a battle between Harvard University and the Trump administration\u2014but it's much deeper than that. Peterson exposes the ideological decay at the heart of elite academic institutions, driven by the dogma of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) and enforced through cowardice, corruption, and groupthink.\n\nFrom firsthand experience at Harvard, McGill, and the University of Toronto, Peterson connects the dots between academia's collapse and its ripple effect on society. With insights into why DEI statements are eroding scientific credibility, how universities became ideological factories, and why the future of higher education may lie in alternatives like Peterson Academy, this episode is a must-watch for anyone who cares about truth, merit, and intellectual freedom.\n\nThis episode was filmed on April 30th, 2025.\n\nUnlock the ad-free experience of The Jordan B.
