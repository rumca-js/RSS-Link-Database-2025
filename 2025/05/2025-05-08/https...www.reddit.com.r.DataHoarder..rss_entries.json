I tried reading the FAQ, but honestly most of that went over my head as I&#39;m brand new to this. </p> <p>My question is very simple; I&#39;m looking for the most reliable way to back up some data that I have (PDFs, Word Docs/Excel, maybe some pictures and video). All personal data, so there isn&#39;t a whole lot as of right now, easily less than 1TB. I have a few random USB flashdrives of varying capacities, as well as a few SD cards. Upon reading this sub and looking into this question on a few others, I&#39;ve learned that SD cards are probably the most unreliable, so I won&#39;t pursue them much any more. </p> <p>Could I store my information on USB thumbdrives (1 as primary and another just for redundancy)? Is there a certain brand I should get, and any I should absolutely stay away from? I plan to load the data, and put them in a weatherproof safe, and update maybe once a year. </p> <",

We&#39;re doing this because we&#39;re afraid of disk rot. I&#39;ve been using Brasero on my linux laptop to make ISO files. Which is what I want, essentially - iso files of each disk. However it&#39;s extremely annoying because you cannot run multiple brasero instances at the same time, even though I have two dvd drives. I&#39;d use MakeMKV but I&#39;d rather use freeware and it just seems like using a space shuttle to get from NYC to Boston (I&#39;d think of a better analogy but not enough time right now). I recently discovered I can simply drag the files over to a new folder in my file explorer (PCManFM on Debian) but I tried that today and the files would not copy over, there were errors. Is there a simpler way to do multiple dvds at once? Please help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/whirlpool97\"",
