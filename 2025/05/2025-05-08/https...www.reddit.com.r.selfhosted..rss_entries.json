As soon as I discovered ProxMox I started self hosting a lot of useful apps on my Minisforum MS-01. However, I have never been able to find an alternative for Motion, a smart planning and calendar app. I have a subscription, but I only use about 20% of its functionality, since it feels more suited for Teams. At 300 something dollars per year this feels like overkill. I like the smart planning functionality, where I assign a priority and it automatically finds a suitable slot in my calendar. Another feature I love is where I drag-select days and periods and Motion automatically creates a calendar with available time slots to send to contacts. </p> <p>I browsed the awesome self hosted site, but can&#39;t find anything that matches. So that&#39;s why I turn to the experts: you. Thanks in advance for suggestions and tips. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",

Currently, I am trying to figure out, where I would best host an Authelia instance. In this regard I tried finding information about as to what would happen if I had set up Authelia for my services and it were to suddenly break/not be available. However, either I used wrong search terms (more likely case), or there actually is no information regarding this topic (less likely case ;) ).</p> <p>Would I be locked out of all of my services? Or would I still be able to login locally (given correct configuration of the services)?</p> <p>Further, given I currently host nearly all my services in my home lab at home (meaning, there is nothing externally on a public cloud or similar): would you say it suffices to have Authelia hosted on this same lab env? Or would you rather host it in a public cloud?</p> <p>If you were able put me in the right direction, that would be awesome.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",
