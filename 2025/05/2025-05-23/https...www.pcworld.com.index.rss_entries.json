But while the big hardware announcements may have left PC building enthusiasts craving more, fun components still could be found around the show. Like PC cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven\u2019t been on the show floor, but I\u2019m still pumped for the news that I\u2019ve been devouring while at home. I wasn\u2019t exactly planning a makeover for my rig just yet, but I\u2019m now awfully tempted by what\u2019s coming down the pipeline. Especially by one case in particular.<br><br>(It\u2019s not the one all my colleagues want.)</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Interested in all <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2791721/best-of-computex-2025.html\">the best hardware out of Computex</a>?

Not so with the Acer Swift 16 AI, which has an 8-core Intel Core Ultra 7 256V processor. Paired to 16GB of RAM and an OLED touchscreen, it\u2019s a pretty serious little machine. Today, you can <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/256904160754\">get it refurbished for just $690</a>\u2014that\u2019s over $500 off the retail price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those looking for a little extra breathing room for work will appreciate the 16-inch 2880\u00d71800 screen, which will also look gorgeous for video and some light gaming thanks to the OLED panel. Other highlights include 16GB of RAM\u2014the bare minimum I would suggest for Windows 11\u2014plus a full 1TB SSD, an infrared camera for Windows Hello, and an extended keyboard with a number pad area. There are plenty of ports too, with double USB-C, double USB-A, and ",

Today, the latest version of SteamOS officially supports the Lenovo Legion Go SteamOS Edition, the first third-party handheld gaming PC to run Steam right out of the box. It\u2019s scheduled for a retail release later this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAdded official support for the Lenovo Legion Go S,\u201d reads <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/820329049655084700\">the update notes for SteamOS 3.7.8 Stable</a>. Among a long list of bug fixes and other adjustments, Valve also lists \u201cImproved support for other AMD powered handhelds (like the ROG Ally and original Legion Go).\u201d That indicates, with very little room for doubt, that fully-compatible Linux-based builds for these other devices from Asus and Lenovo are on their way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>",
