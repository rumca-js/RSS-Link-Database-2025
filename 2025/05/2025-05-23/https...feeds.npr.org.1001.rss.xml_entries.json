        "description": "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem got a pop quiz at a senate hearing this week. The question came from Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan, of New Hampshire.<br><br>Hassan asked Noem to to explain habeas corpus.  <br><br>For the record, habeas corpus is the legal principle, enshrined in the Constitution, that protects people from illegal detention. <br><br>The reason that this bit of Latin is under discussion \u2013 is because the Trump administration says it's considering suspending habeas corpus. <br><br>This core constitutional protection has been an obstacle to the President's mass deportation plan. <br><br>Habeas corpus is a principle that's hundreds of years older than America itself.<br><br>What would it mean if the President suspended it? And could he, under the Constitution? <br><br>For sponsor-free episodes of <em>Consider This,</em> sign up for C<em>onsider This+</em> via Apple Podcasts or at <a href=\"http://plus.npr.org/\">plus.npr.org</a>.<br><br>Email us at <a href=\"mail",

Because of this, Ukraine is at the cutting edge of drone innovation, churning out some two million unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, last year. These flying drones come in all sizes and they're produced in factories large and high-tech, as well as small and shoestring. In today's episode, NPR's Eleanor Beardsley takes us inside a drone-making operation in Kyiv.",
