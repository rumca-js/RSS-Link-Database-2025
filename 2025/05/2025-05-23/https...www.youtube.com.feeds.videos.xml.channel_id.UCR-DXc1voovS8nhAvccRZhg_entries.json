        "description": "The TypeOrTalk is a local, private, offline AI-powered keyboard that translates your speech into text. And it's a fine custom mechanical keyboard, too!\n\nIf you want to get notified of any updates, check out: https://typeortalk.com\nAnd Sam's auctioning off a prototype on eBay! Check it out here: https://www.ebay.com/itm/267259133332\n\nSam paid me nothing for this video, and I'm shipping him back the keyboard now that I'm finished testing it. He and I have been talking (and typing, lol) about this project for a while, and I wanted to show off his project since I thought it was a neat idea and an inspirational project for anyone thinking a project like this is out of reach of an individual!\n\nWhat do you think? Also check out the long form video going over this and a bunch of other CM5 hardware projects!\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\nMerch: https://www.redshirtjeff.com\n2nd Channel: https://www.youtu",
