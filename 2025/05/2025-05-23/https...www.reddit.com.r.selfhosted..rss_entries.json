The station, Germanys SWR Kultur, offers urls for when radio streaming which can be easily streamed and saved via VLC. Since I most likely won\u2019t be near my computer at the time the broadcast starts, I thought I might turn to some kind of solution involving my home server. Some googling only returned solutions that are quite involved to set up and might or might not work, and solutions for setting up an own radio station. Does anyone have any ideas for software that I can host and tell it to record from time A till time B \u2014 ideally with an option to easily run it in docker containers.

I\u2019ve set up a Jellyfin server and that\u2019s been great too. I\u2019ve planned to switch to that but of course, Samsung / Tizen doesn\u2019t have a Jellyfin app. So I make a facebook deal to get a AppleTv 4k so I can use Swiftfin and stream on that.

Didn\u2019t know that so now that\u2019s out. Leaving me with Infuse but holy crap I do all this so I don\u2019t have to pay.
