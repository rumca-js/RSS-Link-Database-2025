        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So in Turkey, phones that are from abroad only work for 120 days per sim card slot/imei number. Meaning, any smartphone that isn&#39;t registered here, when you insert a sim card into it, it begins a 120 days count down, after that finishes, you can&#39;t make or receive calls or sms. With a dual sim phone, you can use it for 8 months and the rest of the year, you need to use another phone for hot-spot as well as making and receiving calls. This applies to any brand. This block on the imei number gets lifted in January of every year. Google pixels aren&#39;t available for sale in Turkey, I wanted to get one to run GrapheneOs on it but I wanted to make sure that I would be able to change the imei number to my current Turkish phone. There is a tax that one can pay to register the phone and use it normally, but it&#39;s more than $1k, which is pretty darn expensive.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ez",

Which ones are best/why? Are there any meaningful differences or just user preference? Are the file search sites in the megathread also currently the best ones? (No idea when or if that gets updated since it got created) </p> <p>I just bought a PC a few months ago after not having one for a VERY long time, so I want to do this properly for the odd media I&#39;ll bother to watch.
