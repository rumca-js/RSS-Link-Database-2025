I am a felon in the state of Arkansas and was wondering if anyone knows if this would be a good career choice for me? I have drug charges, some are class A. Would this prevent me from getting jobs in this field? Would this degree be worth pursuing? I am feeling very discouraged lately and like a failure because I feel like I am so so smart and I wasted my potential because I went to prison. Getting a job anywhere has been hard for me due to my record and I heard that computer tech jobs are felon friendly and avg salary in my state is around 60k. Also is getting my degree in computer science better than maybe going to a computer tech bootcamp type of thing? Any recommendations on some tech boot camps if anyone has taken any?
