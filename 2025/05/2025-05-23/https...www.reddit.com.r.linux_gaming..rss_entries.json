Running games in the iGPU is fine, but obviously leaves me with lackluster performance. There&#39;s also incessant screen tearing when launching any application with the dedicated card, to the extent that most apps are unusable.</p> <p>I originally had a 6.1 kernel, so I tried updating to kernel 6.12.22 (backport) to no avail. I was sure to follow this guide (<a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/AtiHowTo\">https://wiki.debian.org/AtiHowTo</a>) to the letter, so all my drivers and gpu firmware should be up to date. My bios is up to date as well. I&#39;d be very grateful for any suggestions.</p> <p>edit:",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Good day fellas, I formatted my computer this year to change the SSD. I&#39;ve been using Arch Linux for 5 years, and even before formatting I used TLauncher to play Minecraft and I&#39;ve never had any problems with any version. After this formatting, whenever I try to open any version of Minecraft the game simply doesn&#39;t open and a main error appears:</p> <p><code>OpenGL: ~~ERROR~~ RuntimeException: No OpenGL context found in the current thread.</code></p> <p>I&#39;ve already tried updating the video card drivers and also tried other launchers such as Prism, Polly, etc., but none of them work.</p> <p>I&#39;d like some help, I&#39;ve had that annual urge to play Minecraft and I&#39;m genuinely desperate hahahaha</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TrueVoice7942\"> /u/TrueVoice7942 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1kt9glp/problem_with_opengl_when_trying_to_pl",
