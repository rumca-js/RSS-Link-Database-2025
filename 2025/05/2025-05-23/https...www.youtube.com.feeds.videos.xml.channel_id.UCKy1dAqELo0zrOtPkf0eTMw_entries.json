George R.R. Martin, who contributed lore and story elements to the game, is coming aboard as a producer, but no story or casting details have been made available. It's also unclear what game director Hidetaka Miyazaki's role will be, if any. In other news, the FTC vs Microsoft trial over the $69-billion-dollar acquisition of Activision Blizzard King may be officially coming to an end. The FTC is dropping its challenge to the ruling, which cleared the way for the industry-shaking deal. And finally, Marvel Studios is shifting its MCU lineup again, pushing back release dates of several projects, including Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. They are now slated for December 2026 and December 2027, respectively.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #EldenRing",

Their lives changed when Talk To Me, their feature directorial debut, sparked a bidding war at Sundance which resulted in the film being acquired and distributed by A24. Now, Danny and Michael are back with Bring Her Back, a psychological horror movie that casts Sally Hawkins as a terrifying foster parent to newly orphaned kids and continues the directors' exploration of trauma and grief. Danny and Michael stopped by IGN to play some of their favorite games - Postal 2, Limbo, and Fuzion Frenzy - and tell us about their improbable road to success. The Philippous also make a disgusting bet, reminisce about brawling on IGN's stage at San Diego Comic-Con in 2023 and mourn having to drop out of directing the upcoming Street Fighter film adaptation in order to make Bring Her Back.",

With its regularly gorgeous and interesting map, robust drift handling, and a mostly licensed car list, it also reset my expectations of the scale that can be achieved by indies in the racing space. Unfortunately, while I had a good time cruising and drifting, the same can\u2019t be said about the unwelcome surprise events that render your drift cars out of their element, or the poorly optimised grip racing mode plagued with clumsy AI. Developer Gaming Factory has promised more modes and fixes over the remainder of 2025 and beyond, but it\u2019s a plan that overtly leaves JDM feeling like an unfinished project that\u2019s shipped without the early access caveat, if you catch my drift.\"",
