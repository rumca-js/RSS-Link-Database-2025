        "description": "In May 2025, two gifted children in China\u20149-year-old Go prodigy Zhu Hongxin and 16-year-old programming genius Yu Xingjian\u2014ended their own lives. Both were pushed beyond their limits by abusive, perfection-obsessed parents.\n\nThis video investigates the dark world of \u201ctiger parenting\u201d in China, where violence, humiliation, and relentless pressure are normalized in the name of success. Through firsthand accounts, tournament footage, and legal analysis, we expose how a culture of control is destroying the very children it claims to nurture.\n\n\ud83d\udd0d Why did no one intervene?\n\ud83e\udde0 What is the line between discipline and abuse?\n\u2696\ufe0f And how is China\u2019s education system enabling this tragedy?\n\nThese are not isolated cases. This is a system.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 If this story moved you, please like, share, and comment below.\nHave you experienced or witnessed toxic parenting in your own life? We want to hear from you.\n\n#TigerMoms #WolfDads #ChinaEducation #ChildProdigies #ZhuHongxin #YuXingjian #MentalHealth #StopChildAbu",
