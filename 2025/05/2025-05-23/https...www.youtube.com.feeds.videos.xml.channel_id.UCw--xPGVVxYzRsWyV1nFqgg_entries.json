        "description": "After years of building momentum, The Wheel of Time has officially been canceled at Amazon Prime Video. In this episode, I break down what led to the decision, what we know about the behind-the-scenes factors, and what this means for the future of the franchise\u2014and the streaming fantasy landscape overall.\n\nIs this the end for The Wheel of Time on screen?
