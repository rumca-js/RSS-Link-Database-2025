The M.2 2280 SSD is connected via four PCIe 5.0 channels and comes in 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro model is equipped with the Silicon Motions SM2508 SSD controller, which Biwin provides with a DRAM cache to buffer write access. The cache is 1 GB per 1 TB of storage capacity. This means the 2TB and 4TB versions of the X570 Pro can reach sequential write speeds of up to 13,000 MB/s, whereas the 1TB version (with only 1GB cache) doesn\u2019t exceed 12,000 MB/s. Biwin claims that its new SSD can achieve up to 1.6 million input and output commands per second ",
