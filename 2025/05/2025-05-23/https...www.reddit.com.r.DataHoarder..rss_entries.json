I have always had a backup and redundant backup drive done on external drives but my data is growing larger as my career progresses. Buying larger drives 10tb and up is seeming a bit silly and I wanted to look into getting Sata drives with an external thunderbolt enclosure instead. This is all new to me though.</p> <p>My questions are first off, is this a good idea? I&#39;m just looking for as reliable of a backup as I can get with the ability to expand as my back history grows larger. </p> <p>And second, I&#39;m trying to understand external enclosures a bit more. I was looking at the OWC ThunderBay 4. Would I be able to have the main and redundant backup both in this enclosure, or is this only for raid situations? It&#39;d be convenient to have them in the same footprint.</p> <p>I read some talk about setting up a NAS in a video editing subreddit but I don&#39;t know anything about that. From what I gather",

Mind you they wanted 50eur for 32gb... Anyway, I got the DVD&#39;s back and it doesn&#39;t seem as &quot;easy&quot; for me. When I load the DVD into my laptop it shows as a video_ts I believe? just one file, however, when I double click it it doesn&#39;t play it will only play if I open VLC and open it from a disc and it plays (it plays fine in a normal DVD player) if I check the properties of this video_ts file I think it says either .mfd or .mdf I think it&#39;s .mfd though. How would I go about copying this file to a USB without losing any data on the DVD itself? The last thing I want to do is ruin the DVD as they were not exactly cheap to have changed over to from VHS to dvd. I&#39;m pretty tech savvy but in this area I lack knowledge. </p> </di",

It currently consists of a Dell R730XD with 2x 2667v4, 224GB RAM, Tesla P4 and 12x 12TB SAS drives as well as a 25x 2 5&quot; bay EMC DAS. I run UnRAID.</p> <p>So I want to replace the R730XD with something smaller and low profile, like one of those Mini PCs. The problem with those many PCs is you can&#39;t exactly add a HBA and NIC. So I was thinking about the 2018 Mac mini with the i7 8700B as it has 4x Thunderbolt 3 ports, so I could connect a SAS HBA to one and a 10gbe NIC to the other. That CPU should be able to handle everything I run with relative ease and 64GB is enough tbh, 224GB is overkill for me. In the meantime the HDD would go in a SAS DAS, until I decide on a thunderbolt enclosure or I may just migrate to SSDs only.</p> <p>I don&#39;t run any VMs, just docker with Plex, all the arrs, qbitorrent and nextcloud.</p> <p>I did a rough estimate and just sw",
