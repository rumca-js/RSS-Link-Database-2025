I know a fair bit about post stonewall NYC but I\u2019m researching for a work of mine that\u2019s set pre-stonewall. I\u2019m also looking for stuff that centres more around POC members of the LGBTQ of the time as my WIP includes characters of various races (although there are a few white character so it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be POC centred).</p> <p>I\u2019m also just looking for books about life during this time, not necessarily limited to queer experience, although it is my focus. If you have any on Gender non conforming folks that\u2019d also be a huge help.</p> <p>Can be about queer history, biographies etc. I\u2019d prefer books written by queer authors, but that\u2019s not a hard limit - if the author(s) is/are not queer or it\u2019s not known, but the book is good, I\u2019m very okay with that. </p> ",

A man and a woman are having some goofy, fun, innocent moments together, and it&#39;s totally platonic. Then the man is so overwhelmed by emotions that he blurts out &quot; I love you&quot; to the woman. showing his true feelings that he&#39;s had for a long time.</p> <p>The woman is shocked because she also loves him, but was pretty sure he did not feel the same.</p> <p>But there is a catch! They are both very moral and loyal people and are both in committed relationships. So it creates this bittersweet feeling in that moment that I really would like to explore.</p> <p>Do you know of any books with similar themes?</p> <p>Bonus points if it does not have a happy ending, or they get together at the very end.</p> <p>Any suggestion is welcome, book, short story, or fanfiction. Even movie or TV shows would be cool.</p> <p>Oh, and",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>She wrote a 1995 bestseller called &quot;Guilty By Association&quot; and followed it up with 3-4 more bestsellers in the late 90&#39;s and early 00&#39;s. Then she went quiet for about 10 years and re-emerged with two more books which, surprisingly, seem to have been self-published. And she might have written them late in life, in her 70&#39;s.</p> <p>I can find an obituary for her, stating she died in 2021 (one source says aged 82 but this is not confirmed). I cannot find a date of birth. A birth name is indicated to be Suzannah Sloan. It says her agent was Esther Newberg, a very big literary agent.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to learn more about her - her actual age (as curious how old she was when her debut novel was published), and why she chose to take a break from writing, then self-publish. Maybe it was because her former publisher, Warner Books, was no longer around - but was she still repped by Esther Newberg? What led her to self-publishing?</p> <p>",
