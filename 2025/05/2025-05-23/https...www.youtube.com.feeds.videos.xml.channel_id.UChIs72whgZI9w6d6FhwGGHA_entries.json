        "description": "Sponsor: Antec Flux Pro case on Amazon https://geni.us/CaPv\nA bold new case design features a crossflow fan plus two axial fans at the front, potentially improving the flow into the GPU and CPU cooler by evening out air distribution. We're not sure how well it'll work yet and TRYX hasn't yet tested it in A/B analysis, but we're excited about the possibilities based upon our prior testing of crossflow fans in the Meshless AIO case review that we did last year. TRYX also has an update to its Panorama cooler and LUCA L70 case, plus a new Arcvision case and Turris air cooler.\n\nLearn more about how Crossflow or Transverse fans work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CWqCRFroZ0\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
