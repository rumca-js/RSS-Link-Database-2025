        "description": "Samsung\u2019s Galaxy A26 packs a few upgrades over its predecessor, the Galaxy A25. There\u2019s an IP67-rated design which appears slightly different and it offers a bigger display, which also means that the phone has grown larger in size. The chipset too is an upgrade, but again a minor one over the Galaxy A25. Things look fine on paper, but it all falls apart when it comes to execution.",
