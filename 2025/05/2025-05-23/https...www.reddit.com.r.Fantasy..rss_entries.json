That time was 1897 where Bram Stoker was already jumping on a very popular literary trend that most people had forgotten had been going on for decades by that point. Varney the Vampire for example was published a good fifty years (!!) earlier in a penny dreadful and people still read it.</p> <p>Vampires are not going anywhere and probably never will.

I&#39;ve been recommending it a lot around here, and trying to figure out why I&#39;m the only one who does.</p> <p>I guess the main character has a stupid name - that probably doesn&#39;t help. The name of the first book is a little silly... what is stopping everyone from reccing this series?</p> <p>I will admit the series suffers from some of the same things the Dresden Files does - some light misogyny. But the character starts out as a 14 year old kid who grew up rough, and by the end of the series he grows a lot as a person. I feel like it is as good as The Dresden Files, but nowhere close to as popular. What do others think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",
