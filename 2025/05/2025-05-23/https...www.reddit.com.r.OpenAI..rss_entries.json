Two of them are in IT and one was a marketeer. I was discussing about how I was impressed with o4-mini and all three of them disagreed. As I discussed what I liked about it it suddenly occured to me that they weren&#39;t talking about the same model, so I asked if they had a subscription, and none of them did, in other words they thought I meant ChatGPT 4o that they where using. </p> <p>If three random people that work at an IT company don&#39;t even know you have new models because of your weird naming conventions then how is the average consumer ever going to figure this out? I know you may not want to go to Chatgpt5 yet but then at least use some kind of tagline that is easy to distinguish like maybe animals",
