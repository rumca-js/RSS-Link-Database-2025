Basically, it&#39;s a medieval fantasy romance which we&#39;re introduced to as a revenge quest in which one of the cursed lovers seeks vengeance against the bishop who cursed them. It stars Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer as the lovers and Matthew Broderick as the POV character that ushers us from the normal world of a medieval prison escape to the magical curse. Also, Leo McKern and John Wood. Plus a small role for Alfred Molina.</p> <p>Ladyhawke is somewhat notorious for its &quot;synthrock score&quot; but honestly you barely notice it.
