But heavier games seem a bit out of my league when it comes to teaching. Plus, since they\u2019re usually more expensive, it doesn\u2019t feel worth it to buy them without being sure. And since I live in a small town, unfortunately I don\u2019t have easy access to a local store to rent games or try them with a more experienced group.</p> <p>So, what have your experiences been like?

Now I&#39;m trying to figure out how to get everything back in the box. The garage already was pretty full. I added the cardboard damage markers (don&#39;t think the wooden ones will fit). I just laid player boards &amp; other large pieces and powerups on top of everything inside the box, but nothing is really preventing them rattling around inside. Again, I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to get the deluxe wooden bits to fit in the box.</p> <p>Couldn&#39;t find a reboxing video, if those even exist. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Trollz812\"> /u/Trollz812 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kt6oru/any_suggestions_on_how_to_repack_joyride_turbo/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kt6oru/any_suggestions_on_how_to_repack_joyride_tu",
