I layered in journal prompts, brat reset spells (for when my inner gremlin is spiraling), and sacred language that doesn\u2019t shame survival responses.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s live on Ko-fi with free mini ritual to start and $5 offerings for others like me\u2014queer folks, neurodivergents, doms &amp; subs in healing dynamics, and anyone who\u2019s tired of pretending to be okay.</p> <p>If you\u2019re curious, the page is here: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/themoanwitch\">https://ko-fi.com/themoanwitch</a></p> <p>I\u2019m open to feedback, collaborations, or just nerding out over sacred design and storytelling.

It posts consistently in your tone \u2014 trained through:</p> <p>-Your past tweets -A specific topic like AI or startups -Or by mimicking accounts like Elon, Naval, etc.</p> <p>It watches trends from selected accounts and posts like you \u2014 so you can grow while you sleep.</p> <p>Why I think it could help: -Posting consistently is hard -Audience growth takes time -Some people want to experiment with different styles without burning out</p> <p>I\u2019d love your feedback on a few things: -Would you use something like this? -What would make it valuable (or pointless) to you? -How much would you pay for it? -What would you expect from a solid MVP?</p> <p>Nothing is built yet \u2014 just validating the idea.
