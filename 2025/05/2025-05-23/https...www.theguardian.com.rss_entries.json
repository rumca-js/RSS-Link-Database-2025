Wellsbourne GP practice in Whitehawk, East Brighton, has just been told it is losing its contract. NHS Sussex, the local integrated care board (ICB), is provisionally handing it over to a distant Leeds-based company whose main business is in owning and managing healthcare properties. This is a story about how parts of the NHS can slip away<strong> </strong>to profit-makers, despite the government\u2019s aim to put community first. The company, One Medical Group, won the bid by undercutting on price and proposing to add a walk-in centre. It\u2019s not a lone case: some other ICBs erroneously put good NHS community services out for tender, and feel obliged to take the lowest bid.</p><p>To give you a rough portrait, in 2019 Whitehawk was ranked within the top 10% of England\u2019s most deprived areas, and the most deprived in Brighton. <",

The crew watched as the animals \u2013 the last survivors of a weeks-long voyage from Saskatchewan, Canada \u2013 skittered out of their crates and up into the dense, lonely, rainforest.</p><p>The moose had arrived on a flight of fancy, as part of the then premier\u2019s grand vision to turn Fiordland national park into a hunters\u2019 paradise. It was the second attempt to release moose into the region \u2013 in a country whose only native land-based mammals are bats \u2013 after nearly all of an earlier herd died crossing the seas. Red deer and wapiti, or elk, were also released around the same time for game-hunting.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/23/new-zealand-moose-mystery-fiordland-national-park\"",
