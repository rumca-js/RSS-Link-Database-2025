When Amanda was 8 years old, she had the chance to meet the creators of Phineas & Ferb, Dan and Swampy, thanks to Make-A-Wish and Disney. Now, years later, Amanda gets to reunite with them for Disney's Week of Wishes.\n\nDisney is proud to be the world\u2019s largest wish granter for Make-A-Wish\u00ae. A Disney wish is granted every hour of every day \u2013 and we are honored that wish kids choose Disney for their most heartfelt wish. Nearly 45 years ago, the first official wish was granted at Disneyland. Since then, Disney has worked with Make-A-Wish\u00ae to grant wishes and create happiness and joy for kids and families when it\u2019s needed most, in ways that only Disney can.\n\nTo learn how you can become a WishMaker for Make-A-Wish, visit wish.org/Disney\n\nSUBSCRIBE to get notified when new Disney videos are posted: http://di.sn/Subscribe\n\nGet even more from Disney!\nInstagram: http://Instagram.com/Disney\nTwitter: http://Twitter.",
