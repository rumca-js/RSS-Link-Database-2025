        "description": "Ellen Park is known for making viral videos with her grandmother. Today, she\u2019s bringing her mom into the fold for a special multi-generational Korean cooking challenge. Will mom\u2019s kimchi stew beat out grandma\u2019s mung bean pancakes? \n \nFood connects us all: bridging generations, cultures, and traditions. But as each generation changes, so do our recipes. \"Grandma Versus\" is a cooking competition where grandmothers face off against family members in a recipe swap challenge. What do we learn about our past and our future when we cook together? That\u2019s exactly what creators & foodies Lorena Abreu, Emmanuel Duverneau, and Ellen Park are going to find out.\n \nWatch more No Taste Like Home with Antoni Porowski here on Disney+: https://on.natgeo.com/3RysXU6\n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: http://natgeo.com/ytngmagazine\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/NatGeoSubscribe\n\nAnd check out more National Geographic series and specials here:\n\u27a1 Disney Plus: https://on.natgeo.com/3q6on",
