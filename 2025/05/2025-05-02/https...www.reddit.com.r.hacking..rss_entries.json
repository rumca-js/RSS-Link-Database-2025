I have some things that I would give out to kids, wait a second and let me find them&quot;, and she rummaged around and pulled out a link zone 2 thing.</p> <p>Now, I&#39;m not familiar with this kinda stuff, but I figured I would try to set it up - and after about an hour of being confused by the network names not matching, I did!</p> <p>Only problem is, this thing is programmed for &#39;educational resources only&#39; in accordance with &quot;CIPA&quot;.
