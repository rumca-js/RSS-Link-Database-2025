For a long time I have been a huge fan of well written narrative and fantasy worlds, but for the most part only consumed them through video games, anime, manga, shows and movies, letting to an incredible curiosity on books, as I was more of a reader during my childhood and early teen years. After hearing some recommendations on the internet I got interested on Sanderson&#39;s as an entry point to the genre and recently finished the first mistborn book, currently on the second book tho this one doesn&#39;t have me as engaged as the first one, I want some recommendations from you guys with your personal experience and what would be a good series or stand alone to get into while I mix it with mistborne so I don&#39;t get burned on.

Obviously fantasy is my favorite genre but I thought since there is so much out there I&#39;ll ask online for recommendations for my more niche interests. I am a huge fan of sea monsters (any form of kraken, squid or octopus especially) and am looking for books where they either play like a big role or are central to the plot. Even books where there are cool parts featuring them are fine. Honestly my rule of thumb is, if its big and underwater I will probably like it. Aside from that I am not thaz picky, I also really enjoy horror and plenty of books as long as they are well written.
