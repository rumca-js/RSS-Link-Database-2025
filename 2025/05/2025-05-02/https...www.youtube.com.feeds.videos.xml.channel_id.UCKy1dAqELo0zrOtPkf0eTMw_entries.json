Fans are likely pretty disappointed in the news, but it's not entirely unexpected as they haven't shown anything of the game since its first trailer in 2023. But you know who's probably more disappointed? Take-Two Interactive stockholders. The company, who owns GTA developer Rockstar Games, took a hit in its share price after the announcement, but they're looking to bounce back with other game releases this year, including Borderlands 4. In other news, Hollow Knight: Silksong fans are a little confused at some official art from the game that appears to feature protagonist Hornet...undressing? And finally, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is such a hit that even French President Emmanuel Macron has heard about it.",

Not only are we getting two new Predator films from Prey director Dan Trachtenberg with the live-action Predator: Badlands and the animated Hulu offering Predator: Killer of Killers, but we\u2019re also set to receive another major entry in the Alien universe from Fargo and Legion showrunner Noah Hawley with the FX show Alien: Earth. Although these projects are not officially connected yet, fans know that Alien and Predator have a long history as part of a shared universe, with the two iconic monsters crossing paths in numerous films, comic books, and video games.\nExamining the latest promotional materials for Predator: Badlands and Alien: Earth may provide clues that Disney is laying the groundwork for a new crossover between Alien and Predator. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the developments in these franchises and why we might see AVP return to the big screen sooner rather than later.",

Yasuke is the first historical figure Ubisoft made a playable character, as opposed to creating their very own. We ask Tongayi how it feels to hold such a title in the series as it pertains to #AssassinsCreedShadows. MASUMI also has an interesting path as to how she attained the role of Naoe in #AssassinsCreed Shadows, which is explored at length.",

But this is good news! Bethesda Game Studios\u2019 last original open-world RPG outing was Starfield, which was certainly ambitious, but didn\u2019t quite have players over the moon with joy. Before that was Fallout 76, which has since sorted itself out, but only after a very rough launch. The Elder Scrolls VI is still years away, and Fallout 5 even further out than that, so perhaps more remakes like Oblivion are the answer to stoke the fires of Bethesda fandom, and help build anticipation for the next installments in these storied series.

Although many prevailed in securing a Switch 2 preorder, it wasn't easy; why hasn't the games industry learned from this? Why aren't retailers like Best Buy and Walmart better prepared for big consumer-focused moments? Should console manufacturers just bypass third-party retailers and sell directly to consumers?
