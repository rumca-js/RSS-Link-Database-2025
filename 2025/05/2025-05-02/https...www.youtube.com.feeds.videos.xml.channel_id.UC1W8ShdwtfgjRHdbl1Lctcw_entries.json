        "description": "I used a new colorization technique, fully restored and created immersive sound design for this rare footage of Victorian England 1900-1901. This new version brings to life powerful scenes from industrial towns in Northern England, including Pendlebury, known for its coal mining heritage; Oldham and Rochdale, once major hubs of textile production; Rotherham, home to a booming steel industry; Manchester, the beating heart of the Industrial Revolution; and Hull, a key port and center for heavy engineering. Through these glimpses of workers leaving mills, collieries, and factories, we rediscover the daily lives of men, women, and children at the dawn of the 20th century\n00:00 - 00:14 Presentation - Old and New Version\n00:14 - 01:15  Miners Leaving Pendlebury Colliery (1901)\n01:15 - 02:40  Workforce Leaving Alfred Butterworth and Sons, Glebe Mills, Hollinwood (1901)\n02:40 - 05:21  Workforce of Parkgate Iron and Steel Co, Rotherham (1901)\n05:21 - 7:17  Co-operative Wholesale Clothing Facto",
