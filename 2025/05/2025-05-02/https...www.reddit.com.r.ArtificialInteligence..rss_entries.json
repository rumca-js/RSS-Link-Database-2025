OpenAI called it a technical error (overfitting on positive feedback) and fixed it.</p> <p>I accept the technical explanation, but I can&#39;t help but see a disturbing parallel with the current socio-political climate, especially in the US. Powerful figures increasingly seem to cultivate environments where criticism is unwelcome and flattery is rewarded (think about certain dynamics around figures like Trump, Musk, RFK Jr, etc.). This mindset then seems to spread.</p> <p>It makes me wonder: Is this AI &#39;bug&#39; - optimized to please at all costs (perhaps out of an algorithmic &#39;fear&#39; of negative feedback) - a kind of unintentional reflection of this cultural trend? A system learning that unquestioning approval is &#39;safer&#39; than uncomfortable truth?</p> <p>I&#39;m not suggesting political intent b",
