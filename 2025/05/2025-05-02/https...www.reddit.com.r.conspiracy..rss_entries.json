I was recently trying to find articles that addressed the theory and literally couldn&#39;t find anything. I personally believe that HIV was created in a lab by government scientists and introduced to the homosexual community as a means to wipe them out (intravenous drug users as well).

Once they were satisfied with the number of deaths, they introduced the medication that keeps the virus at bay. Ironically enough, not a full on cure but drugs that you&#39;ll have to take for the rest of your life, sustaining revenue for big pharma.
