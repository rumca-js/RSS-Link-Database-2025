Like does anyone have a separate person read their book with a fine tooth comb and offer real criticism? To be fair the issues I had with this book are the same I have with Steven (sp?) King.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just finished A Fine Balance and the way the novel ended got me all kinds of sad. I grew up in India and whatever despair and atrocities are described in the book until the last chapter were digestible and I knew these things happened. A ton of movies show the injustice. But the last chapter, things went downhill so quick. Om and Ishvar\u2019s lives literally ruined for no fricking reason. From poor tailors to beggars just because someone took decisions on their behalf. Maneck\u2019s turmoil and decision to end his life made me realize things just break people quite easily. Dina\u2019s back to her old house and her independence is gone and her happiness is more or less gone.</p> <p>Anyway, great book but didn\u2019t expect the ending to be filled with this much sadness. Things do end badly, as they say. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/currentlyreadingit\"> /u/currentlyreadingit </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.r",

Although, reading this allowed me sight through the lens of someone struggling with the emotional and physical roller coaster of menopause, the emotional turmoil following the past, present, and future as well as the struggles of managing a changing body. This is undeniably a tough pill to swallow I&#39;m closer in age to Willa though, and 1 <em>really</em> disliked her character. She&#39;s immature, pushy, rude, whiney, and so self-righteous. She was pretty much the opposite of how Rocky describes her. It makes sense that she&#39;s portrayed as a warm and golden character in the eyes of her mom. There&#39;s no love like a mother&#39;s. That alone makes me think Willa&#39;s awfulness was intentional, to drive that message home. Still, there&#39;s a clear difference between child-like and childish. Willa is insufferably childish</p> <p>Idk. I mean I listened to this audiobook while ",
