Traditionally extracted alongside fossil fuels, helium is in global shortage and poses environmental concerns when sourced conventionally. Scientists have identified geothermal conditions and ancient uranium-rich rocks in Yellowstone that could offer a cleaner helium alternative. These findings may point the way toward a more sustainable future for high-tech industries increasingly reliant on this non-renewable resource.",
