Now it can&#39;t connect to the internet at all or SSH, so I can&#39;t use portainer either. Is there any way I can fix this by deleting the stack I created without deleting my other containers?

I recently learned about dev containers in VS Code where Microsoft has some dev containers with common utils installed. For example, base Debian bookworm image plus curl, tree, openssh-client, etc. installed. My understanding is that this is just to make the development experience inside this container much simpler given that in every new project using dev containers, you don\u2019t need to install curl or git or whatever all over again. </p> <p>However, in production you may not need all of that bloat. But you may need some. So in my Dockerfile for my project (NOT the dev container), how do I know which common utils which were installed as part of the dev container image are necessary for my project to run, and which common utils are not necessary and I can get rid of?</p> <p>My extreme solution is to just use a dev container with no common utils. Just base OS and install (and document) everything manually, one at a time, ",
