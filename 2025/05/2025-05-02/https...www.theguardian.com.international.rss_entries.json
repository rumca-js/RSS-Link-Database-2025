If you haven\u2019t seen Scam Interceptors, it\u2019s a very entertaining factual series in which Nick and his team of ethical hackers attempt to disrupt scamming attacks on the public as they happen.

She was born in Incheon, South Korea, to a conservative family and earmarked for a teacher\u2019s life, but her teenage dream was to become a drummer. At 19, as the only woman in a not-overly respectful percussion class, she got wind of the Amsterdam Conservatorium\u2019s jazz course, moved to Europe and met her band of skilful soulmates. Her evolving music leans towards a European chamber-jazzy sound with occasional American hints of Wayne Shorter, Paul Motian, or Ambrose Akinmusire. The Dutch jazz scene has feted her: the latest of its accolades, the Paul Acket award for an \u201cextraordinary contribution to jazz\u201d, will be presented to Hong at the big-time North Sea jazz festival this July.</p><p>This album continues her ",
