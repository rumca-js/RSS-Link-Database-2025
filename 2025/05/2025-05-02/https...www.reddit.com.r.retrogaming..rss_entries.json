However, I&#39;ve always been financially poor and only had consoles randomly after my mom died when I was 6. The Atari was financed with a local furniture store and after mom died, my grandmother took over. She couldn&#39;t afford the payments at the furniture store on a fixed income and all of the &quot;new age&quot; stuff was repossessed. However, she paid off most of the account with mom&#39;s life insurance payout after paying for the funeral. She got the gigantic floor TV, huge stereo, the furniture and the cooking set. She let them keep the VCR &amp; the Atari. She ALSO couldn&#39;t afford cable, so we basically watched our reflections on a blank TV screen, which begins my struggles with poverty lol.</p> <p>I was given an Atari 2600 in its original case full of games when I was around 10/11 by my adult cousin.

I remember in the 90s after Mortal Kombat was released, a ton of fighting games came out trying to replicate it&#39;s success. Many of them were cheap and ridiculous knock offs. But sometimes a &quot;clone&quot; turns out to be as good or better than the game it tries to imitate. Which game do you think that is?</p> <p>I think Crystalis, which is seen as a Zelda &quot;clone&quot; or knock off I think is as good as Zelda. It&#39;s not better than Zelda but definitely as good as the original Zelda.</p> <p>I think maybe Killer Instinct is another one that was seen as a &quot;clone&quot; of Mortal Kombat that I think is just as good if not better than the first Mortal Kombat but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s better than subsequent ones.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",

Not Toys R Us, not KB, nothing like that, and I wish I could remember the name of the place. It was a fantastic toy store all around, but the video game section had a special feature that made this store a twenty-five outta ten. They had a station at the video game counter, which was a very impressive section of the store, and you could select from a shit ton of different Nintendo games and play whatever you wanted. Not just a sample level or anything either, if I went there on a Saturday morning when they opened, I could play a game all the way through. It made buying games as a poor kid much more a value proposition, getting to really get a taste of the product! Simpler times, better times. Anyone experience anything like this? It would&#39;ve been late 80s or early 90s, I&#39;m an old fucker now so I don&#39;t exactly have the timeframe precise in ",

I actually prefer the more agile movement of the character in the \u201cboost Sonic\u201d era where he got a dedicated boost button/mechanic, like Sonic Rush, and even a homing attack. You\u2019re still rewarded for running but you can get back into the thick of things faster, and the punishment for slowing down is less frustrating. I think it\u2019s a natural evolution of the gameplay but I feel like I\u2019m taking crazy pills because the overwhelming consensus is that the classic games are much better and that Sonic lost his way when he deviated from that.
