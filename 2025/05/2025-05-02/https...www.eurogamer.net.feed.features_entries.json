This year, the long-awaited sequel has finally launched in early access on PC. While Wreckfest 2 is still very much a work in progress, it already makes a strong case for itself, not just as a worthy follow-up, but as a showcase for some of the most advanced real-time physics we've seen in the genre. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-wreckfest-2-a-superb-overhaul-of-a-boundary-pushing-game\">Read more</a></p>",

She'd never heard of the franchise before, nor Ubisoft - the company that was now keen to secure her services. And so when another email arrived, asking for a second time if she would like to lend her expertise to Shadows' development, Schmidt-Hori deleted the request once more, continuing to believe it was spam. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/working-in-the-shadows-how-an-assassins-creed-researcher-braved-the-backlash\">Read more</a></p>",
