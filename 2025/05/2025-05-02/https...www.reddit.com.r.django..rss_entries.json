Anyway but I was recommended to store the courses in a database instead, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do.<br/> in Django I created a model for the courses, and I connected it to react and it worked just fine, but for some of the details of the course they&#39;re written as a list, I tried to store them in the database with /n/ but it didn&#39;t work. also some paragraphs I needed to separate them or style them, it&#39;s difficult now that&#39;s it&#39;s all stored as one paragraph in DB. Any advice on how should I store them? or any advice on this matter would be much appreciated.</p> <p>Now for the database at first ",
