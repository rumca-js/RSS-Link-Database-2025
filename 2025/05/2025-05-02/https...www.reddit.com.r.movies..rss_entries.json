A man (Judge Claude Frollo) chases down a young mother, kills her, prepares to drown her deformed baby (Quasimodo), is stopped from plunging the child into a watery grave and then saddled with caring for the infant. Instead of receiving affection, the child is manipulated into thinking they&#39;re a monster who will never be loved or accepted. On top of this, the man is actively pursuing an obsession to eradicate an entire ethnic group (Gypsies) while lusting after a woman (Esmeralda) who is one of those people.</p> <p>If that in no way sounds like it could be an animated children&#39;s film, much less a Disney movie, that is where you are mistaken and this is precisely why The Hunchback of Notre Dame is the most beautifully grim and special piece of work that the studio has ever produced.

I don&#39;t think there&#39;s one of his movies I don&#39;t enjoy on some level. I believe we will never see anyone like him again in our lifetime. What&#39;s your favorite Arnold movie or your favorite line from him. For me, it has to be T2, but the quote is, &quot;Remember, Sully, when I promised to kill you last? I lied.
