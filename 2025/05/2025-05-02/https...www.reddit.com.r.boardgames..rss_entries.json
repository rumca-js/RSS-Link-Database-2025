At the moment it kinda sucks because I tag each player with their role and so if there\u2019s four good guys and two bad, and bad win, minion of Mordred is logged as 1/1, and loyal servant of Arthur is 0/3 (other two are Merlin and assassin (and I know assassin could probably be lumped but whatever)). As you can see it kinda makes the winrate wonky because more people win or lose at the same time. </p> <p>Anyway that got me thinking, if you always play six players with four good and two bad, what would you consider balanced win rates by team? Would it be good winning fifty percent of the time and bad winning fifty percent of the time. Or would it be good winning four out of six times and bad winning two out of six times? </p> <p>Probability wise there\u2019s a higher chance you will be good, but if you win more as a bad player and less as good, your winrate will be less than fifty per",

I have been on a recent tear of playing Catan and Wingspan again, and it is proving my love for engine building! These are about the heaviest of complexity that i have played. Part of me thinks my final stepping stone from the little research I have done is to play Everdell, then jump into Terraforming Mars.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Wizard is one of my favorite trick takers. I recently ordered Omnibus Wizard which adds some twists. But, looking through the rules of Skull King, which I bought recently, it almost seems too chaotic as there is no true trump suite. There is a trump suit in the game, but its really the low level tier of trump. Trumps can be defeated by pirates, pirates by the Skull King, and the Skull King by Mermaids, which are themselves defeatable by pirates. So every card is defeatable, meaning you have no sure bets in your hand like you do in Wizard. If i have two Wizards in my hand in Wizard and a high suit, like a 12 or 13, or a high-ish trump, I know for a fact that I can win at LEAST 2 and probably 3. In Skull King, a 14 Jolly Roger (The trump suite) means what? A pirate is most likely able to be defeated in the mid and later rounds. How do you know when to play what???!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lu",

I&#39;m doing a research paper on board games for school and I am laying out broad catagories in the tabletop world. </p> <p>I typically break gaming in to RPG (pen paper/dnd) CCG/TCG (Mtg, poke,F&amp;B) Miniature (40k) Board Game(idk what to put here)</p> <p>I think those are the big divisions when I think of gaming as I don&#39;t really do rpgs/tcgs/minis. I just &quot;board game&quot; as my tabletop hobby. But how do I describe a &quot;board game&quot; as opposed to the other catagories? I get there&#39;s also card gaming (pinnacle/spades/hearts/president) or maybe like casino gaming but how do I explain the &quot;board game&quot; catagory that encompasses most gaming I feel?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrJoFo\"> /u/MrJoFo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kcqgs3/board_game_types/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
