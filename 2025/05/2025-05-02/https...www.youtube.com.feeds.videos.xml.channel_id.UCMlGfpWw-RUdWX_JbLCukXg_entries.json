However, with the rapid evolution of C++ and the AGAS programming model in HPX, the development landscape continues to shift to a better future. Chplx aims to bridge this gap by offering a seamless integration between Chapel and C++, providing a fully customizable and CMake-compatible solution that enhances flexibility in modern parallel computing environments.\n\n---\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nShreyas Atre\n\nI am Shreyas, a masters in computer science student at Louisiana State University. I work with Hartmut Kaiser and the STE||AR Group. I was a summer intern at Cuda Core C++ Libraries ,NVidia. I love C++, parallelism, concurrency and in general low level systems programming.\n---\n\n\nCppCon is the annual, week-lon",
