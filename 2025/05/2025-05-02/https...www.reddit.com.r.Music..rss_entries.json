But I can&#39;t quite figure out <em>w</em>hy they\u2019re so amazing.

It\u2019s about the anti-competitive practices revealed after the Taylor Swift tickets scandal. </p> <p>Quick recap: A few years ago, LiveNation and Ticketmaster merged, with the condition of preserving the competition in the live events market (whatever that means, lol). </p> <p>However, in 2022, after its system crashed during Taylor Swift\u2019s ticket presale, the platform was accused of anti-competitive practices. When this news came out, the stock dropped, and investors filed a lawsuit against the company for this. </p> <p>The good news is that Live Nation finally decided to settle and pay $20M to investors for the damages. The court already approved the agreement.</p> <p>So if you got hit by this, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://11th.com/cases/lyv-investor-lawsuit\">worth checking </a>if you\u2019re eligible for payment. </p> <p>Anyways, has anyone here invested in $LYV back then?
