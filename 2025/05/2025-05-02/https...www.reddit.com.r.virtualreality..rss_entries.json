I have tried TrinusVR, but I cannot get it to work, because for some reason, at least some part of the screen is cut off. I tried to use spacedesk, and desktop sbs together, but that does not work. Please help. Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NMaster22\"> /u/NMaster22 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kcpex8/pc_games_in_vr/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1kcpex8/pc_games_in_vr/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I noticed it seems to disconnect everything that&#39;s connected via USB for a little bit before returning to normal. At first, it only did this every few minutes, but now I can&#39;t even go 10 seconds or so without it happening.</p> <p>The strangest thing is that I didn&#39;t used to have this problem before in the past my computer used to be able to run VR perfectly fine, but now it&#39;s completely unusable. Is there anyway to fix this, or do I need to cut my losses and save up for a new headset?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vulp",
