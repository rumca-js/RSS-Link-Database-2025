Fortunately, the <em>massive</em> Sims modding community is all the way out of control at this point, and so there are plenty of fan-made options for expanding The Sims 4 that you can very easily download for free. And with The Sims 4 apparently here to stay for the foreseeable future, it's a great time to dive into this awesome mess of mods.</p><p> With that being the case, finding the best Sims 4 mods amid an ever-expanding, endless sea of custom content is oftentimes daunting, especially as the life-simulation game's bustling community continues to grow steadily with each new expansion pack release and upd",

Potentially something <em>really</em> bad, like dying. Fortunately, meeting your sims' needs is not the most complex affair--our digital people aren't quite so complicated as real people are. Still, a little knowledge goes a long way, and you'll find more than a little knowledge below as we break down how needs work and how you can best address them, whether it be through activities your sim partakes in, or permanent lifetime rewards that allow you to ignore them entirely.
