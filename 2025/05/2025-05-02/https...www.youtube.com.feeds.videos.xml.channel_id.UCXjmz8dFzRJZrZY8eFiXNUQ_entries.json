        "description": "When Steve Rogers handed his iconic shield to Sam Wilson at the end of Avengers: Endgame, it sparked debate among Marvel fans \u2014 was this the right call? In the comics, Bucky Barnes, aka The Winter Soldier, actually took up the mantle of Captain America before Sam ever did.   Now that we're 6 years removed from End Game and Sam Wilson's first Captain America movie has been released, should Bucky have become the next Captain America?  \n\nJoin us as we break down the legacy of the shield and whether Sam or Bucky was the true heir to Captain America.\n\n#captainamerica #thewintersoldier #buckybarnes #steverogers",
