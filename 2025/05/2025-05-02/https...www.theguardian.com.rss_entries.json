But the series soon transcends its ostensible subject matter and becomes an exploration of some of the people who have devoted their lives to the celebration, study and preservation of these charismatic creatures. These include environmentalists, scientists ... and 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan, who is charmingly and volubly obsessed with them. <em><br>\n  Prime Video, from Thursday 8 May",
