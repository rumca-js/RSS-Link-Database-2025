It\u2019s admittedly an entry-level RTX option in today\u2019s gaming landscape and you won\u2019t be able to crank your settings to the max, but you should be able to play modern 3D titles on medium (or better with games that support DLSS 3). Frankly, if you can do without cutting-edge visuals, then you\u2019re good to go here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equipped with a 13th-gen Intel Core i5-13420H processor and 8GB of DDR5 RAM, this laptop is decent enough to handle your daily workload, but you will notice ",
