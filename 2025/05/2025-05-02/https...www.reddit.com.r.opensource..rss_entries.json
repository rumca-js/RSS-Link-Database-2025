        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A while ago I started a 501c3 non profit incorporated as a non profit in Washington State. My health is in decline and we were looking for a new leader anyway, but I am stepping back from all commitments to focus on my health, my wife, and taking care of some practical matters around the house. We are also looking for funding - there&#39;s about $1000 a year in overhead to stay incorporated and such that needs to be covered. I had been sponsoring that myself the few years. The CEO ideally could take care of it or otherwise seek out grants/funding as part of their job description.</p> <p><a href=\"https://DigitalDefiance.org\">https://DigitalDefiance.org</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Game_Genie\"> /u/The_Game_Genie </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1kcprgg/looking_for_new_ceo_for_non_profit_open_source/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.",
