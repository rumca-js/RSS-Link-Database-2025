Now the game get stuck on &quot;launching&quot; in Steam and does absolutely nothing, not even start the executable. I also tried switching from Proton 9.0-4 to GE-Proton9-27 which didn&#39;t affect the problem at all.

In the meantime I was able to play CS2 without 1 issue at all, but RL still won&#39;t start ",

I have both available and was wondering which card is supported better under Linux. I heard that amd cards have better support, however I did notice that the RX 480 had some micro stuttering issues in GTA 5, while the gtx 1080 did not have that issue however it stayed around 40-50fps which seems a bit low for the 1080. I do fully understand that my hardware is out of date and I am in no way looking to do hardcore gaming just a bit gta and maybe counter strike, dota etc..

So I tried installing the Windows 7/8 version of the launcher which still uses a regular .exe, but that one doesn&#39;t support Minecraft Legends.

I remember how much of a hassle it used to be when I was using linux when wine was at 6.0 branch, used to be the old days, took a lot of work and winetricks to setup some games.

I recently ran into a bug during a quest and I cannot proceed any further. I know I can just reload a save, but I thought just maybe I could try installing mods through Vortex. It doesn\u2019t seem to work. My game launches fine (a lot slower than normally) and it crashed after I tried to go outside. This makes sense because both MO2 and SteamTinkerLaunch tell you what games you can mod after you install them. Anyways, I\u2019m really interested to see if anyone has found a workaround so far.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Yarg119\"> /u/Yarg119 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1kcsk7w/has_anyone_tried_modding_oblivion_remastered/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1kcsk",

One for root, one for home, and one for my games. There will be a fourth partition for games that I need to run on Windows, so I want the freedom to resize and/or delete the partitions for my games as much as I want. Not sure if this setup could cause headaches though.</p> <p>After Windows 11 has been giving me more and more grief year over year, I&#39;ve decided to give Linux another chance, after trying a few years ago. With the massive progress that&#39;s been made with Proton since then, I&#39;m hoping I can (almost) entirely eliminate my need for Windows. I&#39;d say 90%+ of what I do on my PC is game.</p> <p>I hop into Linux machines from time-to-time for work, but I&#39;m not super familiar with it; especially in the context of a home PC where I want to keep tinkering and maintenance to an absolute minimum.</p> <p>Here&#39;s my plan and question:</p> ",
