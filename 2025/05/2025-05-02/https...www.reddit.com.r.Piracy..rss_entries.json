        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone. As I go through the megathread and find what I need without having to bother or pester anyone by asking repeatedly answered questions, I am finding mostly everything that I need. </p> <p>My one question is as follows? Can someone direct me to the correct thread that will help allow me to play online games, actually online in the actual developer servers? I may be missing the FAQ on how to or what but I have a few titles i want to try before I buy and i would love to make sure the gaming community for said titles are well supported!</p> <p>Thanks, and im so excited to get back into this community with my new PC build! I should have all my parts by next Friday, so I have a little time to read up. I&#39;m just sad my sites I used to support and heavily seed for are no longer a thing!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jhunter562\"> /u/jhunter562 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddi",

I know tariffs are a large part of this change, but I can\u2019t see them reverting it after everything is said and done (hopefully :/). Covid is a great example of this, once that hit the stores raised prices and decreased sizes on all items. But once it ended most of the prices/sizes stayed the same. They are forcing us to accept the new normal. $80 is now the new $60. I will NEVER pay 80$ for a standard AAA title.

The thing is, I like starting the game 30 mins after puck drop so that I can skip commercials, or sometimes I&#39;ll watch after the game has ended etc. Sites like onhockey or streameast only stream live. </p> <p>The issue is that NHL66 now has some fairly restrictive VPN requirements for most their stream, allowing only UK or Germany VPNs for most. With my free VPN, that&#39;s not possible. Does anyone know other sites that offer hockey streams with rewind capabilities?</p> <p>Ofc, I could get a paid VPN or even pay for NHL&#39;s streaming services, but would prefer not to if possible.
