We learn about particle counts, data recovery, moonshine, hot air stations, and spare parts for repair. Louis is likely best known for his efforts in the Right to Repair world, but also maintains a repair shop in Austin that previously was located in New York.\n\nCheck out Louis Rossmann's channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w @rossmanngroup \nFind his store here for hot air stations: https://store.rossmanngroup.com/soldering-diy.html\nWatch Louis' appearance in our tariffs video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W_mSOS1Qts\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
