I had tried therapy on multiple occasions from childhood to adulthood, I tried medication, and often times left feeling worse. Through the course of my treatment history, I collected over 5+ mental health diagnoses ranging from Social Anxiety, to Generalized Anxiety, to Major Depression, to PTSD, to ADHD. At the head of it all, I got kicked out of university after failing for three years straight with a GPA of 1.6, and I was playing video games for 16 hours per day to cope.</p> <p>To make a very long story very short, I recovered not through therapy, but through a mix of many self-help resources.

What\u2019s your take on how Spotify\u2019s model impacts emerging artists? Do you think it\u2019s sustainable for musicians creating niche, experimental music, or does it push them toward more commercial sounds? How do you support artists beyond streaming\u2014Bandcamp, merch, gigs? Curious to hear your thoughts and any experiences you\u2019ve had discovering artists like this!
