I tend to buy cables, dongles, and organizational bits infrequently. I wait until I need them, since I figure I can always buy them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that soon may not be the case, as a lot of such stuff comes from China. Even as <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2778369/u-s-reduces-china-tariffs-from-145-to-30-for-now.html\">tariff policies are changing</a>, shipments dropped pretty dramatically over the last month and a half. Plus, when availability goes down, prices go up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\u2019m biting the bullet and finally stocking up on a few small but key items\u2014the same things that many friends often grumble about not having on hand. Chances are, you\u2019ll want to grab some of these, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-product-chart pro",
