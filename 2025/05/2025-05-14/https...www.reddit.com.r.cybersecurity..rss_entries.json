The only piece of that tool we use the attack engagement. What we like about it- it does recon on the user&#39;s mailboxes and sends custom phishes to those users based off whats in the mailbox.

I had been doing THM rooms for the past year and was simply tracking all the different rooms in folders. However, there tends to be an overlap in not only rooms in THM rooms, but also cybersecurity concepts in general. An example is the OSI layer. I have seen this in literally every cert I have taken and want to avoid repeating information in notes.</p> <p>The idea I am thinking about implementing is utilizing the linking method more. For example, I would have note specifically for websites and then branch out to all the different areas of websites. I would then link notes as I gain more information regarding this topic. A slight concern I have about this though is not knowing where I referenced this information in case I want to revisit a certain area. I am not very experienced in Obsidian at all so I",
