I got a good headstrap so i dont mind the bulkyness too much. I also dont use the built in &quot;speakers&quot; I use my open back Sennheisers and I intend to keep doing that with any headset.</p> <p>Is it worth it to sell my used quest 2 and get a used PICO 4 for like 100E extra? Will I notice a difference? Are there any disadvatages? (I really dont care about exlusives unless its GTA6 or a rally sim lol) Btw I run the quest 2 exclusively with a cable through ALVR (no quest link app it disconnected every 10 seconds) can I do something similar with the PICO? I dont really take the quest 3 into consideration cause it costs 400E extra here and AFAIK its not 400E better for PCVR?</p> <",
