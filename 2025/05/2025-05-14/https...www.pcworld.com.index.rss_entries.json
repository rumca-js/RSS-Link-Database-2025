But it\u2019s pretty rare that it can actually damage your computer in a permanent sense \u2014 wipe the drive if you\u2019re okay with losing local data, and you can generally get up and running in a day or two. But what if the microcode running on your CPU\u2019s tiny integrated memory becomes infected? One security researcher says he\u2019s done it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christiaan Beek of Rapid7 says he has created a proof-of-concept ransomware that can hide inside a CPU\u2019s microcode, building on previous work that emerged when Google required AMD processors to always return \u201c4\u201d when asked for a random number. He claims that modifying UEFI firmware can install an unsigned update to the processor, slipping past any kind of conventional antivirus or OS-based security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.ther",
