I just have this one problem when I try to play the exact same game I used to play on arch with the exact proton settings and stuff and I have the nvidia drivers installed too. But idk why while playing out of nowhere the game lags so bad it feel like the screen froze, but after 5 to 10 mins it fixes on its own, I tried testing a few things it&#39;s not anything specific when my game lags it&#39;s not like it happens in combat or stuff it happens even when I am just walking, it&#39;s like it lags for a few minutes then works fine then it happens again. I used btop++ on the side to see if my gpu is being used or not and it is being used so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here and how do I fix this. I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a fedora issue or a driver issue or hardware issue i think it&#39;s a game issue can anyone help me fix it ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",

Initially I thought it would not since the compadata folder is used when running the game on linux, but im not so sure.
