It\u2019s called Quantum Grid, nothing to do with quantum mechanics, you nerds. It\u2019s a program that synchronizes computational power between multiple devices, allowing for easy horizontal scaling. The program handles the data distribution to the different connected devices, which leaves the user to decide how they want the data to be processed on the previously mentioned connected devices with the software they make. Quantum Grid can also be a volunteer computing system, if you so wish it to be. The distribution currently only works with MongoDB.</p> <p>If you like this project, I\u2019d be very thankful if you could upvote it on <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/quantum-grid\">ProductHunt</a> and star it on <a href=\"https://github.com/GeorgiMY/QuantumGrid\">GitHub</a>!</p> <h1>HOW DOES THE DATA DISTRIBUTION WORK?</h1> <p>And how is the data being distributed?
