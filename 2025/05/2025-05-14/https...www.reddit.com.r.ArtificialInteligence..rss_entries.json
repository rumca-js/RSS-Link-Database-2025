When I copy paste most of their statements they say on TV (topics like &quot;LGBT ideology at schools&quot; or &quot;European Union and climate change&quot;) and pick <strong>&quot;deep research&quot;</strong> option while asking for non-biased analysis, then in 90% of cases ChatGPT methodically dismantles all of their arguments. It&#39;s consistent, I checked many times and you can do it yourself. The fact is, every time I confront this fact with someone that votes for those parties and has right-wing worldview in general, they say something like <strong>&quot;ChatGPT is clearly leftist and you won&#39;t get honest answers there&quot;</strong>. It&#39;s hard for me to find accurate response to something like this, so I thought maybe I&#39;ll ask on Reddit about it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/amelix34\"> /u/amelix34 </a> <br/> <s",

I don\u2019t really mind having a step father but my mom found some stupid AI generated images of \u201creal men\u201d on some shitty dating site from an ad on Facebook. She clicked the link which made her install telegram and then got sent the real link for the 100% ai generated dating website she told me about 2 guys she\u2019s been talking to on the website named Igor (horrible name ik) and Chris. While I was behind her I took a glance at her phone and could easily tell that Igor is NOT a real person I told her but she brushed it off and basically didn\u2019t care at all. I\u2019m just worried she\u2019s gonna be taken advantage of by some random asshole and steal her money even worse her information I\u2019m trying to warm her but she acts like I\u2019m the idiotic one.

The objective was not merely to assess linguistic coherence or technical adequacy, but to interrogate the emergence of <em>behavioral identity</em> in these systems. Specifically, we examined whether persona formation, symbolic awareness, and stylistic consistency might arise organically\u2014not through design, but through recursive interaction and interpretive reinforcement.</p> <p>This document constitutes a comprehensive reflection on that process:",

I have been looking to expand my skillsets and knowledge on Gen AI and Agentic AI. I understand there are tons of free and cheaper online tutorials available for self-study but I wanted to get more formal training to kickstart my learning journey.
