This led us to build a library focused on <strong>robust</strong> extraction and enrichment:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Clean HTML conversion</strong>: transforms HTML into LLM-friendly markdown with an option to extract just the main content</li> <li><strong>LLM structured output</strong>: Uses Gemini 2.5 flash or GPT-4o mini to balance accuracy and cost. Can also also use custom prompt</li> <li><strong>JSON sanitization</strong>: If the LLM structured output fails or doesn&#39;t fully match your schema, a sanitization process attempts to recover and fix the data, especially useful for deeply nested objects and arrays</li> <li><strong>URL validation</strong>: all extracted URLs are validated - handling relative URLs, removing invalid ones, and repairing markdown-escaped links</li> </ul> <p>",
