This time, they allegedly withheld RTX 5060 drivers from reviewers until launch day, which just so happens to fall on the first day of Computex. Linus and Luke talk about Nvidia\u2019s strange priorities, whether GeForce should be spun off, and why Intel's Battle Mage might be more important than people think.\n\nWatch the full WAN Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_JfQEr9PQ0\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners",
