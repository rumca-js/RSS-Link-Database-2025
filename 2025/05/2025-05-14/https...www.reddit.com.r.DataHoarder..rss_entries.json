I want to copy it to have a backup for safekeeping. What is the best way to do that in terms of cost, physical storage size, and longevity/durability? I want to store the backup off site. Cloud is cost prohibitive. I&#39;m thinking of just putting together a new NAS, copying everything over, and then putting that somewhere safe like a safety deposit box with other valuables. But that might be too big in terms of physical size. I&#39;ve heard of tape but I&#39;m not too familiar with that. If I go the NAS/HDD route and it&#39;s stored somewhere safe and dry, would that work for the long term? What do people recommend?
