That was the message that flashed up on the Stadium of Light\u2019s advertising hoardings as Enzo Le F\u00e9e lined up a corner with three seconds left in extra time. Back at the halfway line, both managers were scribbling out lists of penalty takers. Sunderland, having produced an early knockdown by winning the first leg of this Championship playoff semi-final, had spent much of the previous 121 minutes and 57 seconds of Tuesday\u2019s second leg against Coventry on the ropes. Yet here they were. Le F\u00e9e lifted the ball towards the near post, where Dan Ballard mistimed his leap spectacularly, ending up in a sort of crouched star jump as the ball deflected off his head, on to the crossbar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/13/sunderland-coventry-championship-playoff-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">",

        "description": "<p>A waste-saving, resourceful and powerfully flavoured broth featuring coriander, garlic and old bread</p><p>Today\u2019s punchy and bright-green garlic and coriander soup is an intriguing Portuguese way to use up stale bread. The recipe is adapted from the traditional <em>a\u00e7orda</em> of Alentejo, where it\u2019s thought of as the region\u2019s signature dish. A\u00e7orda is said to have been born from necessity, a waste-saving and resourceful soup that\u2019s transformed by olive oil, plentiful herbs and rich egg. I find this take on it particularly interesting because, instead of simmering the coriander, garlic and egg in hot broth, they are instead put in a bowl and the broth is poured over them. This enhances the powerful flavours of the garlic and coriander, and the whole lot is then ladled over stale bread. For a vegetarian version, just omit the fish.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/14/how-to-turn-old-bread-into-a-classic-portuguese-soup-acorda-recipe-zero-waste-cooking\">Continu",

(This now strikes her as ominous: \u201cMaybe a man who was so fussy about cherries was not the man for me.\u201d) Lurking at the back of Wilson\u2019s mind had been the thought that she would soon be using the heart-shaped tin to bake a cake for their silver wedding anniversary.
