        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi! I&#39;m a huge fan of fantastic and sci-fi, especially Isaac Asimov and Ursula Le Guin (by far two of my favourite authors). I especially love listening to audiobooks, because I can listen to do them while doing simple tasks like driving or cleaning. I recently finished The End of Eternity by Asimov (it didn&#39;t miss, but his writing never does, imo), and now I want to find something else to listening to. I&#39;m considering the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, a Marvel novel based on some comics, but I want some other opinions. I prefer sci-fi and fantasy, but I also do like classic literature and am very open to reading anything else.

If that sort of gives you a vibe; <strong>upper middle grade to young YA fantasy/adventure.</strong> </p> <p>Trouble is these books need to be pretty clean, her parents are slightly strict, which is totally understandable. Violence I wanna say is okay, drinking/smoking fine. Mostly we&#39;re just worried about sex/nudity and language, or other mature elements (like brothels or spicy clubs lol)</p> <p>I just recommended and got her the Legend Series by Marie Lu. However, I think the last book has a scene in it that might not be very appropriate, according to her parents, so I&#39;ll be bitting my nails over here to see how that goes. </p> <p>Anyways, do y&#39;all have any clean, but FUN book recs that kind of fit that description? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Bad ass soldiers isolated from larger civilization and up against an alien menance or some science experiment gone wrong. I&#39;ve read a ton of 40k, but don&#39;t think it has that aliens feel. Also read some of the actual Aliens books. Bug hunt and River of pain. Both were sort of meh. </p> <p>Hope you can help! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Danthus\"> /u/Danthus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kmobbc/need_a_book_or_series_like_the_1986_aliens_movie/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kmobbc/need_a_book_or_series_like_the_1986_aliens_movie/\">[comments]</a></span>",

She&#39;s been stuck in a time loop for centuries and decides to become the dark lord rather than try and fail to defeat them for the thousandth time. It&#39;s a little heavy on the pop culture references, but the humor doesn&#39;t solely rely on them so it was a fun read.</p> <p>Nearly everything by Ravensdagger qualifies to some degree, as does Thundamoo. Several of the POV characters in The Wandering Inn saga fit, even if the comedy isn&#39;t as heavy in that series, the earnestness in the human characters often carries the show. One that technically fits would be most of Virlyce&#39;s series, but IMO her characters tend to be a little too much over the edge, it&#39;s really easy to for the unhinged girls in that series to just come ",

So if you tell her to picture an apple she can&#39;t picture an apple. So books with long, flowery descriptions probably wouldn&#39;t be her speed. </p> <p>She told me she&#39;s reading Heaven by Mieko Kawakami, bought Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto, and was intrigued at the bookstore by Open Throat by Henry Hoke.

Witches in mist filled bogs, ghosts floating past mansion windows, zombies in forgotten cemetaries, romani gypsies, haunted windmills, ruined castles on high mountains...etc. I have read the Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder novels that fit this theme. I&#39;m looking for newish (past 20 years) novels and while there is a huge host of them coming out now they are all young adult, romanace, or straight smut (nothing wrong with it just not what I&#39;m looking for).

My wife would like to start reading, but she has a very hard time retaining what she reads and finding something that keeps her interest. I&#39;ve had her try some YA novels, some recent fiction. She&#39;s picked out a few books for herself as well but she&#39;s not able to stay engaged. </p> <p>She loves true crime shows and has tasked me with finding a True crime book. I read mostly fantasy so this isn&#39;t my genre.</p> <p>Can anyone recommend a few easily digestible/quick read True crime books? Ideally something with simple writing that&#39;s not in any sort of intricate prose. Something straight forward. She&#39;s open to any True crime stories. </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Much-Coffee95\"> /u/Much-Coffee95 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1km4km4/true_crime_easy_reads/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www",
