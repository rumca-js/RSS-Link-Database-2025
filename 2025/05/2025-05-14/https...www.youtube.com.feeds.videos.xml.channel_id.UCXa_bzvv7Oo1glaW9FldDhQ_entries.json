        "description": "The Precinct is the latest title from Fallen Tree Games, perhaps better known for American Fugitive. The latter embraced a Grand Theft Auto-style sandbox gameplay that channels the older titles, but this one is more about upholding the law as a police officer.\n\nThe mechanics are intriguing at the start as you can patrol Averno City and stop various crimes, reading out offenses to different perpetrators and charging them accordingly. You also get a decent amount of freedom to tackle emergent crimes, not to mention pursuing other activities on the map like racing, time trials, and more.\n\nUnfortunately, The Precinct is let down by numerous factors, like the cheesy dialogue and characterization, the awkward shooting, some performance issues, and the tedium of booking suspects. That's not to say there isn't some entertainment in all this, especially when careening down a street to arrest a fleeing suspect, but its fundamentals need more work.",

A host of new features accompany these games, making them more approachable and fun. Like the first collection, each game has eight difficulty levels along with a bunch of different CRT filters. Unfortunately, players only get one save state for the entire collection, so choose your single-player game carefully. \n\nThe online multiplayer is just as good as it was for the previous collections, though the lack of crossplay is still felt here. The collection launches for a host of on May 16th.",

        "description": "Tainted Grail Fall of Avalon takes the Elder Scrolls formula and refines it into a densely packed experience filled with variety. The setting is a dark fantasy take on Arthurian legend. The world feels more like something out of Dark Souls than The Witcher 3, though Tainted Grail does contain plenty of lighthearted humor as well.\n\nThe gameplay allows a variety of styles and build types. There\u2019s even throwable items that give some crowd control strategy to the mix. Tainted Grail has been in early access since 2023 with fans praising its fun gameplay and varied content. This game is sure to scratch that specific open-world RPG itch when it fully launches on May 23rd 2025.",
