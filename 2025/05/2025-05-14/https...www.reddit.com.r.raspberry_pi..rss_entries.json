If password recovery isn\u2019t feasible, I\u2019m considering alternative hardware like Raspberry Pi 4/5.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve had hands-on experience running AI workloads (e.g., real-time inference with YOLO or TensorRT) on local edge devices, I\u2019d appreciate any insights on what platform you\u2019d recommend for any application.</p> <p>Thank you for your time.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Friendship_1341\"> /u/No_Friendship_1341 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1km5j0j/realtime_object_detectio",
