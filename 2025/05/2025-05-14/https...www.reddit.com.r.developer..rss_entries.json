I&#39;m spending way too much time typing out documentation, especially when I&#39;m prototyping and just trying to get the basic functionality down. I\u2019ve been thinking about leaning into voice dictation, but I haven\u2019t found the perfect solution yet.</p> <p>I&#39;ve mostly been using Google Voice Typing (the built-in one), because it&#39;s free and readily available. But honestly, the punctuation is atrocious, and it constantly gets tripped up on technical terms. It also keeps adding &quot;um&quot; and &quot;uh&quot; everywhere, which is super annoying.</p> <p>So, I\u2019m curious what are other developers using? I\u2019ve heard decent things about Otter ai for meetings and such, but that\u2019s not really my use case. I need something more focused on writing code, documentation, and even just quick Slack messages.</p> <p>I also saw someone mention this thing called WillowVoice in another thread. Appa",
