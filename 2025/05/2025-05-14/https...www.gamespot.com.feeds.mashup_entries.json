Nintendo has recently shared that players can customize these buttons to map to specific actions on a per-game basis.</p><p>In an overview posted on the Nintendo Today app, the company explained that the new buttons are fully mappable by the player. This means that they can take on the role of any other button on the controller. Moreover, these mappings can be set for each game, meaning that you'll have the ability to set up game-specific controller settings.</p><p>Button mappings can be set from the quick settings menu, opened by holding down the Home button from within a game. Any mappings will be saved automatically and persist across gameplay sessions.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-control",

It's still relatively early days for the project, but we've already learned a fair amount about the game. We're collecting everything we know about EA's Iron Man here in this post.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The new Iron Man game will join a small group of dedicated Iron Man titles that have come out over the years. Many years ago, Sega released game tie-ins for the first two Iron Man movies starring Robert Downey Jr., with Gameloft releasing a mobile game inspired by the movie Iron Man 3.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But now, Iron Man is set to take center stage once again with a new game from the developers of the Dead Space remake and <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/\">Battlefield 6</a>'s campaign.
