This is how his colleague, the game's director Mike Kayatta, puts it to me in a conversation at Remedy's predictably stylish HQ in Espoo, on the quiet, grey outskirts of Finland's capital Helsinki. Kayatta means it as a compliment, although with maybe just a tinge of truth to it as well. He's dangerous because, as Kayatta puts it, he's one of the rare few designers who can \"make his ideas manifest faster than he can tell you what it is.\"</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it\">Read more</a></p>",

What he does is kill the plot. The plot comes at him in the form of baddies and deadly set-pieces and locked doors, and he just punches and shoots a way through it until there's nothing left.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/crank-your-damage-to-1000-percent-and-doom-the-dark-ages-becomes-a-surprisingly-good-vacuuming-simulator\">Read more</a></p>",
