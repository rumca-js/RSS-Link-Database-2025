I know Google have said before that they ignore lots of spam links and suspect these aren nothing to worry about.</p> <p>Or would you disavow, my other concern is that we have had large amount of links in short amount of time and worry that it may trigger some form of spam link warning.</p> <p>Any thoughts would be great, we have seen these randomly start cropping up on a few sites.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bird-Marketing\"> /u/Bird-Marketing </a> ",
