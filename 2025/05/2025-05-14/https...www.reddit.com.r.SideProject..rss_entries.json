The concept stemmed from my personal frustration with traditional news formats: overcrowded with extraneous information, increasingly generated by AI, and filled with vacuous content lacking substance.</p> <p>This service offers a clean, distilled version of current events, narrated in a soothing, natural-sounding voice. You simply specify which topics interest you, and each day an MP3 arrives in your email inbox, accessible on any device you choose. WhatsApp delivery is also in development.</p> <p>The project emerged from addressing my own needs, and I&#39;m curious if others might find it valuable as well. A free trial is available for those who wish to experience the service before committing.</p> <p>I welcome any feedback should you decide to explore <a href=\"https://justgiveme.news/\">https://justgiveme.news</a></p> </div><!--",

My team and I have been buliding <a href=\"https://www.onuro.ai/\">Onuro</a> for nearly 2 years now, and have finally switched over to it as a full time startup! We are a group of engineers who became obsessed with pushing AI to its limits in regards to complex tasks, and naturally as engineers, those tasks were coding tasks. What we ended up building is a coding agent with an extremely robust processing engine, which we strongly believe can consistently produce the highest quality results out of any similar product on the market.</p> <p>We have a generous free version for those who want to just test the waters or use it for simple tasks. For the paid version we offer 1 month free trials + your first $15 of usage fees are covered, so you can get quite a bit of usage in without any financial commitment. We would appreciate it very much if any of you go and give it a try, and we are very receptive of feedback!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

I\u2019m running a public competition that puts a twist on the classic Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma Problem and you\u2019re all invited to participate!</p> <p>The challenge is to design a Python algorithm that plays a series of 10-round matches against other user-submitted algorithms. In each round, your algorithm must choose to cooperate with or betray your opponent. The winner is the algorithm who has the highest number of points totaled across all matches.</p> <p>The whole thing is in python and it&#39;ll probably take a maximum of 5 minutes to write your script and put in your submission.</p> <p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/GGFR57ZHGjGAkwFFA\">Link to the Competition</a></p> <p>There is a little cash prize just to incentivize people but at the end of the day, it&#39;s a wacky coding competition I wanted to hold and I&#39;m looking for people to participate.
