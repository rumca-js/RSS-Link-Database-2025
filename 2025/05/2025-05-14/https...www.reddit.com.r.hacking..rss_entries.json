Recently, I discovered wardriving, and have been playing with the WiGLE app for a few weeks. I want to push a little further into this, and I figure the best starting point is trying to get a bit more range on 2.4/5ghz since most of the houses are far enough off the road that the phone won&#39;t pick them up. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been looking into RPi builds, ESP32 builds, Pineapple clone builds, a rooted phone with nethunter, etc. One thing I keep thinking about is the channel hop rates and how fast each device can poll information. </p> <p>So here is my question - if you were building a dedicated wardriving setup that had decent range on wifi and would miss as little as possible, but wanted something relatively ",

Want to get a budget laptop (current or past gen) that has some form of Nvidia graphics chip or workstation chip for doing password cracking exercises. Preference to workstation CPUs as well because may need to run workloads for long periods and desire ECC support for the stability. Ram isn&#39;t a huge concern; need 8 gigs or more.</p> <p>Just not familiar with the market for stuff that might fit my wants/needs and the workstation stuff is a nice to have.
