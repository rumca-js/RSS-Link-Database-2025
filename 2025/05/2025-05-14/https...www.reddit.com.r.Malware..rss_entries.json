At that point, we already discussed static and dynamic analysis with the students, as well as common obfuscation techniques.</p> <p>Did someone see something suitable in recent years? It should not be one of the popular Loaders and can feature some obfuscation. Been looking since Monday, but either process injection is not as popular anymore or it has been completely outsourced to implants and loaders.</p> <p>edit: x86/x64 would be great. C would be best :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nordwald\"> /u/Nordwald </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1kmf6oy/looking_for_process_injection_samples/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1kmf6oy/looking_for_process_injection_samples/\">[comments]</a><",
