        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I never wrote ducky code before and needed to use a custom script for a project I am working on. Let&#39;s just say I was not looking forward to this tedious task, and was curious if I could write a script to track my keys while the program is running and format it in to ducky language without ever having to write a line of ducky code. So to save myself 10 minutes I spent all weekend creating an interpreter, and (today) I believe I have worked out most of the bugs, and think it is now user friendly , however I want people to try it out, let me know if they find any bugs and maybe use it for some projects. All the source code is posted directly on github and there is an executable, but you can compile the c++ code yourself and let me know ! :) </p> <p>P.S I&#39;m not sure if this is the right place to post, but hopefully this finds the right people</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/teslah3\"> /u/te",

The long-time goal is, that this engine should be able to replace CSS in its entirety. At least theoretically, that this is unlikely to happen from today&#39;s point of view is a different question.</p> <p>The comments I got in the CSS subreddit seem to be predominantly from people who view CSS and the W3C as some kind of divine entities which can, by definition, never be wrong and only deliver perfection.</p> <p>Any ideas how to do a better layout engine based on constraints are really appreciated.
