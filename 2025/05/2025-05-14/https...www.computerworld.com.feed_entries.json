But some settings out of the box are simply bad, undercutting your PC\u2019s full performance or keeping you from getting  the best picture from your monitor, for example. And somehow, File Explorer still doesn\u2019t show file extensions by default in the year 2025. That\u2019s just bad for security!</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E307\">I recently spoke to someone who was surprised to find he had been using his display incorrectly for years and found a few quick clicks instantly made his experience better. Lots of things in Windows are like that; every time I set up a new PC \u2014 and I do that often \u2014 there are settings I change immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"E-599\"",
