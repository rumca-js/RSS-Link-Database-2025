I have to buy a new home server (it will be headless) I will install debian as SO and docker with a lot of container like home Assistant (and other &quot;domotic container like zigbee2mqtt, mosquitto , nodered ecc), jellyfin, Immich, adguardhome, torrent, samba for sharing a folder like a nas etc etc I&#39;m thinking to buy a low power cpu like intel n95 or intel n150 etc. (Or other). I have a doubt: I dont know if buy a mini pc on Amazon like acemagic (n95 with solder ddr4) or a nuc 14 essential with n150 cpu. The nuc has the same price of the mini pc but without ram and hd: I have to buy the ram (16gb ddr5 --&gt; about 40\u20ac) and the disk (i&#39;m thinking a &quot;WD RED nvme&quot; for more data security).</p> <p>The question: is it worth spending more money to get probably the same performance but (i hope) greater quality and durability?</p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/paolofaz",
