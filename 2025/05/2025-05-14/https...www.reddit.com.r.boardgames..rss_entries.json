Of course, I was already playing board games every Saturday for the last year at that point, and had been playing board games for years, but I had never considered tracking the games I played. Little did I know that one post would subsume my hobby for the next 2.5 years.</p> <p>2023\u2019s goal was simple: play every game that I owned at least once. Now, that was no easy task. I owned a variety of games, ranging in complexity from Battleship to Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on Cursed Island and everything in between. By the end of the year, I owned 102 games, meaning I would have had to play, roughly, two new games a week to finish by the end of the year. However, not all games or friends are created equal. While we may be able to knock out five quick games in a few hours, we may have to dedicate a whole day to one game: looking at you Axis &amp; All",

I wrote this for my blog, but I figured it might be appreciated here. Mods, let me know if this doesn&#39;t the #5 rule!</p> <hr/> <p><strong>Ichor</strong>, designed by Dr. Reiner Knizia, is an abstract strategy game that pits the Olympic Pantheon against the monsters of Greek mythology. Each player controls six characters\u2014either gods or monsters\u2014on a grid board. On your turn, you move one of your pieces, dropping the titular ichor tokens on each space you pass through, racing to be the first to place all of your tokens on the board. Each god and monster also has a unique, single-use ability that can turn the tide\u2014but only if used at the right time!</p> <p>There&#39;s a lot to love about <strong>Ichor</strong>, starting with its very solid foundation. It stands on the shoulders of <strong>Clinch</strong>,",

The board was set up by installing a tabbed illustration of fans in a stadium into the back of the base, which was very much like the base in All American Football. But, instead of two spinners, this game was dice-based. On the tabbed fans illustration was a huge chart which had the names of running plays and passing plays. Whoever was on offense called a play and tossed three dice. </p> <p>If it was a running play, which included line plunges, off-tackle, end-around and maybe one or two others, you&#39;d toss the dice and see the results of the play on the chart. + 2 yards, no gain, + five yards, loss of three, and so on.

We&#39;ve liked the game, especially the unique mechanics in each scenario. However, we&#39;ve felt like the game is a bit too easy to be super enjoyable. We never really feel in danger in any of the scenarios. I find myself almost hoping that the enemies hit us a bit harder just to make it more exciting. This is different than Jaws of the Lion where I felt like every scenario was going to be a close call.</p> <p>Wondering if any other groups who have played Tidal Blades 2 have had similar experiences?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",

If the players <em>don&#39;t</em> know what cards are in play, doesn&#39;t that give advantage to experienced players, who can claim to have role cards that newer players might not have encountered yet?

So the game im looking to trade is mage knight. Its barely been used and all components are present and accounted for. I just never could get into it and would rather someone else have it. I was interested in swapping the game with someone for a copy of the base game of aeons end. which i think is more than a fair trade. Is there anywhere i can look to do a trade or post a trade suggestion? Id honestly rather just trade one game for another over a trade for money but i dont know of anywhere myself that would help with such transactions.</p> <p>I contacted noble knight games but they were quoting me less than 35 dollars for it and i just dont find that a fair deal.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bummer-Movie7406\"> /u/Bummer-Movie7406 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgame",

I&#39;ve got a 2 year old little girl and want something her age appropriate but that she won&#39;t age out of and will still be fun for her in 2 or 3 years. I went to the Haba website and was flooded with all there amazing products!!! I&#39;m stuck and can&#39;t seem to choose. What&#39;s your favorite and why?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/2Black_Hats\"> /u/2Black_Hats </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1km1ru6/theres_too_many_haba_game_choices/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1km1ru6/theres_too_many_haba_game_choices/\">[comments]</a></span>",
