        "description": "Check out the 'Alert' Teaser Trailer for Jurassic World Rebirth, a new installment to the legendary dinosaur action franchise distributed by Universal Pictures. The film brings audiences to a new island, new dinosaurs to face, and a brand-new trailer in the coming days on May 20. Jurassic World Rebirth is in theaters on July 2.\n\nSet five years after the events of Jurassic World Dominion, the planet\u2019s ecology has proven largely inhospitable to dinosaurs. Those remaining exist in isolated equatorial environments with climates resembling the one in which they once thrived. The three most colossal creatures within that tropical biosphere hold the key to a drug that will bring miraculous life-saving benefits to humankind.\n\nJurassic World Rebirth is directed by Gareth Edwards from a script by original Jurassic Park screenwriter David Koepp, based on characters created by Michael Crichton. The film is produced by Frank Marshall and Patrick Crowley. It is executive produced by Steven Spielber",
