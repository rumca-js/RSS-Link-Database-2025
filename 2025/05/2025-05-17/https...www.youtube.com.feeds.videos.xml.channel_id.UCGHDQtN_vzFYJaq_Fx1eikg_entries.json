They included kamikaze aircraft, fukuryu frogmen, and several types of boats and submarines.\n\nWeapons similar in effect to these self-destructing weapons are used today by modern militaries, though as drones or otherwise automated rather than human-guided. Notable example is loitering munitions, which are popularly known as kamikaze drones.\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Special_Attack_Units\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA\nMerch: https://qxir.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/qxir\nTwitter:",
