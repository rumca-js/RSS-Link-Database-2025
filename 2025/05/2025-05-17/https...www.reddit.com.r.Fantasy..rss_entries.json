Currently I am between the Malazan books or the Wheel of time books and I am looking for thoughts on which one I should start first. </p> <p>Let me describe what I enjoy in a book to better guide the responses. </p> <p>Picking up Brandon Sanderson was really the first time I grasped reading as a whole. What I love about his book is the planning that goes into them. The lore and connections between the books that is deliberate and thought out. Catching the hidden tidbits given to us and making those connections. I know that Malazan has a lot of this but it is not as easy to connect as Brandon\u2019s work and that makes me nervous. The wheel of time is just an established series in the genre and I will read at some point. What do you guys think I should start first Malazan or The wheel of time, or some other recommendation. Thanks! </p",

So far I\u2019ve read: The Wheel of Time- ate it up, probably wouldn\u2019t read again absolutely loved the Stormlight Archive enjoyed The Fifth Season but didn\u2019t like the last one (stone sky) so I stopped reading. I\u2019m now on Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman as a weird in-between as I wait for my library hold of Assassin\u2019s Apprentice by Robin Hobb. I accidentally read book 1 of ACOTAR because I didn\u2019t know it was romantasy lol and hate-loved it until I got bored. I also started Gideon the Ninth and didn\u2019t like it, but maybe just because of the narrator, as I was listening to the audiobook. I like Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K Leguin but the following were slightly boring to me. One of the MVPs, most favorite and reread twice are the Kingkiller Chronicles. </p> <p>Oh also, have read all of Game of Thrones, LO",

If you haven&#39;t started the series, it&#39;s about a Security Unit - essentially a robot with human parts - who has broken free of his governor module, meaning he&#39;s now a free man. Er, sec unit. Readers come for the charmingly anti-social personality, and stay for the action adventures and found family. </p> <p>After finishing book five, <strong>Network Effect</strong>, I took a two year break from Murderbot, as the stories were running together and feeling repetitive. I&#39;m glad I did, because it was really nice to come back into this world, and the mystery framing of book six was really easy to follow and had me wanting to see what happens next. </p> <p>Rating: 4/5 </p> <p>Categories:<br/> Biopunk (normal)<br/> Cozy SFF (normal) - this is subjective</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/P0PSTART\"> /u/",

Are there any books you kept pushing off because of the cover, but when you finally read them, they were great? Or do you not judge a book by its cover? Maybe there are books you hear about but still haven&#39;t read because the cover is bad. </p> <p>For me, I&#39;ve been pushing off reading Jonathan Strange and Mister Norell because the cover gives me no idea what kind of book it is (and it&#39;s quite a boring cover).

Their are boys on the beach teasing her, but feeling guilty and scared when they take it too far. The butcher and his wife and their son. The priest is kind, and tries to straddle the line between confidentiality and comforting a grieving child.

To gain her attention over arrogant duche Ghostblade, he attempts to gain enlightenment as a level 6 warrior and beat out level 9 warriors.</p> <p>Other details: chapters were called &quot;episodes&quot;.

I don&#39;t wanna get into The First Law or Robin Hobb&#39;s world just yet. I landed on these 4.</p> <p>My first question though is that, is it worth reading the Will of the Many or Amina Al-Sirafi now, or do you recommend I wait for their series to be done and then get to them?</p> <p>Also, of these 4 which one is your suggestion to start next?</p> <p>Some of my TBR series are: Locked Tomb, R F Kuang books, Red Rising, Sun Eater, and other James Islington Books.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read WOT, ASOIF, Cosmere, Malazan, and some more I&#39;m not remembering now lol.
