My most recent example is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Endoscope-Adjustable-Semi-Rigid-Waterproof-Inspection/dp/B0CZHT2VHS/\">this USB-C endoscope camera</a>, which I snagged for just $21.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s an endoscope camera? Think of a long, flexible tube with a camera and light attached to one end. In the medical field, it\u2019s used to look inside the human body\u2014but for me, it\u2019s been an everyday game-changer for all kinds of practical uses.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>Further reading: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2779758/5-nifty-usb-c-gadgets-you-didnt-know-you-needed.html\">5 nifty USB-C gadgets you didn\u2019t know you needed</a></p>\n</block",

For $9 per month, Frndly TV offers a bundle of channels you\u2019d typically find in a cable TV package, including Hallmark, A&E, and The Weather Channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s normal for streaming platforms to offer their own free or premium streaming services, most aren\u2019t selling their own bundles of cable channels with optional DVR service. Roku is doing something pretty unusual here, and while it says it\u2019s just trying to boost subscription revenues on its platform, that doesn\u2019t sound like the whole story to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-frndly-fits-in\">How Frndly fits in</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Frndly TV is what\u2019s known in <a",
