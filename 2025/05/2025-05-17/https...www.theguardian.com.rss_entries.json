Here is Richard Linklater\u2019s impeccably submissive, tastefully cinephile period drama about the making of Godard\u2019s debut 1960 classic \u00c0 Bout de Souffle, that starred Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo as the star-crossed lovers in Paris. Linklater\u2019s homage has credits in French and is beautifully shot in monochrome, as opposed to the boring old colour of real life in which the events were actually happening; he even cutely fabricates cue marks in the corner of the screen, those things that once told projectionists when to changeover the reels. But Linklater smoothly avoids any disruptive jump-cuts.</p><p>It\u2019s a good natured, intelligent effort for which Godard himself, were he still alive, would undoubtedly have ripped Linklater a new one.

        "description": "<p>These vegan burgers are child\u2019s play and fun to make, too</p><p>This is exactly my kind of recipe. It\u2019s easy, flavourful and, as a bonus, it\u2019s crisp, too. In fact, it\u2019s so simple, you could make the mixture with your eyes closed or, better still, give it to a six-year-old to do (they could also make it with their eyes closed). The key is the black beans, because they crisp up perfectly, and the condiments, which supercharge the flavour. There is one small catch, though: the onions need caramelising until they\u2019re jammy, and ready to top the patty. You don\u2019t <em>have </em>to do this, but I\u2019m here to tell you that it is worthwhile (especially if there\u2019s a six-year-old already making the burgers).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/may/17/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-crispy-black-bean-burgers\">Continue reading...</a>",
