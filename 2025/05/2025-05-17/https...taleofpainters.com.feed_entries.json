        "description": "<p>There is something special about the 90s version of Goblin Green. It's the colour of our childhoods, when garishly painted armies clashed on green flocked tabletops. But replicating the exact shade of classic Goblin Green seems surprisingly difficult. In this video, I test and rank similar green paints from over 14 old and new paint brands. Let\u2019s determine once and for all which modern paint is the perfect match for the classic Goblin Green of the 90s.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/05/review-the-perfect-matches-for-90s-goblin-green/\">Review: The perfect match(es) for 90s Goblin Green</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
