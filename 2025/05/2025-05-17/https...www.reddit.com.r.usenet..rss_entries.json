I actually receive less content since this but it guarantees me files that can be used directly by emby. </p> <p>Second question I sometimes receive extracts from films only (sample) while in the title it says complete and since they do not contain an extension I have blacklisted the films download well and I end up with a file impossible to watch on emby, how can I remedy this? </p> <p>Thanks for your help! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/huuugoo8\"> /u/huuugoo8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1kotzh1/extension_download/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usene",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Looking through this subreddit I&#39;ve seen a lot of people saying that usenet.nl, also known as freediscussions.com, is a scam, which I really should have looked into before signing up for it. However, I didn&#39;t really get scammed, this was mostly a consequence of my own mistakes, and now I&#39;m in deep shit. I started a free trial with them in late March. I already felt a bit suspicious of their website, so I gave them a fake name and address, and used a virtual visa as my card, which isn&#39;t connected to my bank account and to my knowledge doesn&#39;t have any of my personal information on it. The card had a balance of about $8 and any payments over that would be declined. I didn&#39;t use their services once, didn&#39;t even download Usenet, and promptly forgot about the trial. Eventually the trial was over, and they tried to bill me for 99 euros, because as it turns out even though I signed up for a monthly subscription that was 8.99 euros",
