I always loved how fast safari felt to use. I used Arc and Firefox before as my main browsers because safari lacks good adblocking and extension support.<br/> Orion is just as fast as safari, is not chromium based, has very good adblocking, respects privacy and also has way better extension support than safari.<br/> I love it so much, that I&#39;ll be buying kagi&#39;s search engine subscription to support developnment, which is also great btw.</p> <p>My question is, why not more people are using this browser? </p> <p>Is it the extensions?

One of the main problems is the lack of strong sandboxing, which affects security. On Windows it&#39;s bad, and on Linux it&#39;s horrible. There&#39;s some isolation there, but it&#39;s very weak.</p> <p>I was wondering if there was any way to mitigate or improve this problem. Well, supposedly using Firejail or AppArmor to isolate the browser is a very good alternative. But does it really work? There are other options too, like using seccomp and a reinforced firewall. But what exactly should you use? And how? Should I really use all three at the same time, just one, or exactly how?</p> <p>Does it really work?

Personally, I used Chrome exclusively for years. Then I eventually made the switch to Brave, and now that\u2019s what I use almost all the time.</p> <p>I\u2019ve installed browsers like Vivaldi and Firefox and tried them briefly, but they didn\u2019t really impress me. Either the ad blocking wasn\u2019t great, the interface felt clunky, pages loaded slower, or something else turned me off.</p> <p>That said, I admit I don\u2019t experiment much. I guess I have a bit of a \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it\u201d mindset.</p> <p>So I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s how most of you approach browsers too? If the one you\u2019re using works well enough, do you just stick with it?</p> <p>And for those of you who do try out other browsers, how much time do you spend exploring and adjusting to them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/saoiray\"> /u/saoiray </a> <br",

My conclusions: yes, it&#39;s really bad that corporate companies use my data to sell to third parties, but I don&#39;t think anyone really needs my anime hobby. Also, if I use any other browser, Microsoft will still have my data because I use Windows. It also means that I should stop using MS to-do, because they also get my data that way, but this app is the most convenient for me. I want to hear your opinion: does it make sense to switch to a browser if I use other products that collect data without hesitation (for example, WhatsApp)?</p> <p>I wanted to ask about this in <a href=\"/r/privacy\">r/privacy</a>, but I&#39;m new and can&#39;t post anything there yet </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/makksiikk\"> /u/makksiikk </a>",
