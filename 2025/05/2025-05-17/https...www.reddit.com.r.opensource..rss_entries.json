Today, I&#39;m happy to announce an awesome upgrade to our UX: in-line image grounding.</p> <p>When you use Morphik&#39;s agent to perform queries, if the agent uses an image to answer your question, it will crop the relevant part of that image and display it in-line into the answer. For developers, the agent will return a list of <code>Display</code> objects that are either markdown text or base64-encoded images.</p> <p>While we built this just to improve the user experience when you use the agent, it actually led to much more grounded answers. In hindsight, it makes sense that forcing an agent to cite its sources leads to better results and lower hallucinations.</p> <p>Adding images in-line also allows human to verify the agent&#39;s response more easily, and correct it if the agent misinterprets the source.<",

It&#39;s designed to detect unreachable functions and unused imports in your Python codebases. I know there&#39;s already Vulture, flake 8 etc etc.. but hear me out. This is more accurate and faster, and because I&#39;m slightly OCD, I like to have my codebase, a bit cleaner. I&#39;ll elaborate more down below. </p> <p><strong>What Makes Skylos Special?</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>High Performance</strong>: Built with Rust, making it fast</li> <li><strong>Better Detection</strong>: Finds more dead code than alternatives in our benchmarks</li> <li><strong>Interactive Mode</strong>: Select and remove specific items interactively </li> <li><strong>Dry Run Support</strong>: Preview changes before applying them</li> <li><strong>Cross-module Analysis</strong>: Tracks imports and calls across your entir",
