Aside from that, a technician told us that we shouldn&#39;t disassemble the CIS from the printer to make a scanner, as the connections of the printer and scanner should be intact for it to work, but our project should be portable. We also asked if we could just remove the housing and preserve the connections, including those for printers, but we were told it wasn&#39;t possible. </p> <p>If we are going to buy 2nd hand scanners, with processed CIS, those using USB, so it&#39;s plug and play, is it possible to be integrated with a Raspberry Pi?

This project sounds awesome in my head, and I\u2019d love to build something cool out of it.</p> <p>The problem is... I&#39;m a complete beginner.

While this may not be useful to helping me with my problem, I am using a Pi 2 Zero W, and reading voltages from a potentiometer, fed into a MCP3008 ADC, goes into a python script and returns a wav file to play depending on the voltage, which is then put through a PCM5102A DAC, into a TPA3118 amplifier, and lastly output to a speaker. This is all powered by a 12V talentcell battery, which contains a 12V output for the amplifier and a 5V output for the pi.</p> <p>Upon booting the pi itself though, the speaker immediately plays static and high",
