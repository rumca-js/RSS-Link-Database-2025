It checks if I\u2019m home (local IP) or remote (Tailscale), and mounts accordingly.</li> </ul> <p>The logic works well on boot.</p> <h1>The problem:</h1> <p>On shutdown, if I\u2019m connected via Tailscale, <code>tailscaled</code> shuts down <em>before</em> the NFS share is unmounted. This causes the system to hang \u2014 I assume because the NFS connection drops mid-shutdown and systemd gets stuck.</p> <h1>Current workaround:</h1> <p>I added this to my <code>wlogout</code> config:</p> <pre><code>sudo umount -lf /mnt/nfs; systemctl poweroff </co",
