But I wanted to buy new one since I don&#39;t trust it anymore I was thinking It&#39;ll be easy task just order another barracuda and done but then I found the whole smr and cmr technologies I was reading about it for 2 days already and while I gained some knowledge I&#39;m still confused. Are SMR drives good for OS install or It will be slow after some time? Also if I would overwrite it completely with <code>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda</code> so the filesystems are not involved I think It would be sequential write? Because from what I was reading they are good at sequential writes but suck at random wrties after some time. And if i then overwritten it second time with /dev/urandom will it",
