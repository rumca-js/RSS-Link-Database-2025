Our experience has been alright with Nessus Pro for internal VAs. We list down the IP addresses of their servers -&gt; Setup an Advanced Scan -&gt; Leave our laptop at their site -&gt; Get 2000-3000 pages of report. Though we mostly still have to sort out thousands of pages to determine the actually important vulnerabilities in the VA report before we submit it to the client.</p> <p>We are considering to renew Nessus Pro in the coming weeks. However, there has been a shift such that our clients now mostly request for PenTests on their published platforms instead (web app, iOS, Android). As a result, we have seen a reduced demand for conducting internal VA since the start of this year. Hence, management is considering to remove Nessus Pro as ",
