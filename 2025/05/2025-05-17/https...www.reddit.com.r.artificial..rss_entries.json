I expected it to just spit out code (like those \u201cwrite me a program\u201d memes), but it actually helped me understand how my program works and learn from it at the same time.</p> <p>The best part is that I can throw screenshots or broken code into it and it\u2019ll help fix or explain it. It saved me from turning in a blank file last week.</p> <p>Now I use AI fulltime like I have my own custom ai for specific tasks for the day it feels like cheating but hey, it sames me like 5 hours a day like frrr.</",
