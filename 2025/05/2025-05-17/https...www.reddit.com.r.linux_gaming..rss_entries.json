This game is old, it does not have DLSS, DLSS cannot be modded in, there is no DLSS. So I used Lossless scaling to add interpolation to this and it worked well. When I migrated to Linux, while I could still install and setup PSOBB, it would be capped to the original FPS without this program.</p> <p>Is there anyway to get the same result on Linux? While I can setup PSOBB with wine via Lutris and all that fun stuff, I want my 60FPS+ PSOBB on Linux before I go back to PSO, and I refuse to go back to Windows.</p> <p>Can anyone help provide an alternative that actually works with this 2004 game? Obviously running a VM isnt viable, even for this old video game. Tried that, performance is terrible. I dont want to dual boot either.<",

Really happy with using linux so far. BUT my question is, during the installation it asks how much space is to be allocated to linux and the rest is to storage. Ive allocated 200gb to linux and 800gb (the rest) to storage. Does it matter if linux uses the whole drive? As installing steam games it automatically uses the linux drive i can change it to the other drive. Is it better to install games on the linux drive or does it actually matter?

I have no issues with the Proton overlay, and generally it&#39;s been running great.</p> <p>Apart from this one thing - mods don&#39;t work. Terraria tModLoader is broken and doesn&#39;t launch. The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ doesn&#39;t recognize mods. Even with enabled ptrace.</p> <p>Has anyone run into this issue? Is there any way to enable mods in Steam Flatpak?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hissingFish\"> /u/hissingFish </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1kos25y/no_mods_steam_flatpak_disabled_modding_issue/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1kos25y/no_mods_steam_flatpak_disabled_modding_issue/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My 7900 XT handles 4K gaming reasonably well, but I wish its performance was better; many newer games struggle without using FSR or XeSS. Therefore, I am considering a new, more powerful GPU. Should I go for a 5090? I know that Nvidia drivers aren&#39;t as good on Linux, so will a 5090 perform well on Linux? I really like AMD, but now that they have exited the high-end GPU market, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s my brand anymore.
