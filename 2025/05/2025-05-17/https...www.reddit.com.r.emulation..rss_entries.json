I have been messing with just forcing some games into 16:9 in retro arch, wide screen hacks etc with some being great, some being bad. </p> <p>Just curious if anyone has already done the legwork and has their findings published anywhere, I feel like there probably is and im just bad at googling these days. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fpsb0b306\"> /u/fpsb0b306 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1kowa9f/widescreen_hack_spreadsheet/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1kowa9f/wid",
