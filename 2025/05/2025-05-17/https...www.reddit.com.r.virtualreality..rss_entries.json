Havnt even got a real name reveal yet, for something rumored to be releasing later this year. </p> <p>We also seen leaks of both Valve and Samsung ordering parts for their headsets. But we still kinda left empty handed on news and info. Seem like they all waiting on something. The Samsung Project Moohan is more concerning to me because of this. They show what the headset looks like and a rehashed demo, but won&#39;t even show us the name and what the controllers look like.

I don\u2019t have the glasses spacer atm but I did order one should come in next week. I also ordered the amvr facial interface but that didn\u2019t help at all. If anything it was worse. I do have a bigger nose and a narrow face shape. But after looking some things up I came across a former Reddit post where the person noticed that there are two different versions of the pico 4 face cushion. Universal and Asian. I am 1. Wondering if there\u2019s a way for me to check to see which face cushion I have. And 2. Where or how I can go about finding and ordering either the fitness pu face cushion that pico sells or a replacement European/universal face cushion. I am located in the USA. An",
