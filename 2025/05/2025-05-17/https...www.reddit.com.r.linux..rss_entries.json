Yesterday out of curiosity I installed Hyprland to see how things were going in terms of compatibility and gaming and to my surprise its incredibly smoth. To be fair after I installed hyprland I used a script to set up hyprland (HyDE). This script even fixed a problem I was having, the monitor wouldn&#39;t display anything after waking up. Once finished, it was beautiful and fairly simple to use. I only modified some keybinds and borders which were so easy to modify in the .config files. So the question is, Is it really that easy?

I would highly recommend to any linux newbies to do a total system update after first installing. Update everything that it says to update in the software manager. This will prevent performance issues and will help speed up your browser. </p> <p>2) You do not need to do any kind of ricing or extensive modifications once installing has completed.

Thing is, I want to install Chitubox on my pc because Lychee seems to be broken or something, always crashing during the slicing process due to a memory leak. Tried everything but nothing seems to work.</p> <p>I downloaded the Chitubox installer from their website but all i have is a Manual Page file but i dont know how to run it, or even how to access it. I&#39;ve read about the man command but i just dont know how to use it at all. Any help will be appreciated.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RedPorongo\"> /u/RedPorongo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1kofotq/installing_from_manual_page/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1kofotq/installing_from_manu",
