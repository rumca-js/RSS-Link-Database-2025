        "description": "Sponsor: Thermaltake TR100 mini-ITX Travel Case on Amazon https://geni.us/Yn9DXb\nMontech is preparing to launch new air coolers to battle Thermalright and, by their own wording, take DeepCool's former spot in the US market. Montech isn't quite at Thermalright levels of cheap, but they're trying to get there -- and so is everyone else. Montech also has a number of new cases coming out over the next 6-8 months, including the Sky 3, King 45, King 15, X5 budget case, X5M, the \"ten,\" and more. We'll cover those as quickly as we can in this round-up of the case and cooling company's suite at #computex2025.\n\nHAVN has a really interesting new case and some ultra thick fans with a lot of engineering in them. Check out our news coverage of those here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeGwSlLXXw8\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?

        "description": "Sponsor: Thermalright Frozen Prism 360 on Amazon - https://geni.us/FUqbQC\nHAVN made the well-built but strange HS420 PC case from last year, and now the company is back with a heavy emphasis on thermal performance and acoustics -- though we'll have to test it in our own benchmarking and reviews. The new HAVN BF360 joins the HS420, with the BF360 also bringing in new fans in the 180mm, 140mm, and 120mm categories. The HAVN 180mm fan uses a 40mm thick frame (after experimenting with 52mm thick previously), and special shaping on the hub for what HAVN claims will improve pressure performance across the hub. We won't have benchmarks and thermal performance until they launch, but for now, we can go through what HAVN's thermal engineer is targeting in design.\n\nFind our HAVN HS420 review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7aRWcM0AFE\nWatch our Noctua interview about fan design and materials like LCP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82LZkglNiQ0\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our s",
