The ship is literally a see saw and you must place the pieces on the elevated side.</p> <p>And that\u2019s basically the game. It\u2019s simple it plays beautifully and quickly. We played twice in about 15 minutes at 3 players. </p> <p>Trying to balance the different densitys of cubes and the awkward shaped pieces and the bearings is hilarious and adds a weird layer of thought to it. </p> <p>If you get a chance to pick it up or play it. I highly recommend it. If more dexterity games were like this, that style of game would be taken more seriously. </p> <p><a href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/351810/vi",

The issue I&#39;m having is that YT videos aren&#39;t going into much detail about this game... my guess is so they can avoid spoilers.</p> <p>My questions are: How is the eternal mode? The mode when you just use all the cards to play a trick-taking game rather than doing the missions. Are all the characters placed into a deck and then we open a few and draft the characters? How many characters/tasks are there to draft from? How it compare to The Crew? I have the crew back at home.. it&#39;s been permanently borrowed.
