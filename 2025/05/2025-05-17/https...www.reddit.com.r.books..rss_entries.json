Unfortunately, the last two years, I wasn&#39;t &quot;feeling it&quot; for one reason or another and that really bummed me out. I am still not sure why that happened, but suffice to say, since September 2024, I am very much back into the swing of things and reading roughly a book of week. In this instance, reading itself has become a major hobby of mine with me reading quite often 2 hours before bed, or casually throughout the weekend.</p> <p>With that being said, I have mainly stuck to one book at a time and to fiction. I want to get back into reading Non-Fiction and to accomplish that, I purchased two books &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs&quot; and &quot;The Rise and Reign of the Mammals&quot; by Steve Brusatte. I chose these because I also have had a lifelong interest in the natural sciences (I am a scientist for a living with a PhD in Spatial and Behavioral Ecology).",
