Use code ECHELON at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: https://incogni.com/echelon\n\n\nAs Google rolls out new AI summary tools, and continues to obfuscate their in search advertising, the \"Zero Click\" world of internet searching is beginning to become reality.\n\nWhat was once a stunning portal to a complex online world, is now a shifting window that scraps and regurgitates content, with a self cannibalizing spiral that inexorably leads to the death of widespread unique content.
