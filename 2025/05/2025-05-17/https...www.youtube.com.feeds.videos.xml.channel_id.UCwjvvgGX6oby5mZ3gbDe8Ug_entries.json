        "description": "In 2025, China's TWELVE MILLION TWO HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND college graduates face a brutal job market. From NINE EIGHTY-FIVE universities (China's Ivy League) to Big Four accounting firms like PwC Zhong Tian and Deloitte, dreams of high-paying careers are crushed by salaries as low as TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED RMB ($350) a month. Graduates share their struggles: EIGHT THOUSAND resumes with no offers, HR insults, and jobs demanding quantum computing expertise for just EIGHT THOUSAND RMB. With ONE MILLION RMB invested in education, many earn less than delivery riders. Economic slowdown, policy failures, and censorship deepen the crisis, leaving youth trapped in \"involution.\" Can they find a way out?
