Throughout that time, I\u2019ve tried all sorts of Kindle cases to protect my precious. But it wasn\u2019t until last year that my reading experience got leveled up in an entirely new way with one simple $15 buy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m talking about <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SCSVPN-Kindle-Paperwhite-11th-2021/dp/B09V319QRR/\">a Kindle case with a built-in elastic hand strap</a>. Yes, yes, I know\u2014it sounds unremarkable. Trust me, I was skeptical of it for a long time myself. But once I gave it a try, suddenly all of my \u201creading yoga\u201d became a lot easier. No matter what weird position I ended up in, I could still grip my Kindle and read comfortable.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context",

Today I want to show you a neat trick. As you no doubt understand, getting dead batteries in any device can be a real drag. To stop that happening I frequently swap my batteries out with fresh ones before they go totally flat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As to the old ones, I usually store them in a bag to recycle later \u2014 or to use in a pinch. But on the odd occasion I forget to swap out my battery, get a flat in my device, and have no spares left, I have to rifle through that bag and test out each battery to find one with enough charge left in it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correction: That\u2019s what I used to do. Now I have a method that saves me a bunch of time\u2026</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-do\">What to do</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Find a flat, firm surface, like a table or a book \u2014 this will be your test surface.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now drop the batte",
