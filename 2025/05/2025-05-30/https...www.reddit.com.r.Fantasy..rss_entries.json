Most authors would center the story around fighting the leviathans - the heroes would be soldiers or inventors focused on defending the sea wall - but this series just lets all that drama play out in the background while the main characters solve murder mysteries. The books aren\u2019t \u201ccozy,\u201d there\u2019s plenty of travel and adventure etc, but our main characters are not the heroes of the empire - they\u2019re just investigators, albeit very good ones.

It was epic fantasy similar to the style of GoT and Wheel of Time. It started with a wizard somewhere like the ends of the world or in the ocean. He had captured a woman whom he used as a power source. She gets away from him and ends up being passed around from man to man or sold as a sex slave because she is immensely/unforgettably attractive to every man that sees her. You find out later that she\u2019s a goddess and her power had been taken away from her with her memory. There is also another main character, a young girl in hill tribes or something. She ends up as a blacksmith I think or a jeweler and the advocate for a fire god or something after a burn or injury. I remember her as very similar to Merida from Brave.

I truly loved the first one, not so much the second and the last feels like going back home, but there&#39;s a question in my mind: what about the classic fantasy creatures?</p> <p>I mean where are the orcs, the elves, the dwarves? Sure, there are dragons in The Apprentice&#39;s Quest but they aren&#39;t the classical sit-on-top-of-a-treasure kind of dragons. I know that some D&amp;D novels follow more classic fantasy tropes, but other than that, did fantasy fall out of love with these creatures? Or did it ever fall in love and I&#39;m just seeing from the wrong perspective?</p> <p>Maybe it&#39;s more of a thing linked to what I&#39;m reading, with Trollocs and koloss reinventing the orcs and other things, but I feel it even ",

Mostly because usually it means at some point in the book a heavy emphasis is put some something being like &quot;wow remember this important thing&quot; and I have read the necessary 5 extra books to understand the reference.(And I don&#39;t have the time or effort to do this now) Also I don&#39;t like having to piece together multiple books like this and work things out. This is not to say I don&#39;t like big and complicated worlds like from Malazan. I guess I&#39;m just feeling that way after feeling fairly lost after the most recent storm light archive book. Almost the whole last 3rd made very little sense and my friend whos read all the books Brandon Sanderson has written had to explain a lot of what I would consider VERY important context.
