What stood out to me is how consistent it is when sticking to tone and instructions, even with really long inputs. We pushed it with some heavy prompts worth of internal text dumps and it didn\u2019t fall apart. It actually followed through without skipping context or losing structure, which is rare with most models we&#39;ve tested. The refusal behavior is also pretty reliable not too strict, but it definitely knows when to back off from sketchy inputs. Curious if others here are <a href=\"https://ncse.info/claude-4-by-anthropic/\">running Claude</a> in more structured or high-trust environments, especially paired with something like Make or Airtable for automating summaries, compliance checks, or doc handling. Would love to swap notes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
