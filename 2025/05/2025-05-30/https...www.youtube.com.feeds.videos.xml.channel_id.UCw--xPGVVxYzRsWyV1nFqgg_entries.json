        "description": "The Wheel of Time show is officially canceled at Amazon Prime, and while many fans saw it coming, it still stings. In this episode\u2014Wheel of Time Autopsy\u2014I break down everything that went wrong, from behind-the-scenes struggles to creative missteps, and how a franchise with such massive potential got taken off life support.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a rant\u2014it\u2019s an investigation. What worked in Season 1? What failed in Seasons 2 and 3? Was the fandom fractured beyond repair? Let\u2019s talk about it.\n\n\ud83d\udcda My Books:\nNeon Ghosts: A Witch's Sin Hardcover: https://shop.wraithmarked.com/collections/standard-editions-1/products/neon-ghosts-a-witchs-sin-hardcover\nBreach of Peace: https://tinyurl.com/BoPTLT\nRebels Creed: https://tinyurl.com/RCTLTDG\n\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch & Signed Books: https://www.danielbgreene.com\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DanielBGreene\n\ud83c\udfa5 Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-EqiFg67s2Nd0imgRXg5w\n\ud83d\udcac Discord: https://discord.gg/xUzhVv4\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dgreene",
