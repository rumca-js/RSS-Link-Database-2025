I&#39;m so tired of reading fantasy or just literary fiction, or granted any genre, where the female is just dependent on achieving her goal with some male love interest or romance subplot, they make her so generically and unrealistically emotional or overly emotional or incapable at points in the story, only to use it as a device later ",

I am just starting off creating a bookstagram (I have yet to post yet \ud83d\ude05), but I have been away from Instagram for several years. I have mostly been engaging with book content through YouTube and maybe want to start a channel someday, but I thought bookstagram would be a more manageable place for me to start and see how much I enjoy content creation. </p> <p>Part of my motivation for starting my own account is that I struggle to find content creators with reading tastes that overlap with mine. I read a mix of classics, contemporary fiction, fantasy, sci-fi, historical fiction, and a little non-fiction. It seems that many accounts are heavily centered on one genre and accounts focusing on romance, romantasy, and thrillers are the most common (which are all genres I rarely read). So, I\u2019m hoping to find accounts that read many genres to help inspire me and to start building a community on bookstagram. Would love any recommendations!</p> </div><!-- SC_",

When I now was stuck recovering from leg surgery, I finally gave The Blade Itself a try, which for me was a big let down. That was disappointing, as I&#39;ve heard great things and really wanted to get into his work. As I finished The Blade Itself, TBB sent me a special edition of The Devils, so I decided to try Abercrombie again right away. New story, new setting, not First Law related, 20 years after The Blade Itself. </p> <p><strong>THE DEVILS</strong> - a Suicide Squad style story where a team of monsters has to escort the macguffin, lost princess Alex, from A to B, set in an alternate medieval Europe where magic exists. </p> ",

I&#39;ve been doing a lot of hunting at used book shops lately, but recently I ended up with a Barnes &amp; Noble gift card and went browsing in there for the first time in a long time. What I discovered is that everything is about $20. Today I picked up a stack of seven used books for $17 total, which is less than it would have been to buy one of them new - not to mention the old copies always have much better cover art. So I suppose I&#39;m just curious why anyone would buy a new copy of a book over a used one if the used one is relatively easy to get hold of. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BradleyNeedlehead\"> /u/BradleyNeedlehead </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1kyt0gt/are_there_people_out_there_who_only_buy_new_books/\">[link]</a></sp",
