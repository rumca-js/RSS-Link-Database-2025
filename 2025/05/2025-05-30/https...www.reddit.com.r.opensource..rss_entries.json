So I decided to shop around a bit and found to my dismay that this had become the industry norm, and decided to just forgo code signing on Windows going forward. It seems that Microsoft are getting increasingly strict about non-code signed binaries, and this led to other <a href=\"https://github.com/graphia-app/graphia/issues/84\">issues</a>, so I had a look again.</p> <p>I across a bunch of different solutions, that f",
