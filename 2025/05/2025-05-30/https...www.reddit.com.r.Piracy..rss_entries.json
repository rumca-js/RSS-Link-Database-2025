This is all in the context of WEB-DLs (direct from streaming services):</p> <ul> <li>HDR10:The most basic and widely compatible HDR format. 10-bit video with static metadata (MaxFALL/MaxCLL).

It\u2019s a single-layer, 10-bit HEVC stream with DV metadata interleaved. It does not include an HDR10 or SDR fallback - but that\u2019s fine for streaming since services only serve it to DV-capable devices.</li> <li>Dolby Vision Profile 8.1 (P8.1) - often called \u201cHybrid\u201d:Stores a 10-bit HDR10 base layer with added Dolby Vision metadata.It\u2019s the most widely compatible for local playback (Plex, etc.), since it falls back to HDR10 if DV isn\u2019t supported.How",

This is completely unacceptable. I haven&#39;t seriously pirated since the days of Ares and uTorrent, so I don&#39;t know how to get back into the game. I used to use Bit Torrent and a virtual machine with Windows 7, but I feel like this method isn&#39;t very secure. So, my plan is this: get a cheap computer, install Windows 10 or Linux Mint for piracy, connect it with a KVM switch to my main setup, and connect a router with another gateway to isolate it a bit within my network. What do you think, what else would you do? I&#39;m not even going to install an antivirus on it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nevurianfull\"> /u/Nevurianfull </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1kza5nt/i_need_advice_on_torrenting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>",
