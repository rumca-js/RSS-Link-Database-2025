Yesterday, DeepSeek did a huge update to their R1 model, bringing its performance on par with OpenAI&#39;s o3, o4-mini-high and Google&#39;s Gemini 2.5 Pro. They called the model &#39;DeepSeek-R1-0528&#39; (which was when the model finished training) aka R1 version 2.</p> <p>Back in January, you could actually run the full 720GB sized R1 (non-distilled) model with just an RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM) and now we&#39;re doing the same for this even better model and better tech.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>if you do not have a GPU, no worries</strong>, DeepSeek also released a smaller distilled version of R1-0528 by fine-tuning Qwen3-8B. The small 8B model performs on par with Qwen3-235B so you can try running it instead That model just needs <strong>20GB RAM to run</strong> effectively. You can get 8 tokens/s on 48GB RAM (no GPU) with the Qwen3-8B R1 distilled model.</p> <p>At Unsloth, we studied R1-0528&#39;s architecture, then selective",
