I\u2019m excited about AI, but also worried about the future of web publishing.</p> <p>LLMs learn by reading the open web. But the web only thrives because creators like writers, developers, and podcasters get paid. That happens through ads, paywalls, sponsorships, or a mix of all three. It&#39;s a simple exchange. </p> <p>Creators produce value, and platforms like Google send traffic in return.</p> <p>Now with AI Overviews and AI Mode, Google gives answers right on the search page. Users get what they need without visiting the original sources. When clicks stop, so does traffic. That leads to less income for creators. And without income, the motivation to create disappears.At that point, the web begins to fade. </p> <p>Maybe only a few big publishers will survive by striking deals with AI companies. Everyone else will be pushed out. And AI ends up trained on a past that is no longer growing.</p> <",
