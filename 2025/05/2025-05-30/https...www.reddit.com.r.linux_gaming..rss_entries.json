I also made one user for the administration (SUDOER) and a daily user (NONE SUDOER). After installing Steam and Heroic Games Launcher I tried do install games on my home partition and start them as daily user. This worked very fine on Steam.

I have come to fall in love with the the Linux desktop but I have have spent countless hours testing different games with various versions of proton and I just can&#39;t make my mind up on whether or not the experience is better or worse than windows where gaming is concerned. After some initial tinkering I got a few games running really well, but there are some things I have noticed that seriously detract from my excitement. For example, Doom Eternal was running at a solid 165fps, but i started noticing some weird screen tearing or artifacts when moving around certain textures and I could not replicate these on windows. I also tried Sea of thieves and despite the in game fps counter telling me I was crushing the framerate, the game looked slightly choppy compared to the game running on windows. Are these just the hang-ups with nvidia drivers on linux right ",
