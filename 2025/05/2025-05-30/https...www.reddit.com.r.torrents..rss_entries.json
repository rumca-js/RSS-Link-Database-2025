So many new releases get uploaded 720/1080/1080x265 and 4K? Nobody makes money off these? I use my same three sites, and it never asks me for money, so does someone just do it for the P2P purpose? Someone must have 1000000TB drive for all these. Thanks. If anyone knows. WIth the way streaming is outrageously priced and ads put into streaming, it&#39;s a wonder why people don&#39;t pirate more.
