The current process is customers generate a CSR send it to us, we sign the certificate it and then send it back to them. Ultimately participants don&#39;t want to accept third party certifications and want to use their own private CA to generate and sign the certs to send to us. So ultimately the application needs to be changed to allow certifications from our customers which now puts the risk on us.

I have lots of experience with basic red teaming stuff (I&#39;ve spent tons of time learning things like nmap and practicing sql injection / other exploits on docker container webapps like juice shop), but I have a lot of free time and can&#39;t decide what to study next. I honestly don&#39;t care what I end up doing in the field but like most, I find pentesting to be more fun. Should I focus on learning low level programming so I can reverse engineer stuff and find bugs/exploits? Practice making my own cybersec tools? (All I&#39;ve made is a basic port scanner) Do CTF challenges all day?</p> <p>Basically, <strong>if you had the chance to go back to college age and focus more on practicing specific skills you use a lot now, what would you study?</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",

I understand that we can&#39;t go cowboy but the traditional security and risk processes are crushing and simple chatbots that are approved often aren&#39;t that effective.

That would let our users experiment more with python, scripting, whatever in locked down containers that only communicate out to the prod APIs.
