        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nA report from Windows Central claims that Microsoft might be rethinking its handheld strategy and pulling back development on a first-party Xbox handheld. Instead, they will focus on partnerships with third-party hardware manufacturers (like ASUS) to make an Xbox-licensed handheld. With the Xbox Showcase slated for next Sunday, we might learn more soon. In other news, Ubisoft might be teasing something related to Splinter Cell, after tweeting an image from the third game, Chaos Theory. Back in 2021, Ubisoft confirmed a remake of the original game was coming, but they have not said anything since. The last Splinter Cell game, Blacklist, was released back in 2013. And finally, speaking of remakes, the rumored Persona 4 remake might not bring back the original English voice cast, but no official statement has been made.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Xbox",

        "description": "After playing several hours of the opening of Hell is Us along with some mid-game dungeon crawling, I came away with a clearer idea of developer Rogue Factor's new-weird-influenced take on an action-adventure game that pushes players to mind the finer details of the world and maintain poise during some of the intense engagements. So far, it's a game that makes charting out into a familiar yet deeply alien world feel captivating. Previewed by Alessandro Fillari",

        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nElectronic Arts has cancelled its solo Black Panther game and shuttered the developer, Cliffhanger Games. EA is doing some cost-cutting elsewhere, as well, with around 300 roles affected across multiple teams. It's another blow to an already tumultuous industry where AAA gaming with big IPs usually mean skyrocketing costs. In other news, work on Cyberpunk 2 has officially started over at CD Projekt. The game will be a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, which infamously had a pretty rocky launch on last-gen consoles back in 2020. However, most of the company is still hard at work on The Witcher 4, which does not yet have a release date. And finally, the Switch 2 officially launches in the U.S. next week, but already the console is getting into the hands of the public. A Russian blogger apparently was able to buy one and have it shipped early, but without the Day 1 update, the unit is useless. And over at Target, a whole bunch of Switch 2's were rolled out in a lock-up cage",
