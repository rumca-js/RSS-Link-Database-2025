In chapter 21.1 it says the &quot;the current virtualization mode, denoted V, indicates whether the Hart is currently executing in a guest. When V=1, the Hart is either in virtual S-mode(VS-mode) or in virtual U-mode(VU-mode) atop a guest running in VS-mode&quot; My question is &quot;this V bit&quot; is part of which CSR? how do I monitor this? Or is it implicitly set ? Through out the hypervisor section it says when V=1 something happens, when V=0 something happens.... But what qualifies as V=1? How do I make V=1. Any hint much appreciated.
