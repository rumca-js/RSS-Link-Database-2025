I love a good movie that knows how to balance both the green screen special effects and practical effects. </p> <p>Alien: Romulus effects were superb! And the whole movie was just a great homage to the originals. Bravo to Fede \u00c1lvarez and to everyone who worked on the film!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JollyJulieArt\"> /u/JollyJulieArt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kzbdmf/alien_romulus_use_of_practical_effects_was_so/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1kzbdmf/alien_romulus_use_of_practical_effects_was_so/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It is a biopic that prefers spiritual authenticity over historical accuracy, coming across like a historical text written in antiquity, where the ruler was not just the head of state, but also one that influenced the moral character of his subjects. Where personality and character were more important than facts and figures.</p> <p>This movie invokes the Idea of Ivan quite well, even though it takes a while to get there. Is it propaganda? Maybe, but Eisenstein has bigger balls than Stalin ever realised. He was also far too clever for the Soviets to catch on, at least initial",
