Lately, the days have been blending in with each other because prior to this, I had a desktop with Zorin OS as my daily driver to dual boot with Windows, but after trying to upgrade the RAM, the visuals stopped working and I&#39;ve still yet to figure that mess out. In the meantime, I&#39;ve been thinking of getting another drive and trying it again on my LOQ to dual boot and experiment a little, however I&#39;ve seen very little on its compatibility with Linux. Some people have said there were issues with keyboard commands and sleep mode, others said it was fine now with the latest kernel releases, and one person even recommended a command that could eliminate some of these issues at the cost of some functionality(?). As a Linux noob, this is <em>still</em> ",

Since it&#39;s going to be hidden away with no monitor I&#39;d like to have a decent remote setup. SSH works of course, but it would be nice to have something similar to virt-manager. RDP is an option of course, but since it&#39;s just management I&#39;m after, not actually accessing the VMs and containers, I&#39;d rather just have some nice web-based management GUI.</p> <p>Google gives me a bunch of options, none of which seem to be very supported or widely used. At the same time I can&#39;t imagine I&#39;m alone in wanting this so I assume I&#39;m just bad at Googling :)</p> <p>Does anyone have experience of any nice tools for this?</p> </d",
