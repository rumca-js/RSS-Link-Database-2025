        "description": "If you grew up in the '90s, Boy Meets World was probably a staple of your childhood. Everyone had their favorite character\u2014whether it was Cory, Shawn, or Topanga\u2014but Eric Matthews stood out as the charming, cool older brother we all wanted.  At first, Eric was the guy: funny, smart (enough), smooth with the ladies, and someone you could actually look up to. But somewhere along the way, Eric morphed into... \"Plays With Squirrels.\" \n\nSo, what happened?  How did he go from high school heartthrob to full-on cartoon character?  Was it a case of flanderization? Lazy writing? Or just great comedy that got out of hand?\n\n#boymeetsworld #podmeetsworld #ericmatthews #disney",
