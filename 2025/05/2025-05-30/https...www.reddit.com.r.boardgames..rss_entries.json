It has (relatively) simple mechanics and fun elements like the Intrigue cards to screw players over and Plot quests that add permanent bonuses for the rest of the game. It&#39;s one of my favorite games I own and one of the first euro like games I played, and would like to get more games like it.</p> <p>Cue me looking into getting Dune: Imperium - Uprising due to it being the most recommended version. I recently did the tutorial for the digital version of Dune: Imperium and it scratched that itch for me. My questions are these: If you&#39;ve played or own both, how would you compare the two? Are they comparable in your eyes? How would you compare the ease of teaching/playing Dune: Imperium - Uprising compared to Lords of Waterdeep with the expansions? Would you recommend Dune: Imperium or Uprising if I love Lords of Waterd",
