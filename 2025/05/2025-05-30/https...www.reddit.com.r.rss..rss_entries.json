I am used to just using Newsboat on linux and it&#39;s the easiest thing ever, I just add the RSS links to a text file and then I see them in my reader. For some reason on windows every RSS reader I&#39;ve experimented with is incredibly difficult to use. For example I tried FluentReader and I have to add each source one at a time, and then group them one at a time after adding them. I tried RSS Guard and I can&#39;t even find where to add a source. Am I missing something? Is there an RSS reader that&#39;s simple to use? Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Technology_5151\"> /u/No_Technology_5151 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1kz5zj6/rss_readers_that_are_easy_to_use/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1kz5zj6/rss_readers_that_are_easy_to_use/\">[comments]</a></span",
