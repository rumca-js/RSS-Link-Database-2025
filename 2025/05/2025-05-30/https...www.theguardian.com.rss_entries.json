Join the conversation in the comments</p><p>This past semester I taught <strong>The Voyage Out</strong> \u2013 Virginia Woolf\u2019s first novel, which is less read and talked about than her other books \u2013 to my undergraduates. One of the most interesting things about it is that Richard and Clarissa Dalloway appear as minor characters at the beginning. In each of my rereadings (and for my students who read the novel for the first time), when the Dalloways leave, it feels as though the air pressure of the novel drops for a moment. A reader feels a longing and a wistfulness watching them disappear \u2013 a feeling that Woolf must have shared too. The Dalloways must have haunted her and waited for her to become a more mature writer.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/may/30/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-they-enjoyed-in-may\">Continue reading...</a>",

The past ever present, it&nbsp;underpins but also threatens to undermine the two protagonists. The&nbsp;story opens in present-day Belfast, with Alex, a man caught up in wedding plans. He loves his Ellie, but doesn\u2019t love all the fuss over venues and seating arrangements. The pair are paying a visit to the Manor House, a grand hotel outside the city; Ellie has her heart set on the boathouse by the lake for their reception, and wants Alex to feel the same excitement. This first chapter finds him distracted, though. Impatient with deadlines and invitations, but also&nbsp;keen just to be married; more specifically, to let go of his old life and his old pals from his single days. We\u2019re not told why, only that he is tired of \u201call&nbsp;the pretences and games\u201d and that&nbsp;marriage",

Here\u2019s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, Sky Comedy</strong><strong><br></strong>For all its flaws (desperate attempts to be \u201cwoke\u201d, the annihilation of Miranda\u2019s character), Sex and the City fans can\u2019t help tuning in to this spin-off \u2013 and its third season may finally be getting into its Manolo-heeled stride. This might be hard to believe, what with Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Aidan (John Corbett) resolute on their nonsensical \u201clet\u2019s wait five years to be together\u201d pact. But don\u2019t worry, Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) are rolling their eyes with us. Will they make her see sense? Anyway, there\u2019s still plenty of sex, outfits that turn the streets of NYC into a catwalk, the husky tones of Seema (Sarita Choudhury) and even a naughty night with a nun. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/",
