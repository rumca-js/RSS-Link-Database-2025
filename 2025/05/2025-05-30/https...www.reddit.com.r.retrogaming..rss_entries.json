I hope the mods let this one slide because the game is essentially Streets of Rage 2 but with added features like Rage Relay. My favorite way to play Streets of Rage 2 is via Rage Relay, wherein you assign each character in order. When you play the game, you&#39;ll cycle through each character in the order you selected them. It really feels different for me because rotating through the characters makes me feel like all of them are in this &quot;journey&quot; together.

Hope you all have some ideas for me on this. </p> <p>My father died very suddenly last summer. He was living in the house where I grew up and, to be honest, I&#39;d not thought about what would happen to all my childhood stuff because, well, I didn&#39;t expect my dad to die. I live abroad now, but grew up in the US. This is relevant because all my consoles and electronics are US-style. I played consoles all my life and have sitting in storage now: a Super Nintendo that I am very attached to, a Sega Genesis I am less attached to, and N64 and Game Cube that I can part with, and various old Playstations, Gameboys, etc. I have plenty of games, too, though only really want to hold onto Link to the Past and Secret of Mana. I think I sold my SNES FFs ages ago, but might have a couple somewhere.</p> <p>So... what do I do with all this stuff? Not sure there is a market for any of it. Is there a way of making a US",
