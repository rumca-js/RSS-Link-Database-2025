The reality is that 220-280mbps \u201cPCVR Quality\u201d is what you really need for maximum next gen quality. We are talking 35-45 gb per 20 minutes lol.</p> <p>What does bitrate do? It reduces artifacts, increases sharpness of objects, most especially distant objects (basically increases draw distance), enhanced color / reflections, enhances shadows, and creates a more immersive experience as both eyes see more of the same image. </p> <p>Compression is not linear between both eyes, and when I film at 1800mbps and compress it down to be able to watch on a headset, the amount of artifacts varies between both eyes resulting in reduced immersion and lowered",
