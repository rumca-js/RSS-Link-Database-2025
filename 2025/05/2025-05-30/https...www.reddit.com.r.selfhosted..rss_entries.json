Meaning that my services would not be connected to Pangolin &quot;directly&quot; like &quot;service (homelab) \u2013- Newt (VPN tunnel) --&gt; Pangolin (VPS)&quot; but &quot;service (homelab) --&gt; reverse proxy (homelab) -- Newt --&gt; Pangolin (VPS)&quot;.</p> <p>If there is a reason to do it, how would you expose services &quot;hidden&quot; behind the reverse proxy via Pangolin? I have yet to try Pangolin but I saw you had to enter the IP and port to expose a certain service. Do you just enter the domain name (e.g. service.yourdomain.com on port 443) instead of IP:port (e.g. 192.168.1.15:4321) when using a reverse proxy on your home network? Also wouldn&#39;t the setup with a separate reverse proxy make a mess with SSL certificates and the like if they were handled/generated by both the proxy and Pangolin?",

I&#39;m looking for an easy, open source alternative to Gather to set up a virtual office environment, like a metaverse for the team to interact with. I&#39;ve tried WorkAdventure, but I found it too complicated for me as a junior DevOps. I always had problems with Traefik, the map wouldn&#39;t load properly, and it was super hard to debug. Does anyone know of an open source alternative that&#39;s easier to install and maintain? Ideally something that has good documentation and isn&#39;t too difficult to configure (especially with a reverse proxy like Traefik or Nginx).</p> <p>Thanks a lot for your help! \ud83d\ude4c</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/abarrosjr\"> /u/abarrosjr </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1kz96bk/open_source_and_simple_alternative_to_gather/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1kz96bk/open_source_",

So beautiful.</p> <p>Now coming to my question I have Tailscale setup earlier when my NAS is not connected to VPN and it worked perfectly but now I have setup a VPN on my router and now Tailscale does not seem to work, I see it could be since two VPNs don&#39;t get along, I just need few applications on my NAS to bypass the VPN on myrouter any way I can do that?</p> <p>My setup: I am using an Asus router with VPN fusion to have it use VPN for all connected devices.

For example, Hetzner says that their VPS prices are \u201cmonthly maximums\u201d but that\u2019s a lie. There are overage fees.</p> <p>What\u2019s the solution for this? Does everyone just deal with the risk of a huge bill (DDoS, programmer error, leaking a key, etc. over a long enough time frame anything can happen - especially for beginners)? I bet many don\u2019t even know it\u2019s possible to exceed the \u201cmaximums\u201d but it is!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
