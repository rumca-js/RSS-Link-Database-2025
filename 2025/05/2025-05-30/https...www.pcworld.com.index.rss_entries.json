Is it a good use of your setup if it\u2019s running silent but overheating? Or is it best to fall somewhere in the middle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a big fan of quiet PCs, so it\u2019s no surprise that most of my fan curves are aggressively slanted towards reduced performance for lesser noise levels. But when it comes to water cooling, it\u2019s not just fan noise you need to worry about. The pump can have a noise all of its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a huge source of frustration for me. Fortunately, I found a quick and easy way to calm that noisy whine down. Here\u2019s what I did.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block",
