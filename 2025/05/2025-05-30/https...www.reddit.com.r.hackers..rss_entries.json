Worst part is I kinda fell for it and tapped the &quot;login with facdbook&quot; button but i immediately went out. Then i proceeded to turn on 2 step verification and also changed my password. There was no entry in the login history of my account Thing is he did bluff a few things which kinda scares me that he has gotten what he wanted 1. &quot;Dont login to multiple devices&quot; which was technically true as i was logged in 4 devices 2. Whilst i was talking to him, i was also changing my password. He messaged me &quot;There is no use changing your password&quot;</p> <p>So help me out a little bit. Have i been hacked or am i fooled by some well timed bluffs?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Apprehensive-Act4801\"> /u/Apprehensive-Act4801 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1kz8mb4/so_one_of_my_colleagues_",
