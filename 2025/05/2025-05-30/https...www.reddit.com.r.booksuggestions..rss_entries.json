It&#39;s a fairly new book club so we haven&#39;t had a chance to read something new. We&#39;ve read Twilight, It Ends with Us etc. I&#39;d love to be recommended books that were bad. I totally get that a bad book is quite a subjective thing. I think I&#39;m looking for 1. Books that you think were well marketed but turned out to be overhyped 2. Books that were clearly lesser in quality than the authors previous work 3. Books that glamorise and normalise problematic themes 4. Books that are clearly inspired by other popular books and authors (Game of Thrones, The Hunger Games, Dostoevsky, Bronte etc) but failed terribly. </p> <p>These are just some points off the top of my head. All terrible book recs are welcome! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Charmingbabies\"> /u/Charmingbabies </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",

I have had periods in that timespan where i havent read at all so I definitely havent made books that much of a prioritized hobby yet, but i want to. I have read Fire And Blood (bc of HOTD), The Poppy War, Summernights an then comes the night, and various Cormac McCarthy books. I feel like I havent really hit a particular style of writing that catches me yet. I thought I loved Cormac\u2019s (and I do to some extent ofc), but the more books I attack from him the heavier they seem to get. I thought I loved fantasy for the love of Game of Thrones, but there are things in The Poppy War I just cant seem to take seriously. I would love to be invested in a big series, fantasy or not, but I hesitate to start anything. Can anyone give me some tips? I have considered Dune, The Dark Tower and any Brandon Sanderson series. I havent read ASOIF but I loved political tension and drama in the show.</p> <p>Thank ",
