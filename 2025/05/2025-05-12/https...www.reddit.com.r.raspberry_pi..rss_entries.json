I am looking for an offline library where it supports multiple languages 7-8 languages (english- spanish-french-german-Turkish-..) to take commands like &quot;open arm&quot; ,&quot;close arm&quot;, &quot;wave&quot; for my robotic arm. Upon searching I found mainly vosk and whisper. The problem is none of them is actually accurate. Like for vosk, I have to pronounce a command in an extremely formal pronunciation for the model to catch the word correctly. And for other languages such as Turkish , most of the time it detects nothing while for English it&#39;s not that extreme... I read that a solution is to re train the vosk model using kaldi. I tried that but that seems too complex to be done with nearly no tutorials at all. I have been searching about this for like 2 weeks now with no solution..So I was wondering did I miss any other option",
