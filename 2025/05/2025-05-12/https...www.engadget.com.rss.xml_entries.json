If a teacher has helped you or your kids this year and you want to say thanks, we\u2019ve got some ideas. All year, the Engadget team tests and reviews the best gadgets we can get our hands on \u2014 and we think some of them will make welcome gifts for educators. We\u2019ve included our favorite ereader, a few clever coffee accessories, a handy portable battery, some worthwhile subscription gifts and more. No matter what they\u2019re into, you should be able to find something they\u2019ll appreciate here. Of course, a small gift card and a heartfelt thank you note are worthwhile teacher gifts, too \u2014 especially if you spell all the words right.</p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"f72af3d19e32412b9688720fa4db424e\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ember-Temperature-Control-1-5-hr-Battery/dp/B07NQRM6ML\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"e6f6f9799cd54385a4e0b68b49919bbf\" data-type=\"produ",

But there are a ton of great games outside the Season One offerings too, for when you\u2019ve finished the whole batch or, for newer players, while you\u2019re waiting for new games between the weekly drops. Here, I\u2019ll highlight some of the best games I\u2019ve played so far from the Playdate Catalog. It\u2019ll mainly be split two ways: games that use the crank and games that don\u2019t.
