Each night we read a book together and want to transition to longer, more complex chapter books. Ideally we will also transition the kids to reading a few pages themselves, so something like the Hobbit or Harry Potter would be too complicated (as fun as they are)</p> <p>For example, we\u2019re planning on starting with The Boxcar Children, Amelia Bedilia, Magic Treehouse, etc. </p> <p>Books like Ramona Quimby and Junie B. Jones are the right level of reading, and fun and nostalgic, but looking back, the main characters are a bit of troublemakers and we don\u2019t want to inspire the kids to act like that. So preferably no books with troublemaker main characters. </p> <p>The youngest kiddo is our sensitive one, so we want to be sure we\u2019re not deterring them from reading if the books are a little too scary for now. </p> <p>Lastly, we\u2019d really love a lot",

The basic setup: a podcaster meets this really strange woman who says they share the same birthday. They start recording episodes together... and that\u2019s when things start getting weird. Really weird.</p> <p>I won\u2019t spoil anything, but the way this book messes with truth, memory, and storytelling is wild. Super unsettling but addictive. I read it in two days.</p> <p>If you\u2019re into unreliable narrators, creepy characters, and twisty stories that make you question everything, this one&#39;s worth checking out.</p> <p>Anyone else read it? Curious what people thought of the ending (no spoilers, just vibes).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Krezion\"> /u/Krezion </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kkswa",

Sometimes it&#39;s really trashy.</p> <p>I noticed among the books I&#39;m aware of, I can&#39;t think of any where trans women are treated the same as other women.

I was trying so HARD to read &quot;The Rage of Dragons&quot; and it seems like an excellent book! I just can&#39;t with all the names of new and different things! I try and pronounce them in my head and I just can&#39;t, it pulls me right out. This happens a lot in fantasy I&#39;m reading. I tried MULTIPLE times to read &quot;Dune&quot; but I couldn&#39;t because of the weird names for things.
