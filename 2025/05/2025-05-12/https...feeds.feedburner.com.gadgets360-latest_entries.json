The bone is a galactic center filament that is based at a distance of 26,000 light years from Earth. The fracture would have occurred due to collisions with the neutron star, known as a pulsar, that spins rapidly. The scientists suspect that the fracture will heal naturally",

The pulsar exhibited a 7.02-second pulse period and underwent a significant X-ray brightening event in October 2024. Researchers noted a double-peaked pulse profile and measured a spin-up rate of -0.00033 seconds per day. With luminosity fluctuating between 8.2 and 37 undecillion erg/s, the pulsar remains a compelling subject for future astronomical exploration.",

The discoveries suggest advanced landscaping and military planning under the Ptolemaic dynasty. Living quarters and an even older structure were also found, raising questions about earlier settlements. These findings offer a fresh perspective on ancient Egyptian defense and infrastructure strategies.",

The study also connects T. rex's enormous size to global cooling after a major climatic peak 92 million years ago. As other predators died out, tyrannosaurids and megaraptors seized the ecological opportunity, growing larger and dominating their ecosystems. This research reshapes our understanding of dinosaur evolution and the role of climate change.",
