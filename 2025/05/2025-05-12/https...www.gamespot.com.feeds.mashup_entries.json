This would be a \"Season 5, Season 6 type of end point,\" Moten said. \"We've always known that we're going to take our time with the development of the characters,\" he explained (<a href=\"https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-tv-show-six-five-seasons-of-story-planned/\">via TheGamer</a>).</p><p>It's not immediately clear if Moten is talking about the endpoint of Fallout in general or potentially for his character. In any event, it sounds like there could be a lot more Fallout coming.
