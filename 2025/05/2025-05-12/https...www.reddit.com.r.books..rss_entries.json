I like Raul, but I found Christine to be a pretty weak character/protagonist, as she is extremely naive and that doesn\u2019t really change much throughout the book. Also, the drama / arguing between Raul and Christine gets kind of repetitive. Also, the Persian seems is this random character that just appears at the end of the book. Also (I understand it\u2019s an old book, not trying to judge people of the 1910s by today\u2019s standards), but the Persian does seem to be sort of a racist caricature. </p> <p>Is the musical somehow more focused and present the main characters in a way that is more likable?

I have bought the book a couple of years ago, but now I have only begun to appreciate it. It is an interesting dive into World War I as recounted by a young soldier named Paul B\u00e4umer. The entire novel is told by Paul&#39;s POV and so we get to dive into his thoughts, dreams, feelings and experiences. Paul is a young soldier who joins the Imperial German Army with his friends (Muller, Kropp, Westhus), and he gets to know Stanislaus Katczinsky (Kat) and Tjaden (a jewish soldier). Kat is the oldest in the group (he is 40 years old), and he has some special &quot;sixth&quot; sense that helps him find food, clothing and shelter in the most dire situations. </p> <p>At the beginning of the story, Paul recounts his harsh days in the training camp, where he and his friends are mistreated by an officer nam",

I think there\u2019s a lot of potential to do an other half/parallel novel, similar for instance to Emily St. John Mandel\u2019s <em>The Glass Hotel</em> and <em>Sea of Tranquility</em>.

I tend to persevere through most books, even if I&#39;m not completely vibing them. The frustrating part for me is that when the novel hits particular scenes, I find the writing so compelling, but there is so much meandering that I end up semi-skimming through parts. I&#39;m about 40% of the way through and tempted to put it down in favour of something else. Would love to hear some spoiler-free opinions from people who have read it and if you felt it was worth reading to the end.

Outside, there&#39;s a heavy storm with strong rain but inside the house, it&#39;s comfy, peaceful and the temperature is just right not too cold.

Is there some unsaid writing rule that lesser number of sentences to be used to convey idea irrespective of length of the sentence? Theres an argument that writers want readers to make efforts to understand but what would that achieve and why should reader make effort? What&#39;s been your experience?

There may be a reason why back in the 70\u2019s there was such a huge uptick in these events: lead in the water and the media finding a new darling to report upon: terror in one\u2019s backyard. </p> <p>Given the findings about lead did not come to light until well beyond the publication date of former FBI agent Robert K. Ressler\u2019s memoir (co-written with Tom Shachtman), the latter, the media, is of paramount importance. But even before that\u2014and the crux of the book itself\u2014is getting to the bottom of what turns someone into a serial killer, what we can learn from them, and (of course) how we can prevent this process from happening in the first place.</p> <p>Whoever Fights Monsters almost threw me off at first; it begins almost as if Ressler was simpl",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I love fantasy and science fiction and feel like there\u2019s not a whole lot of LGBTQ series out there. Maybe I\u2019m missing them but\u2026 Anyways I don\u2019t really like urban fantasy that much, but if it\u2019s super well written I can handle it. Examples of things I didn\u2019t like: The entirety of RW&amp;RB. I hated how they used electronics, hated the characters, and the story was SOOOO boring. House of Earth and Blood (SJM): her urban fantasy series. Worst series from her. I didn\u2019t like the straight up \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f scenes and the usage of electronics. Felt dumb. I do not care if it is mlm or wlw or any sort of LGBTQ, I just want a good queer book.
