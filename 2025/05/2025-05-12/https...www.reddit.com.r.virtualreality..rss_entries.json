This is the biggest FOV I have ever seen in a microOLED headset. </p> <p>However, it was an early prototype and in",

However I have a kiddo who benefits from VR distraction during brief medical procedures, which are fairly frequently needed. We&#39;ve been borrowing a friend&#39;s Meta Quest for such times, but it would be helpful to have something we own to use, without over-investing. We have a Nintendo Switch, so I wondered about something like this Maxx Tech VR Headset for Switch:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ebgames.com.au/product/nintendo-switch/305294-maxx-tech-vr-headset-for-switch\">https://www.ebgames.com.au/product/nintendo-switch/305294-maxx-tech-vr-headset-for-switch</a> </p> <p>Has anyone used one similar this with their Switch and can provide feedback on if it&#39;s effective enough to provide robust and immersive distraction for several minutes? </p> <p>Thank you so much! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Petaluna\"> /u/Petaluna </a> <br/>",
