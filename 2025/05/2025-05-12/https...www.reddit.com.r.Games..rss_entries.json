In many ways Halo had overtaken Mario as gaming&#39;s ambassador. It might sound hyperbolic, but it&#39;s not that far from the truth. In the 2008 Guiness World Book of Records gaming edition, Halo was voted as the best gaming franchise ever. However recent Halo games haven&#39;t been king of the hill of the FPS genre as the original trilogy have been.

Two examples of these would be the Silent Hill HD and MGS HD collections. A remake was when the game was remade, often in the graphics, but there were different levels of how much effort they put in the remake.</p> <p>In recent years it feels like the terms definitons have shifted. What would be counted as a remake of yesteryear not get the term remaster, while remakes are those games that would almost be considered reimaginings in the past. RE2 and RE4 are not just basic remakes imo. They are close to reimaginings as they are so much more than just remade graphics.</p> <p>Meanwhile Oblivion, which I consider a remake because they&#39;ve completely remade the graphics, have the &quot;remaster&quot; subtitle.</p> <p>Have the definitions of these terms shifted in recent years?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
