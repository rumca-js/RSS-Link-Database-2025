Back in 2022, my team and I were working on a service which was printing a fairly sizeable amount of logs from a distributed cluster of 20+ hosts: about 2-3 million log messages per hour in total. We were using Graylog, and querying those logs for an hour was taking no more than 1-3 seconds, so it was pretty quick.</p> <p>Infra people hated Graylog though, since it required some annoying maintenance from them, and so at some point the decision was made to switch to Splunk instead. And when Splunk was finally rolled out, I had to find out that it was incredibly, ridiculously slow. Honestly, looking at it, I don&#39;t quite understand how they are even selling it. If you&#39;ve used Splunk, you might know that it has two modes: \u201cSmart\u201d and \u201cFast\u201d. In \u201cSmart\u201d mode, the same query for an hour of logs was taking <em>a few minutes</em>. And in so called \u201cFast\u201d mode, it was taking 30-60s (and that \u201cFast\u201d mode has some other limitations which ma",
