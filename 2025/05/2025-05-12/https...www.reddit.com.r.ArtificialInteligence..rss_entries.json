The most common feedback I get about AI Agents is that they are around a Graduate level (sort of) of output. The hallucination thing seems like a major issue though - something that AI panels &amp; Execs rarely talk or think about.</p> <p>My question is, does AI hallucination happen during automation? (is this even a logical question?) If so, it kind of seems like you are always going to need ops/engineers monitoring.</p> <p>Any non-technical area that higher ups think can be replaced (say HR, like Payroll or Admin) will probably always require tech support right?</p> <p>My general vibe is a lot of the early adopters of AI platforms and cut staff prematurely will ruin or end a lot of Executives careers when they have to hire back in force (or struggle to due to bad rep).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-",

Stuff like Italian cities, coffee shops, etc. the entire thing is AI generated, I assume. We\u2019re curious because it seems like almost every video has this specific clump of butterflies, that really look more like moths or bugs. Also usually a cat, and some steaming coffee. </p> <p>Does anyone know why this happens? Is there an algorithmic reason for it? Are the creators of these videos putting them in manually?</p> <p>I have attached a video for reference!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SaxeMatt\"> /u/SaxeMatt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uyzKdK1fJfg&amp;pp=ygUeUG9zaXRhbm8gc2Vhc2lkZSBjYWZlIGFtYmlhbmNl\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1kkfuta/butter",
