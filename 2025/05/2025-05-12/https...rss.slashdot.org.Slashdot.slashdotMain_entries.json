Autonomous and artificial intelligence-assisted weapons systems are already playing a greater role in conflicts from Ukraine to Gaza. And rising defence spending worldwide promises to provide a further boost for burgeoning AI-assisted military technology.\n \nProgress towards establishing global rules governing their development and use, however, has not kept pace. And internationally binding standards remain virtually non-existent. Since 2014, countries that are part of the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) have been meeting in Geneva to discuss a potential ban fully autonomous systems that operate without meaningful human control and regulate others.

The update has already rolled out to the Google Search app on iOS and is in beta for Android. From the report: It's a subtle change that you might not immediately notice, especially if the main place you see it is on your homescreen. It will be even less noticeable as a tiny browser favicon. It does not appear that Google is refreshing its main six-letter logo today, while it's unclear whether any other product logos are changing. In theory, some of the company's four-color logos, like Chrome or Maps, could pretty easily start bleeding in their sections.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?statu",

        "description": "Apple is weighing price increases for its fall iPhone lineup, a step it is seeking to couple with new features and design changes, according to WSJ, which cited people familiar with the matter. From the report: The company is determined to avoid any scenario in which it appears to attribute price increases to U.S. tariffs on goods from China, where most Apple devices are assembled, the people said. The U.S. and China agreed Monday to suspend most of the tariffs they had imposed on each other in a tit-for-tat trade war.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Apple+Considering+Raising+iPhone+Prices%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fapple.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F12%2F1251211%2F%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter\"><img src=\"https://a.fsdn.com/sd/twitter_icon_large.png\"></a>\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fapple.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F05%2F12%2F1251211%2Fapple-",

        "description": "Evidence is mounting for \"a vast reservoir of liquid water\" on Mars, according to a new article by Australian National University professor Hrvoje Tkal&#196;i&#196; and geophysics associate professor Weijia Sun from the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, announcing their recently published paper. \n\"Using seismic data from NASA's InSight mission, we uncovered evidence that the seismic waves slow down in a layer between 5.4 and 8 kilometres below the surface, which could be because of the presence of liquid water at these depths.\"\n\nMars is covered in traces of ancient bodies of water. But the puzzle of exactly where it all went when the planet turned cold and dry has long intrigued scientists... Billions of years ago, during the Noachian and Hesperian periods (4.1 billion to 3 billion years ago), rivers carved valleys and lakes shimmered. As Mars' magnetic field faded and its atmosphere thinned, most surface water vanished. Some escaped to space, some froze in polar caps, and some ",

        "description": "The United States and China said Monday they reached an agreement to temporarily reduce the tariffs [non-paywalled source] they have imposed on each other in an attempt to defuse the trade war threatening the world's two largest economies. From a report: In a joint statement, the countries said they would suspend their respective tariffs for 90 days while they negotiate. Under the agreement, the United States would reduce the tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from its current 145 percent, while China would lower its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. \n\n\"We concluded that we have a shared interest,\" said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at a news conference in Geneva where U.S. and Chinese officials met over the weekend. \"The consensus from both delegations is that neither side wanted a decoupling,\" he said. The agreement breaks an impasse that had brought trade between China and the United States to a halt. Many American businesses had suspended orders",

The report addresses whether the copyrighted content AI companies use to train their AI models qualifies under the fair use doctrine. AI companies are probably not going to like what they read... \n\nAI execs argue they haven't violated copyright laws because the training falls under fair use. According to the U.S. Copyright Office's new report, however, it's not that simple. \"Although it is not possible to prejudge the result in any particular case, precedent supports the following general observations,\" the office said. \"Various uses of copyrighted works in AI trai",

(Some players say that in response the game's publisher is now even censoring the word \"boycott\" on its official forums and community spaces...)\n\n\nInfinity Nikki players were immediately incensed by a bevy of bugs and general game instability, and made even more angry by several baffling changes to both the story and its monetization structure... Players globally are vowing to stay off the game until Infold Games addresses their concerns, including at least one Infinity Nikki creator who is part of the game's partner program...

[T]he closest hints are probably in Apple patents revealed over the years, like one from 2019 that describes a phone encased in glass that \"forms a continuous loop\" around the device. \n\nApart from a changing iPhone, Gurman describes what sounds like a big year for Apple. He reiterates past reports that the first foldable iPhone should be out by 2027, and that the company's first smart glasses competitor to Meta Ray-Bans will be along that year. So will those rumored camera-equipped AirPods and Apple Watches, he says. Gurman also suggests that Apple's home robot &mdash; a tabletop robot that features \"an AI assistant with its own personality\" &mdash; wi",
