I used OBS to screen-record each chapter and uploaded them to YouTube (channel has bogus name info - nothing identified to me) in the &quot;private&quot; status and did not share with anyone else. As you may guess a few weeks later my manager was notified and I got called into HR who is currently determining the next steps. I violated the terms of service regarding the training content which understandably was copyrighted by the vendor and not permitted for redistribution.</p> <p>Ok my bad and I accept the consequences, but any idea how the vendor was notified? Is anyone familiar with web-based training content and/or videos having some type of invisible watermark that identifies me (as my real name is registered with the vendor) and then YouTube has something to read that and kick off a notification workflow to the vendor?",

I don&#39;t know what changed in the 10s to come to where we are now. Maybe fake solutions like DRM to create a false sense of freedom, general lack of interest by the consumer class, or just the massive uphill battle against entrenched Entertainment and Pharma industries who benefit financially from anti-piracy and maintaining their monopolies.</p> <p>It seems the best bet nowadays is soft reform, pirate parties globally ",

I have been a downloader and seeder my entire life this is my first time ever doing something like this and I want to share it for people to pirate but I have no idea where to go, my most used sites as a consumer have some sort of limitation on uploads and I&#39;m just wondering where to go for this.</p> <p>Just wanted to ask this here in case someone can help If this counts as self promotion, then i&#39;m sorry and I understand if it gets removed.</p> <p>Edit: Also, even If I do something, I might be good at editing itself,. But I have no experience in compressing / encoding. And the file ended up being 19gb. Is there a good guide somewhere for how to compress files?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",
