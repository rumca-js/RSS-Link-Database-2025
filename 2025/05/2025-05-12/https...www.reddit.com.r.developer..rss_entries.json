The idea might be solid. But the way it\u2019s framed usually isn\u2019t. If you want buy-in, especially from product or execs, you need to speak their language: which is business value.</p> <p>Here&#39;s what has worked for me,<a href=\"https://shipvalue.substack.com/p/making-your-case\"> I also wrote an entire post about it here</a>:</p> <p><strong>1.
