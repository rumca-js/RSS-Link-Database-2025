My father is a uni professor so he wants me to have a bachelors in Cs. For what I have read and researched, a uni degree isn&#39;t a essential for such a career. When I explored the contents of the degree, there are very few courses realted to cyber.</p> <p>Its a top uni in Pakistan and anyone here who completes it almost guaranteed a high paying job. With that said, I don&#39;t need any certs but only hands on polished skills with much short time as possible. Now I already know that the major fundamentals I want to learn are networking, python, bash, Linux, active dir. Operating systems would be mainly taught at the uni so I don&#39;t want to do that for now. First I decided to grab ccna but now with this context, is it an essential?
