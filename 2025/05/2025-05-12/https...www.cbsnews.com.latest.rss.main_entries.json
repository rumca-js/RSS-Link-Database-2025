Chris Van Hollen of Maryland tells \"Face the Nation\" that the Biden administration has set a \"very low bar for what's acceptable\" from Israel in a report on that country's use of U.S. weapons in the war against Hamas, and Zahra Skaik, a 44-year-old Palestinian woman living in Gaza City, escaped the war thanks to her sons \u2013 one of whom is an infantryman in the U.S. army. Margaret Brennan sat down with Skaik recently as she described how she left Gaza with nothing but a small backpack and the same clothes she had been wearing since the war began.",
