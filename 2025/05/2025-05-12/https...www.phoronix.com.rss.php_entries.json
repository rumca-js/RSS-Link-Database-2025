        "description": "We finally have AMD's Strix Halo in the lab for benchmarking! HP has kindly sent over their ZBook Ultra 14-inch G1a mobile workstation: it's a beast being powered by the top-end AMD Ryzen AI Max+ PRO 395 SoC with 16 cores / 32 threads and powerful integrated Radeon 8060S graphics, 128GB of system memory, a nice 14-inch 2.8K display, and other top-end features to provide a dominating laptop powerhouse. In today's article are the very initial benchmarks of the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ PRO 395 Strix Halo SoC under Linux with a focus on the CPU capabilities: a separate article also out today is looking at the AMD Radeon 8060S graphics on Linux.",

But that's only half the magic of Strix Halo, with the other aspect being the very capable integrated RDNA 3.5 graphics with unified memory support. Given this being an equally interesting topic for Linux users considering a Strix Halo laptop or desktop, this article is centered around the integrated Radeon 8060S graphics support and performance under Linux.",
