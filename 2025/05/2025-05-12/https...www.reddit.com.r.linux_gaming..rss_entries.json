Steam reads it as PS5 controller and all the inputs works just fine to navigate big picture mode. Yet, as I launch any game, only the trackpad works and behave as a mouse.</p> <p>Couldn&#39;t find any specific discussion about it, but tried all the troubleshooting heads up about controllers in Linux without fortune. Here is a list of test I&#39;ve made:</p> <ul> <li>Turn on/off Steam input</li> <li>Turn on/off Playstation controller support</li> <li>Force different Proton versions (9/10/experimental)</li> <li>Check different games (Hollow knight / Drg survivors / Hades)</li> <li>Launch games from big picture mode</li> </ul> <p>But the issue unfortunately persists. What can I do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",

I managed to make it work with the Xbox Wireless Adapter with XONE package, but I can&#39;t use the dongle unfortunately, because it has lower range than the BT signal. I have the &quot;wake from usb&quot; enabled in BIOS as well as turned on the &quot;power to the usb while sleep&quot; so in theory it should be possible as the PC recognizes the PCIe card as USB with &quot;lsusb&quot; command right ? </p> <p>Nobara 42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kikolka\"> /u/kikolka </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1kkrrbf/wake_up_through_pcie_bt_card_xbox_controller/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://",

I decided on a small form factor build using AMD Ryzen 9 9900X, 64 GB RAM, and no GPU for now (no plan of gaming and currently not enough value to get a GPU solely for local LLMs). </p> <p>For the motherboard I thought of going for <code>ASRock B650E PG-ITX WiFi</code> BUT I randomly found a YT video showcasing a SFF build, which used <code>Asus ROG Strix X870-I Gaming WiFi</code>.<br/> The build was very cool which made me think of going for the Asus instead of the ASRock now.</p> <p>Do you guys have any insights into why choose one over the other, pros/cons, etc?</p> <p>It seems to me that Asus is a bit more future proof with also more connectivity but maybe coil whine while the ASRock&#39;s fan seems to be loud but can be turned down in the BIOS.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nice-Engine-6537\"> /u/Nice-Engi",

But, Eve Online was supported on Linux for a long time and one of the developers supposedly likes to game on Linux (and worked on a Linux-friendly launcher or something like that). </p> <p>So, it got me thinking: shouldn&#39;t we be supporting the gaming companies that support us? </p> <p>I know the list of mmorpgs that natively run on Linux is low, but playing games that do not have native Linux support kind of feels like supporting a company that does not want to support us (or worse, does not want us there in ",
