It was directed by Bennett Miller and adapted by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin. </p> <p>I have seen the movie over 15 times. It took me a while to figure out why I am such a huge fan. Turns out quite a few people on reddit feel the same way. But I think most of the reviews actually miss why the movie resonates so deeply. Here is my theory. It comes down to four things: </p> <p><strong>1. It uses the subject of Baseball to show society&#39;s evolution into the digial/computer age.</strong> Of course, this is never mentioned in the film. But the real underlying story is how computing technology will eventually disrupt our old way of life. And how some people will kick and scream to stop it, but it is inevitable. Those who identify it first will have the edge. Billy Beane and Pete represent the digital, new way of thinking. The manager and scouts represent the analog age. In a sense it is the most important issue of our time,",

Long after everyone else has moved on, I&#39;m still thinking about all the elements that go together to make this one-scene masterpiece. It&#39;s not just her performance (though that&#39;s the major part). It&#39;s how Batman and Catwoman and Jim Gordon are talking to her through a truck window, and at a lower height too. Just the absurdity of standing around outside a semi, looking up, listening to someone poignantly die. I think Cotillard understood the assignment: this is camp, so that&#39;s how I&#39;m playing it.
