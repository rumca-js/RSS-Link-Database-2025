I used to run a small software consultancy business, which ate a lot of my time - prior to that, I&#39;ve worked with startups from 3-men bands, to fintech scale-ups. </p> <p>Up until now, I&#39;ve always had a side project on, but now? Nothing - and I&#39;ve got that itch to get back into the ring and create something. Sure, I&#39;m not looking for the next billion pound idea, but I want to get my hands dirty again! </p> <p>I&#39;m a software developer, ex visual designer, with around about 10 years in the industry. I&#39;m looking to build something - but ideally, I&#39;d like to focus on the software, avoiding marketing, outreach, etc. I know what I&#39;m good at - so I&#39;m looking for someone who&#39;s good at the stuff I&#39;m not!</p> <p>I&#39;m UK-based, but happy to get to know and work with people from all over the world, Ideally",

I\u2019ve been lifting for a few years, and I noticed a lot of beginners and intermediate lifters (myself included at one point) struggled with staying consistent or knowing what to do in the gym when training 3 days a week. </p> <p>So I built a simple, repeatable 3-Day full body strength program that focuses on: </p> <p>\u2022Progression (not just random workouts)</p> <p>\u2022Core lifts with alternatives (dumbbells, machines, etc.)</p> <p>\u2022Build it warm ups and structure </p> <p>\u2022Weekly progression tips to avoid plateaus </p> <p>It\u2019s beginner friendly, but solid enough for intermediate lifters to benefit as well.

I originally built it just for myself after getting overwhelmed by pretty much every reminder app out there. They all had too many features, too many lists, and left me feeling more behind than productive.</p> <p>Remnio is super simple. You just type what you want to remember, pick today or tomorrow, and it sends reminders at random points during your day. No due times, no overdue lists, and nothing carries over.

I wasn\u2019t planning to release it at first, but it\u2019s worked so well for me that I figured I\u2019d put it out there and see what others think.</p> <p>Does this sound like something that would actually help you?
