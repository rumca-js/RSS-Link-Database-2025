It can have towns and sci-fi elements);</li> <li>Pixelated chibi graphics (Chrono Trigger, Lunar, Star Ocean, Atelier Iris\u2026);</li> <li>PSX or earlier (NES, SNES, Sega stuff, GBC, GBA\u2026);</li> <li>Fast, few and easy combat (more focus on story and exploration. I don&#39;t mind if the game is one big tutorial);</li> <li>More emotional story (little to no comedy. A beautiful romance is encouraged);</li> </ul> <p>Anyway, a very calming experience to roam through beautiful places, read the story and combat a little bit. Low effort, comfort game.</p> <p>Example: Dragon Quest V</p> <p>Thank you all in advance!</p> <p>(You can even recommend the games I&#39;ve mentioned, I don&#39;t have a problem with that)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",
