I&#39;ve never had it before that I unzip an image over several zip files, so I was overwhelmed at first. Actually, I should have read it better. I was able to start the system well and also Internet via cable works. The WLAN stick from me could also be set up, so far so good.</p> <p>My bigger problem is that I had now tried to install Fedora (I didn&#39;t think anything would break). I had looked to the instructions and made the settings on Uboot (probably not quite right). Now Uboot has crashed and I can&#39;t restart the computer, no matter which image I use (Neither Rockos or Fedora can boot via the SD card). I&#39;m really clumsy and don&#39;t know if I can heal it again.</p> <p>I have now seen that I could save the whole thing over a UART/USB cable.
