It may take much longer to decide hostages as a result, but you could probably tell players to dedicate the last minute or 2 to decide.</p> <p>When I thought about this idea, I thought about how the last round loses a bit with the removal of the Leader. The Leader could mark someone as a hostage with no agreement from the rest of the room and there would be no counter to this. Without the Leader, you won&#39;t get this last-second &quot;blindside&quot; unless half the room is thinking about it.</p> <p>But maybe that rarely happens.

Very thematic, heavily focused on storytelling, light on mechanics.</p> <p>+ Thanks to huge number of event, equipment, ally and (most importantly) encounter cards, which can thematically interact with each other, during session you will often see various mini-stories. They are generated by game situations and do not require much imagination to unfold (and they usually fit overall narrative of opposing Ancient One), since EH is so thematic. This storytelling is the best part of EH. For example, in one of our sessions ex-cultist who gathered a plenty of spells, some in Silver Twilight lodge, was attacked by shoggoth - a reckoning effect for having a debt. Clearly it was sent by lodge; very thematic that mystical order decided to punish a rogue ex-mage :-)</p> <p>+/- You can feel some Lovecraftian atmosphere.

I said look into Print and Play Games, but he&#39;s hesitant for some reason. Does anyone have reccommendations about making a board game/finding someone that would mass print and make them? He doesn&#39;t have a price point, yet, since he&#39;s been looking and not deciding. </p> <p>I think he has some grandious idea about making it a much larger thing, like building your own team and playing around a diamond with weird weapons, rolls like DnD for hits, etc. &quot;Don&#39;t give it all away, asshole&quot;. </p> <p>Any advice would be nice.
