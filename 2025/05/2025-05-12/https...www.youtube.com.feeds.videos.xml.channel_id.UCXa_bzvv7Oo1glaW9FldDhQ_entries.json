        "description": "The DOOM series is full of action and over the top moments, and a Slayer who never backs down from his purpose. In this video, we\u2019re diving deep and covering everything you need to know about DOOM's storyline. \n\nThis video is a full recap of the stories from DOOM 1, DOOM 2, DOOM 64, DOOM (2016), and DOOM Eternal, all of which we covered previously. But wait, there's more! As a bonus, we\u2019ve also included the story of DOOM 3. \n\nThat makes this video the definitive DOOM story breakdown. So, here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to do this: first, we\u2019ll cover the original trilogy: DOOM 1, DOOM 2, and DOOM 64. Then we\u2019ll move on to the recent games with DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal. \n\nAnd finally, we\u2019ll focus on DOOM 3 as a bonus addition to wrap up the video.",

        "description": "After the fantastic Elden Ring and its excellent expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, Elden Ring Nightreign probably wasn't what players expected from FromSoftware. It retains the same action RPG tenets and open-world exploration but in a co-op multiplayer-focused format with dashes of rogue-like and battle royale.\n\nAs the Nightfarers, players drop into Limveld and defeat enemies to become stronger. They can explore the surrounding area for weapons and tackle fortresses to obtain maps that reveal more information. Eventually, the area shrinks, and you need to tackle a boss. Survive the night, and it's on to the next, until the final confrontation against the Nightlord.\n\nWith eight playable characters, each with dedicated kits, Relics that you can equip before runs to improve stats and skills, and a focus on team play (though you can still go in solo), Elden Ring Nightreign is unlike anything seen from the developer. \n\nIt's out on May 30th for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, and PC -",

        "description": "More than a year after offering the world its first ever look at the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, Rockstar Games recently released a second trailer for the upcoming open world crime epic- and it\u2019s fair to say that the game is continuing to look incredibly promising. \n\nThe newest trailer for GTA 6 perfectly struck a balance between showing exciting new footage and still holding enough back to maintain a level of mystery- though that, of course, means that the wait for the next trailer is going to feel excruciatingly long. \n\nNot only is GTA 6 still a little over a year away, Rockstar is also a company that historically likes to do things on its own terms, which means trailer 3 is likely a ways off.",
