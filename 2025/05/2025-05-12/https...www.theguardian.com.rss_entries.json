This \u201cunique experiment\u201d sees 12 virgins, mostly in their 20s (one is 30), heading off to a \u201cradical retreat\u201d on a Mediterranean island, where a team of professional sexperts will work on and guide them through some of their issues with intimacy. It looks like a reality show, but it is apparent from the beginning that those taking part are not reality show contestants. Nor is there a prize, as such, though some would like to have sex by the end of the experience.</p><p>The first and most obvious question is whether sticking people on telly to pore over their innermost fears and psychological struggles will prove to be in any of their best interests.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/may/12/virgin-island",
