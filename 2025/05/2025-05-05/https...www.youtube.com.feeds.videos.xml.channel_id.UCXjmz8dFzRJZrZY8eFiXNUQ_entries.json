        "description": "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is a 90s sitcom legend, launching Will Smith\u2019s acting career and redefining the genre with its perfect blend of humor, heart, and cultural impact. But did you know that a young Kevin Hart once starred in a short-lived, Fresh Prince-style sitcom that completely flopped?    \n\nThe Big House was a 2004 sitcom that tried to flip the Fresh Prince formula upside down, but despite Hart\u2019s star power, the show was cancelled before its first season even finished airing.\n\n#kevinhart #willsmith #freshprinceofbelair #sitcom",
