If you\u2019re the secret criminal\u2026 suddenly your love of folk music and inability to keep plants alive has the power to incriminate you! You and your fellow players take turns in the hot seat to figure out Whodunnit. Suspectives is one of five brand new games coming this fall in The Jackbox Party Pack 11.\n\n#ps5 #ps5games #ps4 #ps4games #jackbox #jackboxpartypack11",
