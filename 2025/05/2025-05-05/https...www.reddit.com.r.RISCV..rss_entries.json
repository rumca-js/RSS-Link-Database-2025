But I regularily check in to this sub to see if there are new chips or boards being released - which doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p> <p>My main usecase is a homelab; little server things and just trying to see how much I can run on them compared to my arm64 fleet. :) The VF2 was super close actually; aside from k3s&#39; build being a little wonky and some containers missing back then, it actually compiled and ran...somewhat. Recent new releases also introduced RISC-V images, so I would love to use a few of them.</p> <p>So what are some boards for this use? I have a plain rack shelf where some SBCs just live, cluttered in a 2U space. There&#39;s still room.</p> <p>Any places aside from here where I could look out for RISC-V news perhaps?</p> <p>Thanks!</p>",
