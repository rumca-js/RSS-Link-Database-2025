Anthropic\u2019s Claude Code is a similar software but only using Claude.</p> <p>I have tried both and they are amazing to use. They\u2019re both open-source and backed by their respective companies, but I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s something equally powerful that\u2019s maintained by a broader community. Ideally, it would be API-agnostic, plugging into OpenAI, Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and even local Llama models.</p> <p>Has anyone come across a community-supported CLI agent that supports multiple backends and stays up-to-date with the latest models? I\u2019m hoping for something that offers the same level of code introspection and execution, but with the flexibility to switch between LLM API providers or self-hosted Llama models.</p> <p>By having a community at the helm, I feel like there could be an even better product than what bot",
