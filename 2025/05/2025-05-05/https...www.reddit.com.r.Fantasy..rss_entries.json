Anything with shapeshifters (especially if they&#39;re women) or dragons is a massive plus. I&#39;m not too big on romantasy if the relationship starts out toxic (but I do love a hate read). Huge plus if there&#39;s lgbtq+ representation. Also please no YA. While there&#39;s nothing wrong with liking it, I&#39;ve long since grown out of it.</p> <p>For fantasy books I&#39;ve liked in the past:</p> <p>-Shadow of the leviathan series (no spoilers for book 2!

So my entry to fantasy that I actually like has been Fantasy Romance (strongly disliked Harry Potter &amp; other fantasy as a kid). </p> <p>But honestly there&#39;s a lot of times I could do without the spice/smut and I&#39;d enjoy the book just as much (or more!). So, I&#39;m wondering if I need to venture into the fantasy genre more - with low or no romance. </p> <p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve liked:</p> <p>\u2764\ufe0f Kindred&#39;s Curse - I like to world building and magic system a lot \u2764\ufe0f Phantasma - I liked the paranormal aspect, the challenges \u2764\ufe0f Nocticadia - I like the dark academia setting \u2764\ufe0f Scholomance (Novik) - I also like the academic setting, characters, magic system, but this was a bit too YA for me in terms of the whole teens running around saving the world with little to no adult supervision plot \u2764\ufe0f Fourth Wing - school setting (sensing a theme), I like the dragons (and I was surprised I would), and I like that there&#39;s history/family lore ",
