Throughout my experience, I&#39;ve felt the need for a convenient way to organize my subdomain enumeration scans and screenshots. This inspired me to create SubAnalyzer.</p> <p>This is a tool to make the process of finding subdomains easier when doing pentests or bug bounty hunting. It will identify subdomains and take screenshots of available web sites.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently looking for testers to try out the platform. In exchange for valuable feedback such as you experience with the tool, any issues you encounter or feature suggestions, I would be happy to give a free 3-month subscription to everyone willing to help out.</p> <p>If you&#39;re interested send me a PM and I&#39;ll set you up with access right away. You only have to create an account (by signing in with Google) and send me the e-mail you used when registering.</p> <p>Your feedback will be extrem",
