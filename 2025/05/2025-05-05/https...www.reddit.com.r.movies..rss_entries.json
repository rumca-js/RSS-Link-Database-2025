He falls apparently unconscious, but rather than ensuring he is actually dead, she hits him in the back with the butt end of the rifle twice, and the two drive off in one of his vehicles. This in and of itself is absurd.</p> <p>To add insult to injury, the two women soon reach a cliff, and instead of trying to steer a different direction and avert their tormentor (he is now pursuing them in another car), they end up getting out and pushing the fucking car over the cliff\u2014mind yo",

For instance, The Substance shows Demi Moore literally giving birth to her younger self through her back. She points out The Brutalist for visualizing its metaphors too explicitly: immigrants&#39; lives being depicted as literally turned upside down and showing the American Dream as something that, &quot;literally fucks you.&quot; Did anyone else read it and just curious about thoughts about whether they feel that movies are spelling out symbolism instead of trusting the audience&#39;s intelligence.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/today_okay\"> /u/today_okay </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http",

All the sacrifices she&#39;s made (and dad) raising and protecting us, all that time passed and how fleeting it all is.

The scene when he punches his wife in the face made my burst out laughing. I also started chuckling at the Snakes scene when the hyperactive piano music plays and the whole direction is just telling the cast to run around the house screaming in a failed attempt to make the audience feel panicked.</p> <p>But what I actually love about it is how nice the characterization is. The characters do feel kind of relatable. The plot plays on the dad sounding like he&#39;s becoming obsessed with the crook, while the wife is too trusting in other people to rule him out yet.
