I did 2 long tests after i bought him, one with Data Lifeguard Diagnostic and one with Victoria. Both were successful with no errors. Now and then , especially at night time and for several minutes, it keeps doing the noise that you can hear in the video, which i recorded this morning. Because my pc is in my bedroom, it woke me up at 6:00 am. At the time of the noise , a movie from that HDD played (helps me sleep). When i stopped it, noise continued. All the files were accessible and no matter what i did noise didn&#39;t stop. It only stopped when i shut down the pc. I immediately started it and no noise. What do you think? Head failure incoming? Anyone with the same disk and similar noise?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VaggosX\"> /u/VaggosX </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/s",
