Just as it says in the headline, I run a retail store in my town and I&#39;m having issues with people renting computers/Playstations from us and then trying to steal them. There&#39;s a legal process we can go through but it takes up to 4 months at least and by that time the thief could&#39;ve moved off where we&#39;d have no clue how to find them. Honestly, it&#39;s getting to the point that it&#39;s affecting my pay check and is very frustrating. I really am not very pc literate and didn&#39;t know who else to ask, so i figured I&#39;d come ask some hackers since you all do this stuff for fun lol. So my question is, is it possible to set these devices up to where I can activate/deactivate them at will and is there any way to shut down the pcs that are already stolen? The way I figure it, these people would be less likely to want to risk going to court for embezzlement if they couldn&#39;t even use the system anyways. </p> </div><!-- SC_O",
