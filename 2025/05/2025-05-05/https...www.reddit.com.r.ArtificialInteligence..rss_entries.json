The academic year is over and the instructor made an announcement that the grades will be posted tonight with the exception of students who have been flagged for using AI. I am not the brightest student, passed the exams by the skin of my teeth and also barely scraped by with the assignments so I think it&#39;s safe to say I am pretty consistent with my poor coding abilities. I am an extremely anxious person so I put my assignments (along with my comments) on the chatgpt ai detector and it said that some of my programs are 95% AI made, including some of the comments??? Can someone please tell me this is inaccurate I am literally freaking out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/imbarelyactive\"> /u/imbarelyactive </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1kffbda/academic_flag_for_ai_usage/\">[link]</a><",

Right now, I have it running with just a basic stuff. I used gpt4all mistral, becoz its basic and light weight, however I set it up in WSL and have the external plugged in in powershell so there are some issues, but its fixed with .bat file. Its slow, very very slow. I was thinking maybe i could have the gpt4all package as a global package within the external drive to avoid setting up a virtual environment, and just run the .py file, but still needs to run within the terminal with powershell. Another thought is to use a framework like flask/fastapi to host it locally and give the burden to the app instead? Would that work? But I guess it still the type of external I am using since HDD is slow.</p> <p>Any thoughts? I just trying",
