I don&#39;t remember much of it because I didn&#39;t really play it myself, but I feel like the story was the player character had like been turned into a troll/goblin or some other such short greenish creature, and I remember the early gameplay being in like a household of other such characters, all very fantasy and very 90s I suppose!
