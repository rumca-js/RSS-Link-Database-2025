There&#39;s one *major* issue: I DO NOT WANT WINDOWS11!! I genuinely think that the new Windows is really bad. I am afraid that the AI features which I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll eventually make every win11 user to have, will make the os nearly unusable. At least down the line.</p> <p>So Linux it is. But I am still unsure how certain parts work together with Linux.

After installation of Linux Mint on my current computer, I noticed that after installation of minecraft it doesn&#39;t perform as well as on Windows 10. I thought it could be due to some settings being off compared to Windows or maybe because of lack of optimization mods. I changed settings to similar ones I used on Windows and also I installed performance mod: Sodium which I also used on Windows 10. Difference is, that the game still &quot;feels&quot; laggy. I see that mobs in game respond to surrounding with delay (maybe due to some internal server delay - I play singleplayer mainly) and I experience major lag spikes when moving around world and loading new chunks with potential mobs in them.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know what I could do in this moment.

However, I noticed that my root partition of 20GB is apparently not enough and is on the brink of filling up. To resize it, I need to go boot through a USB drive and mess with the partitions to increase the size of the root partition. This is from what I have read pretty complex and a pretty big pain in the ass, especially as over time the root partition gets full and has to be resized again.</p> <p>Now at my workplace, our PC drives are set up with LVM so that we can easily resize our partitions on the fly. But, I have also heard that CachyOS (which I have heard a lot here use) uses a filesystem called BTRFS which also includes a way to easily resize partitions.</p> <p>I wanna know if you guys can provide some insight in this issue &amp; some recommendation on how to move forward. I am fine with reinstalling my current OS (Arch Linux) or go with CachyOS.</p> ",

I&#39;ve got this issue where Monster Hunter Wilds freezes for about ~4 seconds (*just* the game, everything else is still running) and then continues on. It happens at least once per session - it was much worse when I was on Proton 9.0-4. I played around with using experimental, hotfix, and the 10.0 beta, but they were all about the same with 1 freeze per session. Normally I&#39;d throw up my hands and say it is what it is, but if I&#39;m in multiplayer these freezes make me get kicked out of the session, so it&#39;s kind of annoying. I&#39;ve had this machine running Windows (till about 2 days ago) and encountered no issues, so I&#39;m pretty certain it&#39;s not my hardware. People on protonDB also seem to have got it working with very similar hardware.</p> <p>I&#39;m running Hyprland with Arch, 7800XT with a 5700x3D. Game&#39;s on an SSD. I&#39;m using mesa 25.0.5 installed via pacman. On Arc",
