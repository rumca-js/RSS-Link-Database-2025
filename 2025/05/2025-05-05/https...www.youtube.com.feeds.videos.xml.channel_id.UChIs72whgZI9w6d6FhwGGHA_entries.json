In this video, we'll talk about the System76 ARM system that Wendell brought with its 128 cores and alternative to x86 options on the market. Fittingly, we also venture into the topic of Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA and their ARM or x86 ventures.\n\nFind Level1 Techs here: https://www.youtube.com/c/level1techs (we recently joined them for a video!)\nWatch our PCIE is the Future video with Wendell here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fz3P41emo8\nWatch Part 4 of our old \"Is Intel Actually Screwed?\" series here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGd6Dsm_lo\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
