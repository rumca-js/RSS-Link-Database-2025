Shot a few months prior to Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Elwira Niewiera and Piotr Roso\u0142owski\u2019s documentary probes this thorny question with a searing intimacy. The film observes an alternative production of Hamlet, which brings together a group of Ukrainian performers from all walks of life and as volatile emotions are spilled on to the stage, performance becomes a conduit for personal catharsis as well as artistic expression.</p><p>In the film, scenes of the rehearsal process are interspersed with revelations about the actors\u2019 backgrounds. Many of them are soldiers on the frontline: Slavik and Katia, for example, have endured the bloodshed of combat as well as the horrors of captivity.

It is such hard work to win a title over a 38-game season, with the race often going down to the wire. Arne Slot had four matches to spare and used the trip to Stamford Bridge to give first league starts of the season to Wataru Endo and Harvey Elliott. The former has been used frequently as a late sub while the latter is often brought on to make an attacking impact, but the form of their teammates and Elliott\u2019s long-term injury have limited chances under Slot. Jarell Quansah was given a rare start and Federico Chiesa was permitted a fifth league game which qualifies him for a medal.
