Most &quot;prime&quot; distros that others are forked from (Arch, Debian etc.) are by default just the kernel with basic system tools and the rest is only there because you decided to put it there. The entire GUI can be changed as one wishes, with diverse options to choose from. That&#39;s unlike Windows, where modifying and taking away one component may cause the chain reaction and collapse the entire thing.</p> <p>Trivial customizations like the boot splash animation, login screen or a widget style are pretty difficult to change on Windows and it requires third-party tools that might contain malware, be paid or actually be a sham. In Linux, such stuff can be easily changed with either a few commands or GUI tools supplied with the DE. And those options are pretty straightforward, so breaking something isn&#39;t really an issue.

I tried Linux between 2010 and 2014, but it never felt comfortable, too many quirks, time &quot;wasted&quot; on maintenance, missing features or software, and unstable drivers (I remember Nouveau crashing constantly). In the end, it felt like I was forcing myself to use it for no real reason, especially since Windows just worked.</p> <p>Recently, though, Windows 11 started giving me trouble: losing performance, strange bugs (like Explorer lagging when renaming files on multiple computers), ads to disable after installation, Copilot installed without my permission, telemetry, and a general sense of bloat and unwanted changes over time.</p> <p>I even considered switching to macOS with a Mac Mini M4 (600\u20ac) for a more comfortable, stable platform (also because I al",
