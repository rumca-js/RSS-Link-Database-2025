I think this intro was <strong><em>critical</em></strong> to both my understanding and my enjoyment of the work that followed. He gave a few insights which likened a couple of the characters in the book to himself and his own family members, and a few of his personal anecdotes about life overall really resonated with me in a way that perfectly kicked off the story from the very beginning.

Talking about the essay by Susan Sontag the other day in class, I was confused by the last sentence of the following paragraph: To preen for a woman can never be just a pleasure. It is also a duty. It is her work. If a woman does real work and even if she has clambered up to a leading position in politics, law, medicine, business or whatever, she is always under pressure to confess that she still works at being attractive. But in so far as she is keeping up as one of the fair sex, she brings under suspicion her very capacity to be objective, professional, authoritative, thoughtful. Damned if they do-women are; damned if they don\u2019t. Please shed some light on the last sentence.
