It\u2019s still early, still buggy in places, and the chat system isn\u2019t finished yet, but this week something happened that really reminded me why I started making games.</p> <p>I logged in for testing and noticed another player walking around. I couldn\u2019t chat with them (not yet anyway), but they kept following me, waving their sword, and kind of signaling with their movement. I realized they weren\u2019t just exploring randomly. They <em>knew the game</em>. They had found it on Reddit, remembered the name, and came back to check in.</p> <p>Otherworld hit over 1,000 players this week and briefly reached number five on IndieDB, which totally caught me off guard. But honestly, seeing a single player show up and silently signal \u201chey, I know this\u201d felt even more real than the metrics.</p> <p>If you\u2019re building something and wondering if it matters \u2014 it does.
