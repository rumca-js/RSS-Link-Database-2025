I\u2019ve been using it for years, and the last time I can recall having virus problems on my PC was well over a decade ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, looking around for confirmation of this long-held belief quickly turns up an alternate universe, full of experts who insist that everyone should be paying for antivirus software. This advice comes not just from the companies that sell antivirus suites, but from reputable sites that perform antivirus software reviews. <",
