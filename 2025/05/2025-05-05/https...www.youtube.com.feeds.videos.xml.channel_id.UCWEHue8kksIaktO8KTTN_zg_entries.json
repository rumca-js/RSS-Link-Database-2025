These two concepts are a bit at odds with each other. \n\nSingle sign on, such as Google Login, Facebook Login, Github Login, has made it far more seamless for users to securely access your project but....\n\nMost web frameworks are not designed to work with each other _and_ each others' users seamlessly.\n\nLet's say you built a Django application and have Django AllAuth. That's is an awesome start. One I have recommended many times.\n\nNow you want a more powerful frontend. Say React or Vue. How about a new OAuth provider that isn't supported by All Auth. What if you want to leave Django altogether for FastAPI or Flask? Or CrewAI? \n\nHow to do you migrate users? How do you migrate securely? What if you change your mind after a few weeks of using any other backend? What do you do then? \n\nThis is where Clerk comes in.\n\nClerk is a platform for User",
