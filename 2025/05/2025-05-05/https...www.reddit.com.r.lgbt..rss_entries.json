I&#39;m not an expert, so I may be wrong, but many of the things they claim appear incorrect, for example they claim that the rate of intersexuallity is actually closer to 0.018% rather than 1.7%, and not a real sex? They also say that the risks of medical are much higher than other reports. They appear to have no resources on any gender identities other than man or woman, and throw around the term &#39;trans/gender ideologies&#39; a lot, which I mostly see used by transphobes. Maybe I&#39;m wrong and they are fine, but I get a bad feeling about it, especially since I&#39;ve seen it suggested as a good resource it for parents of trans kids. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hopeful-Flower6693\"> /u/Hopeful-Flower6693 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://w",
