Here is an impressive effort to do just that</p><p>In her landmark 1985 work, The Body in Pain, American essayist Elaine Scarry makes a case for the&nbsp;\u201cunsharability\u201d of pain and its resistance to language. \u201cPhysical pain,\u201d she writes, \u201cdoes not simply resist language but actively destroys it.\u201d Sixty years earlier in On Being Ill, Virginia Woolf made her famous claim about how language \u201cruns dry\u201d when it comes to articulating illness. Both theories grapple with inexpressibility. Experiencing serious, persistent pain invokes many feelings: irritation, curiosity (what\u2019s causing it?), fear (of something sinister) and ultimately the desire to eradicate it. The search for a diagnosis can be as debilitating as the condition itself. In Pathemata: Or, the Story of My Mouth, Maggie Nelson tries to solve the mystery of a&nbsp;longstanding health issue. \u201cEach morning, it is as if my mouth has survived a war \u2013 it",

She has stepped out of the lakeshore family home of Charlie Margolis, a cardiac anaesthesiologist to whom she\u2019s engaged.
