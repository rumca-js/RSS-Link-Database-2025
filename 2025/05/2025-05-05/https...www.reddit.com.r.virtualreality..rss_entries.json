If you can afford a 2k+ GPU, could you also get a dedicated PCVR headset - or are those gamers in the small niche and don&#39;t want to spend money on the better stuff?</p> <p>Why do people have a rig that can push high resolutions but cripple the graphics with compression and color banding - artifacts from being limited to 500mb vs the 19GB of display port bandwidth? I know most content creators on youtube never show you how it actually looks for them claiming there is no compression where somehow they break the limitations of wireless. They try to prove it with videos which look really good, but they never say that is the desktop mirror so that is the image before it is compressed and sent to the Quest 3.</p> <p>I think maybe the wireless freedom is more important than image quality - but personally if I am going to go hi",

I have a quest 3, and while I do find it pretty neat, and I use it often, I find I really don&#39;t use it for anything other than PCVR stuff. I bought it to upgrade from my quest 2 so that I could have the colour passthrough, and while I do enjoy having that, I find I usually have my guardian boundary turned off, so I can&#39;t use it anyway. I just simply lift up the headset to see around me, or use VD&#39;s menu to interact with my PC.</p> <p>So my question is, if I sold my quest 3 to buy a dedicated PCVR headset like, say, the valve index, would that be the better solution for me? I don&#39;t mind wires at all, since I used to use wired link before buying VD, and I use a battery pack connected to my Quest 3 to keep it charged while playing. I just really like the features and the ecosystem of a PCVR headset, though.</p> <p>Losing the pancake lenses might be a bit sad, but I feel I&#39;d probably get over that as well.</p> <p>As for per",
