We often play different cards and explore several mechanics. In the tcg we play roughly the same deck and we certainly have a combo which means that certain cards are masters. In other card games we play a hero which reinforces this feeling of belonging.</p> <p>Is there a mechanic that highlights one or two cards or elements of a game, which creates this proximity without representing a particular hero? The sensation I&#39;m trying to explain is for example the white dragon with blue eyes from Kaiba in Yu-Gi-Oh but this representation is a little too predictable especially in competitive games regardless of the type of game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ayle_en_\"> /u/Ayle_en_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kfie5a/how_to_give_a_feeling_of_belonging_t",

It uses the standard 52 card deck and each person had 6 cards face down that they do not look at. Each turn you draw and discard, so you could replace the unknown cards with something you drew. There was a face card that allowed you to peek at a card (yours or someone elses), and a different face card let you switch any two face down cards around. If you (for example) see a 6 on top the discard pile you can put one more 6 on it from the face down cards. If it was from someone else&#39;s hand then you give them one of your cards. If you thought you had a 6 but it wasn&#39;t then you have to draw another card for you hand and are not allowed to look at it. The objective is to be the first to get rid of your hand If anyone knows this game please let me know what it&#39;s called, or which face cards have which ability!!! </p> </div><!-- SC_",

If anyone is familiar with the Speech and Debate event Impromptu, it reminded me of that. One of the biggest things that seems to separate this game from most of the other card games I could find is that it isn\u2019t specifically about talking about yourself or meant to start conversations. Another thing I remember about the game is when I had looked it up when I first saw it was that I think it was crowdfunded or at least the only game the company had made. </p> <p>Sorry for not having more information.

So, from what I remember we used 1-3 decks, possibly. There was a scoring system based on what you had, kinda like poker. 4 Kings = 10 x 4 = 40 and there was a score to reach before you won.
