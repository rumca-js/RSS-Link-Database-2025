I allowed port 25 in the firewall but using netstat on that VPS suggests that port 25 isn&#39;t open (at least it isn&#39;t listed) and an external telnet returns the same result. Does anyone have experience with this provider and knows how to open up port 25? Maybe some settings must be tweaked in the user panel? Thanks for help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBadBossBaby\"> /u/TheBadBossBaby </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1kflbwy/contabo_mail_server_troubleshooting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1kflbwy/contabo_mail_server_troubleshooting/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The <code>www-data</code> user has read/write access and can create files in the share without issue. I verified this with a simple PHP script \u2014 file creation works fine.</p> <p>Nextcloud is installed (latest version) with Apache 2 in <code>/var/www/html</code>. The NFS mount directory is owned by <code>www-data:www-data</code> and has <code>755</code> permissions.</p> <p>However, Nextcloud installation fails to use the NFS directory, without showing any errors in the Apache or Nextcloud logs. I&#39;m stuck trying to figure out why.</p> <p>Do you have any idea what could be causing this issue?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/skurty\"> /u/skurty <",
