The reason why handedness is associated with these disorders is probably because both are affected by processes in early brain development. Various studies have explored this link for individual disorders and have sometimes been able to show it, and sometimes not. A meta-analysis carried out by an international research team shows that left and mixed-handedness is particularly common in people who suffer from a disorder that manifests itself early in life and is associated with linguistic symptoms. These include dyslexia, schizophrenia and autism.",

While oxygenation approaches have already been proven successful in lakes, their potential side effects must be carefully analysed before they can be used in the sea.

In an article in the scientific journal EOS, they warn: Technical measures can mitigate damage temporarily and locally, but they are associated with considerable uncertainties and risks. Above all, they do not offer a permanent solution because the oxygen content will return to its previous level once the measures end, unless the underlying causes of the problem, nutrient inputs and global warming, are not tackled.",

        "description": "At a conference in Washington D.C. in 2000, the secretoglobin super family of proteins was named to classify proteins with structural similarities to its founding member uteroglobin. Now, 25 years later, there is still little known about the basic functions of these proteins, prompting a group of researchers to dive into their evolutionary origins. This bioinformatic survey reported that secretoglobins, or SCGBs -- originally thought to be exclusive to mammals -- are also found in turtles, crocodilians, lizards, and birds. These new findings suggest that these proteins evolved earlier than dinosaurs and share a basic function that is not yet discovered.",
