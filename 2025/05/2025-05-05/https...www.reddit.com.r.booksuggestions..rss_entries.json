I prefer fiction, and I enjoy mystery, romance, comedy, and contemporary novels. Really open to anything, but I <strong>do not</strong> like slow burns or fantasy. </p> <p>Some books I have enjoyed in the past include: </p> <p>I Who Have Never Known Men, The Midnight Library, The Silent Patient, Just for the Summer, The Invisible Life of Addie Larue, and Yellowface (loved this one). </p> <p>I did not like the ACOTAR series, although smut is fine, just not fantasy. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd_Photo_7179\"> /u/Odd_Photo_7179 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kfpuc2/help_me_make_my_summer_reading_list/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1kfpuc2/help_me_m",

But I don&#39;t find motivation. So I need some motivational books to keep me going. </p> <p>I don&#39;t like those self-help books that give 2 days of motivation.

Faced some issues, which I later found very common in most businesses. I think, I could have avoided some of those hardships and could have planned better if I knew about them before. After one year I think besides seeking advice from experienced people, books are great way to learn about this journey.</p> <p>So, I would love to hear what business books really helped you in the early stages of your startups.

I\u2019ve been to the bookstores lately, but the only recommendations I keep seeing are Karen White&#39;s books, which I know are popular, but they feel a little different from what I\u2019m looking for.</p> <p>I\u2019m after something similar to Sarah Jio\u2019s style - those heartfelt, often historical novels with a touch of romance and deep emotional connections.

I do not mind whether the authors focus on foundational history or more modern history..

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I&#39;m trying to get into reading, few years ago, in 2020, I started giving reading a shot. Mainly read those 3 books:</p> <ol> <li>The Glass Castle (I think it was by Jeannette Walls? Though I forgot a bit about it since)</li> <li>The Outsiders (By S.E Hinton, probably my favorite of the 3)</li> <li>Tuesdays with Morrie (Though it was my least favorite of the 3)</li> </ol> <p>But after those I stopped reading all together, but recently wanted to go back to it. I bought a book that is Murder/Mystery (I forgot its name exactly) and just quit it. I couldn&#39;t get myself to focus on it one bit, got confused a bit and just didn&#39;t feel attracted to reading it.</p> <p>I tried my shot at a &quot;Self-help&quot; book, a pretty known one I think called &quot;The Power of Now&quot;. Initially I was so happy and focused on it, but with time, I couldn&#39;t get myself focused on it much anymore. I did finish it, but I&#39;d be lying if I said I was able",

I finished it several hours, many smiles, and even more tears later. It\u2019s simply one of the most moving books I\u2019ve ever read. If you care about cat communities, human communities, or just want to read a quietly stunning memoir, I\u2019d recommend this book to you. </p> <p>Has anyone else read it? I\u2019d love to hear others thoughts. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/230516\"> /u/230516 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1keyipv/poets_square_a_memoir_in_30_cats/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1keyipv/poets_square_a_memoir_in_30_cats/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I wanna find a few non-romance books with 2 different pov&#39;s. Though to self indulge a bit I&#39;d be find with a dual pov romance book if it&#39;s mlm. Overall a dual pov book of any genre except romance unless its mlm.
