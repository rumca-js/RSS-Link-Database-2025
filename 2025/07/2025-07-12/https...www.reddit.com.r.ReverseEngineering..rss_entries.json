The goal is to reverse engineer and crack the software. Anybody willing to work on this project will be compensated $500 once it is cracked and prepped for release and be provided an additional $200 a week to keep updating files which should be fairly passive once everything is cracked and setup. This is by no means an easy task or ask. It could turn into a quick and easy fairly passive money maker for someone once it is up and running properly.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Intrepid_Offer_4789\"> /u/Intrepid_Offer_4789 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://discord.gg/k9qbTRWdew\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1lxpwmg/looking_for_reverse_engineering_partner_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",
