The problem is, it&#39;s hard to keep track of prices across all the different online game stores.</p> <p>I built a Chrome extension, Price Tracker, to help with this. It&#39;s universal, so you can track a game on your friendly local game store&#39;s site, a publisher&#39;s page, or a big retailer. Just navigate to the page, click the price, and it will watch it for you.</p> <p>It&#39;s free for a 10-game watchlist. Hope it helps you expand your collection without emptying your wallet.</p> <p>Link: <a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mknchhldcjhbfdfdlgnaglhpchohdhkl?authuser=0&amp;hl=en\">https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mknchhldcjhbfdfdlgnaglhpchohdhkl?authuser=0&amp;hl=en</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/iPCGamerCF1\"> /u/iPCGamerCF1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",

I\u2019ve played a few games on Steam, still under ten in total, and I feel pretty confident with the rules after going through the rulebook and watching some tutorials. That said, I\u2019m still learning the strategy side of things.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for any tips on how to teach the game to complete beginners. They both enjoy games, but they\u2019re not heavy gamers, so I want to keep things engaging without overwhelming them.</p> <p>I also remember reading somewhere that some people recommend giving each player a specific starting hand the first time they play, to help make the experience smoother. Is that something you\u2019ve done before? If so, do you have any hand setups or suggestions to share?</p> <p>Any advice is appreciated \u2014 whether it\u2019s teaching tips, how to pace the game, how much history to bring in, or common beginner mistakes to av",
