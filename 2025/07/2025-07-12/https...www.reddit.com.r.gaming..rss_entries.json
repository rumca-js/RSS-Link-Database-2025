Also has been on my bucket list since release as I&#39;ve been a Doom fan since I was like 10. Completed it, went back to DOOM og, beat it. And now I want to play DOOM II and Eternal side to side. But I also play subnautica on and off and I&#39;ve noticed trying to juggle more than like 2 games makes it difficult to sustain interest in all three and you kind of fumble around ",
