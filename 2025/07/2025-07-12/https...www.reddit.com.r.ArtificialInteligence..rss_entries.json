Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present eleven evaluations for measuring a model&#39;s ability to instrumentally reason about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness).

But beneath the surface of these seemingly noble intentions lies a deeper, more concerning reality: the regulation of AI, as it is currently being proposed, will not serve the public good.

At some point, I brought it up with my team and they didn\u2019t like the idea of being recorded. I tried to explain to them that this is really no different than Zoom transcription and feeding that into ChatGPT to get a summary. No voice files or sound is being given to any company. It came up again, and my coworker asked that I tell him before every meeting before I use it. He said he doesn\u2019t like that I\u2019m using it, but won\u2019t try to stop me using it as long as he is informed. My stance is that these tools will soon be so ubiquitous, that we should just skip this step. Curious to hear others thoughts on if they agree that it\u2019s ethical to always inform anyone whenever you are using an AI transcription app. How do wearables fit into this? Would I need to tell everyone I encounter that I am wearing a wearable? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zensamuel\"> /",
