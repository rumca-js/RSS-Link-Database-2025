It walked upright, and was built for heavy chewing with relatively massive jaws, and huge teeth with thick dental enamel. It's thought to have lived between 2.25 million and 1.7 million years ago.",

This creates a dichotomy where forests are treated either as plantations or reserves.

Whereas selection forestry focuses on which trees are taken, retention forestry focuses on protecting features that will remain after logging. These biological legacies provide ecosystem continuity.",
