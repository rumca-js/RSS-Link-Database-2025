        "description": "It's exactly one week since \"Back To The Beginning\" in Birmingham - Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath's last ever live show. Among the many covers was Jack Black's \"Mr Crowley\" tribute accompanied by a new generation of musicians - real ones. This is a longer episode because watching them encouraged my inner guitar nerd to come out and play. I've apologised. \n\nTo watch Mr Crowley in its entirety: https://youtu.be/hm-M8GvgYws?si=qap23a4-shvUT0gj\n\nAnd the original is here:  https://youtu.be/G3LvhdFEOqs?si=3AsUfwiscM99OKWz\n\nTo come and see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n #jackblack #",
