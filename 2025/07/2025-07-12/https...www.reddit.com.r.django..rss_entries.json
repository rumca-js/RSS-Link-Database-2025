Fastapi supports the pydantic, msgspec and other data serialization methods also. Dont you think now a days people barely render templates on server side and return it as the response? Although a lot of time SPAs are not required but it has become the default choice for frontend guys and due to which my lead decided to go with fastapi. I have beein using Django for 4 years, I think the ORM and admin panel is unmatchable and i dont think I will find this in any other framework.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/paklupapito007\"> /u/paklupapito007 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1lxxm7i/is_it_possible_to_make_rest_apis_like_fastapi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1lxxm7i/is_it_possible_to_make_rest_apis_like_fastapi/\">[comments]</a></span>",
