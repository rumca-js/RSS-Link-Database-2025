It was my own fault really, I left an RDP port forward open after testing some stuff and they brute forced the password (impressive, since it was relatively strong). I cut them off when I realized it was happening (insert scenee from Trnsformers movie where dude cuts the network lines with an axe), but they encrypted a big chunk of my data. I had also stupidly attached my backup drives to do some archival and so they hit a lot of my redundant files too.</p> <p><strong>I&#39;m not asking for help with this.</strong> Well, there <em>is</em> no help really (last I checked anyway). My query is this: <strong>How has the source for this never leaked?
