Playing these games in VR gives you actual scale of the environments just like any other native VR game. I was able to do my first time playing Tony Hawk 3+4 in VR with the click of a button. It simply isn\u2019t the same to see the game on a monitor vs being inside the game. It is such a joy to see these games in VR even if it is just playing with a controller in third person, it feels unreal, pun intended.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mii123me\">",
