I&#39;m very interested in stories such as paranormal stuff, and more of the creepy genres for example: Coraline, a huge problem is most books feature romance, I&#39;m not very big on romance and generally dislike it. I&#39;m very lost on what books to read that don&#39;t feature romance but features my type of style (coraline) if that makes sense, there&#39;s no romance in coraline generally but yeah. If anyone has book recommendations WITHOUT ROMANCE, whether it be online for example: Wattpad, or in real life for example: the library, that would be VERY much appreciated, I&#39;m very into paranormal/creep books that give off halloween vibes!

I&#39;d read daily from like 6 until I was around 14, but when I was 14, my foster parent stopped letting me read things she didn&#39;t approve of (think &#39;you can&#39;t read fiction, it&#39;ll make you mentally ill&#39;) so for ages i couldn&#39;t read. I&#39;m trying to get back to my old pacing of reading, which was 2 books a week at *least*, but it&#39;s a struggle right now. I&#39;ve tried reading shorter books, but it didn&#39;t help, so if anyone knows any good long books that aren&#39;t purely romance, I&#39;d love to get some reccs! I won&#39;t read anything by Colleen Hoover, but anything else I&#39;m up for.

I think it&#39;s because he has to read a lot of classics and stuff at school, and also most of the books he&#39;s read are, imo, good, but really long and has a slow start. And he has a really short attention span and hates sitting around, probably due to his ADHD. But if he gave reading a chance I know he&#39;d fall in love with it. So I need a short book (I&#39;m thinking 350 pages or less), something that hooks you in from the FIRST line and holds your attention for the rest of the book. No long, pretty descriptions, and not a lot of dialogue. I need something that&#39;s action-packed, simple plot, and gets straight to the point. He&#39;s turning 13 this year btw (but don&#39;t recommend me the generic stuff, like Percy Jackson, he hates those books with burning passion for some reason).

I&#39;ve also read &quot;Open&quot; by Rachel Krantz about a married couple opening their relationship. I&#39;m looking for more memoirs ideally written by normal people (i.e. non-celebrities) about messy relationships, complicated or unusual dynamics, infidelity, etc. I already have a hold on &quot;A Beautiful, Terrible Thing&quot; by Jen Waite, but would love more suggestions for books in this niche category as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LogicalBench\"> /u/LogicalBench </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lxngpb/memoirs_about_messycomplicatedunusual/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lxngpb/memoirs_about_messyco",

I don&#39;t remember a whole lot about it, certainly not the name or i wouldn&#39;t be here. The book was a red canvas texture hardcover with a silhouette of a 90s ish Jeep Wrangler, it had a simple sunset and African tree behind the Jeep. The story was following a two person team competing in a multi-day offroad rally course through the African desert. one scene in it was of the driver accidentally getting his foot run over by a vehicle and having to drive with a broken foot. If anyone knows this book pleaseee help me find it. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wolf_3500\"> /u/wolf_3500 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lxn7cw/africa_rally_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; ",
