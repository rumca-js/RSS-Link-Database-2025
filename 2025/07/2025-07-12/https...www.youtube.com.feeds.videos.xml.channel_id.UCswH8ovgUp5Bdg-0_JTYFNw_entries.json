        "description": "Charlie Kirk says Trump is being pressured to abandon his immigration promises\u2014and he\u2019s not the only one who thinks so. Is the migrant issue just a distraction from the real power behind the problem: Big Agriculture, Hospitality, and Corporate America? Today I unpack the lobbying pressure Trump is facing, and why some say ICE raids are theatre while the industries fuelling illegal immigration remain untouched. Is Trump making the same compromises as everyone else in Washington? Or is this the moment we find out who really runs the show?
