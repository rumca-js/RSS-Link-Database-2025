James Gunn\u2019s Superman has officially flown into theaters, bringing with it characters like David Corenswet\u2019s Superman/Clark Kent, Rachel Brosnahan\u2019s Lois Lane, and Nicholas Hoult\u2019s Lex Luthor. But a surprise character joined the fold, surprising DC fans everywhere.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s right, the wait to meet Milly Alcock\u2019s Supergirl is over. The Girl of Steel has crash landed in the DCU in all of her drunken glory. But why is this version of the character so much different from classic characterizations of Kara Danvers? The answer to that question sits with the limited run comic Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. Join us as we break down what her comic history tells us about the Girl of Steel\u2019s future in the DC Studios franchise, and what that future means for the character and women in the DCU as a whole.\n\n#IGN #Superman #DC",

But there are some vital lessons it can learn from arguably Rockstar's biggest ever risk with the Grand Theft Auto games.\n\nGTA 4's success was never guaranteed. Grand Theft Auto 4 was a major departure from the cartoon worlds for GTA 3, Vice City and GTA San Andreas. It was mature, had muted colours and opted for more realistic driving and dour tones. It was an enormous risk for Rockstar to completely change their beloved series, but it paid off in a big way.\n\nSo, what can GTA 6 learn from GTA 4? In this video, we delve into everything great and risky about Grand Theft Auto 4, and what 2026's Grand Theft Auto 6 can draw inspiration from to ensure it also forges its own unique identity in the long-running Grand Theft Auto series.\n \nThis GTA 4 review retrospective celebrates Rockstar's best game.\n\n\nSubscribe to IGN for more!\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/IGNentertainment?sub_confirmation=1\n\n",

I\u2019m not over the moon about Operation Storm and I think the monetization is simultaneously fine in some places and potentially predatory in others. But I\u2019m here for the 6v6 and 3v3 modes. That stuff is for PvP sickos. I\u2019ve come away liking the little moments, the stories my group has been a part of. If Mecha Break plays it smart, I think it has the juice to last for the long haul, and I know my crew will be hitting me up for matches for the foreseeable future. We\u2019re still chasing those moments of perfection, those stories. Sometimes we\u2019ll get there. Sometimes we won\u2019t. But the perfect match is out there. And I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m not gonna try to find it.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
