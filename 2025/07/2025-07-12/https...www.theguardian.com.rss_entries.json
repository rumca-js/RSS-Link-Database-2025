Ratatouille is a glorious riot of stewed vegetables, and I like to serve it with a vibrant French take on pesto. Le grand a\u00efoli, meanwhile, is a feast of seasonal veg, boiled eggs, anchovies and plenty of garlicky mayo for dipping.

I thought he was odd until I spent some time with an ice-cream sandwich and found myself, like a car (or circle) enthusiast, fawning over the arcs and appreciating the loveliness of a double round cookie housing a cylinder of ice-cream. Unlike a car, however, you can <em>eat</em> the ice-cream cookie and rejoice in the crunch giving away to cold cream \u2013 and that, in my opinion, is proper satisfaction.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/12/no-churn-malted-ice-cream-recipe-peanut-cookie-sandwiches-meera-sodha\">Continue reading...</a>",
