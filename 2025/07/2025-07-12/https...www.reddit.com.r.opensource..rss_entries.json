Even if it\u2019s easier of at least look easier for data engineers. </p> <p>But they are comfortable in doing from SSMS, they know the interface well and smart enough to understand the options. The idea is make a desktop application (similar interface like ssms with good hierarchy of folders and containers ) which they can use and run sql queries on top the data lakes using Compute engines. </p> <p>First of all how is the idea and then I know it can done with chrome extension but desktop is much more good and feel local. </p> <p>I don\u2019t know anything on open source this is my first open source project. Please enlighten me or let\u2019s work on this </p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/MC140/DeltaDesk\">https://github.com/MC140/DeltaDesk</a></p> <p>",
