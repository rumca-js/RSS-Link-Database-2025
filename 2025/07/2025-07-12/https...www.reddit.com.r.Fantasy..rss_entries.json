Particularly I love the way they are written, clearly feeling historical with the depictions of culture, ideals, thought processes and the language used by the author. I particularly love stories with female characters breaking cultural norms which restrict them from doing what they want out of life, as well. I&#39;m looking for more with this feeling while reading. They don&#39;t have to be historical fiction or so clearly inspired by it. I also love dragons, but that is a secondary request. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Starboot1\"> /u/Starboot1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1lycza8/recommendations_with_a_feeling_like_a_natural/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1lycza8/recommendations_with_a_feeling_lik",

And now that I&#39;m thinking more about it, I&#39;d like to bring some nuance to this topic.</p> <p>I&#39;d first argue that long books are a staple of the genre. Isn&#39;t Lord of the Rings, the foundational novel of modern fantasy, over 1200 pages long, after all? Sure, it was divided into a trilogy upon publication, but the actual content remained the same. Still nowadays, there are endless debates whether Tom Bombadil and the Shire battle are useless, or whether removing them from the Peter Jackson&#39;s adaptations was heresy. </p> <p>The above take might sound simplistic: after all, aren&#39;t many literature classics very thick books as well?

Anyway, I&#39;ve finished The Witcher 3, Mass Effect trilogy, Greedfall and most recently, Cyberpunk 2077. I want to find a game that has story rich, just like the above, each of them make me feel so emotional when playing, also I really like the romance aspect of the games, is not the main thing ofc but is really make the plays feel real, every conversation u have with npc feels real, I can feel the grief, the fun, the emotion in the voiceline (hat off to Cyberpunk damn I was about to cry). So I know myself a picky player, I&#39;ve try AC Odyssey before and drop it, GOT I play through act 1 but then I lost the saved file so I droo it too, BD3, well is seems to be the most possible games that both story rich, romance and happy ending ( not bittersweet like Cyberpunk, I really love CDPR ) but I find the game kind of too hard, even on easy level, I still don&#39;",

Can anyone recommend a series like that, possibly with some slice of life elements? Darkness is okay, after all most of the time you can&#39;t have much of a story without it, just so long as it&#39;s not a complete world of bleakness kind of situation, for example Storm Light Archives. An example of boarderline though I do like it a lot is Griphon Rider Academy by Elise Hennessy.
