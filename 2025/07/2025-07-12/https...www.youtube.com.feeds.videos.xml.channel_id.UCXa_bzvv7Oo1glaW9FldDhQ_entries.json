        "description": "\"Another year, another college football game from EA\"\u2026  is not what I thought I\u2019d be saying a couple years ago, but here we are. This year\u2019s offering is brimming with interesting and engaging stuff to do, whether it\u2019s the revamped recruit mechanics in Dynasty or the new high school experience within Road to Glory. \n\nCoaches finally represent their real-life counterparts this time around, making for a more realistic simulation of the FBS league. And to top it all off, the presentation is a rich tapestry of authenticity - from the hundreds of fight songs to highly detailed stadiums across the country. Some sore spots include an underbaked Ultimate Team mode and some menu navigation problems, but College Football 26 remains a fierce competitor in the sports game genre and one worth checking out whether you're a fan of collegiate football or not.",

        "description": "The initial announcement of Wuchang: Fallen Feathers back in 2021 was a mixed bag for some. Souls-like fatigue is seemingly a never-ending issue, and it didn't appear to really offer much else. Four years later, and with its launch on July 24th, that's no longer the case.\n\nAfter more development time and shifting to Unreal Engine 5, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has emerged as one of the more promising Souls-like action RPGs in some time. The story, which sees players as the amnesiac pirate Bai Wuchang, takes place in the Land of Shu as she combats the Feathering disease. Its mix of Dark Souls-like interconnectedness, fast-paced combat and extensive build-crafting with numerous weapons and spells looks to be shaping up well.\n\nAlong with launching on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, it will be available on day one for Game Pass. What should you expect before jumping, especially since it's the latest title to opt for a $50 price tag? Find out here.",

        "description": "During Microsoft's terrible, no-good, very bad week, it was understandable that some news didn't warrant as much focus. Dying Light developer Techland cancelled two titles (potentially including its fantasy RPG, though thankfully there were no layoffs). \n\nEA is finally shutting down servers for Anthem in January 2026. However, it's the situation at Unknown Worlds Entertainment, developer of Subnautica, and everything surrounding its upcoming sequel that escalated into something else entirely.",
