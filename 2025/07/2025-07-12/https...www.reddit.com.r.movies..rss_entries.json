And that person in charge says &quot;Does anyone else know about this?&quot; It drives me nuts. It&#39;s a question that translates directly to &quot;Do I need to kill anyone besides you to keep this from getting out?&quot; Their motive is extremely obvious, especially if it&#39;s the first thing they ask.

Then Mangold takes the reigns in The Wolverine, which while an improvement also suffers from a generic to downright bad third act that feels slapdash and rushed compared to the rest of the film (the director\u2019s cut helps this somewhat). Then we get Logan, which IMO, is the best genre film aside from The Dark Knight (and Nolan\u2019s trilogy had its own stumble with the enjoyable but flawed Rises). </p> <p>Is there any other trilogy that was so miles ahead of the first film?

Before Sunrise was really, really good - charming, romantic and captured that exuberance of doe-eyed youthful passion so well.</p> <p>But Before Sunset, man, it&#39;s just on another level. Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m the same age as the characters now, in my 30s and married and with some life experience but it felt so resonant. Jesse and Celine have grown and changed over the past decade - they&#39;re more jaded and cynical, and not the hopeless romantics they used to be. But this growth is what lends so much more depth and complexity in both personalities and the current state of their relationship, and how much that one night steered the course of their lives in the ensuing years.</p> <p>As with Sunrise, the dialogue is really the star here and it&#39;s even better ",
