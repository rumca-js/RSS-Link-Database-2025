This `--suprvised` flag doesn&#39;t exist on the gpg manual, and instead a `--deprecated-supervised` is documented. Aparently the gpg people don&#39;t want to support socket/service activation a la systemd. Which sure, fair enough, but this started a particularly funny attrition war in which the systemd-pilled vendors are arguing for &quot;sandbox-based security&quot; and to keep using the deprecated flag for the forseable future, and upstream devs are arguing for &quot;security by simplicity&quot; to avoid supporting the feature. All of this on a cryptography library mind you. I can almost taste the ",

Currently, Koca can run and create packages for the following platforms: - <code>.deb</code> (Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivati",
