I was struggling to get LLMs to understand full codebases without hitting context limits or having to manually copy-paste files. So, I built CodeToPrompt \u2013 a Python tool that turns local repos, GitHub URLs, web pages, and even YouTube transcripts into one focused prompt. It&#39;s been especially useful with models like Gemini, which let me include much more of a project.</p> <p>One feature that&#39;s made a big difference for me is its smart code compression. It uses tree-sitter to summarize supported languages (like Python, JS, C++, etc.) into high-level outlines, which saves tokens while keeping the project&#39;s structure. It also has an interactive way to pick files, it truncates data files smartly, and offers different output formats. It&#39;s genuinely helped make my LLM-driven work smoother, and if this sounds familiar, maybe it can help you too! Happy to h",
