I just crossed 100 paying customers and ~$1.2k in revenue for my solo SaaS, and I did it with no paid ads, no co-founder, and barely any budget.</p> <p>The Idea: Make Subtitles That Actually Keep People Watching</p> <p>Like many of you, I wanted to build something useful, but not waste time building stuff no one wants. I kept seeing how every viral short-form video had styled subtitles \u2014 not plain captions, but punchy, colored, animated text that made the video pop. And I realized most creators either did this manually in CapCut or paid editors to do it for them.</p> <p>So I built <a href=\"http://SubtitleMe.io\">SubtitleMe.io</a> \u2014 a simple tool that lets anyone upload a video and instantly generate styled, high-retention subtitles using AI. It uses OpenAI Whisper for transcription, adds trendy subtitle designs like \u201cBold Punch\u201d a",
