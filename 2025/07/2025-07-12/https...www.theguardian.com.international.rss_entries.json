It\u2019s stranger still to choose Kingston, Jamaica, a venue that until a couple of months ago didn\u2019t even have floodlights. Up until two days before the match, there has been local conjecture about whether they would be adequate for the match, with a chance that plans would have to be changed. But one day out, the lights have been announced fit by sports minister Olivia Grange.</p><p>Putting the pieces together, it\u2019s likely related to Jamaica\u2019s upcoming election and a sitting government that has worn plenty of whacks for not supporting cricket, having refused to bid for matches at last year\u2019s T20 World Cup citing expense. A cricket spectacle might be an attempt to recover some ground. It helps that Mexico, Canada, and the USA have host qualification for next ",
