        "description": "A cat named Pepper has once again helped scientists discover a new virus\u2014this time a mysterious orthoreovirus found in a shrew. Researchers from the University of Florida, including virologist John Lednicky, identified this strain during unrelated testing and published its genome. Although once thought to be harmless, these viruses are increasingly linked to serious diseases in humans and animals. With previous discoveries also pointing to a pattern of viral emergence in wildlife, scientists stress the need for more surveillance\u2014and Pepper remains an unlikely but reliable viral scout.",

These shape-shifting proteins don\u2019t clump into visible plaques, making them harder to detect but potentially just as harmful. Scientists believe these \u201cstealth\u201d molecules could evade the brain\u2019s cleanup systems and quietly impair memory and brain function. The discovery opens a new frontier in understanding dementia and could lead to entirely new targets for treatment and prevention.",
