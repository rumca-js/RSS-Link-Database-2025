I tried to replicate the glitch on windowed mode to check if i could see it in a screenshot, but the glitch didnt happen on windowed. Could this bencaused by a faulty gpu? some proton bug? Id like some opinions.</p> <p>potentially important info: - CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS - GPU: Radeon 780M graphics - OS: Ubuntu 24.04 - bug happened on multiple screen resolutions and screen ratios(always fullscreen), but never in native resolution. - glitch appears sometimes when i open the menu or console, not while playing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by",

I have seen Bazzite as a viable option to convert a computer into a console thanks to the &quot;game mod&quot; without losing the advantages and utilities of a PC Now my question is this:</p> <p>In my country, to get video games on the PC, it is super common to get them pirated or cracked. Will I have compatibility/performance problems when using this software? I have heard that AMD cards are more Linux friendly, is that true? Or should I buy an Nvidia card?

Let me explain my problem better: I often play the same game with a friend and I put his Discord stream on top of the game.

I&#39;ve searched online and even asked on chatgbt, but I don&#39;t quite understand the steps. I tried to set it to &quot;always on top&quot;, but as soon as I go to fullscreen or maximum window, it loses &quot;priority&quot; and goes to the bottom.

Just picked up a new 2tb during prime days, and wanting to maybe try something new. I\u2019m not much of a pc gamer, although there are a handful I\u2019ll play on occasion, and they all work on Linux (thank you GE!). I\u2019m aware of Bazzite being a fork of Fedora Atomic/silverblue, but haven\u2019t dipped my toes in immutable OS\u2019s yet. I\u2019ve dabbled with Arch and Cachy a bit, and have gone through the Debian days with Mint and Pop!. Is there maybe one I should try/consider?</p> <p>Besides the few games I do play, work with CAD software and light coding, so fairly basic PC usage, and more partial to GNOME, although DE makes little difference at all.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",
