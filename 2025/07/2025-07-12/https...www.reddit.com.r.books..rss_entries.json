I&#39;m in my 30s and consider myself a good reader, but I&#39;ve never read something this old. I find myself googling vocabulary used often and reading slowly because it takes a lot more concentration to read this book than others. Dont get me wrong, I love it! I love learning the language of this setting and time. It&#39;s just so unlike other books I&#39;ve read. The <em>only</em> book I can assimilate it to is Harry Potter, because of some of the language. But not really haha. It&#39;s just a cool feeling honestly- learning all about a culture that I had not much knowledge in through a fictional story. Have many of you who&#39;ve read these books had similar feelings? How long did it take for you to read it? I&#39;ve had the book for over a week and finally am 100 pages in. And shout out to the gracious human who placed these book gems in a LF",
