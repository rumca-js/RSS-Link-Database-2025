It was a perfectly presented love letter to the Robocop franchise. One that paid particular homage to the dick shooting, squib-tastic, satire strewn Paul Verhoeven original in all of its excessively gory, 80's action movie glory.\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/robocop-rogue-city-expandalone-unfinished-business-feels-like-the-raid-the-video-game-and-id-buy-that-for-more-than-a-dollar\">Read more</a></p>",

It's a tremendously creative and clever take on DK as a character, and does a great job of both expanding the existing DK universe and building something all-new for a younger generation - one that's also about to get to know DK's world properly for the first time, given this is all just in time for an upcoming movie. It's brilliant.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-voice-acting-villains\">Read more</a></p>",
