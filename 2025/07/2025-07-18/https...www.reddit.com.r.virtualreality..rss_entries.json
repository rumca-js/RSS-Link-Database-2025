So I wanted to keep playing on PC and especially I wanted to keep using the Index&#39;s Knuckles controllers. I found a way to do this but it is was a real pain in the a** having to recalibrate the controllers each time I took a small break of a session. My gf was also interested in getting into VR so I ended up giving the headset to her and I just use it when I need the passthrough feature which is fine.<br/> The thing is, the diference in visuals is so BIG I really wanted to get a decent upgrade for the Index but I wanted to keep using the Lighthouses and Knuckles controllers, after a lot of searching I ended up deciding",

I tried Sweet surrender, asgards wrath 2, and dungeons of eternity all of which I saw had good reviews and tbh I really dont like them.</p> <p>Lets start with sweet surrender, it was a pretty cool sounding idea I love roguelikes so a robot fighting vr roguelike sounded right up my alley. I immediately noticed that it lacks a ton of polish, its ridiculous that pretty much all audio has a delay (how do you even let that go unnoticed) like genuinely every gunshot and interaction has a one or two second delay. Not to mention I couldnt even get through the first area without getting bored, the guns and enemies feel extremely uninspired, skill is not rewarded and each room feels and looks the same. Total disappointment.</p> <p>After that I tried dungeons of eternity, I heard it had a pretty simple gameplay loop but was apparently",

It is a free demo and I really am just looking for feedback and other tips so that I can create the full game. Do not expect a complete game, right now it is just a simple arcade game with one game mode and you can easily get the whole experience in 5-10 minutes.</p> <p><strong>About the game</strong></p> <p>CoopScoop is a VR arcade-style game focused on managing a chicken farm during an epidemic. Players must actively wash, cure, and quarantine chickens to prevent the spread of infection, with gameplay centered around time management and quick decision-making. CoopScoop offers a high-paced, skill-based experience where the objective is to keep chickens alive for as long as possible.</p> <p><strong>Demo link (SteamVR)</strong>:<br/> <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3709400/CoopScoop_Demo/\">https://store.",

Many of the games that are directly compatible with bhaptics I don&#39;t play, so I would be using the audio-to-haptics feature, and I haven&#39;t really seen anyone talk about it. I know this is basically what woojer is meant for, but is the bhaptics better at it? The other reason I&#39;m leaning towards bhaptics is they have a sale rn on the air + the haptic sleeves for just a lil over the price of the woojer vest 3.</p> <p>Any and all advice would be super appreciated!! &lt;3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#",
