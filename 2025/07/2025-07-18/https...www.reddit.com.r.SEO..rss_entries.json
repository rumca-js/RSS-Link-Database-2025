        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone, I have a list of about 20 to 30 low competition keywords in our niche that we want to target. It is for a services business. We put out a lot of related content in the form of podcast episodes. I\u2019m relatively new to search engine optimization so excuse me for being a bit of a beginner. I\u2019m wondering if this would make sense \u2026 we could to target each of these keywords with various episodes where relevant.</p> <p>So, for example, if we put out 100 episodes over the course of a year then that would mean we would choose one of the keywords for each of the podcast episodes and over the course of the year we would have an SEO optimized blog post for each podcast episode about 4 to 5 times over the course of the year. Would that make sense to do? Or is it better to be more selective about targeting particular keywords, like instead create a very authoritative landing page with pillar content targeting that keyword. Does this make sense?</p> </d",
