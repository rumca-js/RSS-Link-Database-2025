        "description": "My brother was appalled and it seems that many others were similarly horrified by my lack of Deftones knowledge in my episode on the band's latest release, My Mind Is A Mountain.  I just never investigated them. I don't even know why. What was I thinking? Anyway, I will be from now on. Dan told me to start with Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) after watching Deftones open with it at Crystal Palace. And to make our mother proud, I did what he said. \n\nThe track can be found in its entirety here: https://youtu.be/KvknOXGPzCQ?si=Y7C6ehW9rCKliML8\n\nTo come and see this show - Justin Hawkins Rides Again - but LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: ",
