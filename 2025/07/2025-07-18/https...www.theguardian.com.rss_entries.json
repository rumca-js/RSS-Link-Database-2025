Having impressed last season on loan at Galatasaray, winning the Golden Boot in Turkey on the way to a S\u00fcper Lig title, Osimhen could complete a remarkable permanent move to Istanbul in lieu of any other interest. Napoli are happy to sell, given Osimhen has one year remaining on his contract, but have reportedly inserted a clause preventing the striker from joining Juventus at a later date.</p><p>Like a sophisticated nuclear submarine patiently lying in wait or just a middle-aged man trying to get out of a bathtub, West Ham have emerged as a potential loan destination for <strong>Jac",

He plays a mild-mannered CIA cryptographer sent on a bloodthirsty revenge quest after his wife is killed in a terrorist attack. What\u2019s fascinating about this film is that, had the lead been any other actor, it would have devolved into generic pulp. But Malek, in the hands of director James Hawes, really leans into the character\u2019s psychopathy. He has a dead-eyed stare throughout, the sort you\u2019d usually expect to find on a film\u2019s antagonist. Sure, this is a globe-trotting Bourne-style romp, but you\u2019re never allowed to forget the ethical iffiness of, say, blowing someone up inside a swimming pool. <em><br>\n  Out now, Disney+</em></p> <a hre",

Ta-da!</p><p>There\u2019s a touch of theatre to a bombe Alaska: the soft swoops of toasted meringue, the hidden layers revealed at the slice, the contrast of cold and flame \u2026 This one takes its cue from lemon meringue pie, reimagined as an icy dessert with a gently tangy heart. The lemon ice-cream is no-churn, which makes it blissfully easy, and it softens into a mousse-like texture, rather than melting, so this is great for entertaining, when timing isn\u2019t always precise. Underneath is a tender pistachio sponge for a little texture and subtle nuttiness, and it\u2019s all wrapped in a satiny meringue, torched to golden. It\u2019s a dessert that feels doable but celebratory, a little retro and entirely joyful.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/18/lemon-meringue-bombe-alaska-cake-recipe-pistachio-helen-goh\">Continue reading...</a>",
