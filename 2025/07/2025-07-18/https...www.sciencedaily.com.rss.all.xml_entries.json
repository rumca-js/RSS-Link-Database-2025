        "description": "In a groundbreaking UK first, eight healthy babies have been born using an IVF technique that includes DNA from three people\u2014two parents and a female donor. The process, known as pronuclear transfer, was designed to prevent the inheritance of devastating mitochondrial diseases passed down through the mother\u2019s DNA. The early results are highly promising: all the babies are developing normally, and the disease-causing mutations are undetectable or present at levels too low to cause harm. For families once haunted by genetic risk, this science offers more than treatment\u2014it offers transformation.",

Researchers found that disabling this gene in colorectal cancer cells not only crippled their survival but also disrupted thousands of other genes tied to cancer and metabolism. This opens the door to highly targeted cancer therapies\u2014by either cutting off vitamin D supply to tumors or enhancing the gene\u2019s activity to boost health. The findings hint at vast possibilities in treating diseases influenced by vitamin D, though long-term impacts remain uncertain.",

Elephants in Sri Lanka and India have learned to beg for snacks sugary treats and human food leading to deadly encounters, injuries, and even the ingestion of plastic. Once wild animals become accustomed to handouts, they lose their natural instincts, grow bolder, and risk both their lives and the safety of humans.",

CVI affects the ability of veins especially in the legs to return blood to the heart, often leading to swelling, pain, skin changes, and ulcers. The American Heart Association warns that CVI isn t just a cosmetic issue; it's strongly linked to cardiovascular disease and increased mortality, even when other risk factors are accounted for. Seniors, smokers, those with sedentary lifestyles, and people with obesity are particularly at risk.",
