It runs quietly in the background via systemd, and I\u2019ve set up a custom keyboard shortcut to send text to it instantly \u2014 it&#39;s super convenient.</p> <p>But you can use it however you like \u2014 whether you&#39;re a content creator, language learner, or just someone who prefers listening over reading.</p> <p>Get Started: It\u2019s super easy to set up!

I volunteer for a Tech Center at a Senior community and looking for budget friendly ideas (they have none) There are 6 windoze machines and 3 Mac\u2019s set up for them to use in a Library/Kiosk set up. Problem is they have never had any kind of proxy/web filtering system set up, and I\u2019m trying to help the Director get it done. I\u2019m thinking I could run PiHole and just have each workstations primary DNS set to it. But - a buddy of mine suggested I use AdBlock Plus for the same use case. Questions: Does PiHole have the capacity for custom filter lists? How would this work in Adblock Plus? </p> <p>Thanks in advance, RHC</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RenHoeksCousin\"> /u/RenHoeksCousin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1m350qk/pihole_or_abp_as_filtering_server/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1m350qk/pihole_or_",

It\u2019s been tough cutting through all the noise to find something that actually works.</p> <p>From what I\u2019ve seen, NordVPN still gets mentioned a lot as one of the best VPNs for speed, streaming, and overall security. People talk about their NordLynx protocol being faster and it works well with Netflix, but the price is on the higher side. Surfshark seems to be the most popular budget pick with unlimited devices, solid speeds, and a much lower price.

We\u2019re now venturing into building a <strong>product</strong>, drawing on all the experience we\u2019ve gained so far.<br/> One of the key challenges we\u2019re navigating is <strong>how to make this product open-core and self-hosted-first</strong>. Given the sensitivity of financial data and the need to comply with stringent government regulations, self-hosting appears to be the right path for many of our target customers.<br/> I\u2019ve been lurking in this subreddit for a few months now and have learned a lot from the discussions here (thank you!). Many of the projects shared here lean towards open-source, and we\u2019re leaning in that direction too \u2014 but I\u2019d really value your perspectives: </p> <ul> <li>What are some <strong>gotchas</strong> or lessons you\u2019ve learned ",
