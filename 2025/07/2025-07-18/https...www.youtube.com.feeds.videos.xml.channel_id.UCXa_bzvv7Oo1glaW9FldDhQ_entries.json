        "description": "In case you haven't heard, Void Interactive's Ready or Not recently landed on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, and it's pretty good. You're probably thinking, \u201cYou would know that if you played the PC release!\u201d and you know what? Fair enough, but better late than never, especially with all the additional content, fixes (fake surrenders are less rare than before) and improvements. \n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing for me, especially after I've heard about the game in passing for so long, is how good playing solo can be.",

        "description": "Mafia: The Old Country is Hangar 13\u2019s two-decade-plus series\u2019 fourth mainline entry, and it sees the series retreat to early 1900s Sicily to explore the origins of Sicilian crime families and their pre-eminent tussles for power and control. \n\nPromising newfound immersion thanks to painstaking research during development, Mafia: The Old Country is period-correct in every way; weapons, vehicles, costumes, and characters, plus the beautiful landscape in which this story takes place are created with an authenticity-first mantra. \n\nAnd on the subject of story, Mafia: The Old Country is a narrative-led, linear experience, pledging unexpected twists and turns as we follow underling Enzo Favara as he rises through the Torrisi crime family\u2019s ranks. This feature discusses 15 things you need to know - both the good and the concerning - before deciding whether to buy.",
