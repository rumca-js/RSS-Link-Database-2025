Early on, it\u2019s thoroughly enjoyable to bounce around the vibrant reimagining of Tokyo and help out the small pool of lovable NPCs. Eventually, though, the patience-testing roadblocks and onslaught of low-stakes activities amount to little more than a beautiful but taxing slog. With a ton of excellent Persona games to play elsewhere that don\u2019t artificially hold you at arm\u2019s length, it\u2019s fair to say that my relationship with Lufel and the gang will remain in the acquaintances category, rather than best buds.",
