I was curious to see if you guys think i should keep the method of finding albums or ask in another subreddit for the information</p> <p>Anyway i just wanted to share this thought i had because i think it&#39;s a good discussion (i would also like to share the albums i heard so far but i don&#39;t think this sub allows a way to share it so...)</",

Instead, someone actually rewrote the lyrics from scratch to make it rhyme and sound better in English.</p> <p>The German version is more direct and serious right from the start. Like it opens with \u201cHast du etwas Zeit f\u00fcr mich...\u201d which is like \u201cDo you have some time for me...\u201d and then in the English one it\u2019s suddenly \u201cYou and I in a little toy shop, buy a bag of balloons with the money we\u2019ve got.\u201d Totally different.</p> <p>Apparently this is pretty normal with song translations, since trying to match exact words and still make them rhyme and fit the beat is almost impossible.

But I can barely get through the verse. </p> <p>Everything about it just sounds bad to me. The rhyme, the stuttering rhythm, how on the nose the whole story is. I am 100% convinced they put it there because \u201cthe song needs a verse\u201d. I was always hoping for a cover version that would quietly get rid of the verse, but alas.</p> <p>If they just kept working around the riff(like the solo, it\u2019s great!) it would\u2019ve been one of my all the favourites. But every time I have to suffer through a boy with a wooden sword so migh-e-tee who lives through a dnd character backstory.

Not a runaway dog. </p> <p>I consider it a shame how many people don\u2019t know about this interview because a lot of misinformation seems to have been spread about the original concept of this song over the years and a majority of people that I have seen arguing over the lyrical interpretation of this ",
