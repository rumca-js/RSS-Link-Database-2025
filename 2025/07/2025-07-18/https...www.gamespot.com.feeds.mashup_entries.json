You can't quite put your finger on it, but something is wrong <em>when you put your fingers on it</em>. It's the jump button.</p><p>For DK Bananza, the jump button has been uncharacteristically mapped to the A button by default on the Switch 2, as opposed to the more traditional B button. This is mainly so that the face buttons map to the directions DK punches: X button for upward, Y button for forward, B button for downward. It makes enough sense. But going back to the days of the Super Nintendo, the jump button has almost always been on the bottom of the \"diamond\" shape of face buttons. So if you just want jumping to feel normal again, there is a way to do that.</p><p>From the start menu, go to the fourth menu in a row--Options, with a gear icon--and scro",

But membership also offers a handful of games to play on iOS, such as Crossword Mini and Sudoku.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/07/apple-news-plus-introduces-emoji-game/\">Apple announced</a> yesterday that Emoji Game is now available for Apple News+ subscribers in the US and Canada. So far, the puzzle title only supports English as players use emoji to finish phrases with short clues. For example, there is a mystery two-word phrase with \"departure\" as the clue (which can be expanded, though it costs a move). The solution requires dragging over the sunrise and clock emoji for \"early,\" followed by car and keys emoji for \"start.\" These emoji also have to be selected from a larger group, too.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uplo",
