The mission was cut short due to multiple thruster failures and helium pressurization leaks. NASA decided to bring Starliner back to Earth empty, leaving the astronauts on the ISS for safety. Engineers traced the issues to thermal damage in thruster housings and are now testing fixes, including added insulation. Starliner may require another uncrewed test before resuming crewed flights. Meanwhile, the program has gone billions over budget. Despite setbacks, NASA continues to support Starliner as a needed backup to SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon for ISS rotations.",
