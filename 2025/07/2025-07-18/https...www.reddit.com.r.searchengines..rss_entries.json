I know there are shortcuts and ways to massage the search into what it used to be, or at least sort of. But I don&#39;t want to support Google anymore. What is the best alternative for a search engine? I&#39;m so sick of AI, slop and crappy. If not, misleading ads for what I searched.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/laxton1919\"> /u/laxton1919 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1m33qgn/google_is_trash_what_else_can_i_use/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1m33qgn/google_is_trash_what_else_can_i_use/\">[comments]</a></span>",

And half of The Pictures don&#39;t work when you click on them. The Pictures are also way too small now too. The Yahoo Mobile App is completely ruined now. What are some Search Engines that are way better than Yahoo that I can use? What are my other options? Is there another Mobile App that I can use besides Yahoo Search? Do you think that I should just delete The Yahoo Search Mobile App? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PrincessBananas85\"> /u/PrincessBananas85 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1m2wxp6/what_are_some_other_search_engines_i_can_use/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1m2wxp6/what_are_some_other_search_engines_i_can_use/\">[comments]</a></span>",
