I plan to play VR on my PC wired up and am wondering if ALVR Wired is a good experience with the Quest 2, especially compared to the Meta Quest Link app (Which is trash a lot of the time). I plan to have Windows dual booted but want it to be only for games with Anti-Cheat issues so I barely use it except for the rare times I want to play said games. I have seen SOG talk about having a virtual Windows machine and am also not really sure how nicely that would play with VR so if anyone has tried that feel free to let me know! Just want to try minimize my use of Windows as much as possible, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/unhopeiguess\"> /u/unhopeiguess </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments",

For example I bind running in games to NUMPAD 6 and I bind NUMPAD 6 to the 6 on the side of my mouse. I put this command in the output: Hold_keys (Key_NUMLOCK_6) but it doesn&#39;t seem to binding to my mouse. I&#39;m not sure if I even have the command correct. The input just reads KP End but I have no idea where it got that information.</p> <p>May someone please help me with this?

Questions: 1. Is this normal behavior for high-performance mice under Linux? 2. Any way to force reconnect as USB 2.0 (480 Mbps)? 3. Would tweaking usbhid or using hid_polling help with latency? 4. Could this be a quirk of the mouse itself? On Windows it feels snappier.</p> <p>Any help or optimization tips would be appreciated!</p> </div><!--",

The odd thing is that when I first launched the game, while it was installing (a Ubisoft feature), it seemed to work perfectly, with only a tiny bit of lag. However, after restarting it to change some settings, the game looked horrible. I&#39;m using Wine version 10.12. I&#39;ve also tried to launch it via Lutris, but that doesn&#39;t yield any better results. So I was wondering where I could change the preferred GPU for Wine.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to play steam games on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (fresh OS install today). From what I&#39;ve seen online, the default windowing protocol (X11) causes my games to run at the refresh rate of my slower secondary monitor (60Hz) despite my primary monitor being capable of 240Hz. I&#39;ve seen that switching to Wayland should allow my games to run at 240Hz on my primary monitor. When I switched to Wayland, my games&#39; refresh rates would drop to ~12 FPS (potato games that should be running at hundreds of FPS) with about a second of input latency. I suspect it has something to do with how my system is configured (I haven&#39;t configured anything on this Ubuntu install yet), but I&#39;m having a hard time tracking down what configuration needs to change. Does anyone know what could fix this? </p> <p>System info:</p> <p>Ryzen 5 5600X</p> <p>Nvidia RTX 3070 (driver version 575.64.03)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",
