Works that reflect something essential about the country\u2019s identity, history, or values.</p> <p>Would really appreciate any recommendations, classic or modern, as long as they hold real literary and cultural weight.</p> <p>Thank you\ud83d\udc9c</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dependent_Park8286\"> /u/Dependent_Park8286 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1m3hqv3/need_book_recommendations_for_my_upcoming_trip_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:/",

He asked for something Trojan war related and fictiony. I had an hour in the library before closing and searched for EVERY recommendation ever for a book like this. They had literally none of them.</p> <p>I ended up randomly picking The Last Odyssey by James Rollins. If he isn\u2019t engaged, he\u2019ll stop reading it and he doesn\u2019t like it I\u2019m scared it\u2019ll be a while before he tries another book lol.</p> <p>Will he like it or should I not bother giving it to him? Is it any good? I don\u2019t know anything about James Rollins books. He loved the Iliad &amp; odyssey in school (obvi), loves watching Avatar the last airbender, marvel movies, James Bond, Harry Potter.

And I am one of those people who bought a lot of self help books like 48 laws of power, atomic habits, deep work etc. I did read them but the thing is, I just can&#39;t really feel them.

As a child, I was really interested in books but as I grew older and life got busier, I kind of lost that spark. Every time I try to pick up a book now, I never read past the first 10 pages. I\u2019m struggling to find a book that will ignite that interest again. In theory, I would say I am more into classics and fantasy than other genres, but I\u2019m not so sure anymore. I did finish the metamorphosis by Franz Kafka and loved it. Unpopular opinion but I didn\u2019t really enjoy The Great Gatsby. I also started reading Frankenstein, and while I started to enjoy it, I never finished it. I\u2019m hoping you guys have any suggestions that might help me get into reading again. Any suggestion is appreciated.

I loved how he managed to convey emotion while keeping his writing style simple, which made reading his work much more accessible to me. I also loved getting back into the act of reading, so I want to find more books in a similar style until I get more familiar with literature and start exploring more intricate works. I would appreciate any suggestions, thank you!!</p> <p>For reference, some books I tried reading have been: - 1984 by Orwell (translated to my native language): easy to comprehend but I got bored about 2/3ds in - A room of one&#39;s own by Woolf (translated): I didn&#39;t understand shit and had to go over each sentence two and three times - The Great Gatsby by Fitzgerald (english): comprehensible but still somewhat challenging for me (ik this one is supposed to be easy pls don&#39;t judge)</p",

The Haunting of Hill House for instance was an absolutely painful read. I stuck with it, but I was incredibly let down. I really cannot even think of one part that remotely had me on edge. Another Example is Stephen King\u2019s It. Don\u2019t get me wrong it was well written but it read more like a history book than a horror story to me. It was soooo slow moving and the suspense building for literally hundreds of pages was not worth the pay off. </p> <p>The book that hit all the right spots for me was The Exorcist. So well written. Excellent story. Excellent charact",
