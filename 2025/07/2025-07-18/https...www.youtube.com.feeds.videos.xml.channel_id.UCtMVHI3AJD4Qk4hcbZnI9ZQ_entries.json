        "description": "Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at recent bans of video games on Steam. These game bans have come not because they violate a law or even Steam's TOS, but rather companies like Mastercard and Visa have exerted their control to censor at will. I may not be a player of the games that are banned but this level of control that comes from a handful of companies that control our money needs to be examined. Thanks for watching!\nLike, Comment and Subscribe for more videos!",
