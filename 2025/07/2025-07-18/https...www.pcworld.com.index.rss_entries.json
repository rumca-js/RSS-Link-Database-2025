I\u2019ve been fascinated by time lapse videos ever since I saw the video effect used on a bean-sprout growing in second grade class.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to condense days of growth into a short video that I could watch in just a minute seemed like magic to me. What\u2019s more, it opened my mind to something about plants that you just can\u2019t see every day \u2014 the fact that they\u2019re not just inanimate things. They can move just like us (albeit a lot more slowly).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about making a time lapse video these days is you don\u2019t need a studio or specialist equipment to pull it off. It can be done with a mobile phone and / or a free app in Windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you\u2019re into a hobby that lends itself well to a time lapse (and that can be almost anything), why not make a time lapse video? Here are some ideas for inspiration:</p>\n\n\n\n<u",
