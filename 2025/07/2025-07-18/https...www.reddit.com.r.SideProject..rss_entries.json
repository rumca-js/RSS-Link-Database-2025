Really solid problem to solve and I was pumped to build it.</p> <p>Started coding and immediately fell into the infrastructure trap. Instead of building the actual recovery features, I spent literally 6 months trying to build HIPAA-compliant auth from scratch, setting up secure databases, building video call systems, basically becoming a security expert when I just wanted to help patients recover better.

Instead of spending hours recording, editing, and figuring out background music, PodGenius turns all that into beautifully generated, interactive audio experiences. Seriously, you just type in a few keywords, and BAM! It spits out an entire podcast with a voiceover, background music, and even uploads it straight to YouTube for you. Zero editing, zero scripting, zero headaches.</p> <p>I&#39;m talking about going from a random thought to a fully published podcast in literally a minute. No fancy recording studios, no sifting through endless hours of content \u2013 just pick your topics, hit a button, and boom! Your podcast is ready to go.</p> <p>I built th",
