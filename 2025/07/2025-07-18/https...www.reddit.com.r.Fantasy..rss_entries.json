I\u2019m currently working on a big world building project on my own time in hopes of creating a world that people can connect with and dive deep into. So far I\u2019ve been doing surface level work in all the different parts I could think of, geography, religion, culture, history, etc, but I want to get deeper. The issue is I\u2019m a little unsure of how I want things to go since my target audience is people who love to throw themselves into exploring the fantastical environment and culture of a world but I don\u2019t actually know a lot of people who read books or stories and really get into it. I figured I would try and reach out on the internet to see what everyone\u2019s favorite thing about a world may be. So I\u2019m asking what is an aspect of a fantasy world that really draws you in? The species, the religion, the cultures, the environment, or something else? I really appreciate any feedback or advice I can get or if maybe I should ask another community as well? \ud83d\ude4f</p",

Its been a good half a year of fantasy for me, so I thought I would share some quick reviews of the books / series I have read so far. Reviews listed below, which start from the beginning of the year, and end on what I am currently reading: </p> <p><strong>Cradle Series by Will Wight \u2013 <em>5/5</em>:</strong> This series is fantasy crack cocaine. I wrapped up the series at the beginning of 2025 with Dreadgod, Waybound and Threshold. These books are pure action-packed fun and are the definition of page turners. My favourite in the series was Wintersteel (that big Lindon reveal at the end was insane), least favourite was Bloodline. Threshold (the book of short stories) also didn\u2019t really hit for me. </p> <p><strong>Wind and Truth by Brandon Sanderson \u2013 <em>3.5/5</em>:</strong> I rounded this up to a 4 on goodreads. It was a good but flawed book. This is probably higher than the average rating",
