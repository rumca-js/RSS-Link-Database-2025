It\u2019s all fuzzy. I know it\u2019s cause of the digital to analog conversion I\u2019m doing, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any great hdmi to rca converters I can find.

Just for the floppy disk version.</p> <p>Not too long ago I managed to snag an original boxed copy of Daggerfall in excellent nick.

One that I had known for quite a while but had never beaten before, and the other one I had never played before. I often post about classic beat &#39;em ups here. The Sengoku series is good, but <strong><em>Sengoku 3</em></strong> is the best. Simply because it allows the gamer to execute insane combos with special attacks. The final boss (Evil Emperor) of the game isn&#39;t easy to beat, but the battle with him is so enjoyable. It certainly took multiple continues to beat him.</p> <p>Combo hits are the primary reason why I like beat &#39;em ups so much. When I see 20+ hits on the corner ",

After being stuck i the same area for quite some time, I finally made progress earlier today and beat the first major boss (I think) of the game. I had to grind to get 4 good Personas and get my first Heal All spell so I think there won&#39;t be a need for any grinding in the short term. I&#39;m eager to see where the game goes next so I&#39;m definitely playing more this weekend.</p> <p>I&#39;m also going to play a bit of Fantastic Four: Flame On (GBA) since the newest Fantastic Four movie is about to come out. This game is focused on Human Torch and the game has a lot of humor (health powerups are nurses, for example) so I&#39;m looking forward to playing this one again.</p> <p>What about you guys?

That&#39;s been well-covered elsewhere. What I wondered is this: Billy Mitchell set a score of 874,300 on Donkey Kong in 1982. That score wasn&#39;t beaten until Tim Sczerby set 879,200 in 2000 (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_high_score_competition\">source</a>). The record score then shot up quickly, exceeding 1 million in 2006, 1.1 million in 2012 and 1.2 million in 2016. How did that 1982 record stand for so long? Was no one playing DK competitively during 1983-1999? Did everyone just assume the 1982 score couldn&#39;t be beaten so no one tried? Did the release of MAME in the late 90s give people an edge in training (e.g. ability to use save states to practice specific sections of the game) that made it easier to beat the 1982 score?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
