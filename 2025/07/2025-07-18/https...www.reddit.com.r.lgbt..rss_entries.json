My family is homophobic and they constantly make hurtful comments and jokes (to the point that I&#39;ve had to go along with them to avoid raising suspicions) Is there a functional idea or advice that you have applied to clarify your ideas? I have many questions about what I want for myself and although it terrifies me to leave what I have (my family, my home, my friends) I also know that it&#39;s wrong to repress myself because they are not aligned with who I really am. Not even my best friend knows this, it&#39;s something very personal and tough for me, I was on therapy but I wasn&#39;t able to bring it out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Goga-06\"> /u/Goga-06 </a> <br/> <span><a h",
