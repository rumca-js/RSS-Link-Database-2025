I have the registry key ad applied it to a few test machines without issue. However, since we provide different services to our customers (we&#39;re not an MSP) our customers may have their own software, etc. </p> <p>From what i&#39;ve read, once the fix is implemented, it can prevent executable from running unless they&#39;re properly signed. This could hamper our customers, or it may not.</p> <p>This one has been sitting high on my list to get resolved, but i need good information to take to CAB review. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/outerlimtz\"> /u/outerlimtz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1m32a1h/microsoft_winverifytrust_signature_validation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1m32a1h/microsoft_winverifytrust_signature_validation/\">[",
