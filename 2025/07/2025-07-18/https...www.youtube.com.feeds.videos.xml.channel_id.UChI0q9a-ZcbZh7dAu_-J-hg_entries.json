Use code ECHELON at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: https://incogni.com/echelon\n\nThe Jeffrey Epstein Disaster of 2025, has now morphed into the \"Epstein Coverup\" of the Trump administration. With each side tripling down, and the obvious reality of far reaching corruption... a years old issue is now the mainstage talking point, as those involved try desperately to distance themselves. \n\nThe White House is now trapped in a scandal that has been slowly brewing since 2005, with no apparent way out. Their solution, is to execute the absolute worst coverup I have ever seen, and likely ever will. \n\n\nPART ONE (The Epstein Disaster): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4u62mbibqI&ab_channel=UpperEchelon\n\n\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: h",
