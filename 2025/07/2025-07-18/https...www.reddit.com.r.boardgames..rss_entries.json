I&#39;ve lost contact with the group I played it with, so I can&#39;t really ask them. I&#39;ve been googling everything I remember, but I cannot get anything that looks similar to it. Forgive me if I&#39;m getting some if this information wrong it was a long time ago. It was a board game set in space that was either pve or pvpve. The plot was something like evil space aliens are invading and you need to upgrade your ship and eventually kill them. I think the game used cards for your ship upgrades and you rolled dice to move around the board. The board had three rings or sections that you could travel around and when you felt ready to go to the next ring you can move their via warp drive or maybe even just doing one full rotation around the board. The closer to the middle of the board you got things got harder but the rewards were better. Eventua",

I\u2019m starting to get the hang of it maybe I\u2019ve won 1 game against the automa. </p> <p>What I really want to know is all about the factions. Which is the best pairing because I\u2019m playing against the automa most of the time and need every advantage I can get? Which is the funnest to play as? Which are the worst? With 14 factions I\u2019m a bit overwhelmed. </p> <p>My Review: I\u2019ve played 20 games (18 against the bot and 2 against my spouse) and I really like it. I like that you have to think and plan out each turn to efficiently use all the resources to gain victory points. Even though I\u2019ve only won 1 game I keep improving with each game so it feels challenging not defeating. I love engine building games and this one is great!</p> <p>I wish I got a little more theme like backstory on the aliens that relates to their perk might make it easier to remember ",

And one of the things I was curious about was the relation of how well games are rated as opposed to how few owners they seem to have. Essentially, what are the games in my collection that have few owners based on BGG, yet are very highly rated. </p> <p>So I selected out all of the games that are not in BoardGameGeek top #1000 and they have no more than 5000 owners on BGG and have been released before 2024. I then applied a simple formula that boosted the games based on how good their ratings on BGG were based on how small their owner count was. </p> <p>So, basically these games seem to be essentially still in this undiscovered zone, even if some of you may have heard about (especially the first one I guess). And at the same time despite having high ratings, they have fewer owners than mos",
