        "description": "In theory, you wouldn\u2019t be who you are without your brain. But when a 44-year-old Frenchman visited the doctor and got a brain scan, the results seemed to show he didn\u2019t have a brain at all! Or, at least, not the kind anyone had seen before. At 10% of its normal size due to the Lateral Ventricles filling up with cerebrospinal fluid, he still appeared to have been living a normal life. All of the important bits were still in tact which just goes to show how adaptable the human body can be.",
