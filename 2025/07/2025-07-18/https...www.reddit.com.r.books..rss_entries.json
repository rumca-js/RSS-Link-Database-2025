Spanning over 500+ pages, it is what I would describe to be Ishiguro\u2019s most courageous work. The story operates in a curious, dreamy sense of unreality. The lines between the protagonist\u2019s memories and the reality occasionally dissolve, offering unsettling glimpses into his character. This work is, by far, the most vivid and realistic description of an anxiety dream that I have ever read. You will either find its dreamlike style growing on you, or you toss it after a few chapters.</p> <p>To give you a sense of what unfolds in the book: Mr. Ryder, an internationally renowned pianist, finds himself in a small town preparing for a crucial performance ahead, but how he got there, what is he supposed to play, what does his schedule look like, he has no recollection of.
