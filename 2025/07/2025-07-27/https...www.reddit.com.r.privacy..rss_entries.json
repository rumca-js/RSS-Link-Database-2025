Im not so tech savvy so I don&#39;t understand much tbh so, sorry if it doesn&#39;t make sense x) It never happened before so I&#39;m wondering if it could be the reason. I don&#39;t have trouble with anything else, even streaming high quality videos. If this is bc of a privacy feature its fine by me, I&#39;m just curious.

Is there a possibility that a bad sector where veracrypt stores the internal information would end up corrupting the rest of the data as well?</p> <p>If yes, is there maybe a simpler solution? Like I am thinking something as simple as a basic hash generated using your passkey that creates some bits that can be added/subtracted from your data. That way if a sector goes bad, I guess the rest of your data can still be decrypted.</p> <p>I just want my data to be safe from an average guy out there who might find the drive in case I lose it, and don&#39;t care about the SOTA encrypt methods.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/USBhupinderJogi\"> /u/USBhupinderJogi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1mafyrh/technically_easy_way_to_encrypt_an_external_hard/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.r",
