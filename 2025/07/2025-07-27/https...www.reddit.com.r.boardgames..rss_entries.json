I&#39;m more like the guy that has a friend with ton of Board Games, so i get to play them. Well, that&#39;s the short story, and now i&#39;m planning on opening a caf\u00e9 with Board games.<br/> The idea is that people can go there and play a board game that we would have for rent. Basically, being able to play games that are not exactly cheap. Also, with a lot of board games requiring long sesions, people would be able to just ask for food while still playing.<br/> To make sure that people don&#39;t damage the Board games with food, i&#39;m planning on also using mini-tables for the food.
