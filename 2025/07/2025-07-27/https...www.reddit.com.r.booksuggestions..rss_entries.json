The story then doesnt make him a bad person and we get to read about the pain it causes the mmc to betray a person they love which is so heartbreaking. The fmc should be a person they love and it doesn&#39;t matter if us readers know about the mmc pretending. </p> <p>An example would be Cruel Prince, where &gt;! Carden pretends to send Jude to exile to protect her but Jude doesnt know so she hates Carden until the truth is revealed !&lt; Another example is a fanfiction called Mancaled by senliyu (not sure if fanfiction can be given as an example). This one goes one step further where the &gt;! mmc hurts the fmc !&lt; but basic trope is the same. </p> <p>Any suggestions are welcome",

I started reading Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari today expecting it to be a brief history of the world but noticed that the book is more \u201csocio-political\u201d, though that might be a fault on my behalf because I was assuming it to be a full on history book instead of anthropology(?) or whatever it is.</p> <p>So I\u2019m asking if you have any good world history books to recommend. I obviously know that one book isn\u2019t enough to cover all of the world\u2019s history but I\u2019m just looking for something that mentions most the main civilizations throughout history. But also I\u2019d appreciate it if you recommended a book that covers certain parts of history/places/years etc. (For example, brief history of Rome or The 18th century) etc.</p> <p>Thanks in advance \ud83d\ude42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/someoneindacrowd\"> /u/someoneindacrowd </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/",

I&#39;ve found that even reading or watching movies/TV that takes place in France helps me keep up my interest so I&#39;m looking for any suggestions. I mostly read high fantasy novels but I&#39;m not dead set on that. Historical Fiction that takes place in France or a French speaking country would be great also, and probably a lot more options because I don&#39;t typically read this genre. I&#39;d ever consider a romance novel if it was interesting enough and related to France somehow.</p> <p>And just to be clear I&#39;m not looking for a study aide or novel written in French. I have plenty to keep me busy when I&#39;m learning French so this is more of a relaxing hobby to let my mind take a break and stop trying to think in French. I&#39;ll be reading the book in English.

Something most of the aforementioned have in common is, well, that the plot is happening deep in the woods and something&#39;s... off... and even supernatural. This opens the scene to exploring the human nature and its extremes and that was been really fascinating for me to read! And I love to see that the characters are as scared/surpised as me when reading.
