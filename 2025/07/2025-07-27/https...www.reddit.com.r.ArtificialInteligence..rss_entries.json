But AI has been scaring me lately, with it taking jobs, automating everything and just overall making my passion useless as a career. So my question is What can I do as a 17 year old to ensure I have a future in AI when I&#39;m older? should I learn how to make my own AI, learn how to implement AI into everyday life etc.</p> <p>I am going into engineering in university and I might specialize in Computer or Electrical Engineering but At this point I don&#39;t even know if I should do that if the future is going to be run by AI.
