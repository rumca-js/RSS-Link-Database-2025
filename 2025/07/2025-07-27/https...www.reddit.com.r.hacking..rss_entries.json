We believe he had over 60 million pounds worth of bitcoin spread between a few wallets. Unfortunately, my mother formatted his hard drive, leaving us only a memory stick which looks to be veracrypt encrypted.</p> <p>His passwords were predominantly names or simple words followed by 3-4 digits, sometimes 2 names/words in combination. I have pasted the hash below.</p> <p>I am placing a bounty of \u00a36 million/10% of my Dad&#39;s bitcoin to whoever is able to crack this hash.
