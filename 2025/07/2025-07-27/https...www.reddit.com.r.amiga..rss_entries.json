        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have installed igame in winuae and work without problem. Now i want to have screenshots for my games, not the default icon for all of them. I have a zip file with screenshot collection. I tried to unzip one of them in some directory and add them to igame like game directory repository. After that i made rescan but nothing&#39;s happened. The games icons are still the same for all of them. Only if i copy the iff file to game directory then the screenshot appears correctly. Is it possible to extract the screenshots to different directory? Do the game directories have exactly the same name as the screenshots directories? How could i install screenshots in igames for all of my games?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/denis1276\"> /u/denis1276 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1max7oa/igame_screenshots/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amig",
