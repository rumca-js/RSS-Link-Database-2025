Eventually your headset will run all out of power and die since the cable doesn\u2019t charge enough to keep up with it.</p> <p>Unless there\u2019s an extra usb c port on the data cable that can support fast charging.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the Quest 3 but also other headsets like the Play for Dream which probably requires even more power to sustain it\u2019s playtime without the headset dying.</p> <p>So you either need a pc connecting cable with an extra USB c port to allow for a fast walk charger.</p> <p>Or you\u2019ll need to have a powerbank and a router which is just a more expensive option.<",

I&#39;m unsure about what to do with it.</p> <p>Looking around on the Internet, it seems that people have mixed opinions about wether you can sell the actual account or not, and I&#39;ve looked at the refund policy, still unsure wether I&#39;m eligible for refunding the games or not (ive had it for a year+). One person said that I could tag it along with the sale of the headset itself, but can not add any extra cost, so at that point I might aswell keep it.</p> <p>I need advice. Can i sell the account? Can I refund or sell the games in some way? Could I somehow add it and some extra cost to the sale of the headset?
