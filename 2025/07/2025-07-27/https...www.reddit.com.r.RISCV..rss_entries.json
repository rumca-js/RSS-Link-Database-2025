It feels too much like setting up a phone,<br/> and I find that process quite annoying.<br/> What I would like to do is boot Linux from an external hard drive,<br/> but I\u2019m not sure how to achieve this. I imagine it should work<br/> similarly to my Raspberry Pi 4, where I just plug in a USB hard drive<br/> and boot from it, but I have my doubts.<br/> Also, I like customizing Linux a lot, and I\u2019m not a big fan of the default base version that comes with the Lichee Pi.<br/> Could anyone recommend a good Linux system for the Lichee Pi 4 or give me advice on how to boot from an external drive?<br/> Thanks!
