Most of the tasks I\u2019ve tried, hoping they\u2019d save me time, have actually ended up taking more time instead.</p> <p>I get that it\u2019s still early days. Agent Mode feels like it\u2019s in its \u201cGPT 2 stage\u201d right now. In all the demo videos I\u2019ve seen, people seem frustrated with the current use cases, like buying clothes or scheduling tasks. What we really want is for it to handle real, meaningful work.</p> <p>Honestly, I doubt OpenAI will release something that can fully replace someone\u2019s job for just $20/month.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>curious what everyone thinks is coming with the teased release of <em>GPT-5</em> in August. I&#39;m personally looking forward to the huge update to intelligence and competence. heard Sam talk about the model picker being messy and most seem to agree with that so hopefully that&#39;s going away asap. i spend so much time just asking ChatGPT about which strong suits each model has, and while it is fun to mess around with each and see different results, it would be better suited as just maybe GPT-5o and then maybe one or two lighter models (<em>mini&#39;s</em>) for very specific categories of things. What are some things you hope to see improved or changed in this coming update? <strong>let me know</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/studiocookies_\"> /u/studiocookies_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1madhsk/predictions_on_improvements_coming_with_gpt5/\">[link]",
