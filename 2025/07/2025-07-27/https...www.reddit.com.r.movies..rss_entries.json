Personally, I prefer &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot;, not just because it gives Candy a better foil with Dan Aykroyd, but because it perfectly captures the look and feel of a vacation in the Midwest, specifically WI/MN at a lake. When Candy and Aykroyd are sitting on the cabin deck looking out at the lake, I want to be there with them. And then we get my favorite exchange in the movie.</p> <p>&quot;I see the underdeveloped resources of Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, a consortium exploiting over a billion dollars in forest products. I see a paper mill and a mining operation, a green belt between lakeside condos and a waste management facility focusing on the newest rage in waste: Medical refuse.
