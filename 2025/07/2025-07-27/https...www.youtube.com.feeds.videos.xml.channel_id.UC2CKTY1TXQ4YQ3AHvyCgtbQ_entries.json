        "description": "That's right: Gen Con, the largest tabletop gaming convention in the country, is next week and I'll be there again. I'll be checking out all the cool new games, see the weird and unknown, and hopefully have fun and get good footage. And if you're there, I'll be having a meet-up as well. I'll talk about that, and of course I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made ANOTHER game!
