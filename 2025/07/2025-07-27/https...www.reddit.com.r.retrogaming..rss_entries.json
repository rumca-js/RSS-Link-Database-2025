A lot of posts on this sub ask for your favorite X, or best Y, and I think it would be good for the community to allow for images in the comments so we can immediately show what we&#39;re talking about. It would drive up engagement, make interactive posts more fun, and it&#39;s a good way to show people things they don&#39;t know about.<br/> So I kindly ask of the moderation team to allow for images in the comments.
