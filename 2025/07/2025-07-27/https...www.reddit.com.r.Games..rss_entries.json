When something similar happened with <strong>Magicka Wizard Wars</strong> i decided to make a &quot;Wizard combat game&quot; on my own. </p> <p><em>How is it different from other ARPGs?</em> It&#39;s definitely more deliberate in how skills/spells are used. You can combo and counter almost any spell if you have the right ability on hand.</p> <p>Focus is on PvP first, with modes like Deathmatch and Capture the Flag. PvE/Co-op will start with smaller challenge modes (already in the game) and once PvP is in a good state I&#39;ll shift development to more complex PvE content.</p> <p>Playtests 2025, Early Access 2026.</p> <p><strong>Steam:</strong> <a href=\"https://stor",
