It restores the removed worlds of <strong>Akaria</strong> and <strong>Sakkara</strong>, along with other cut areas from the original game. The mod is now much more polished and fully playable.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested, feel free to join the <strong>Sphinx Discord community</strong> to stay up to date with the latest news about the mod and the game.<br/> Below you\u2019ll find a link to the mod trailer and an invite to the Discord server.</p> <p>Trailer: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/XH86_KtcudI?si=pc2KTxpLKhXn8Qpc\">https://youtu.be/XH86_KtcudI?si=pc2KTxpLKhXn8Qpc</a></p> <p>Sphinx discord: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbERxN0JuOW1aRXNYano4N0tBbGo1UVZtNnJ4UXxBQ3Jtc0trWG5RZTV5U3JZdUk4aVRpeDNNTXpadTRBNDY2NGJHYnUycmNXWHVOS19TTkpkYXZpRmFQQ1ZULWFFcFdnT3JnSzIxR1dvQUhFdDgzN1p",
