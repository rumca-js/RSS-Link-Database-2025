Before I double down and spend more time on this (I am thinking this could be an open source developer tool with perhaps a usage based pricing on a cloud offering), does anyone want a tool like this or do you want to roll your own?</p> <p>In short, it is to authorise an agent to read/write to an external api. The agent makes a request that sends a notification to a human request owner. The human then reviews and grants permission to make that request on behalf of the human user (human needs to authenticate using auth0/azure/can configure other options). My auth service then gives the agent a token to make only that specific request (write, order for 1 chicken fry, expires in 5 minutes). When the request hits the api, the api service owner gets a notification to approve the action. If ",
