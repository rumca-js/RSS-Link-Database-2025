I seem to be all about the jank with everythign I do these days and have built a new open air frame threadripper system with a hot swap caddy to house my 16TB Exos HDD&#39;s array. As I was shoving that into the rack as best as I could. I perched the hotswap caddy right on the front edge as I miscalcualted sizes and things didnt fit how I tought they would. Well fast forward to plugging in power cables at back of new system. At least I had some sense to make sure everything was switched of and it was just cold unpowered cables going in. So nothign spinning.</p> <p>But like the donkey that I am, I carelessly pushed too hard on the frame as i was pluggin in power and that nudged the HDD caddy forward off the front of the shelf and it tipped off the rack!!! </p> <p>The whole thing fell slgihtly off-vertical, total drop was about 6 inches onto soft carpet. Everythign starts up fine and no errors have been reported. Did ",

I also have a JBOD with a couple of Exos and an IronWolf drive. I&#39;m looking for a replacement for that 4TB that would be primary, active storage for my photos and video. (I&#39;d use an M2 as video editing and then save the results back to the spinning disk) Looking at GoHardDrive and ServerPartsDeals, I can get a 14TB Ultrastar HC530 (that&#39;s CMR) for $150, or a 12TB IronWolf for $180.</p> <p>Would you buy a manufacturer recertified drive for inside your PC? Or should I look for a new drive?</p> <p>If so, would you choose the Ultrastar or the IronWolf? Does it matter if you&#39;re using a &quot;NAS&quot; drive inside your PC? Which would be louder? Which would have better performance?</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/evildad53\"> /u/evildad53 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
