But lately on the internet I\u2019ve seen people using it as a way of degrading gay men, or making fun of them, and it\u2019s strange. Obviously it\u2019s not a slur, but to use it like that makes me uncomfortable. Plus, people don\u2019t know what it means, and will just call any random person a twink which doesn\u2019t make sense. Why would you think Pedro pascal is a twink. Be serious. I know this is such a small issue in the grand scheme of things and I\u2019m not trying to imply that gay men are the biggest target in the community, I know I\u2019ve got so much privilege\u2026 but I don\u2019t understand why straight people or younger queer people use the term twink the way they do.

It feels like freedom in a country that doesn\u2019t give them much of it.</p> <p>But the second I step outside that space or scroll social media it\u2019s immediately being slapped back into reality. The hate, erasure and constant censorship is overwhelming. People say the cruelest shit about LGBTQ folks like it\u2019s nothing. And the government acts like we don\u2019t exist unless we\u2019re a \u201cproblem\u201d to be dealt with. All of the supports and groups get shut down, everything about queer content gets wiped, even harmless online posts get flagged. It\u2019s like we\u2019re being pushed underground all over again.</p> <p>What hurts the most is that it feels like most people just don\u2019t care.
