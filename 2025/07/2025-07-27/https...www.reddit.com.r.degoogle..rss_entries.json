But today, their phones are strong alternatives. They offer real privacy tools and features without Google\u2019s tracking. You get a clean system focused on user needs, not ads. Huawei\u2019s phones now run HarmonyOS, which works smoothly and has its own app store. It\u2019s time to see why Huawei is the best choice for cutting Google out of your life.</p> <p>Huawei beats many brands on price and quality. Take the P60 Pro: it costs $899, $100 less than the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Yet it has a better camera system with a 48MP main sensor and variable aperture for sharper low-light photos. Battery life lasts 1.5 days compared to iPhone\u2019s 1 day. Charging hits 88W, filling the battery in 40 minutes. Even mid-range models like the Nova 9 ($499) outperform rivals. It has a 120Hz OLED screen and Snapdragon 778G chip, beating Samsung\u2019s A54 ($529) which",
