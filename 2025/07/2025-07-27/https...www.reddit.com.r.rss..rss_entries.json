Choose the topics you&#39;re interested in (e.g. AI, Bonds, Africa)<br/> 2. Choose the sources you trust - I have linked over 70 sources so far from outlets that bother to make their feeds accessible (you would be surprised by how many trusted news sources gatekeep! The Economist and The Times to name and shame!) </p> <p>You end up with a real-time feed only from sources and topics you have chosen/care about. Hopefully this provides a solution to feeling overwhelmed by so many articles being published everyday! </p> <p>Let me know what you think. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",
