        "description": "For Mafia: The Old Country, developer Hangar 13 is culturally resetting the series. We\u2019ve already discussed new mechanical and gameplay elements set to be introduced in other features so here, we\u2019re going to discuss the differences Mafia: The Old Country harbours over its predecessor Mafia 3, focusing specifically on its non-gameplay elements: narrative, structure, themes, tone, and artistic presentation. \n\nIndeed, after gameplay and mechanical differences have been stripped away, we\u2019re still left with starkly contrasting experiences between the two titles. Mafia: The Old Country represents not only a cultural shift for the series, but it\u2019s the culmination of a philosophical refinement in how to craft games from the developer behind the series.\n\nBoth are Mafia games, but for The Old Country, the meaning has shifted.",

        "description": "Madden NFL 26 is set to be the biggest overhaul of EA Sport\u2019s long-running American Football simulation franchise that we\u2019ve seen in a long time. Wholesale updates are coming to Franchise Mode, with particular emphasis on coaches. \n\nStrategic calls will be deeper and more meaningful, athlete management more involved, crafting the perfect gameplan more intuitive. EA Sports have zeroed in on detail too, utilising real-life NFL data to devise their AI systems. Furthermore, boons to presentation are set to ensure that actually playing Madden has the look and feel of a primetime TV broadcast. \n\nThere\u2019s so much to unpack! This feature expands some of this year\u2019s new inclusions further, outlining NFL 26\u2019s biggest differences over last year\u2019s version.",
