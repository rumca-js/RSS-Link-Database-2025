My two case options are:</p> <p>1) Argon Neo 5 M.2 NVME case. From what I&#39;ve seen, this seems to be a very good option that will keep everything neat and tidy.</p> <p>2) Official Raspberry Pi 5 Bumper + M.2 hat + Official Active Cooler. This will be less neat than the Argon case, but simpler.</p> <p>My use case is that it&#39;ll get quite light use as I experiment with using Linux as a desktop system. It&#39;ll mostly be used for web browsing and YouTube etc so nothing too taxing. However, I will say that I have an old Pi 4 in a FLIRC case that gets quite warm to the touch, but that is only using passive cooling - the two options here will have active cooling instead.</p> <p>Would the Argon case give much better cooling than active cooler on the open system? Are there any other reasons to pick one over the other? ",

I usually write an update in Thonny and manually update the <a href=\"http://main.py\">main.py</a> files when I meet them personally. </p> <p>Is there a way for my clients to easily update the <a href=\"http://main.py\">main.py</a> file with a laptop or tablet or phone? Maybe attach it and see the storage without pushing the button on the Pico (it is concealed WAY in the device, not reachable)? Even pressing the button and inserting the usb into a laptop, the <a href=\"http://main.py\">main.py</a> file is not visible in file explorer.</p> <p>I use the uf2 files provided by RPI.</p> <p>Any ideas, thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/maloside\"> /u/maloside </a> <br/> <span><a hre",

Both the &quot;player&quot; and the cartridges will be &quot;dumb&quot; devices a fun way to trigger a movie to play that has an analogue feel to it. (I&#39;m stoked to add LEDs and possibly even a motor/solenoid/etc. inside to give it a mechanical feel.)</p> <p>So what I&#39;m looking for is the simplest way to turn &quot;I picked this cartridge&quot; into playing that movie file. </p> <p>I&#39;ve found $15 USB barcode readers that can scan a barcode and return it as text on the PC, so I could make a s",
