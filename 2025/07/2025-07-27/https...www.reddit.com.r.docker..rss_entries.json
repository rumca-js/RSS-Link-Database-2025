        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, I&#39;m new to docker/docker compose, and I&#39;m trying to setup something very simple as a test to learn. I am putting up a mealie instance in a docker container, but I already have a host running postgresql that I want to use, with a user and database setup. If you look at the docker compose file provided by mealie below, it has a value &quot; POSTGRES_SERVER: postgres&quot; which very clearly points it to the postgres container that this stack makes. I don&#39;t want that, I will remove it from the stack, but I DO want to point it at my server instance of course. How can I make it take a hostname instead? Or failing that, can I just plugin an IP address and will it work? Do I need to specify it in a different way because it&#39;s not a container? Thanks in advance.</p> <p>``` services: mealie: image: ghcr.io/mealie-recipes/mealie:v3.0.2 # container_name: mealie restart: always ports: - &quot;9925:9000&quot; # deploy: resources: limits: memo",
