I\u2019ve absolutely loved shows like <em>House of Cards</em>, <em>The West Wing</em>, and the Danish series <em>Borgen</em>. That intense political maneuvering, backroom deals, and high-stakes drama just keeps me hooked.</p> <p>So now I&#39;m looking for a <strong>book</strong> (or book series) that can give me that same kind of vibe.</p> <p>Here are a few things I\u2019m looking for:</p> <ol> <li>I love <strong>long books</strong>, so preferably something around <strong>500 pages or more</strong>. I enjoy really diving deep into characters and storylines.</li> <li>It would be a bonus if it\u2019s part of a <strong>series</strong>, so I can stay in that world a little longer \u2014 but it\u2019s not a deal-breaker if it\u2019s a standalone.</li> <li>I&#39;d really prefer if the story had a <strong>realistic political tone</strong> \u2014 not dystopian or over",

But lately I\u2019ve been wanting to change that. I want to spend less time on my phone and more time reading and learning.

What stood out to me this time was the raw vulnerability of the unnamed narrator. It&#39;s almost painful to witness his descent into idealizing Nastenka, and how far removed his fantasy is from reality. Made me think a lot about how we sometimes construct entire worlds in our heads. Anyone else have a deep connection with this one, or particular parts that stuck with you?

Never used this sub before, I decided I needed something new to read, since the last few books I read (and actually liked) weren\u2019t what I expected, and they totally changed how I think about the kinds of books I enjoy.</p> <p>Traditionally, I found myself <em>trying</em> to read light/YA fantasy (which I still love), but it always took me a long time to get through them. Then a while back, I read a book that I picked up because it looked cool and was set in the Philippines (I have a bunch of pen pals there), called <strong><em>Patron Saints of Nothing</em></strong>. It\u2019s about a Filipino-American kid going back to the Philippines to uncover the truth behind his cousin\u2019s death. No spoilers, but the book explores identity, race, family, government, the Catholic Church, death, truth, and drugs, and I thought it was amazing.</p> <p>After that, I read <strong><em>The Hate U Give</em></strong>, which had been banned in the school district I\u2019m part of",
