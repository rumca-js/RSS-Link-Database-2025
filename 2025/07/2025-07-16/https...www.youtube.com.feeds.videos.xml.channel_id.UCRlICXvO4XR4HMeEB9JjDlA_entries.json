A heavyweight hiding in the shadows, tugging at distant asteroids with its invisible gravitational tentacles like some kind of celestial puppet master.\n\nSo why haven\u2019t we seen it? Well, it\u2019s far\u2014600 AU from the Sun, to be precise. That\u2019s twenty times further than Neptune. And although we've spotted exoplanets millions of times further away, the irony is that our methods for doing so\u2014like transit photometry\u2014don\u2019t work well within our own solar system. It's like finding a yeti in the Himalayas while being oblivious to the one in your garden.\n\nThe hunt began over a century ago with a chap named Percival Lowell.
