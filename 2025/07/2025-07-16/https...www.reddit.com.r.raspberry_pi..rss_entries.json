Somewhat randomly it would stop working, and required reflashing the device. While throubleshooting, I noticed that sometimes it would not even complete hass boot, giving several storage related errors, but taking off the top part of the case, it would boot again and stay without issues, but can&#39;t leave it like that forever. Have tried using duct tape on the case in the region of USB-A and RJ45, since it looked like it would make contact, but didn&#39;t change a thing, have already disassembled and reassembled it several times without change in behaviour.</p> <p>Have tried using sd card, and this way I see stability, but was really hoping for using NVME. Anyone has any suggestion?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www",
