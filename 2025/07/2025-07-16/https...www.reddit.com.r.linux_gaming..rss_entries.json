Bazzite is immutable so it means it&#39;s impossible to break but on the other hand I have the 9070xt and wanted to try out FSR4.

Before nuking my W10 install on my main PC I wanted to try out linux on my old laptop, an MSI GP60 with an NVidia 740M (yes, it&#39;s ancient).</p> <p>I both installed Debian (with Xfce) and later additionally (dual booting) CachyOS (with Gnome) and the laptop runs great with both.

I have about a year of experience with debian-based Distros before switching to windows due to lack of game support and now the support has been increased which makes me want to try out a Linux distro more but these two I&#39;m getting stuck between. I am mainly looking for something stable, and partially easy to use (i dont mind going through the terminal). And also looking for some distro with more application support (not sure if this would matter but please take this into account if it does). I am also looking for the Distro that would provide the most performace too.(Other distros are also fine if they meet the criteria. Also <strong>NO ARCH OR ARCH BASED DISTROS.</strong> I personally would like something from the Debian or Fedor",

I am done with Microsoft&#39;s \ud83d\udca9, so I want to switch to a distro that will further my tech curiosity and help me with getting those gaming achievements. The pc I have in hardware terms is quite old, it has intel i5 2nd cpu, 12GB of ram, no graphics card as this is a dell sff pc. I am newish to linux, dabbled a bit in kali and ubuntu desktop so I know linux is command line. Which distro would be the best choice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Individual-Base-489\"> /u/Individual-Base-489 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1m1d2d8/the_best_distro/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1m1d2d8/the_best_distro/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;ve been an active Linux user for about 3 or 4 months, ever since I got a new laptop and installed Linux Mint alongside Windows 11 in a dual-boot setup. Mint has made me really happy, and I no longer use Windows 11 on my laptop at all because I get better battery life, more control, customization, and a bunch of other features I really value.</p> <p>With that in mind, I decided to do the same on my desktop PC, which I mainly use for gaming (AMD Ryzen 9 7900X 12C, GeForce RTX 4070 Ti). I ended up installing Nobara on a separate partition. The thing is, even though I enjoy experimenting and learning by solving issues (and Nobara did come with a few, like graphics glitches after sleep mode), I\u2019m starting to question the point of this setup.</p> <p>Even after installing Wine and other tools, I don\u2019t really see the benefit of playing games\u2014already installed on my W11 partition\u2014from within Nobara.

No stuttering and very consistent smooth frame rate, I&#39;m running Bazzite on ROG laptop with RTX 2070 8gigs, 32gigs RAM, i7 10th gen. External monitor is a pretty nice one with high refresh rate but only 1080p which is fine for me. Got the settings set to Ultra, native resolution, DLSS on Quality. No frame generation, and no ray tracing. Game looks great and running smooth but occasionally just decides to fully lock up. It does a full freeze, then 1 frame skip, sound still going. Then just have to minimize the game and force shut it down. When this happens and how often seems unpredictable, can happen after 20min of playing or it might run great for 3hrs. I&#39;ve tried different proton versions doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference. Any idea why its doing it? any tweaks to fix it?</p> </",

I initially installed it on a system that uses a ryzen 3 pro 2200g. I know this is not a fantastic processor and to boot I was using the integrated Vega 8 graphics. However, when I would launch a game, the &quot;processing vulkan shaders&quot; box would pop up and take a few minutes, then the game would run fine. Fast forward, I decided to drop an rtx 2070 super into the system to see how adding a graphics card would work. Mind you I completely wiped the initial install of bazzite and reinstalled bazzite using a new bootable flash drive with the selected Nvidia options from the bazzite website. Everything seemed like it was running OK until I decided to try to run games. Now the &quot;processing vulkan shaders&quot; takes an absurd amount of time. Likely would take hours if I let it finish. This clearly can&#39;t be normal. I was wondering if anyone had any idea of why this was ",

So, I installed both the rar and unrar command lines and attempted to use them on the game folder and it didn&#39;t work. I tried opening the folder with both File Roller and Files, which are both apps native to the Ubuntu install on my laptop and neither worked. Then, I decided to use the official rar software (on my PC as &quot;rarlinux&quot; with some numbers/letters after it) and it didn&#39;t work. Deleted and redownloaded the game to make sure I didn&#39;t mess with the files enough to make it un-unrar-able. Still didn&#39;t work. The only rar and unrar command that worked was &quot;a&quot;, so I used it to extract the main game file, which is a .exe.
