        "description": "I was dismayed to see the Professor of Rock's posts over the last couple of days - where he explained that it was becoming impossible to show his album countdowns and even an interview without being hit by copyright claims.

So what should we do?\n\nTo come and see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #musicreview",
