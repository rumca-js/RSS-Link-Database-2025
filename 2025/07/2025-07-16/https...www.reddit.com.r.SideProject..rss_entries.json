So 2020 I locked in and I&#39;ve been coding ever since (mostly in university, I&#39;m a CS student / + online courses ). School kind of sucked the fun out of it for me icl.. Coding started to feel like stress, not creativity.</p> <p>This year though, I took a UI/UX class that flipped everything for me.

Always have.</p> <p>So I asked ChatGPT:</p> <p><strong>\u201cCan you interview me (step by step) to help me come up with a niche saas project idea?",

We wanted to experience a real adventure with locals. We also noticed that travel agencies made all the prices almost 2x higher.</p> <p>We saw a clear problem and that gave us a business idea: a service where we find and vet the local operators in customers destination, so they can skip the expensive markup from travel agencies and save a ton of time and money.</p> <p>Another problem our business solves is the time that goes into trip planning. The locals can also help our customers plan their trip and that makes their life much easier.</p> <p>Our MVP is just a tally form where people can put their trip info and we will manually find the guide for them. We are probably looking to expand into a platform in the future.</p> <p><a href=\"https://tally.so/r/mRqD1l\">https://tally.so/r/mRqD1l</a></p> <p>Any feedback is greatly appr",
