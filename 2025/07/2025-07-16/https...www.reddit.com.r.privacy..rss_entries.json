Obviously my number got leaked/sold by someone. I&#39;m aware that there&#39;s no shortage of services that will help prevent these calls. But I&#39;m pretty annoyed at the idea of paying $10 a month just to not have all of these spam calls. So a couple questions.</p> <p>1.) Is there a way to manually figure out myself how to get my number removed? The calls change numbers every single time, so blocking them doesn&#39;t do anything. Already filed for a private number with the FCC, but obviously that doesn&#39;t do much. Curious if there&#39;s any other free options I can try?</p> <p>2.) Which paid service is the best for this? Aura seems to be the top recommended one, but curious if anyone else has other recommendations.</p> <p>Thanks for any and all advice!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",

I must have several hundred accounts from various platforms associated with the email- I don&#39;t even know what I might have tied to it.</p> <p>How do I even begin to clean this? How do I find what services use my email for accounts? If I delete the email should it also deactivate the accounts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/voidprophet__\"> /u/voidprophet__ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1m10eyh/how_to_go_about_cleaning_up_and_old_email/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1m10eyh/how_to_go_about_cleaning_up_and_old_email/\">[comments]</a></span>",
