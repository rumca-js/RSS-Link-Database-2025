Going in, I\u2019ll say I was skeptical because the \u2018web interface for usenet\u2019 concept sounded interesting but gimmicky. Surprisingly, it\u2019s straightforward. Log in, run searches, click. I like the thumbnails too. </p> <p>I\u2019m not running into much I can\u2019t locate and overall, the search has been effective. Speeds aren\u2019t as fast as a regular Usenet setup, but there\u2019s a tradeoff for not needeing indexers, clients etc. </p> <p>A couple things I\u2019m curious about:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Search filters:</strong> There are tons of fiter options I haven\u2019t played with yet. Any recs for optimal settings? </li> <li><strong>NZBs:</strong> I noticed an NZB download button in the search area.
