Currently I can end up with between $600 to $800 back to me after selling the 4090 if I buy an MSI Vanguard. The Vanguard seems to OC very nicely which closes the gap with the 4090 in some ways.<br/> I also saw a video or two about PCVR actually working better in some cases due to the new codec used with VD?<br/> In any case, its tempting to get that money back but just wondering what you guys think about PCVR and of course the 16GB vs 24GB situation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shaolin95\"> /u/shaolin95 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1m1jvhm/going_from_4090_to_5080_for_pcvr_quest3_headsetok/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comment",

I currently have over 50 actual games on my list that I want to play. And these don&#39;t even count the uevr games which I&#39;ll definitely load up. It&#39;s been a long time since gear vr haha.</p> <p>If I&#39;m honest, I do care about graphics a lot. But there are still a fair amount of good graphical games. If I add in the cool experiences (I haven&#39;t researched any yet), I probably have over 2 years of playtime to look forward to. Add in uevr and yeah wow.</p> <p>Ironically, 3 of the most praised games are not on my list. I looked at gameplay videos and they just don&#39;t look interesting to me at all. Those are superhot, boneworks, and blade and sorcery.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",

Ive always found it has the most satisfying sword combat out of the games ive played, but there is one problem.</p> <p>Every single time I play one way or another it will freeze for at least 30 seconds, the game still plays so I can still get hit and die but I stay completely frozen. I think it happens because the enemies can flail out and lag the shit out of the game but sometimes it just happens.</p> <p>I really dont understand why it does this, ive lowered the graphics to the lowest they will go and it still does this, I have an RTX 3060, Ryzen 9 5900x, and 32gb of ram so I can even run half life alyx with barely any stutters. Anyone have any idea what\u2019s wrong? Is it just badly optimized?

If I could name it, I could go about trying to fix it for them (assuming they are experiencing the same issue). The issue is one where the object I&#39;m focusing on appears to be in a different location for each eye, such that it moves if you alternate closing shutting each eye.

The next game Im looking at is RE7 VR. I plan to give asseto corsa a shot in the future as well. I also play beat saber, pistol whip and mini golf native on the Q3.</p> <p>My PC has a ryzen 5600, rtx 3090 and 32gb of ram. I connect my Q3 to it with virtual desktop. It plays all games Ive tried well</p> <p>I&#39;d like to ask this subreddit&#39;s opinion if getting a pimax crystal super with the high fov module would be worth the purchase?

My play space starts about 5 feet away from my desk where my router is and I\u2019d like to know if this will give me any noticeable improvement as I just bought the puppis router since it\u2019s clean and small and matches my desk but 80$ for little to no improvement wouldn\u2019t be great. Other people do use my WiFi mainly for TV and some games if that matters.</p> <p>TL;DR: Is it worth getting a dedicated router to just put right next to my homes router</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DogBoi111407\"> /u/DogBoi111407 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/com",
