Right now I have a 2 1TB HDD for storage and an 124 GB NVME for OS. For now it will fit but I keep in mind expanding it so I keep the options available. For the backup I\u2019m planning on using an external drive and compressing the data into it and/or using Amazon glacier. I\u2019ve seen that in the dedicated OS\u2019s (like trueNAS and Proxmox) it\u2019s not that convenient to upgrade the storage unless you buy a few more drives. As I know I want to keep it simple and not that costly I wanted to research the options to expand storage cheaply before I dig in. I\u2019ve seen that if I just use Ubuntu I can merge drive mounts but I wanted to see if you\u2019ll give me a better ideas first.

So far, I&#39;ve been able to access the AMP interface from a separate machine on the network, spin up a server instance, and access everything just fine on my home network by accessing it via the IP address assigned by my router and the port I setup in my AMP instance (I know I&#39;m overexplaining, it&#39;s for my own benefit as much as anything). Safe to say that I&#39;m comfortable with accessing everything on my home LAN.</p> <p>Where I get a bit more uncomfortable is figuring out and deciding how to access things off the network:</p> <p>I have leveraged <a href=\"http://playit.gg\">playit.gg</a> to access the Minecraft server, and that works fine, no real issues.

At the end of the month I will likely be moving into a place with a forced ISP that runs the whole building on a 1:1 NAT. To get around this I cooked up a scheme to tunnel my TrueNAS traffic through a VPS thus continuing to make my services publicly available. My flow starting from the end user is as follows. (End user &gt; Cloudflare DNS &gt; VPS server running debian acting as a wireguard server &gt; UDM PRO SE as a gateway and wireguard client (along with some static routes) &gt; NPM running in truenas apps &gt; services (jellyfin, nextcloud, Minecraft, etc...) honestly I thought about just using the cloudflare tunnel as thats rather easy but it does limit you to web traffic i.e. no game servers. I also know the flow is complicated but I&#39;m pretty sure everything is alright until I get to the vps where up until today",
