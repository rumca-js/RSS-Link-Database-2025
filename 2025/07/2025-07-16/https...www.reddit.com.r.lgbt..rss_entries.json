I was slightly confused, as I\u2019m not out to anyone yet, I had told my little sisters (8 and 7) that I wanted to turn into a man after I move out, but I haven\u2019t directly told them that I was trans. After some questioning he told me that my little sisters had called me their older brother, and after inquiring as to why, they had elaborated and told him that I wanted to \u2018transform into a boy\u2019 once I move to Europe. I laughed loudly, mostly shocked but pleased. I gave him a skittle and he left. It was all slightly awkward, but I\u2019m still very happy with how it\u2019s all turned out. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gus-5325\"> /u/Gus-5325 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1m1qpgw/my_brother_found_out_im_trans/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt",

Therefore, pawns are unequivocally men. This is essential, because it means that every promoted queen is trans. Additionally, since the term \u201cmen\u201d includes the original queen as well, this means the queen is a trans man, which implies as well that a) the king is gay with the queen and 2) the queen is always trans, meaning that trans people are the most powerful. </p> <p>I have not slept in three days. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MohnJilton\"> /u/MohnJilton </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1m1p3sq/i_have_heard_the_argument_that_since_pawns_can/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1m1p3sq/i_have_heard_the_argument_that_since_pawns_can/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019ve heard multiple Christians say that we \u201c stole the meaning of a rainbow\u201d, as if a rainbow has one meaning. It\u2019s like the Christians that feel this way I think they own the rainbow, which is a colorful phenomenon in the sky. I\u2019d say it\u2019s very odd because how can you steal something from someone that doesn\u2019t own that something? Different people have different symbolisms for all kinds of things or concepts, but there is no designated way to interpret something.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ur_g00fy_ah_n3ighb0r\"> /u/ur_g00fy_ah_n3ighb0r </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1m1jok6/you_stole_our_rainbow/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1m1jok6/you_stole_our_rainbow/\">[comments]</a></span>",
