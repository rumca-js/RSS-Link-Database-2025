        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">What's the measure of a new <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/\">Sims 4</a> expansion pack at this point? After 11 years and dozens of free and paid DLC releases, it's easy to imagine that we've seen it all, that we may be past the point where a new release can dramatically alter the fundamentals of the Sims 4 experience. But the latest pack, Enchanted by Nature, proves that expectation is faulty thanks to its mix of compelling fairy gameplay, a uniquely verdant new world to live in, and the ability to live self-sufficiently in the woods. Yeah, this pack is different.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Since most of the worlds in The Sims 4 are familiar-looking city environments, it's always at least a little bit exciting when we get something more distinctive, like Chestnut Ridge in Horse Ranch or Mt. Komorebi in Snowy Escape. Innisgreen, a lush world based on Ireland, is another location that definitely fits that bill, as it's more like a large region than a singular town ",
