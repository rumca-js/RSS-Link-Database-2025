I want to search the archives and solve the mystery at the heart of magic. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Can anyone recommend a beautifully crafted story that can satisfy this need? Or do you disagree? Maybe I should push through the gratuitous romance to reap the reward on the other side? </p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FractalFragment47\"> /u/FractalFragment47 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

The last big things I have read were China Mieville books and The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe, and I have liked them very much. Then I decided to read something more entertaining, and my choice fell upon the First Law. Ended up binging the trilogy and the next 2 standalones.</p> <p>They were easy to read, with energizing pacing, bright characters, cool action, and all of that. Yeah, they were as good as people talk about them. However, the more I read, the more I realized how &quot;same-y&quot; it felt, like books keep retreading the same stories, archetypes, morals, etc. The global plot barely advanced in BSC and The Heroes.
