I&#39;m curious if you ran an <em>outdated browser</em> (2 years? 5 years?) old. Are you really easily going to get infected visiting popular <em>average joe</em> websites?</p> <p>I&#39;m currently running Chrome 138 and disabled it from updating. It&#39;s running inside a dud VM, through a VPN on a separate ISP. But it has uBlock, Windows Defender and MBAM. I&#39;m wondering how difficult it would be to infect this system.</p> <p>Obviously I&#39;m not trying to purposely visit garbo websites, I want to see if it&#39;s possible for this system to get infected if I&#39;m browsing normie websites (eg. Reddit) and sticking with them and not clicking redirecting links.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/coomtilldust\"> /u/coomtilldust </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comm",

But by default, most of them look kind of boring.</p> <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not defending Opera or roasting other browsers. But when it comes to default design, I genuinely think other browsers could learn a thing or two from Opera. (I&#39;m talking to you, Edge!)</p> <p>They even made Opera GX for gamers, and it looks futuristic.
