A heist with heart\u2026 and Craig Robinson in disguise.\n\nIn this episode of Seen on the Screen, Jacqueline Coley sits down with Craig Robinson, who returns as the endlessly lovable Mr. Shark in The Bad Guys 2. Known for his iconic roles in The Office, Zack and Miri Make a Porno, Knocked Up and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Craig brings his signature blend of warmth and absurdity to the DreamWorks sequel\u2014complete with another wildly unconvincing disguise.\n\nCraig opens up about why he keeps returning to stand-up, what it\u2019s like when fans yell lines at him on the street, and how much fun he has working with longtime friends like Andy Samberg. He also shares stories from his early days teaching music in Chicago, and reflects on the lasting impact of comedy heroes like Eddie Murphy.\n\nFollow and listen to Seen on the Screen with Jacqueline Coley wherever you listen to podcasts \ud83c\udfa7\n\u00b7 Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/seen-on-the-screen-with-jacqueline-coley/id",
