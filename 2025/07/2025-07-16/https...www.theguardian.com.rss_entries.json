While I would never throw a classic out of bed, every now andd then I like to swerve the mayonnaise and do something a little more exuberant. Today\u2019s potato salads are a riot of texture and flavour, and pack a serious punch. They are satisfying enough on their own, but serve them at your next barbecue and you are bound to please the potato pleasure-seekers in your life.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/16/potato-salad-recipes-chaat-yoghurt-spicy-peanut-butter-ravinder-bhogal\">Continue reading...</a>",
