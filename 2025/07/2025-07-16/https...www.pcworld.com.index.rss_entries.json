Well, if you\u2019re a Windows user, there\u2019s a Phone Link app that offers lots of the features iPhone users can get on Macs! While Phone Link works with iPhones, too, most of its features require an Android phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not all Android phones are equal. If you use a Pixel phone with a Windows PC, you\u2019re missing out on some of the cooler features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want the kind of integration iPhone users get with their Macs? Then you\u2019ll need a Samsung Galaxy phone, not a Pixel phone\u2014and definitely not an iPhone. (A few other brands, like OnePlus and Asus ROG, also offer these extra features. But Google\u2019s Pixel phones don\u2019t.) Here\u2019s why.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-listicle-chart\"><div class=\"wp-block-listicle",
