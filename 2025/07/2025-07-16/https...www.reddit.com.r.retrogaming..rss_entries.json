        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m really trying to find the right retro games for me to play in short sessions that won&#39;t frustrate me or stress me out. More of a relaxing cozy vibe, which is complemented so much by the 2D animations and amazing soundtracks of the games from my childhood. Those games are way harder than I remember. I&#39;m wondering if retro isn&#39;t for me and I should stick to the easier stuff that&#39;s coming out now on steam and Nintendo. I love the look and vibe of Zelda games but they&#39;re so difficult for me. Never played a 2D RPG other than Pokemon Yellow (loved it!). I have a lot of fun with pretty much any kirby game I&#39;ve played.</p> <p>My fav modern games are Skyrim, RDR2 and Stardew Valley in terms of most played. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Shire_Jedi92\"> /u/Shire_Jedi92 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1m1fjpj/what_are_your_mustplay_easy",

Couldn\u2019t put it down. some maps seem impossible. so I don\u2019t feel bad about looking them up. (some Steam forum post). Bosses not very hard with basic FPS strategy.

It\u2019s faster if you load your save but its honestly more fun to play with no starting equipment and you can rebuild everything on almost any level.

If anyone was ever on the fence about getting one of these I HIGHLY recommend picking one up. The input lag is virtually non existent and if there is any it\u2019s so minimal I can\u2019t even tell, especially when I was comparing with my original wired controllers. I also casually speedrun from time to time so I\u2019m pretty sensitive to input lag and the controller has been great. Battery life also seems to be pretty decent as well. Feels great not having to sit so close to my TV for the cord to reach where I play!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",
