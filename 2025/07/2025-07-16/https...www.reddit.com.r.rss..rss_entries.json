But as we scale up, we&#39;re hitting some operational bottlenecks.</p> <p>Right now, we\u2019re trying to:</p> <ul> <li>Monitor breaking news across multiple niche topics in real-time</li> <li>Collaborate efficiently \u2014 ideally in a system where we can react to stories, assign them to writers, notify them, and track progress without bouncing between a dozen tools</li> </ul> <p>We\u2019ve tried the usual suspects (Slack, Feedly, Notion, Google Alerts), but it all feels a bit too scattered and hard to manage as a workflow.</p> <p>I recently came across <a href=\"https://100.news\">100.news</a> \u2014 it looks promising, especially for quick keyword tracking (they have a free version), but the source pool is still a bit limited (~70 sources). Has anyone used it at scale or found something similar but with broader coverage",
