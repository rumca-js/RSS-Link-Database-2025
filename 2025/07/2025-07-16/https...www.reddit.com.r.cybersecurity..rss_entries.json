If the command works we validate it, if it&#39;s a failure we delete it.... we end up with a succession of approved commands that we can then save as a playbook or script. Then a file explorer allows us to simply replay the script and the commands chain in the terminal.</p> <p>I thought about it for a moment and told myself that it could serve a whole bunch of",
