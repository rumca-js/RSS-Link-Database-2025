This vision defined the character for nearly three decades, and now Donkey Kong is stepping back into the spotlight with his first original game in over a decade. Bananza isn't just a return; it's a reinvention - one of the most imaginative, playful, and technically ambitious titles the company has delivered since <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857\">Breath of the Wild</a>. From a game design perspective, Bananza pushes the 3D platforming genre into exciting new territory, but from a technical standpoint? It's a showcase for Nintendo's latest console. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-tech-review\">Read more</a></p>",
