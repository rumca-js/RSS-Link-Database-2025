That one change turns the whole thing into a forward thinking puzzle where you\u2019re constantly asking, \u201cWill this card still be good by the time I get back to it?\u201d</p> <p>It becomes this fun mix of tactical decisions and trying to piece together a long-term plan.</p> <p>Super quick to teach, plays in about 20 minutes, and supports up to 6. </p> <p>Anyone else played this one yet?

Guilty as charged. As time wore on and my collection grew, I then could not ignore what was happening to the cards in my own stock. We still love, for example, Shadows Over Camelot, but the cards are so worn that you can barely make out a number of details on many of them. It&#39;s to the point where I&#39;ve thought about collecting the card art from all over to then send it all off to a card printer to start fresh.</p> <p>So, I became a card-sleever. (insert expected boos and jibes here) However, now that nearly all the card-populating games I own are sleeved, I have begun to question a number of realities that I&#39;d love some feedback on -- or, as is life on Reddit, targeted disparagement ;-)</p> <ol> <li><p>I&#39;ve now come to realize that I&#39;ve spent a small fortune",

Also, before player 2 revealed their card, player 3 called bs on player 1\u2019s assassin.</p> <p>Player 1 then revealed they did not have an assassin. Player 2 did not have a contessa, but argued that they should not lose both cards because player 1 didn\u2019t have the assassin.</p> <p>We ended up making player 2 lose 1 card instead of 2.</p> <p>What\u2019s the right way to play in this situation? If we make the contessa bs resolve before any other bs-ing then it seems like it\u2019s just favoring one bs over another randomly.</p> <p>There\u2019s something to be said about agreeing on whether or not to allow the assassin before any contessa is called,",
