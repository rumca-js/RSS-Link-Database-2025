This is because, despite so many being marketed in my direction and so&nbsp;many requests for a column about the best of them, I am consistently grumpy about neck products on principle. I certainly don\u2019t neglect my&nbsp;own neck in my routine, and encourage anyone engaged in their appearance to take good care of their <em>entire</em> skin, scalp to toe. And I can obviously understand why people seek out a specialist neck treatment when they notice changes in firmness and texture on the throat. But skin doesn\u2019t become different when it passes the jawline, it responds in the same way to TLC as the face, so I&nbsp;can see few good reasons for spending extra money.</p><p>The things we know can help produce collage",

Now he\u2019s started nursery (or what Germans refer to as Kita), other parents in Berlin, where we live, have warned me that an avalanche of illnesses will come flooding in.
