My biggest dilemma is probably whether to download REMUX or compressed versions. I downloaded Terminator from 1984 in both versions. My TV is a LED Samsung 55&quot; 4K TV with HDR etc. and I use Nvidia Shield together with KODI for playback. I don&#39;t have cinema sound at home.</p> <p>At a very close distance I can see a difference in the picture and maybe also a slight color difference. The REMUX version has a slightly cleaner picture. The compressed version takes up about 20GB and the REMUX version takes up about 53GB. Both are HDR DV.</p> <p>But I can see that many other movies take up about 80GB.</p> <p>In the long run I&#39;m going to buy an OLED TV and at least 65&quot;. So I don&#39;t know if REMUX is worth downloading and wasting a lot of space on it.</p> <p>Will the difference be quite big when I buy a bigger TV?</p> <p>Should I download R",

A couple of months back because of the whole manifestv3 business, I got a warning from Chrome and it turned off BPC as an extension. I re-enabled it then. This morning, I opened Chrome and it told me that BPC along with 5 other extensions are no longer supported.</p> <p>So, what are my options? Is there a fix? I&#39;d like to keep using this extension.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WinXPbootsup\"> /u/WinXPbootsup </a",
