I&#39;m hoping to create a playlist which is nothing more than timestamp offsets within the file. I could have sworn that this was pretty common practice years ago with mp3 files and an m3u playlist but I can&#39;t for the life of me find details, and to the contrary what I have found suggests that it isn&#39;t possible (except maybe within the Apple ecosystem).</p> <p>Can it be done? I no longer care about file formats, I&#39;ll just simply convert to whatever supports timestamp seeking. Ideally I&#39;d like to use something that is supported by Plexamp, but I&#39;m happy to pretend it&#39;s an audiobook or any other method that would work.

I will be copying them to new HDDs every 5-10 years or so. In addition to that, I&#39;d like to burn them to DVDs as I&#39;m under the impression discs are better for long term storage. Are there particular DVDs that are better suited for long term storage? Can you highlight the specs look out for and perhaps some real world examples as guidance?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ThePeoplessChamp\"> /u/ThePeoplessChamp </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1luhm68/examples_of_blank_dvds_best_suited_for_long_term/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1luhm68/examples_of_blank_dvds_best_suited_for_long_term/\">[comments]</a></span>",
