They were both 17f-18m around that time when he did that, and he pulled so much more shady shit on her, like calling her and hacking her phone to pretend to be someone else. it was super weird, and she is with him because she is really emotionally attached to him. we are working on that rn\u2014how to get her over him. and for more context, they live in different cities and meet only once, and he always calls out the stuff mentioned below over text when they aren&#39;t together. </p> <p>But here is the main issue. he always knows what app she is using to chat with me. We met on Instagram, and he knew she was talking to someone! but didn&#39;t know who and what we were talking about </p> <p>then we switched to Snap. She had never used Snapchat in her life, but he found out about that ",
