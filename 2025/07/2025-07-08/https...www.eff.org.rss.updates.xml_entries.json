The IRS\u2019s sharing, and especially bulk sharing, of data is improper and\u00a0 makes taxpayers vulnerable to inevitable mistakes. As a practical matter, the sharing of data that IRS had previously claimed was protected undermines the trust important civil institutions require in order to be effective.\u00a0</span></p>\n<p><span>You can read the entire brief <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/docum",
