I <em>think</em> it was Zzap 64 (I had a Commodore 64 at the time). I never actually got to see it on an Amiga because my mum couldn&#39;t afford to buy me one at that point and by the time I could afford a better computer I was studying to be a software engineer and had to get a PC for my studies, so went with that instead! Anyway, I digress! Me and my mate built an arcade cabinet recently and it has an Amiga emulator, so I was wanting to try this game, but I can&#39;t remember the name of it now. At the time, in the magazine, it was touted for it&#39;s use of parallax scrolling. It was a side scrolling game and had a two legged horned beast guy as the player&#39;s character. It is NOT Shadow of the Beast though and that&#39;s all I can find when I&#39;m looking for it. The player&#39;s character was blue from what I can remember, but I might be wrong in that. Can anyone help m",
