It has been completely perfect with usenet for about 6 months. During that entire time, I have had two usenet providers with secure connections/SSL enabled. I have also had a VPN (surfshark) on only the unraid machine through my asus router (vpn fusion). It has worked flawlessly. Suddenly today I noticed SAB was not downloading a request. I looked and the items were being passed from radarr to sab, but not downloaded and just sitting in the queue. the second i turned the vpn off at the router the downloads started. if the vpn is on then i get the following from two different providers when i test the connections (long delay):</p> <p> [Errno 111] [SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1010)</p> <p> [Errno 111] _ssl.c:993: The handshake operation timed out</p> <p>Any idea why this is happening all of t",
