The world No 1 had bested every opponent here in straight sets, but needed a decider to beat Laura Siegemund 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 and book her place in the semi-finals, where she will face the No 13 seed, Amanda Anisimova.</p><p>Sabalenka had a clear early tactic: get to the net as soon as possible. She struggled though, with an early double fault and hitting it long. Siegemund troubled her with an unreachable backhand drop shot and, despite slipping, hit a forehand winner to earn her second break point before a cross-court backhand return secured the game.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/08/aryna-sabalenka-survives-siegemund-scare-to-set-up-wimbledon-semi-final-aga",

        "description": "<p>An authentic alternative gazpacho with rustic appeal, a powerful flavour mix \u2013 and not a tomato in sight</p><p>Gazpacho has been part of Spanish kitchens for centuries. Long before tomatoes arrived from the Americas, it was made with bread, garlic, olive oil and almonds, which have always been part of our food culture. It began as field food, crushed by hand in mortars and eaten by workers under the sun with nothing but stale bread and whatever else they had to hand alongside. No blenders, no chill time, just instinct and hunger. This version, with courgette and basil, goes back to that idea: take what\u2019s around you and make something good out of it. Simple roots, but full of life.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/08/courgette-almond-gazpacho-recipe-jose-pizarro\">Continue reading...</a>",
