In the Imager program, I set the SSID, the password for the WI-FI, the location of this router and the time zone. I also set my login and password and enabled SSH for the password. When I first start, I see 127.0.1.1 instead of 192.168.0.XXX. I connected the Ethernet cable and everything works fine, but for some reason it refuses WI-FI. I tried using 2.4G and 5G, but it is useless. In raspi-config it says that there is just an error without clarification, nmtui was used. I also went and wrote to the .conf files and even tried to check if it blocks, but all to no avail. I am using a new router, and it worked without problems on the old one. Maybe it is impossible to connect WI-FI because of the new and slow Internet?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Remus_28\"> /u/Remus_28 </a> <br/> ",

I found that I should probably enable the read-only filesystem, which I did, but after a few more works, it became inoperable again.
