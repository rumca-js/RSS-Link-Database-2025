I have tried every thing I could think off, installing it directly on the steam deck, put it on a separate as card, try half of the latest proton versions yet all I get is either a black screen of a anti cheat error before the game crashes.

I&#39;ve been using LInux for only about 3 weeks and I recently reformatted my SSD to ext4 (from ntfs) to move my games onto. Since then, I&#39;ve been gleefully moving my games from my disk Storage (HDD), using Steam to do so, over until I hit a snag today. For some reason, ESO is installed on /home/****/Elder Scrolls Online. I didn&#39;t worry too much about this and got all of my addons working and played. It&#39;s my main game.</p> <p>I noticed an occasional &quot;hiccup&quot; where my character would be running or riding along and there would be a stutter, sometimes every 4 s",

I already bought Ex Astris but apparently my phone is not strong enough and my laptop was kinda okay when running it on emulators like LD Player or Bluestack on Windows.
