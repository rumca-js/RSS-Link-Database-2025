I have full root access to this server, and I&#39;m serving my website from it. No hard feelings if this has to be taken down.</p> <hr/> <p>My website is for my small business, and I thought it would be cool/useful to see how many unique human visitors there are/will be. So I looked around and found Goaccess, which seems to be what I&#39;m looking for. It reads my NGINX log found at /var/log/nginx/access.log, and presents a TUI view in real time, really cool stuff. </p> <p>While Goaccess seems really useful, I&#39;m not sure how I would be able to filter out all the bots from the real humans. I could probably write some grep command to do it, but before getting to that, I thought I would ask if this already is a solved problem. </p> <p>I hope what I&#39;ve written makes sense, I can provide more info if needed.

A lot of people recommended to use an email relay rather than migrating to Microsoft or Google.</p> <p>My use case isn&#39;t mass marketing. It&#39;s just personal email accounts. At a stretch it&#39;s small business. Nothing gets sent on mass, and none of it is marketing communications.</p> <p>But I&#39;ve still got problems with my IP address (OVH) being routinely blocked by Microsoft. My SPF, DKIM, DMARC is all setup and correct.</p> <p>Will using an email relay solve my problems? From what I gather, the relay will still be prone to getting blocked by Microsoft because someone else in the same IP block might be sending bullshit.</p> <p>If it does solve deliverability problems, can anyone suggest a relay service?

What I have in mind is something that stores the markdown files it uses as files on disk, so I can just use syncthing to get those files to my computer raw where I can just use vim most of the time, but which gives me a webinterfaces (optionally, also a dedicated android app), where there&#39;s and editor/renderer that is easy to use.
