It\u2019s now based on Qt6 and KDE Frameworks 6, dropping all Qt5 support. The audio engine has also been overhauled to use GStreamer instead of Phonon, which improves consistency and feature support across systems.</p> <p>The internal database now handles full UTF-8 properly, so podcast metadata with emojis and special characters should behave better. It also addresses the year 2038 bug and several long-standing bugs related to volume control, cue file support, and database scans.</p> <p>While Amarok has had a long and bumpy development history, this release feels like a serious effort to modernize the project without breaking user expectations. The devs say the bigger UI changes are coming later with Amarok 4.</p> <p>Here\u2019s my write-up if you want a full breakdown: \ud83d\udd17 <a href=\"https://nerds.xyz/2025/07/amaro",

Vidar is an SMS app not to far from the likes of iMessage or Google Messages. The key difference is that Vidar is encrypted using AES256 encryption and thus it keeps your messages private.</p> <p>Unlike other messaging apps like Signal or Telegram that rely on centralized servers or similar, Vidar uses good old SMS; this allows Vidar to be unrestricted by national firewall, censorship, and surveillance. No internet? No problem. With Vidar, your messages travel securely over the traditional SMS network completely encrypted.</p> <p>Getting started is simple: just create a contact by entering the person&#39;s name, phone number, and a shared secret key. And voil\u00e0! You\u2019re ready to have an encrypted, private conversation (as long as both parties are using Vidar with the same key).</p> <p>I would appreci",

I recently started working on a custom programming language built from scratch, includes full tokenizer, parser, interpeter in Python, variables, loops and more. I would love some suggestions and honest advice from more advanced devs, and maybe some issues opened on the repository + stars. Thanks! If you want feel free to contribute. </p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/jimmydin7/custom-programming-language\">https://github.com/jimmydin7/custom-programming-language</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dry-Cabinet-6475\"> /u/Dry-Cabinet-6475 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1lun7qu/i_built_a_programming_language_from_scratch_at_16/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1lun7qu/i_built_a_programming_language_from_scratch_at_16/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Sometimes I forget about changes I made in a repo I haven\u2019t opened in a few days, and that can lead to lost time or even lost work.</p> <p>To solve this, I built gits-statuses: a simple tool that gives you a bird\u2019s-eye view of the status of all your local git repositories.</p> <p>It scans a directory (recursively) and shows you which repos have uncommitted changes, unpushed commits, or are clean. It\u2019s a quick way to stay on top of your work and avoid surprises.</p> <p>There are two versions:</p> <ul> <li>Python: cross-platform</li> <li>PowerShell: great for Windows users who want native terminal integration</li> </ul> <p>Check it out here: <a href=\"https://github.com/nicolgit/gits-statuses\">https://github.com/nicolgit/gits-statuses</a> </p> <p>Feedback and contributions are welcome!</p> </div><",
