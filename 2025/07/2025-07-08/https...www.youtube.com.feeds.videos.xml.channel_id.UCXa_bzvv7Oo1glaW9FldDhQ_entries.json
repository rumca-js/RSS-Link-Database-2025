        "description": "Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5 has been selling like hot cakes since it was released back in 2020. With a whopping 10 TFLOPs of raw compute, the PS5 is a gaming beast that has been producing some amazing visuals in current-gen releases, both first-party and third-party alike.\n\nThere\u2019s always been this notion about a console being a much cheaper alternative than the PC in gaming circles, but exactly how big is that margin right now? To answer this question, we will try to build a PC that\u2019s just as powerful as the PS5 in an effort to find that out.",
