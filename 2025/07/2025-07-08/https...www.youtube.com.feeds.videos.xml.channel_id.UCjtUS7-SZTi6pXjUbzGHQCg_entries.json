When we talk about the circular economy, we picture batteries stripped for their metals, factory floor scraps spun into sweaters, and agricultural waste transformed into biogas.

It\u2019s now possible to spin it into high-tech, biodegradable plastics and textiles or use it as glue inside lithium battery electrodes. And as for the urine we send down the drain, it might someday help build our cities with better concrete. So, is this the next leap in sustainable design \u2014 or just a steaming pile of hype?
