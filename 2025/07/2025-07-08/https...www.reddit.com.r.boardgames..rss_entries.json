I know Scythe for a long time now and i know that its not a wargame, but most of the people in my group, funnily enough doesnt actually like playing hiper-agressive and we mostly avoid crippling each other when playing (We like fighting, and sometimes we will play really agressively, but we tend to only do that to avoid others from winning) With that in mind, im thinking about getting Scyte especially because its not a overly agressive game, while it also allow players combat. but is the engine building aspect of the game acessible/fun for newcomers in euroish genres?
