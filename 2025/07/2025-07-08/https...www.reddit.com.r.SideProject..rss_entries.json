So I built a basic prototype that could do it for me.</p> <p>At first, our CTO wasn\u2019t really convinced it was worth the time. Fair enough, the first version was rough. But I believed there was something there, so I spent a few more weekends improving it, digging deeper into the Figma API, and refining the code output.</p> <p>Eventually, the results spoke for themselves. The developer friends of me even dev in our team started to get interested too.

There are some good business name generators out there and a lot of poor ones., but none were perfectly matching my needs. I built mine as an opportunity to play with AI models, but also as a way to come up with ideas for my own businesses.
