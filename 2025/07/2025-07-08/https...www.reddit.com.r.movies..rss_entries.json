For whatever reason, with some actors, no matter what film I\u2019m watching with them in it, I don\u2019t see the character, I just see the actor.</p> <p>Sometimes it\u2019s because they basically play themselves every time, or they\u2019re typecast into the same type of role over and over. Other times it\u2019s just their massive star power overshadowing the entire film.</p> <p>For example, Marilyn Monroe - one of the earliest examples of this. Hell yeah, she was a great actress, but in every film, all I see is Marilyn. I can never even remember her characters\u2019 names because it\u2019s just her.</p> <p>Perfect example: Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson...he\u2019s been playing himself since the mid-2000s. imo Jack Black too. Jeff Goldblum feels like he\u2019s parodying himself these days. And as much as I love Bruce Willis (\ud83d\ude22) after Die Hard, 90% of his roles felt like slight variations of a cavalier John McClane. Pacino too ",
