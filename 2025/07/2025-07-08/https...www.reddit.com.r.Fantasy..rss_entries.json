Like Kekon has it&#39;s own culture, food, superstitions and we also explore the entertainment industry. The world feels so lived in. </p> <p>Now I can&#39;t get into any other fantasy books. Cause for me, the green bone saga was the perfect blend of everything I like in my books. Great character drama, an amazing world, a compelling plot, characters that are so well written that by the end of the trilogy I felt that I knew them in person, and some very interesting politics. And now I can&#39;t find this in any other book</p> <p>Also Kaul Hilo is such a great character. Sometimes he made my heart mealt and sometimes I just wanted to smack him. But boy was he charismatic! I could talk about him for hours. </p> <p>Any other recommendations? I love u",

No racist, sexist or homophobic material to speak of. Remarkably literate and clever dialogue. A story that feels so much like an adaptation of an old tale that you can&#39;t believe it was written from scratch. Broderick being funny and touching. Hauer being badass and smouldering. Pfeiffer being the goddess she sometimes is. And a marvellously disheveled Leo McKern between <em>Rumpole</em> episodes. </p> <p>I acknowledge that the soundtrack is not for everyone, but I put it to you that the problem with the score is not so much the style of the music as the fact that it&#39;s really quite pedestrian on its own terms. Yes, it&#39;s pretty basic synth-based 80s prog, but that&#39;s what it would be regardless of context. In any case it is not awful enough to detract from my overall enjoyment.",

The book features two rivals, Leovander Loveage and Sebastian Grimm, who end up bound to each other through a control spell that was accidentally cast. Upon closer reading of the text, it tells you exactly how the spell was broken. Please do not read any further unless you are prepared for spoilers.</p> <p>We learn from Sybilla that the spell is actually a love spell and will be broken if Grimm (the caster) falls in love with Leo. So long as the spell is in place, Leo is compelled to follow Grimm\u2019s commands. However, we know that by page 343, the spell is broken. Grimm orders Leo 1) to draw his sword to protect them from a monster, but Leo refuses, exclaiming that a sword is like a needle to the much large monster. On page 348, Grimm tells Leo 2) to get \u201cto the top of the hill,\u201d but Leo does not follow and Grimm needs to drag",
