David Corenswet is a natural, benevolent Superman, Nicholas Hoult\u2019s egomaniacal Lex Luthor gives him the perfect foil, and by minute two, you\u2019ll be willing to burn a thousand Kryptons if it means saving Supes\u2019 chaotic, good-boy companion Krypto the Superdog. Director and DCU maestro James Gunn throws a lot at us here and trusts that decades of practice watching superhero movies will carry us through any storytelling corners he\u2019s cutting in favor of keeping the pace brisk and the fun abundant. It\u2019s a dense and at times overwhelming adventure, but it feels like the right one for the moment.\n\n#IGN #Movies #Superman",

He\u2019s faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. In short, he\u2019s one of the most powerful fictional characters ever conceived, able to break the laws of physics and bend time itself with impunity.\n\nThat said, Superman\u2019s powers are nothing if not evolving. They\u2019ve ebbed and flowed a lot over the decades, with the character evolving from super-strong defender of the downtrodden to all-powerful, godlike superhero to the more well-rounded character he is today. The only constant with Superman is his inconsistency.\n\nWith actor David Corenswet introducing moviegoers to the latest cinematic incarnation of the Man of Steel, let\u2019s take a step back to examine how Superman\u2019s powers have evolved and changed over the years, from the earliest Superman comics to the campy excesses of the Silver Age and right on into the modern era.\n\nSuperman is directed by James Gunn and stars David",
