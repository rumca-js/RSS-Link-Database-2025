I work nights in a warehouse and have let my self presentation slip since I do pretty much everything on my own outside of work and during the hours that most other people are asleep or working and when I\u2019m at work I\u2019m getting sweaty and dusty so there\u2019s no need to dress up. My hygiene is good but I want more motivation for small things like taking care of my skin and flossing and finding a good personal style to put effort into. As well as tidying up my space as I live alone and sometimes let it slip into a mess.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/the1975whore\"> /u/the1975whore </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1luzgtv/looking_for_self_help_books_that_can_help_me_keep/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddi",

Can anyone recommend more books like this?</p> <p>I don&#39;t care for extreme amounts of sensationalising or demonising, we know what these people did is very bad, I&#39;m more interested in learning how and why people commit violent crime. My favourite parts of Douglas&#39; books were the interviews from prison, so would be very interested in reading more like this and learning how the brains of violent criminals work from a psychology perspective. True crime is a big genre so some pointers on where to look would be very helpful, thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tea-boy460\"> /u/tea-boy460 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1luv8hx/true_crimepsycholo",

Once I started working and got into the real world with real world problems, I stopped reading. I used my mind for work and I just wanted to unwind without having to do much more thinking. But lately I\u2019ve been considering getting back into reading and I have no clue where to begin. I don\u2019t want to read steamy romance or horror. Just something that\u2019s feel good or even classics. I used to enjoy reading through the classics on that display at Barnes and noble. I do like love stories too. I just need some wholesome book suggestions. I used to read some mystery too but nothing too gory. I just feel like I\u2019ve lost a lot of imagination and creativity.

I use to work in a book store and got dozens of dystopian, dark, moody, and overall generally pretty sad leaning books. Though I do love them and really enjoy reading them, I need a change of mood. I recently read a romcom book (the hating game) and though I did get bored with the smutty part of it I enjoyed the light hearted falling in love part. I know I should delve into romance if that\u2019s what got my attention but after picking up two other rom-comish books it didn\u2019t get me! Which made me feel like I truly am lost on what I want. Which is a huge bummer since I have loved reading for so long. In conclusion I just want a happy, light, (even a) quick read to enjoy in between say chain-gang all stars and pachinko (see i\u2019m all over the place!). So what\u2019s your favorite book when you want to feel good? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Charming-Speed-9860\"> /u/Cha",

Usually the character being followed ends up isolated or mostly isolated, resulting in the narrative being more about reflection or about the world around them. </p> <p>I have enjoyed also reading: I Who Have Never Known Men The Silence The Boy on the Bridge Oryx and Crake (which was more about how the world got to where it was) The Last One</p> <p>I have seen recommended as similar titles, and read: Wool (didn\u2019t enjoy as much as it was more interpersonal than exploring the world around them - but have only read the first book so far) basically everything by Margaret Atwood The Book of the Unnamed Midwife The Road Station Eleven World War Z</p> <p>Please help me find more!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cavernsandcreature",

Want to know the reasons on why id push the only person that loved me away. See where my deeper issues lie.</p> <p>Thats why i came here.

A college kid facing financial stress takes a mysterious job offer. What follows is intense, emotional, and far from predictable.</p> <p>The themes around grief, pressure, and friendship are handled really well. The emotional weight builds fast, and the final third of the book shifts the entire tone. I didn\u2019t expect where it would go, and the twist in the mansion has stuck with me. Only 99 pages, but it never felt rushed or hollow. That brevity actually made the tension hit harder, since there was no filler or wasted space.</p> <p>Highly recommend it if you\u2019re into psychological stories that explore moral pressure and real emotional consequences! Would love to know what others thought, especially about how it all ended.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/foereyes\"> /u/foereyes </a> <br/> <",

Also how it then made him a perfect victim for The Overlook. Can anyone recommend any books that deal with similar themes? People fighting addictions and how it affects their lives and relationships? Memoir recommendations also welcome. Horror books where the character&#39;s struggles play a big part. I&#39;m currently reading The Front Runner by Patricia Nell Warren and getting a similar vibe with the MC&#39;s backstory, how his struggles with his sexuality as well as societal attitudes and prejudice affected his career, so anything like that also.

I don\u2019t remember the title or author only some of the plot and I\u2019m having the hardest time finding it! The story was set in the past on a plantation, the main characters were two young boys who were best friends, one of whom was the son of the owner of the plantation the other was the son of one of the servants. It was a rice plantation and the antagonist was a massive alligator who lived in plantation creek, the boys would hunt for the alligator. One chapter included the two boys digging up Native American beads and gifting them to the servant boys mother and the plantation owner taking them back from her because he feared them carrying a disease that killed the natives.

He is into music, adventure, travel. He has read Diary of a Wimpy kid and likes it ok. Tried to get him to read Harry Potter and even took him to Livraria Lello and bought each HP book, but he&#39;s not really interested in fantasy. I would prefer non-series, in possible.</p> <p>I have a 7 year old. He is a little delayed with reading/talking as he had a hearing issue but during covid testing was closed. However, he&#39;s made great progress so I don&#39;t want something too easy.</p> <p>He likes travel, adventure, Super Mario, and soccer. </p> <p>Any suggestions would be great. I will have them reading some books alone and others will be my wife or I, so any suggestions are welcome. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",

They felt like characters from a Bethesda or Valve game if that makes sense. I loved the horror bits. I love that there was <em>some</em> action, but not too over the top that it lost its tension and made the characters feel anything more than powerless to their circumstances. I don&#39;t know, it was just a genuinely fun read that also hit a good horror spot for me. I like The Troop and The Deep as well, though not as much. The Handyman Method I really really didn&#39;t care for. The Acolyte and The Queen are on my &quot;to read&quot; list. Any other recs?
