A family member had no need for their old Meta Quest 1, and I have always wanted a VR headset regardless of its version or newness. Of course, I gladly accepted. My laptop, yes, laptop, was not purchased for the sole purpose of VR. It&#39;s an HP Omen 16 with 16 GB of RAM and a 4050 GPU. (I&#39;m not also totally knowledgeable about computers, so if you need any clarification feel free to ask.) Experience-wise, it has been able to run games like Red Dead Redemption Two and FC 25 at pretty much maximum graphics. So, before I put 24 dollars to waste on my makeshift setup, I would like help from people who know a lot more about VR than me. <strong>Simply, can my computer/headset combo run Blade and Sorcery at low to medium graphics?</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",

Why haven&#39;t they developed an audio attachment yet? Are people just using their own headphones over the top of whatever strap?

So I decided I should buy my own so I don\u2019t have to rely on his anymore. I\u2019ve been looking at peoples reviews for both the 3 and 3s and I\u2019ve seen a lot of people say the 3 is better. So I decided to ask myself, which would you guys consider would be better to use? I do like better graphics and performance when it comes to anything gaming related. Also one of the main games I do play is vrchat. (I use steam link)</p> <p>Is there really a strong difference between the two? Should I just save my money with the 3s or do you think it\u2019d be better to invest my money in the 3 for the long run? </p> <p>Thank you for the help!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SkxllSxur\"> /u/SkxllSxur </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1lurrl1/quest_3_or_quest_3s/\">[link]</a>",

When the initial hype I had died down a bit, I only played once a month. And now, maybe once every 2 months. And every time now, I regret putting it on. Because there&#39;s so much time between sessions, there is always an update I need to do. Last 3 times I played, the UI changed. I used to use air link, but now it doesn&#39;t work at all anymore.

Was just wanting to ask a quick question since I know right now the VR scene is a bit all over the place (and I haven&#39;t been in it for a hot minute).
