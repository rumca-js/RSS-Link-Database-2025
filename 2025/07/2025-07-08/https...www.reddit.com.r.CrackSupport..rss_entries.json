I was recommended to deinstall and reinstall sims 4 yesterday as i had a critical error to do with extracting the packs. Now im back to square one and im just wondering if there\u2019s any easy fixes. So basically, i have all the packs downloaded, and when i go onto the expansion packs on sims 4 it says \u2018download to use\u2019 and they are not usable. Yet when i go onto the sims 4 updater, it wants me to redownload all the packs again which would take forever on my slow computer. I\u2019m just wondering why they aren\u2019t recognised on my laptop, is there a certain place they need to be or anything i can do?
