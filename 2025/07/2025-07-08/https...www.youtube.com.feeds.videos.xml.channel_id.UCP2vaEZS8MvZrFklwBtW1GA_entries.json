        "description": "Tile hand safety tips\u2026I had to pull this tile and remove just a fraction of an inch. I\u2019m wearing the Ironclad Command Foam Nitrile gloves. They have Level 2 cut resistance with an extra coating on the fingers & knuckles for added protection. The last thing I need is to hurt my hand and be off the job. Many thanks to Ironclad for sponsoring this video and keeping people safe \ud83d\udd25#handprotection #ironcladperformancewear #tilework #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
