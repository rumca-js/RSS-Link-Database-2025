It reduces the risk I make a simple configuratoin mistake, incorrectly exposing a service to the internet. For example, I run several HTTP services behind Cloudflare Tunnels with Access controls using Google OAuth and strict email filtering. The only real exception I make is OpenSSH, which I lock down with PasswordAuthentication=no.</p> <p>With that in mind, I&#39;m hesitant about exposing Jellyfin directly to the internet using just its built-in username/password login. I&#39;ve set it up with port forwarding and Caddy for TLS, but the login form feels like a soft target \u2014 e.g. no 2FA.</p> <p>By contrast, Plex uses centralized SSO with their own servers, which benefit from continuous monitori",

Recently I&#39;ve begun down finally getting around to setting up my AD domain fully not just for user accounts but groups to use for authentication to services, access levels, file shares, etc.</p> <p>I&#39;ve used just about all the password managers that exist but to my knowledge next to none exist (at a free &amp; self hostable tier) that allow for LDAP authentication. The best I&#39;ve come across is using KeePass with a LDAP plugin and KeeWeb for a WebUI. Not opposed to the setup but wondering if there&#39;s anything better. I know Delinea has Secret Server and they are one point may have had a free for 10 users/250 passwords but can&#39;t find a way to get that license key anymore.</p> <p>Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wildgust421\"> /u/Wildgust421 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"h",

I will admit that this is a super specific ask, so ill try to say it in simple terms then in advanced terms in hopes that maybe someone understands my issue.. searching it up on google results in like one github feature request saying its not possible to support and then also people being like &quot;just dont do that&quot; which.. entirely isnt a choice i have, i just work here.. so since im stuck with it and telling my supperiors to &quot;just use kubectl cp command&quot; isnt an option... i either find something that works or i write something myself.</p> <p>simply: In one of the servers we are working with, container volumes arent able to be accessed by other containers or anything outside of its little group (pod).. so we need like a filebrowser gui docker container that we can launch multiple instances of and then have them connect to a central webgui for easy management. ie: we go into <a href=\"http://filebrowser.example.com\">filebrowser.",
