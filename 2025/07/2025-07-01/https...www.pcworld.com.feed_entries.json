I know, it\u2019s kind of a shock, right? I had to be reminded of this fact, and I cover this stuff for my job. Maybe part of the reason the company tends to go unnoticed is that those monitors are usually a lot more expensive than the competition. Not today: You can get a Sony OLED gaming monitor with 480Hz of refresh <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9R7HCVG?th=1\">for $714.99</a>. That\u2019s almost $400 off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, that\u2019s still hitting at about average pricing for a 27-inch OLED monitor with a 2560\u00d71440 resolution at the moment. But it\u2019s the speed that\u2019s particularly notable. At 480Hz with a .03ms response time, the Sony Inzone M10S is approximately twice as fast as comparable monitors. It\u2019ll pump out frames so quickly that even a beefy gaming PC will struggle to keep up with it in just about any recent 3D game.</p>\n\n\n\n",
