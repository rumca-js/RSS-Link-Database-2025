The players each had a small <strong>&quot;hammer&quot;</strong>. The handle of the hammer was a small wooden rod about 6 inches in length, attached to a s small wooden cuboid (1 1/2&quot; X 1/2&quot; X 1/2&quot;) in the middle of one of its long ends, with <strong>one of the square faces having a sticky surface</strong>. No idea what made the surface sticky, maybe some non-drying glue?<br/> All I remember about the rules is that you had to pick up the pieces of cardboard from the shallow box quicker than your opponents. <strong>What game was this??</strong> I have searched many times for &quot;sticky hammer board game&quot; and can&#39;t find anything.

It would be nice to be able to play with other people, but as long as the two-player experience is not far behind. We like to be competitive and occasionally block some moves, but not so much that the game is &quot;on the edge of a knife&quot;. We have no problem playing unofficial variations of the rules. I have already looked for some information about both games, but I am a little worried that nordic countries might be too tight for our style while Europe might be too loose. So, which option would be the most entertaining for us? As for expansions, is Nordic countries compatible with any?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Interaction_4184\"> /u/No_Interaction_4184 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lp2ccf/ttr_europe_or_nordic_countries/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>",

Since i&#39;ve had no luck googling, i may be severely misremembering the name.</p> <p>To my understanding, the gimmick is that the players are all aliens in an alien high secutiry prison, which then goes into some sort of code red, and then they have to escape while either helping, or screwing eachother over.</p> <p>There was also a variant of the game, where it the guards against a kingpin player who had taken over the prison.</p> <p>I&#39;d be super grateful if anyone could help me ID the game.</p> <p>Edit: <a href=\"/u/T5-R\">u/T5-R</a> found it immediately. The games are called Level 7. Now i just need to find a place near me that sells Level 7 [Lockdown] which appears to be unavailable everywhere.</p> </div><!",
