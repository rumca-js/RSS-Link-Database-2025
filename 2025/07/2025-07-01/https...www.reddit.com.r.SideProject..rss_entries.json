I\u2019d post on Reddit or Product Hunt then abandon it when nobody cared.</p> <p>This time I decided to try something more specific, a simple tool to help tattoo studios manage appointments and deposits. I used to work part-time at a shop so I had some context.</p> <p>Instead of waiting for people to find it I tried doing outreach. I exported tattoo studio owners using <strong>Warpleads</strong>, cleaned the list with <strong>Reoon</strong>, and wrote super short emails offering free access for early users.</p> <p>Out of about 650 emails I got 22 replies, 4 people signed up, and 2 ended up paying $35/month.
