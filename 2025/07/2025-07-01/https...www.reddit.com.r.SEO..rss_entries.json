So let&#39;s say hypothetically, I had an HVAC business that served a wide area (5ish surrounding cities) and one main city with one physical address within the main city. And there&#39;s 3-4 main services (heating,ac, electric), and a few sub services under each main service (ac repair, ac install, etc). What&#39;s the proper silo structure to include my main city, as well as all the surrounding cities? And does each surrounding city also need a main service page and child subservices? </p> <p>Or if there&#39;s a guide on this somewhere, I&#39;ll watch/read.
