This will lead to a whole bunch of very angry people who don\u2019t feel relevant as they can\u2019t provide for their families anymore. A low percentage of this group will be extreme enough to start sabotaging/destroying AI infrastructure like data centers and their power supply. If this happens frequent enough, AI data centers and power infrastructure become unsustainable. I think this could actually happen. A small percentage, still big as a group because so many will be affected, will not sit still at home, nibbling away at whatever UBI might exist.
