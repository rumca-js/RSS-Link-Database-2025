        "description": "This is the most ambitious DK has been in years.\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza has so many wild aspects going for it--the terrain deformation, the Kong transformations, the tween Pauline sidekick--that it's easy to overlook the basics. This is a new 3D platformer from the team behind Super Mario Odyssey, arguably one of the best of its genre. It's hard to see how those disparate elements come together from a distance, but an extended hands-on showed me how all the pieces gel together to make a new experience that feels like a next step for the Odyssey team, and even reminiscent in some ways of 3D platforming's earliest roots on the Nintendo 64.",
