There is this feature built into the system/ui that allows me to copy stuff on my phone and they&#39;d be copied to the tablet&#39;s clipboard as well and vice versa when both wifi and bluetooth is on. For example I can copy the text in this post on my phone and it would be copied to the tablet as well.
