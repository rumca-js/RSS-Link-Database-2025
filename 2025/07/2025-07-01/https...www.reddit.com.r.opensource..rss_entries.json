I needed a solid data grid for a React side project and eyed AG Grid for its Enterprise features like cell selection and row grouping. But their $1,000 per year per developer plus $750 per license pricing was way beyond my $0.00 budget (I am broke). </p> <p>I explored alternatives: TanStack Table lacked a built-in UI, and Handsontable\u2019s styling was a nightmare to customize. Frustrated, I decided to build my own. Meet Simple Table! A lightweight (16 kB) open-source React data grid, free for everyone. It includes alignment, filters, sorting, virtualization, infinite scroll, pagination, nested headers, row grouping, cell selection, aggregation functions and more. </p> <p>Check it out at <a href=\"https://www.simple-table.com\">https://www.simple-table.com</a> or",
