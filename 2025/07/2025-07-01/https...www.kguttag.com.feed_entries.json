        "description": "Last week, I gave a presentation at The Vintage Computer Festival Southwest (VCF SouthWest) about the development of the TMS9918 (and related devices), which I helped define, design, simulate, and debug from September 1977 through mid-1978. In addition to the presentation, I participated in a one-hour question-and-answer session hosted by Matthew Hagarty. Matthew has developed a series of FPGA-based 9918 emulators, the latest of which is pin-compatible except for providing R, G, and B output rather than composite video.",
