The thing is, I\u2019m doubting if I\u2019ll be able to grow professionally in here because it\u2019s been 2 months and I\u2019m just in tech support. I have 1 yoe and I wouldn\u2019t want to stuck my growth this early on my career.</p> <p>I\u2019ll try to explain my situation as detailed as I can:</p> <ul> <li><p>In the interview my boss said they needed a developer to update their Nodejs project. Said that I would be doing updates in general to some projects.</p></li> <li><p>First week in I found out I was replacing someone (I\u2019m fine with that), but this person had duties that are not for a developer, and of course I got all of these duties. I\u2019ll specify them down below.</p></li> <li><p>Two months in, I\u2019ve just been uploading files using existing apps, and haven\u2019t even touched the node project, and in the other projects I have changed a few lines like changing x == 10 to x",
