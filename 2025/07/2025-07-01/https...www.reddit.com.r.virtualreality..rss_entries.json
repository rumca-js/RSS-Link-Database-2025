I&#39;ve included it as it was one of the games I was replying to in the other post and it gives context to the next two games. At $4 on sale, I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth it. The main way it differs from other swinging games is that it provides a visualization of your movement, which honestly makes swinging around the city much, much easier than the next two games. If you aren&#39;t in it for the difficulty, this is the better of the three swinging games.</p> </div>",
