I have it on my old T420 laptop and was feeling confident, however had never switched due to being a quite avid gamer and worried about incompatibilities. </p> <p>So I installed Linux Mint, and ran into my first issue. I thought that since I had the games installed on a secondary SSD, I was good to point a fresh steam install to the old hard drive and pick up the old games. That SEEMED to work, until I tried to launch a game and nothing would happen. More furious googling resulted in realizing the NTFS file structure of the old drive was the likely culprit. No problem, I have fast internet. I formatted , reinstalled the games, cleared steam download cache, Budda boom Budda bin",

I\u2019m normally a Mac guy and absolutely hate Windows, but I\u2019ve had Linux on a couple of old computers to play around with. That being said I\u2019m very interested in switching from Windows to Bazzite, and I\u2019m hoping to find out if my hardware is compatible? It has:</p> <p>11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11600KF @ 3.90GHz 3.91 GHz -NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12gb -16GB RAM</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen some posts saying NVIDIA isn\u2019t great with Bazzite but I figured I\u2019d ask. Also, I do play games with anti-cheat but I\u2019m willing to separate with them if it means no Windows, as the bulk of my gaming is story games anyways. What\u2019s the process for getting games to work with Proton? I know of it but not how it works. </p> <p>I\u2019m very much a noob when it comes to computers and Linux, even with my minimal experience.

The way it&#39;s worded on the Bazzite website leaves some doubt about how well this actually works these days. (Before I get flamed for switching to Nvidia, I have a 6600xt I bought for gamescope features last year, and my 4070oc has just been collecting dust)</p> <p>If you&#39;ve been waiting for Nvidia support to get good enough to run Bazzite with an Nvidia graphics card for a htpc, the wait is over. It&#39;s good now, it boots right into controller friendly steam deck ui, the quick settings menu and performance overlay menu works now, and the best part, it&#39;s stable. Install the Nvidia os version (I&#39;ve seen weird issues with rebasing breaking gamescope, but try it lf you want), then set max resolution to 1440p ",
