So basically I have this project idea where I would like to connect an iPhone to a Raspberry Pi and transfer files from the phone to the Pi. I would write my own app and code for both but I would like to know if there is some knowledge about this topic that I could use for my idea. So far my research came to the point that in theory a Pi could connect to the iPhones Hotspot when connected by cable and via an http server on the pi the phone could do such file transfers. However I am not sure if this still works or if there are other ways to solve this.</p> <p>Thx in advance for any advice or suggestions :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BrogrammerAbroad\"> /u/BrogrammerAbroad </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1lpbdo0/file_transfer_from_ios_to_pi_via_cable_possible/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",

One of the commands I have uses FFMPEG in order to play preset sounds in a voice call, however I cannot figure out how to get it to work. Having the FFMPEG folder in the virtual environment just doesn&#39;t work and trying to use it from outside the virtual environment has permission issues.
