Among then, there were several moments where the book was written in such a way as to obfuscate information from the reader that was known to the characters. Personally, I found this to be somewhat annoying and artificial, pulling you out of the story by slapping around the head with the fact that you&#39;re reading fiction.</p> <p>On the other hand, the whole thing is artifice. It&#39;s fiction, so complaining that some particular element is artificial seems a bit arbitrary. I can think of other books that did something similar (not exactly the same but close enough) that I didn&#39;t find quite as grating. I think it&#39;s a fair question what is a legit use of the medium vs an abuse.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Crownie\"> /u/",

While the first was extremely lean, compact, methodical\u2013where every little thing beginning to end ended up serving some purpose, Lirael was very much NOT that. First, the beginning 100 pages (the section everyone raves about with the library) felt like almost an entirely separate story that could have just been its own novella. Beyond that, there are about 300 pages in the middle where the book meanders badly with zero direction or sense of urgency\u2013this isn\u2019t helped by Sam\u2019s POV introduction which is part",

I started reading Assassin&#39;s Apprentice by Robin Hobb and I think it&#39;s great, and I want something similar but with a female protagonist. The ones that immediately come to mind for me are the Alanna books (and sequels) by Tamora Pierce and The Seven Realms by Cinda Williams Chima (although I read them as a teenager so I don&#39;t know if they are actually good or if I was just young). I enjoyed The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms but haven&#39;t continued the series.

I put it off for a long time because surreal fantasy isn&#39;t really stuff I usually read and also because people who recommend it are always so mysterious about it. But since it&#39;s by far the most popular standalone on this subreddit I decided that I have to read it.</p> <p>The Concept is amazing, it reminds me of some of Christopher Nolan&#39;s films which I love (Prestige, Inception, Memento). The Prose is simplified on purpose but still beautiful and easy-flowing. The characters are ok I guess, there isn&#39;t enough time to make them great which is fine. The plot is good but once again the book is too short and isn&#39;t really about plot.</p> <p>In conclusion I give it an 8/10, fun read but I don&#39;t share the opinion of some people who think it&#39;s the greatest book of all time. If you like early career Nolan you should read it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",

I wasn\u2019t so sure about Pratchett\u2018s comedy before I started , but I did think it was quite funny at times, especially when I listen to parts of the audiobook. The narrator did a really good job. It was a pretty good commentary on religion. Even though it was quite a short read, and I enjoyed it I still felt myself dragging towards the end and just wanted to be finished. It wasn\u2019t really that much of a page turn for me like some of the other fantasy books I get really into. But it was a great pallet cleanser and change of pace from more serious fantasy. I especially like the ending when Brutha walks into the desert with vorbis. I\u2019m not entirely sure I want to read more discworld, I have going postal and mort downloaded already so there\u2019s a chance it could happened. 3.5/5 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a ",

We started with hidden gems and intersectional identities, had a massive rec thread, debated queernorm versus oppression narratives, tackled stereotypes and own voices, explored non-novel formats, discussed less visible identities, and ventured into sci-fi and horror territory. Plus we had our bookclub discussions throughout.</p> <p>That&#39;s a lot of ground covered, and hopefully people discovered some new books, authors, or perspectives along the way. The question now is how we keep some of these conversations going year-round - which topics resonated most, what books from our discussions deserve more attention, and how we can make sure the momentum doesn&#39;t just disappear come July.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ky947o/pride_month_2025_announcement_",

My preference for a series is to read the main books then come back and read novellas if I really enjoy the books and usually as a world refresher before a new main book. So, are the between book novellas required reading for the plot of the main story or just helping to build a wider world and is there a recommended place to read the prequel novellas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NefariousnessOk8476\"> /u/NefariousnessOk8476 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1loocbf/the_bound_and_the_broken_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1loocbf/the_bound_and_the_broken_question/\">[comments]</a></span",

It got me thinking and looking for more books/comics with sentient weapons and armor. </p> <p>I love sentient weapons and armor. Something about your mode of self defense having a mind of its own and not knowing how it could turn a battle or affect your everyday life is a fun story element.</p> <p>I\u2019ve read a few. Elric and Stormbringer probably the first to come to mind. R.A. Salvatore has Spearwielder\u2019s Tale. Also solid. I recently picked up the Ripple System books by Kyle Kirrin with Frank the talking axe. Progression fantasy, but fun reads.</p> <p>Anyone else have any that stand out?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ZainMcAllister\"> /u/ZainMcAllister </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1looblz/sentient_armorweapons/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
