Unfortunately it seems to activate a virtual card I need to provide photo ID with a live selfie. Now obviously the photo ID isn\u2019t an issue since to get a credit card to begin with you need to hand over that kind of information. What I\u2019m more worried about is the Live Photo. Would they be getting any usable biometric data from this? I.e face depth points, or any other kind of data that wouldn\u2019t be available in a normal photo? I\u2019m probably overthinking this but I would like to at least attempt to limit how much of my facial data is out there if I can help it.
