A good place to start with this, said Hilbert, would be fluid dynamics \u2013 physicists should be able to prove that our fluid dynamics equations are rooted in how we understand atoms behave when they bump into each other. This would also explain the origin of irreversibility in our lives, or the \u201carrow of time\u201d as physicists like to say. Over a century later, mathematicians have made a major breakthrough in this arena. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01800\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sci",
