What I think I would like in a book would books that are similar to these tv shows and movies. Granted there is a big gap in what they are. Animes I really enjoyed and would love a book like them would be; Vinland saga, Pluto and Monster. something that is thought provoking. Then for movies a book like Interstellar or Arival would also be amazing. </p> <p>I know those are broad but its because I want a bit of range to try some stuff and I know I&#39;ll like something that follows the same theme as those.</p> <p>Thanks for the help </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MonkeyDReader\"> /u/MonkeyDReader </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lpeazl/i_want_to_read_my_first_full_book_help_a_brother/\">[li",

I tried Hyperion, but I\u2019m really not big on Christian/catholic religions, and it\u2019s way too engrained in the story for me to get into it. I\u2019m trying The Fifth Season now, but I\u2019m having trouble getting into it because of the perspective. I like likeable, well-fleshed out, unique characters. The 2nd person perspective feels sort of like a character with no soul - like they\u2019re just \u201cblank.\u201d </p> <p>Noteable books/series I really like: - Red Rising series - Solo series - The handmaids tale/the testaments - The butterfly garden - Black Sun/Fevered Star/Mirrored Heavens - Project Hail Mary - The Martian - The Grishaverse books (shadow &amp; bone/six of crows, etc) - The Mystborn Saga </p> <p>Dislikes: - romance (especial",

Literary fiction or horror books that deliver a profound philosophical exploration of faith and the human condition as well as southern culture and americana. Im open to more bizarre books with elements of magical realism or paranormal elements, or honest down to earth books that explore the themes above while remaining grounded in real world scenarios.

More like someone thinking out loud about the quieter side of life. No big plot, no &quot;here\u2019s how to fix your life&quot; chapters. Just someone reflecting on what it feels like to live a normal, uneventful existence.</p> <p>What surprised me is how peaceful it felt to read. There\u2019s something weirdly comforting about someone admitting they don\u2019t have it all figured out either. Made me feel a bit more okay with where I\u2019m at, if that makes sense.</p> <p>Definitely not for everyone, but if you ever feel stuck in the in-between of things, this one might speak to you in a quiet way.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

I am interested in dark romance books, I\u2019ve read Corrupt, Haunting Adeline( although I didn\u2019t really enjoy this one so much it still kept me hooked ). Other books I\u2019ve enjoyed are: Punk 57, Ugly Love, Hercule Poirot\u2019s Christmas by Agatha Christie. If my favorite movies would help you even more in giving me a suggestion, I really enjoyed \u201cGone girl\u201d, \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d and \u201cHow to lose a guy in 10 days\u201d.
