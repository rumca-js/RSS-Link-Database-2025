It was the perfect length (about 3-4 hours) with mostly intuitive puzzles and would love to know if anyone else has any <strong>lesser-known 90s adventure games for PC</strong> they would suggest that are under 10 hours in length (soft request - don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s a little longer) and semi-easy to get a physical copy of. These will be played on time-accurate hardware, so I&#39;d like to get an actual disc rather than rely on emulation. Bonus points if the main playable character is a woman, but I know that was a bit of a unicorn to find in Obsidian. Otherwise, any genre from sci-fi to fantasy to mystery are all good with me. Would love to know any quality titles that would be fun to go through.</p> <p>If you suggest Myst or Riven, you will be admonished.

A good analogy to the 8-bit vs. 16-bit 1990s console thing would be comparing the performance of different cars, from different manufacturers, solely based on engine displacement. Can you say that a car from manufacturer X equipped with a 2.0 liter engine has better performance than a car from manufacturer Y equipped with a 1.6 liter engine? No you can&#39;t, because performance has multiple dimension (acceler",
