Which means not using Gosu or similar to deescalate privileges.</p> <p>In regards to the attack surface I&#39;m thinking that using a distroless base image is a good start. Most applications require a bit of setup which would usually be done using a shell script. However since including a shell in the image is out of the question I&#39;m thinking this should be implemented as a statically compiled binary using something like Go or Rust (or whatever make sense).</p> <p>Obviously regular patching is also a key factor.</p> <p>Do you guys agree with the above?
