I managed to make the setup work. Finally, it was installed. Then right out the box the garuda updated couldnt update cause some lib was missing, despite being in my system, somehow managed to download it off the web and manually install, then linux wouldnt allow me to install because of SigLevel something, again chat gpt guided me trough, managed to fix the issue with the lib. Sudo update ffs its been hours. Aaaaand it still wouldnt work, cause somehow pacman was corrupted? Then went back to fix it. Did that, tried to update my system again. Guess what. Errors in the konsole. Want to remove ? Yes Loads smth like 680 files, then, c",

[cough] vintage laptop with dual core CPU and 1 GB DDR2 RAM for 30$, 32bit only. I wanted to deepen my Linux knowledge without making any changes on my main machine. I am not sure about the version of the book I was following, probably book 9 or 10.</p> <p>My installation didn&#39;t reach to a bootable stage since the HDD in the laptop had issues. I was apparently writing the freshly compiled binaries right onto an HDD with many bad sectors.</p> <p>Even though it might have been looked like a defeat, my aim was to learn Linux intimately. I learned about following dependencies, appreciating time and effort that goes into building a functional end product, and maybe the most importantly, not being scared of tarballs \ud83d\ude05</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mrtzysl\"> /u/mrtzysl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
