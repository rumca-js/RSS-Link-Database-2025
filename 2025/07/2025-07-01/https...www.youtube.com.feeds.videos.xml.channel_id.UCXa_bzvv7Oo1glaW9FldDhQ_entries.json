        "description": "While Elden Ring Nightreign is a great way to bring a bit of roguelike action to the tried and tested FromSoftware formula, what has made it really special is its callbacks to past titles in the studio\u2019s illustrious history. \n\nThe Nightfarers each bring elements of titles like Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice to the mix, alongside a slew of bosses that bring back many fond memories of their original appearances in past games. With all of these nostalgic additions being brought to the table, it\u2019s puzzling that the studio hasn\u2019t added any of the memorable weapons it has added in past titles to the mix. \n\nWe take a look at ten weapons that could potentially make the cut if FromSoft decides to remedy the situation.",
