We walk through his life: he is 52, twice divorced, has written three books about the poets (that have made no difference or impact whatsoever), and only teaches for the money (his classes have been less populated day after day).

This was on my mind when beginning a book all about seemingly one man\u2014and one with an especially checkered history at that\u2014spun news so hard metaphorical scissors were needed to break it apart again. America a hundred years ago simply did not want to get involved in affairs it had no reasons to join. This means war in far off lands and while WW2 with hindsight seems a no-brainer why the US joined (and even then it was after a strong push for isolation until that became a totally indefensible position), WW1 was a much more mixed affair. I admit I am (yet) far from even an armchair amateur on this corner of history, but to put it succinctly, this was far and away not a \u2018good vs evil\u2019/\u2019black vs white\u2019 conflict that WW2 seemed to become.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the most gifted liars ever and immune to shame.\u201d</p> <p>The book opens early on with the author describing John R.

I\u2019m only finishing because I\u2019ve made it this far. It\u2019s written in such a juvenile way without totally being a YA novel, all of the characters are very one dimensional, and why does the writer seem to constantly hint at an unhealthy closeness of the adopted brother and sister???? The only saving grace this book has is that there are some more unique ideas for zombie world building.
