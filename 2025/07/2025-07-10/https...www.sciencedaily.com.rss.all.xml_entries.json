        "description": "What if humans didn\u2019t have to suffer the slow-burning fire of chronic inflammation as we age? A surprising study on two types of lemurs found no evidence of \"inflammaging,\" a phenomenon long assumed to be universal among primates. These findings suggest that age-related inflammation isn\u2019t inevitable and that environmental factors could play a far bigger role than we thought. By peering into the biology of our primate cousins, researchers are opening up new possibilities for preventing aging-related diseases in humans.",

That\u2019s what researchers at Columbia and Brookhaven are doing\u2014constructing intricate 3D nanostructures by harnessing the predictable folding of DNA strands. Their new design method uses voxel-like building blocks and an algorithm called MOSES to fabricate nanoscale devices in parallel, with applications ranging from optical computing to bio-scaffolds.
