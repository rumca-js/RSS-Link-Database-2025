While that&#39;s brought back a lot of old memories, I haven&#39;t been able to find the particular one I&#39;m thinking of.</p> <p>I know that I&#39;m clutching at straws expecting anybody here to be able to identify it for me but I figured there&#39;s no harm in asking for suggestions. All I can say is that, unlike the majority of cracktro music, it was very upbeat. It was a happy, uplifting tune.
