Running <code>run.sh</code> starts up the dev container successfully, but the nested anonymous volume at /app/.venv seems to create a .venv on the host. I thought the entire point of this setup was to isolate the container&#39;s venv from the hosts, but it doesn&#39;t appear to work how I would expect.</p> <p>Why does docker behave this way with nested anonymous volumes? How can I achieve full isolation of the docker venv from the host venv without giving up the use of a volume mount for bidirectional file propagation?</p> <p>For reference, I am running this in WSL 2 Ubuntu 22.04 on Windows 10.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Revolutionary_Dog_63\"> /u/Revolutionary_",

If so, I\u2019d love to hear about your experience running containers with Docker alone in production.</p> <p>For context, I&#39;m trying to understand whether we really need Kubernetes, or if it&#39;s feasible to run our software on-premises using just Docker. For scaling, we\u2019re considering duplicating the software across multiple nodes behind a load balancer. I understand that unlike Kubernetes, this approach doesn\u2019t allow dynamic scaling of individual services \u2014 instead, we\u2019d be duplicating the full footprint of all services across all nodes with all nodes connecting to the same underlying data stores for state management. However, I\u2019m okay with throwing some extra compute at the problem if it helps us avoid managing a multi-node Kubernetes cluster in an on-prem data center.</p> <p>We\u2019re building software",

Also looking at using a vpn to tunnel in.</p> <p>I&#39;m interested in how others have arranged a similar setup, perhaps using Stacks and Environments in Docker. I&#39;m assuming that there is some (more) &#39;optimal&#39; way to arrange and monitor everything in Docker rather than just having a whole list of containers.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BJeT0421\"> /u/BJeT0421 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1lw0kca/container_arrangement/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1lw0kca/container_arrangement/\">[comments]</a></span>",
