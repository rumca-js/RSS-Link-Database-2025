Actors who gave such an amazing performance that no one else could have played their role. </p> <p>One that comes to mind is Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski. It helps that the role was written specifically with him in mind, but still. It is absolutely his most iconic role and for good reason. He is not playing a part in that film. He IS that character. He might just be playing himself, but he is so natural. As a matter of fact, another example of perfect casting lies within that movie as well, with John Goodman as Walter. I can\u2019t imagine anyone else playing that role. He is by far the funniest part of the entire movie. </p> <p>Other examples without making this post an essay:</p> <p>J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Terrence Fletcher</p> <p>Matthew Lillard as Shaggy</p> <p>Al Pacino as Michael Corleone</p> <p>Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",
