It makes me wonder if VR will eventually take over flatscreen gaming since more people want that deeper immersion. It\u2019s kinda like how fewer people play on regular monitors these days compared to before. Maybe one day flatscreen gaming will just become less popular as more switch to VR. With some device I have been used such as PCL,Q3,BSB1 the experience already feels better than a regular screen. I feel like if VR headsets can get lighter and more comfy to wear, while still keeping good graphics and performance, then VR could really become the main way people game in the future. Making the hardware easier to use and portable is gonna be super important to get more gamers on board.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tatonkk\"> /u/tatonkk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1lw7hip/do_you_think_vr_will_e",

I&#39;m looking at playing games like War Thunder, DCS, and Assetto Corsa, all of which I have on steam, so I don&#39;t understand why the extra storage is such a need. If I&#39;m only using games i have on steam I&#39;m assuming i don&#39;t need to use the storage in the headset right? Apart from the storage the only difference is the resolution which doesnt seem all to worth for the price, especially because I dont play in 4k.</p> <p>It seems im leaning towards the 3s but want to learn more before i buy. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-Lobster-4510\"> /u/Icy-Lobster-4510 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1lw1qf7/need_help_deciding_on_quest_3_or_3s/\">[link]</a></spa",
