I noticed that a lot of my books are non-fiction, and the fictional books that I have are rarely comedy. I want more comedy books, or at least books with some comedic elements in them \u2014 preferably fiction. </p> <p>I don&#39;t care too much about age range of the book&#39;s intended audience too much since I liked the Lemony Snicket series and A House Called Awful End. I also liked Hitch Hiker&#39;s Guide Through The Galaxy and Dirk Gently. </p> <p>I also do not care if it has profanity, violence, a lot of romance, or nudity in it since I find humor in all sorts of comedies. Anyhow, I would love to have more funny books and audio stories in my collection, even if they&#39;re short.

For those of you who are not familiar with AR (Accelerated Reader) it&#39;s an online testing system where students (and teachers) can take a quiz about the content of the book to earn points based on the book&#39;s complexity and length. I would like suggestions if books that fit into this category, I&#39;m a high school (9-12) teacher and I compete with other teachers for the most AR points every year and I also am always on constant lookout for great books to add to my classroom library. I will include a link in the replies to the AR search engine so you can see if your suggestion is testable as well. </p> <p>I read very broadly, but a good portion of AR is sci fi and fantasy YA, or just generally popular books. I will take suggestions in any genre, especially those that are obscure or unique!

It&#39;s about a guy who wrote creepypastas when he was young and gets introduced to the dark web by a mysterious person.

I&#39;m a philosophy enthusiast, and recently I&#39;ve realised that I know a bunch of european philosophers as well as some middle eastern philosophers from ancient times (let&#39;s say middle ages), but I don&#39;t know any Maya, Inca or Aztec philosopher. Searching on Google lead me to discover native americans&#39; general philosophy and modern day Latino philosophers, which is cool but isn&#39;t quite the same thing. So I wanted to ask if someone knows any book about this civilizations&#39; philosophies. On a side note, I noticed that both Native americans&#39; philosophy and Latino philosophy seem to focus heavily on gender, more that European philosophies from the same times. If pre-Columbian civilizations also happened to focus on gender and someone knows any material about it, feel free to recommend it. Uni papers or collections of papers are good too, even if I suppose it&#39;s a bit of a stretch of the whole subreddit&#39;s go",

I like most sub-genres, but I lean more towards the fantasy, contemporary, gothic (not dark), angsty style romance sub-genres. Idk if any of that helps or makes sense, but I really don\u2019t know where to start looking or if there\u2019s a book like that out (I\u2019d be surprised if there wasn\u2019t lol!) so any book or author recommendations I\u2019d really love it!! </code></pre> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wyvern-0221\"> /u/Wyvern-0221 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lw1oai/helpless_romantic_book_recs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lw1oai/helpless_romantic_book_",
