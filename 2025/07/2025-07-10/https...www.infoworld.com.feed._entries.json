While Azure offers flexibility and power, it also makes it easy to overspend. Resources are often left running, services are overprovisioned and budgets get blown without warning.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s changed recently is that artificial intelligence can now take on much of this burden. Microsoft has integrated AI into several core Azure tools. These intelligent features analyze usage, find waste, make predictions and take action before problems become expensive.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article explains how AI helps real organizations cut costs on Azure without compromising on scale, security or performance.

The JIT compiler compiles the CIL code at run time, hence the name. However, you might often want to tweak the JIT compiler to optimize the performance of your applications. You can apply specific attributes in the code of your application to achieve this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>MethodImplAttribute</code> class in C# enables you to instruct the JIT compiler to \u201cinline\u201d a method by decorating the method with the attribute. Inlining is a compiler optimization that improves execution speed by replaci",
