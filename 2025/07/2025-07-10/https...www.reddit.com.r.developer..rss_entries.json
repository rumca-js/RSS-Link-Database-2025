I am proficient in Python, Django, Flask, and have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the cloud side, I know MS Azure very well, and know enough of Google Cloud to fulfil the project needs. Going forward, I am building a web app that utilises GenAI on top of Google Cloud. Since I am not that much familiar with the different CSS and JS frameworks, I would like your expertise to pick between Tailwind CSS and Next.js (suggested by GPT) and Django/Flask with Python to create the webapp. I will need to learn Tailwind CSS and Next.js, if I have to go with that, but if I pick Python-Django, I can get started easily.</p> <p>Please guide a fellow junior out\ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kirti_7\"> /u/kirti_7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1lw6hms/need_opinions_on_which_tech_st",
