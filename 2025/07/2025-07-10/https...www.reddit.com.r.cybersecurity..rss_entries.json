The problem is, there\u2019s basically nothing to do here.</p> <p>The full-time employees just sit around watching logs on giant TV screens all day, but they don\u2019t actually do anything with them. If they see something, they just raise a ticket and pass it on to another team in a different city.</p> <p>We don\u2019t even have the permissions to configure the firewall or tune IDS rules, which I thought would at least be a basic part of this work.</p> <p>To make it worse, I\u2019ve actually had to explain and teach a couple of security tools to the full-time employees here.</p> <p>I\u2019m actively looking for other internships, but honestly I can\u2019t stand even one more day here. I feel like I\u2019m wasting my time completely.</p> <p>Has anyone else been in this situation? Is it better to just end it early and focus on fin",

So far, I\u2019ve tested tools like OpenVAS, Grype, Vuls, Trivy, and OSV-Scanner, but none have been fully satisfactory - partly because my company wants a solution that only shows software that actually needs to be updated due to a known CVE (and not every installed package or potential issue).</p> <p>Additionally, the final goal is to scan a system that is completely offline (no internet connection). The idea is to collect data from that machine via USB stick, scan it on another machine, and then bring the results back.</p> <p>I\u2019m honestly not sure if I\u2019m missing something here (or just overthinking it \ud83d\ude05), especially since I don\u2019t have a contact person or mentor for this topic internally.</p> <p>Is what they\u2019re aski",

My cyber career started IT-focused; for the last three years, I have been working more in OT/ICS domains . Clients are from energy, transport, telecom, and water . I do risk assessments, due diligence, write cyber security mgmt plans, etc.</p> <p>But I feel like I don\u2019t know these systems deep enough(obviously). I\u2019m just skimming the surface. I did a project on offshore wind farm and another on telecom infra, and it made me realise I barely understand how telecom actually works. I am really interested in what\u2019s really going on behind the scenes.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to change careers. I just want to get deeper into the systems side while staying in cyber. Anyone else in a similar boat ? How do you go about learning this stuff properly without stepping out of security work?
