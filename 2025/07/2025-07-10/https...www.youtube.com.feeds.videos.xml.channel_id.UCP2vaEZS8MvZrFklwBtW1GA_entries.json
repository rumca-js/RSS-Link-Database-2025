        "description": "How to waterproof shower outside corners\u2026I applied Schluter ALL-SET using 5-inch and 12-inch joint compound knives. They I used the KERDI trowel and embedded KERDI membrane which extends at least 2 inches beyond the screws & washers, This is just one way to waterproof an outside corner. Many thanks to Schluter for providing the materials for my client\u2019s shower renovation.
