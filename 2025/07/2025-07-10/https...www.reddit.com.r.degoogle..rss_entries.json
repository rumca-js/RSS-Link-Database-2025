However I feel like, especially lately with all the gemini stuff, privacy and google are not a good match and I want to have close to zero ties with that company.

This made me wonder about how deleted data gets treated on Google\u2019s end. It seems that once you delete your data, google does eventually get around to permanently deleting the bulk of it, or at least anonymizing it. However some wording in their privacy policy was a little vague and I was hoping someone could help clarify. They state that \u201cif Google receives a lawful subpoena, information may be retained as required by law.\u201d The way this is worded to me means that if you delete your data, but google gets subpoenaed in the time before they delete it from their side, they retain the right to hold onto the relevant data to comply with the subpoena in case someone gets in trouble for a crime and tries to cover their tracks by deleting data before google is compelled to share it. However, could it also mean that they can hold onto whatever data they want even if they don\u2019t get subpoe",

Currently, I&#39;ve only been able to set Kagi as my home page, but nothing else.

I&#39;ve become a lot more interested in making a private life recently due to everything going on in the world right now. I have removed just about every part of Google and Meta from my phone/pc, I have switched from Windows to Linux, and I am starting to learn how to self-host.</p> <p>I have been trying to show my gf what I have done and the benefits of going private. I even convinced her to use the Cloaked website to see what kind of information is out there about her. However, she still doesn&#39;t take her privacy seriously. And that&#39;s fine, her life her choice, but I want to know how her lack of online privacy might effect me and my progress in going fully private.</p> <p>If she refuses to go private, does that make my goal of privacy a pipe dream? Am I doomed unless she follows in my footsteps?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",
