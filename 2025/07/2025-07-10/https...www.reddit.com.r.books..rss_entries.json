But I&#39;m currently reading the complete works of Shakespeare, and I&#39;m debating whether to count every play. It feels weird not to, because it&#39;s Shakespeare and they&#39;re all so well-known and iconic. But they&#39;re printed in small print, two columns, on big pages, so most of them are pretty short and don&#39;t meet my usual rule.The Comedy of Errors is only 18 pages! Counting all 37 therefore also feels wrong and not an accurate portrayal of my yearly reading. </p> <p>I know this doesn&#39;t actually matter, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m obsessing about it, just trying to document as best I can given my Type A-ness. \ud83e\udd23</p> <p>So in a more general sense (so this post fosters discussion and hopefully doesn&#39;t get removed), what do you all count as worthy to put in your reading logs? Where&#39;s the dividing line? Or is there one?",

I know I could borrow the books from my local library (that way, I&#39;m not spending money on them), but I&#39;d just DNF them if the content is too spicy. That&#39;s already happened with one series I borrowed from the library (<span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">The Arcana Chronicles by Kresley Cole</span>, for anyone who is curious), and I&#39;d like to avoid that again.</p> <p>Now, I&#39;m okay with romance in books; however, I very much prefer it when authors &quot;fade to black&quot; or find other ways to imply that the characters did it.
