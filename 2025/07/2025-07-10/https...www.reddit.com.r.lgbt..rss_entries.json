If I had a nickel for every time I\u2019ve heard someone who isn\u2019t queer ramble on and on about their boyfriend or girlfriend and them ramble on and on about girls or boys, I\u2019d have a yacht and a private island with a runway for a private jet.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a slippery slope of what \u201cmaking it your entire personality\u201d is. I\u2019ve seen many wise this when queer people are literally just talking about being queer or expressing pride in their orientation. </p> <p>Another thing that bugs me is it seems like a very shallow way of viewing queerness.
