I just looked it up on google to try to find a torrent for it and I saw a website called finduzzcatcafe.se which showed me a magnet link download for the movie. It looked kinda shady because when I looked up the website separately apparently it was for a Swedish cat cafe that had nothing to do with torrents but my friend said it was fine so I just downloaded it. After transterring to a flash drive and connecting it to a tv the file didn&#39;t even play, and then a couple hours later I was just on the YouTube main recommended page and some weird audio was playing in the background with scary music and dialogue, like some movie or something. It only stopped after unplugging the tv. My friend thinks it&#39;",
