Internal Tool MCPs Get More Usage</strong><br/> Even though everyone talks about customer-facing AI, internal MCPs give teams room to experiment and better ensure adoption. E.g. letting support folks query internal systems or enabling non-tech teams to get data without pinging engineering.</p> <p><strong>2. The Use Cases Go Way Beyond \u201cAI for APIs\u201d</strong><br/> We assumed MCPs would mostly wrap APIs. But there&#39;s a lot more to it than that, including one team that sees them as a way to shift integration burdens.</p> <p><strong>3. Observability is a Black Hole</strong><br/> You can build and deploy an MCP but understanding how it behaves is super hard.
