I really really want a simple and free text to speech generator that has character voices, specifically Katsuki Bakugou from My Hero Academia, the English dub. I even tried going on c.ai and asking a bot of him if it could repeat after me, it said yes, and then couldn&#39;t. I just have a thousand words I need read in that voice and I dont want to sign up for a subscription or pay to do it. I dont even care if it sounds robotic or unnatural. This seems like it should be so easy but I cannot find anything and I&#39;m actually going crazy. Please, if you have any sites or programs that can do this for me I would be forever grateful, like I said I have been searching for an hour now and can&#39;t seem to find a single free TTS that can do this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
