It comes with features like automatic message translation and smart group chat replies using AI. It\u2019s a pretty competitive space for third-party Telegram apps, but I managed to get 200 initial users in the very first week by doing two simple things. 1. I shared the app on Twitter. I\u2019m a Twitter creator with around 100K followers, and with help from a few friends, we posted some hands-on demos and early access links. That attracted a wave of early adopters, especially folks like me who are into indie app development. Around 100 users actually joined our internal Telegram test group from that alone.</p> <p>2.I posted in several AI-focused startup communities. I invited people to join our private beta and report bugs in exchange for small rewards. That helped spread the word organically among people who genuinely cared about this kind of tool. As of now, we\u2019ve passed 6,000 early users. If you\u2019re workin",
