I was thinking maybe some forgotten realms books?</p> <p>I really like the found family trope, a ragtag group of characters thrown together on a quest and finding friendship, love and acceptance in each other. Only examples I can think of are tv, but I loved the group dynamics in ATLA, The Dragon Prince, and Firefly.</p> <p>I&#39;m open to any type of story though, I just would like it to be lighter in tone, low stakes kind of fantasy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Binlorry_Yellowlorry\"> /u/Binlorry_Yellowlorry </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1lwrd12/looking_for_standalones_to_read_between_books_of/\">[link]</a></span> ",

Holly here, author of Tudor-inspired fantasy Six Wild Crowns, which was published by <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/holly-race/six-wild-crowns/9780316572927/\">Orbit US</a> and <a href=\"https://store.orbit-books.co.uk/products/six-wild-crowns\">Orbit UK</a> exactly a month ago. It&#39;s what you would get if Six the Musical and House of the Dragon had a baby, and is born of my long and deep obsession with all things Tudor.</p> <p>What if Henry VIII was married to all six of his wives at once? And they lived on an island where the king <em>had</em> to have six wives, stationed in six castles, in order to maintain the island&#39;s magical protection? What if that protection was mysteriously failing, and Henry&#39;s newest wife Boleyn took it upon herself to find out why? If you like feminist rage, queernormative worlds, dragons as cute pets, underwater palaces and messy messy women, you might enjoy Six Wild Crowns. It&#39",
