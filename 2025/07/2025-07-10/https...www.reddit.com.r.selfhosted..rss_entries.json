Tried going through settings and it seems like it should be possible (there&#39;s a Continue Listening tab available) but didn&#39;t find anything that would be preventing this from working for me, and looking it up I haven&#39;t found people asking this.

Current approaches such as Obico\u2019s \u201cSpaghetti Detective\u201d utilise a vision based machine learning model, trained to only detect spaghetti related defects with a slow throughput on edge devices (&lt;1fps on 2Gb Raspberry Pi 4b), making it not edge deployable, real-time or able to capture a wide plethora of defects. Whilst their model can be inferred locally, it\u2019s expensive to run, using a lot of compute, typically inferred over their paid cloud service which introduces potential privacy concerns. </p> <p>My research led to the creation of a new vision-based ML model, focusing on edge deployability so that it could be deployed for free on cheap, local hardware.
