Basically it&#39;s their move to go beyond just an AI chatbot and more into being a proper real-time search and knowledge engine. The idea is to deliver answers that are fast, accurate, and always grounded in live data, not just some static model.</p> <p>From what I gather, the goal with Comet is to compete more directly with traditional search engines like Google, but using AI at its core instead of being just a search index with ranking algorithms. They&#39;re aiming to combine the best of both worlds: the speed and flexibility of LLMs with the reliability of up-to-date sources. It\u2019s not just generating stuff off the top of its head either, it&#39;s citing and sourcing everything in real time. That\u2019s a big shift from hallucinating bots.</p> <p>Seems like they\u2019re really doubling down on being an answer engine not a search engine. So instead of giving you 10 blue",
