        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>In basically all forms of media and entertainment the occurance of the &quot;flop&quot; is pretty commonplace. These days, movies or albums from major studios/artists with big budgets and even bigger expectations that fall flat upon release are pretty common, and the news is seemingly always talking about them. Even in my other non-media hobbies, like cycling, I&#39;ve seen flops happen when new products that are supposed to be innovative and cool turn out to be smoke and mirrors. However, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard anyone call a board game a flop. </p> <p>So to the actual question of the post, there are bad games and there are overrated games, but do board games ever flop? Have there been major releases from big publishers/designers that had sizeable (for the hobby) levels of hype only to fail critically and commercially upon release? And if so, what are some of the notable times it&#39;s happened?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted ",
