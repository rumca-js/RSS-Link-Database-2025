Looking at <a href=\"https://www.protondb.com/app/1172710/\">ProtonDB</a> this particular combination seems to cause frequent crashes. All the reports with that combo are saying that. The only ones with a 5800X3D that say it works fine use an AMD card. I myself have a 5800X3D, a RTX4070 and 64GB of RAM. I&#39;m using the Flatpak Steam on Debian and other UE5 titles work fine without any stability issues. The game runs well I don&#39;t have any performance issues, but after 20-30 minutes it reliably freezes for a minute and then crashes. I have tried all possible combinations of launch options from ProtonDB but so far no luck. So I&#39;m really curios if anyone has the game running reliably on that hardware combination and if so, how they&#39;re running it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pzm9-",

I&#39;ve even downloaded it from everywhere it&#39;s available and not a single one worked. Bought the game on steam (didn&#39;t want to do that) and it works somewhat perfectly, it uses the IGPU not the DGPU on my laptop and about 15GB of RAM on medium settings at 720p but it runs well enough. The built in mods are great and I&#39;m enjoying the game but just wish it was available on GOG so I could actually own the game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lazyphantom_13\"> /u/Lazyphantom_13 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lwcfwm/weird_issue/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lwcfwm/weird_issue/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Overall it\u2019s going well, but I\u2019ve noticed noticeable FPS drops on certain games, particularly Pacific Drive and The Alters. I\u2019ve been told that DirectX 12 games can be more problematic on Linux. Current setup: RTX 3060 Ti I\u2019m wondering if switching to an AMD RX 9060 16GB would be a good move to improve performance on Linux. By selling my 3060 Ti, the upgrade would cost me around $200. Questions: \u2022 Are AMD GPUs really better performers than NVIDIA on Linux? \u2022 Is the upgrade worth it for $200 in my case? \u2022 Has anyone tested the RX 9060 16GB on Linux?
