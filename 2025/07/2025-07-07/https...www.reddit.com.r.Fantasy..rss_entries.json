It features cool cosmere science, the likes of which we\u2019ve hardly seen in the cosmere before, and gives a glimpse of the sorts of geopolitical conflicts that can arise once the worlds of the cosmere start colliding more regularly with one another. It serves as both a sequel to the novella <em>Sixth of the Dusk</em> and a stand-alone entry in the universe (<em>Sixth of the Dusk\u2019s full text is featured as flashbacks in this book)\u2014though I wouldn\u2019t recommend it as an intro to the cosmere since it features a high degree of cosmere interconnectivity and has spoilers for Mistborn Era 2\u2019s *The Bands of Mourning</em>.</p> <p>To be clear, I had not read <em>Sixth of the Dusk</em> prior to reading this novel.</p> <p>It is far from a perfect book, in my opinion: the entire first half of this book was a chore to read, with relatively uninteresting characters and plotting.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>About 150 pages into Red Knight - Miles Cameron, I was really digging the more realistic take on medieval combat. </p> <p>The armament descriptions and fatigue as well as the tactical descriptions of warfare were interesting. I also liked the magic system of the book. </p> <p>However, the book overstayed its welcome to me by about 250 pages. I think you could take an ace to this book and make it actually great. </p> <p>I was on kindle and didn&#39;t realize just how long this book was and it was really only &quot;pretty good&quot; to me not &quot;great&quot;. </p> <p>Does anyone have thoughts on whether or not it&#39;s worth continuing on? I&#39;ve read the author is pretty prolific so I doubt he becomes a much better author book over book which sometimes does occurred with new authors. </p> <p>Tldr: is the series worth it? I would rate book 1 a 6 of 10 but I am intrigued. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

I stopped because it is revealed suddenly that Gen loves her and they start making out. From the start , I never felt like Gen loved Chalaine as a man loves a woman. It was her mother, he has some chemistry with. Specially in book 1. Gen had the memory of 3 ancient legends. The way he behaves also does not portray a teenager. so it made sense that he would fall in love with Mirelle(the mother). Chalaine is a sheltered but good hearted teen. What she needed after the the death of of her son and the rapist ",
