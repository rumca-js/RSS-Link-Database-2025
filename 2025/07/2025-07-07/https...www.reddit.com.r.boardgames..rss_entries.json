My partner and I have been invited to a long time friend\u2019s birthday party this weekend, and are unfortunately unable to get him the kind of present we\u2019d like to. HOWEVER we did have the thought of baking him a huge cookie or cake and then using icing to give it the appearance of the disc from the Betrayal Legacy 1st Edition game (the first legacy board game we played with him long ago, and a bit of an inside joke). Can anyone please share photos of both sides of the disc? We know one side had the place to put little shields or something, but, while we swear the back had something to, we don\u2019t recall what it looked like and can\u2019t find it online.

At the time, I was a poor college student, but this year I graduated, and I finally had the disposable income to buy all my missing expansions, only to go to their website and find out they closed shop two weeks ago...</p> <p>Is this temporary? Is there a new store page somewhere, like a parent company or an amazon storefont? Where can I find them on resale. I have Hallow&#39;s Eve &amp; Black Masque, but I&#39;m missing the others...</p> <p>Could someone with the missing expansions at least take pictures of the slasher cards from the expansions &amp; thier slasher powers so I can know who I&#39;m missing &amp; what they looked like/do?</p> <p>I&#39;m devastated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EffectiveGap1563\"> /u/EffectiveGap1563 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/",
