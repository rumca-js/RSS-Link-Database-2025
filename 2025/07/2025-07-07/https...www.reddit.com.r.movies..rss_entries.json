I suddenly realized the studio&#39;s collection of 100 000 sound effects was useless without the experience to know which 50 effects the audience had been conditioned to accept as authentic by other films. And then there as the foleying that I helped with, in which a man kneeing a watermelon doesn&#39;t sound like a Hollywood effect, a real punch to the face doesn&#39;t sound like a Hollywood effect, but a man kneeing a watermelon with olive oil on his leg sounded &quot;right&quot; for reasons I can&#39;t explain.</p> <p>Something I appreciate in the filming of movies is when the actors are actually shouting in loud environments (nightclubs, windstorms) because they&#39;re recorded in silence and the music/wind is added later. What this usually results in is the audio being loud",

Requiem for a Dream, 12 Years a Slave, Grave of the Fireflies, Dear Zachary - all these movies are really well made and people give them their flowers, but like no shit people only want to watch them once, they&#39;re emotionally devastating. </p> <p>Meanwhile I think of Nomadland. Other than the main character&#39;s background of losing her things in a recession, the story isn&#39;t supposed to be sad. I mean, it&#39;s about a woman finding out what makes her happy and brings her joy and peace. And she finds a community of like-minded people. But man, it just instilled such an incredible sense of loneliness in me unlike anything else I&#39;ve seen. And it came out right after the worst bout of depression I&#39;ve ever had in my life, so I hate it because I felt like it found joy specifically where I had found misery.</p> <p>And this post was also inspire",
