This low-volume, high-precision factory near Berlin is focused on manufacturing thermal paste, liquid metal, and CNC products like water blocks and fittings. Roman \"Der8auer\" Hartung shows us the processes for making liquid metal in this special video, following-up our previous video seeing how thermal paste is made. These processes involve chemistry, mechanics, manufacturing, scanning electron microscopes for R&D, and more.\n\nWatch our THERMAL PASTE FACTORY video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIk_mMrt2w\nAnd check out our Intel Fab tour in Arizona here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUIh0fOUcrQ\nFind our factory tours playlist here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsIk_mMrt2w&list=PLsuVSmND84QuVMZuk2HGUtCSYXR7nmC5a\n\nDer8auer on YouTube: @der8auer-en \n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: h",
