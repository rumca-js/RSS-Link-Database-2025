However I&#39;m unable to play the COTP DLC and idk why. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because it&#39;s not in the game files or what but in the map I can see the &quot;Valley of the Kings&quot; region and everytime I hover over it it asks me to buy the DLC from the ubi store. Obviously I can&#39;t buy it cuz it&#39;s cracked so I&#39;d appreciate any help or solutions. How can I play the DLC? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Klutzy_Sell_5419\"> /u/Klutzy_Sell_5419 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1lu9f5v/how_to_unlock_curse_of_the_pharaohs_dlc_for_ac/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1lu9f5v/how_to_unloc",
