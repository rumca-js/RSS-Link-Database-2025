But insiders and scientists warn that hidden within it is a mix of household and industrial chemicals such as Pfas (\u201cforever chemicals\u201d), pharmaceuticals, pesticides, hormone-damaging chemicals and microplastics, threatening the long-term health of the land.</p><p>Every year, 768,000 tonnes of this byproduct of wastewater treatment is spread over 150,000 hectares of agricultural land in England. The practice is banned in some countries, such as Switzerland, but in the UK it continues with little scrutiny and has become a covert route for dumping toxic industrial waste, experts say.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/07/toxic-sewage-sludge-british-farming-pfas-chemicals\">Continue reading...</a>",
