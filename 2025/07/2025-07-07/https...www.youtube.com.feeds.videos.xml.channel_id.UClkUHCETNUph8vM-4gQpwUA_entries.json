        "description": "Elden Ring Nightreign PARTY COMPOSITION - Does it EVEN Matter???\nIn this Elden Ring Nightreign video, we're going to talk a little bit about party composition and how it can affect your runs out there. I know in Elden Ring, Nightreign that you can beat any boss with any party composition. This is absolutely doable. So party competition isn't necessarily something that should make or break your run. But when you're playing in a group with people that you know, party composition becomes a lot less impactful. But when playing with randoms, it can absolutely have an impact on how your run is going to go. And that's what I want to look into in this video. We'll be talking about this mostly from the point of view that you are playing with randoms. We'll talk a little bit about parties as well. When you're playing with friends and things like that.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign Wiki: https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Nightreign+Wiki\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Nightreign Party Synergy",
