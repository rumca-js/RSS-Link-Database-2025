        "description": "Waymo has launched new \"road trips\" to Philadelphia and New York City, \"signaling the Alphabet-owned company's interest in expanding into Northeastern cities,\" reports TechCrunch. While these trips don't guarantee commercial launches, they follow a pattern that previously led to deployments in cities like Los Angeles. Other road trips this year are planned for Houston, Orlando, Las Vegas, San Diego, and San Antonio. From the report: Typically, the trips involve sending a small fleet of human-driven vehicles equipped with Waymo's autonomous driving system to map out the new city. Then Waymo tests the vehicles autonomously, though still with a human behind the wheel, before taking any data and learnings back to its engineers to improve the AI driver's performance. In some cases, these road trips have led to commercial launches. In 2023, the company made a road trip to Santa Monica, a city in Los Angeles County. The company now operates a commercial service in Los Angeles, including Sant",

        "description": "Jack Dorsey has launched Bitchat, a decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging app that uses Bluetooth mesh networks for encrypted, ephemeral chats without requiring accounts, servers, or internet access. The beta version is live on TestFlight, with a full white paper available on GitHub. CNBC reports: In a post on X Sunday, Dorsey called it a personal experiment in \"bluetooth mesh networks, relays and store and forward models, message encryption models, and a few other things.\"\n \nBitchat enables ephemeral, encrypted communication between nearby devices. As users move through physical space, their phones form local Bluetooth clusters and pass messages from device to device, allowing them to reach peers beyond standard range -- even without Wi-Fi or cell service. Certain \"bridge\" devices connect overlapping clusters, expanding the mesh across greater distances. Messages are stored only on device, disappear by default and never touch centralized infrastructure -- echoing Dorsey's long-runnin",

        "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: Epic Games, buoyed by the massive success of Fortnite, has spent the last few years throwing elbows in the mobile industry to get its app store on more phones. It scored an antitrust win against Google in late 2023, and the following year it went after Samsung for deploying \"Auto Blocker\" on its Android phones, which would make it harder for users to install the Epic Games Store. Now, the parties have settled the case just days before Samsung will unveil its latest phones.\n \nThe Epic Store drama began several years ago when the company defied Google and Apple rules about accepting outside payments in the mega-popular Fortnite. Both stores pulled the app, and Epic sued. Apple emerged victorious, with Fortnite only returning to the iPhone recently. Google, however, lost the case after Epic showed it worked behind the scenes to stymie the development of app stores like Epic's. Google is still working to avoid penalties in that long-r",

Reuters: The EU's climate targets are among the world's most ambitious, but they have been based entirely on domestic emissions cuts. Now the bloc faces a mid-September deadline to submit a new 2035 climate target to the United Nations. \n\nBrussels has refused Beijing's repeated requests for a mutual climate commitment after the summit of the world's second- and third-largest economies, unless China promises to do more to cut greenhouse gas emissions, EU officials said. \"There is only merit in having a declaration from our perspective if there are also content nuts to be cracked and ambition to be displayed,\" Climate Commissioner Wopke Hoekstra told the paper.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitt",

From a report: Welcome to the low-hire, low-fire labor market. Private-sector layoffs are at historic lows, but that masks a dreadful outlook for unemployed workers or those unhappy with their current positions. \n\n[...] \"We're in a complex jobs market -- it's not falling apart but the lack of dynamism, the lack of churn and the lack of hiring has been punctuated in the first half of the year,\" says ADP chief economist Nela Richardson. \"Many employers are loath to lay off workers until they see the whites of the eyes of a recession, having had such problems finding suitable workers in the first place,\" David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P.

From a report: The shift comes as Prime Minister Donald Tusk's government accelerates efforts to diversify energy production in Poland, which despite recent progress remains a major producer of coal and the most coal-dependent country in the EU, with about 60 per cent of its electricity coming from the fossil fuel in 2024. \n\nLast month renewable energy sources accounted for 44.1 per cent of Poland's electricity mix, narrowly surpassing coal, which fell to 43.7 per cent, according to a study to be published next Monday by Forum Energii, a Warsaw-based energy think-tank, using data from Poland's grid operator.

Yet the structure of this new industry looks troublingly familiar, echoing a pattern of dependence that has long marked India's economy. \n\nNowhere is this dependence clearer than in the heft of intellectual property. The portfolios of India's largest battery-makers, Amara Raja and Exide, contain just seven patents combined. This pales in comparison to the industry's giants: China's CATL sits on a hoard of over 43,000 patents, while South Korea's LG Energy Solution possesses some 70,000. \n\nHaving largely missed the global lithium-ion boom, India's established lead-acid manufacturers built a business model on licensing technology rather than inventing it. This long-standing habit is now reflected in deals that create deep technological dependency. A 2022 agreement between Exide and China's SVOLT, for example, cal",
