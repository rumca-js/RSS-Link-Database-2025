I have a schizophrenic neighbor who recently moved out. He has access to my phone and my laptop. Not sure how he told me he went on the dark web and hacked my Wi-Fi, but I think he could be lying because I don\u2019t think he would tell me the truth. He sees my photos and everything I do on my phone. He tells me oh I know you were doing this today after I take photos of myself doing something I don\u2019t text or tell anyone, but he knows because of the photos. I\u2019ve never clicked on an email or link or put my password in anything. I\u2019ve changed my iCloud password and my Wi-Fi password, but he still in the phone. He uses the dark web and he is very invasive. He went to jail for breaking into his ex-girlfriend\u2019s house, please tell me what I can do to get him out of my laptop in my phone permanently.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",
