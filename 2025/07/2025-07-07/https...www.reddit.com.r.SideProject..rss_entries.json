(Today relaunched on Product Hunt, upvote me :D)</p> <p>All organic, zero ads, no videos with my face.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I learned in the first month:</p> <p><strong>1. Launching without an audience is tough.</strong><br/> I accidentally launched on Product Hunt with no audience and got zero users.</p> <p><strong>2. Consistency on X-Threads works.</strong><br/> I started posting and replying daily on X and in threads. About 5-10 replies a day and 3-5 posts. Engaging with others really helped get my project noticed.</p> <p><strong>3. SEO Pages that cursor builds are 100% essential.</strong><br/> I made 500+ SEO pages, which helped LLM models and search engines recommend my app. In 2 days after publishing these pages, my app got 80 clicks. (yes it\u2019s mind blowing)</p> <p><strong>4. Launch before your app has all the features you want.</strong><b",
