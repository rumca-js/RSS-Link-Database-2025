I rented it, but it seems that there&#39;s some protection as I&#39;m unable to use OBS to record it (black screen). My only thought now is to use a VM and screenrecord from behind that. Does anyone have any thoughts, or a method that they&#39;ve used to rip from them before? I&#39;ve ripped tons from VHS, DVDs, Blu-rays - but I have very little experience with web-ripping beyond a simple screen record or using yt-dlp.</p> <p>And yes, I&#39;ve checked trackers (even several private), it is only available in SD.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheQuranicMumin\"> /u/TheQuranicMumin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ltxgbp/ripping_content_from_sky/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1ltxgbp/ripping_content_from_sky/\">[comments]</a",

It is, however, possible that you&#39;ll face a criminal charge if you pirate movies produced by Nepal based companies but none bothers on pirating Nepali movies. </p> <p>I guess this is the same for other countries from global south.</p> <p>The take is, I will be moving to US on September for my graduate studies. Now I&#39;ve found websites such as myflixer, fmovies, oniontv and others, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll buy subscription of any of the streaming platforms, as yk, they don&#39;t have the movies you want to watch.

I&#39;ve been running Windows 10 unactivated since 2018, but bought a cheap key for it to use after I put the new machine together with fresh OS installed. I don&#39;t want to put the key in now since Windows would consider it a new computer, due to the new mobo, and don&#39;t want to bother with the hassle of contacting Microsoft.<br/> The technically-forced upgrade to Windows 11 while it&#39;s still free will be available after doing all that.</p> <p>Since you require an active Windows to be able to download the installation files officially, I went to other sources, finding a list of activated Windows 10 downloads. I was wondering what sort of keyword I should look for to find something I can put on a bootable USB to activate afterwards?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",
