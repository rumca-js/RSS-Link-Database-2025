        "description": "Patients who undergo tummy tuck surgery may be in for more than just cosmetic changes \u2014 a new study shows they often keep losing weight for years after the procedure. Researchers followed 188 patients and found consistent weight reduction up to five years later, especially in those with higher initial BMIs. Interestingly, lifestyle improvements, such as better diet and exercise habits, may play a key role in this surprising long-term effect. This could mean tummy tucks aren't just sculpting bodies \u2014 they may be reshaping lives.",

Surprisingly, participants needed high financial incentives to push through challenging memory tasks, hinting that motivation can override mental fatigue.
