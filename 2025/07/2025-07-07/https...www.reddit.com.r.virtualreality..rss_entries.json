But having it for around 2 weeks now the performance difference Ive gotten hasnt been that great in vr, in some flat screen games the performance increase has been about 30% so im happy with that but in games like blade and sorcery I still get the same lag spikes with multiple npcs as I did with the 3700x. Im considering returning the 5700x3d and just getting a refurbished 5900x so Im just trying to figure out if its worth it, also not sure if my gpu is the reason im getting these lag spikes.</p> <p>My specs are</p> <p>rx 6700 xt<br/> ryzen 7 5700x3d</p> <p>32 gb 3200 mhz corsair vengeance<br/> b450ma-ii motherboard</p> <p>550 watt corsair psu</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any replies</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Commercial_East3578\"> /u/Comme",
