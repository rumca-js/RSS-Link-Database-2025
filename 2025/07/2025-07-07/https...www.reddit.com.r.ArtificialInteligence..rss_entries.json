However, this is too early for our civilization, which has not yet achieved interstellar travel. Because once AGI is discovered, ASI, or artificial superintelligence, will be discovered much more quickly. And in a worst-case scenario, artificial intelligence could take over the entire world. This time, it will want to spread into space. This may have already happened to thousands of other alien civilizations before us. Think about it. To prevent this from happening, they would either need to discover interstellar travel much earlier than ASI, or somehow manage to control ASI. I don\u2019t think this is very likely. In my opinion, if our civilization were to come into contact with an alien life form, it would be more likely for that life form to be an artificial intelligence machine.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SanalAmeri",

We develop tools to measure convexity in sampled data and evaluate it across layers of state-of-the-art deep networks. We show that convexity is robust to relevant latent space transformations and, hence, meaningful as a quality of machine-learned latent spaces.

So the course would be covered by the family business. I&#39;ve seen other reddit posts about how AI certifications aren&#39;t worth it and better off learning independently. In my case, I would learn better being in a educational environment, even though it&#39;s online as I&#39;m too depressed and lazy to learn independently as I struggle with having passion for anything.</p> <p>The course itself is from Lumify Learn. From what I&#39;ve experienced so far and read online, it seems trusted and legit. Takes from 6 to 12 months to complete and the three certifications are Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals, and ",

According to an ABC report, Australian entry-level roles are already being impacted by automation. Young workers are entering a market where AI tools are outperforming them in routine tasks \u2014 and employers are rethinking what jobs even need humans anymore.</p> <p>At the same time, Amazon\u2019s rollout of new autonomous robots in the UK signals a bold shift in global warehousing. The company now has nearly one million machines \u2014 and for the first time, these may soon outnumber human staff. While Amazon claims automation reduces physical strain and boosts productivity, it&#39;s also clear: fewer people are being hired back.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just a tech upgrade \u2014 it&#39;s a workforce disruption. Since 2022, Amazon has laid off over 27,000 staff. Yes, they\u2019ve trained 700,000 workers since 2019, but many of those roles have been eliminated or replaced with machines.
