As our appeal will show, the EC is\nmandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which\nare confusing for developers and bad for users. We implemented\nthis to avoid punitive daily fines and will share the facts with\nthe Court.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Everyone\u2009\u2014\u2009including, I believe, at Apple\u2009\u2014\u2009agrees that <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/apple_app_store_policy_updates_dma\">the policy changes Apple announced at the end of June</a> are confusing and seemingly incomplete in terms of fee structures. What Apple is saying here in this statement is they needed to launch these policy changes now, before the full fee implications are worked out, to avoid the daily fines they were set to be penalized with for the steer",
