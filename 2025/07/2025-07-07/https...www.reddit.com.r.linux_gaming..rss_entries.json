Of course it works with Wine, but just download the Linux version, install 32-bit SDL support, start the game, go to &quot;register&quot;, input the registration key from the page and the name joe bloggs ... I have no affiliation with the game maker, so I can&#39;t help with anything. I downloaded the SDL support with ChatGPT, so I&#39;m a total newbie, but it works beautifully.

The disk itself only had 44 gb of data on it that could be located with tools like k4dirstat. After much digging, I finally have located what I believe is the culprit, which is /home/user/.cache/doc being absolutely full of steam files. My OS drive is 250 GiB, but /home/user/.cache/doc is showing as using 644.2 GiB. I do have a separate drive for my steam library, mounted at /games, which is showing the expected amount of storage utilization, which roughly matches the 644.2 figure. Uninstalling a game decreased both /games and /home/user/.cache/doc by roughly the same amount. </p> <p>I&#39;ve tried clearing the download cache in steam, but that didn&#39;t do anything. Restarting changed nothing, and I&#39;ve verified the mountpoint for the games drive is correct. I&#39;m currently using the .deb version of steam, when I first noticed this issue I was using the snap version. ",

What are the odds? I have a 77-bit processor, 19 GB outline memory, and a 66 GB hard driving capacity, GOG up the wazoo, and WINE running great as my emulator. so I know it\u2019s <em>possible</em>. But I\u2019m not naive enough to believe that just because something is <em>possible</em> doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s <em>likely</em>. So someone please tell me, what are my odds of driving to Kubuntu? The only thing that\u2019s delaying the deployment of my computer is the driver. So all i would have to do is driving to Kubuntu, charge the configuration, and access the kernal. Last time I tried this, my kernel got hacked right away so I gave up and switched over to Befany. But I want my Kubuntu!! Should I hit the road or should i lose all hope? Thanks and ANY feedback is appreciated!! Thanks again!!!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a",
