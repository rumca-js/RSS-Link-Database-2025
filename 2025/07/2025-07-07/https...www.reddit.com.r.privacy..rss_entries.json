The bill would essentially require &quot;social media&quot; websites to estimate user&#39;s age based on existing data and prevent under 13s from making accounts (and not use algorithms on any under 17s). As you can imagine, this is a violation of our privacy and the tech is wildly inaccurate. Additionally the bill defines social media as being &quot;directed to consumers,&quot; &quot;primarily deriving income from ads...&quot; and it &quot;provides a community forum for user generated content.&quot; Which basically means most websites.</p> <p>I normally wouldn&#39;t be worried since it passed out of committee in February but it recently started picking up co-sponsors again and is now officially on the senate calendar.
