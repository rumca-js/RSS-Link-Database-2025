I have already been disconnected and disinterested from the man so I\u2019ve been largely unaffected by his outburst. That said, my wife chose to cut ties from him because of how he reacted to finding out I was trans. His girlfriend of 2+ years is extremely supportive and essentially said that she refuses to cut ties with us because he\u2019s being a baby about everything. The rest of his family ie. His mom, two brothers, and all of the rest of the family is more or less just uncomfortable with how he reacted and how he got weird and vulgar on the fascination of my sex life. Until further notice of him (unlikely) apologizing and making amends, my wife gave him the ultimatum of either fixing things or going no contact.

I feel like im not allowed or &#39;worthy&#39; enough to interact with any kind of MLM content. maybe its internalized transphobia but I cannot see myself as anything but a disgusting girl obsessed with fetishizing gay men since I dont physically have what the content is showing. Im telling myself Im not a &#39;real enough man&#39; to be allowed to see myself in any of this content. Im making myself feel othered but I have no other perspectives to show me otherwise. and on the other hand, interacting with WLW stuff makes me feel like a creepy guy... Im in a purgatory of my own doing where Im only allowed to be apart of trans content. Not who I actually am or want to be, only trapped with the curse of what I was born with.

My mother is the one that hurts the most, she claims to still love me but her words were cold and judgmental as she said it will be hard for us to have a relationship. I spilled my guts on how hurt I\u2019ve felt and terrified I\u2019ll lose them. She didn\u2019t comfort me, didn\u2019t apologize and said she\u2019d pray for me.
