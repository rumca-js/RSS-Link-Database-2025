There a lot of books with this trope and it&#39;s so crazy that people actually accept this. &quot;Haunting Adeline&quot; is one of the books that have this trope and it&#39;s also a very popular book. Raping someone does not mean you love them and it does not just become an okay thing because you&#39;re obsessed. Same thing with &quot;The Ritual&quot; and &quot;Sick Fux&quot;.

He&#39;s not afraid to make his audience uncomfortable, either.
