I&#39;m more into fantasy, but she is enjoying mystery/thrillers and ESPECIALLY dystopian! What would y&#39;all recommend? </p> <p>I&#39;ve loaned her my Hunger Games books (she loved) and also Divergent (tbd). She read and enjoyed Harry Potter, but it wasn&#39;t her preferred. </p> <p>No/very little spice preferred as she&#39;s still pretty young.
