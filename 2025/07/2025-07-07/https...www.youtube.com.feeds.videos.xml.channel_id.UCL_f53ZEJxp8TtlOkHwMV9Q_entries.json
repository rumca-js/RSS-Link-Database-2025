        "description": "Sparked by French\u2019s recent New York Times article, \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 $20 Million Man Problem,\u201d he and Jordan Peterson discuss the societal failures contributing to male alienation\u2014fatherlessness, loss of purpose, overmedication, and a culture that increasingly pathologizes masculinity. French shares personal insights as a father, veteran, and conservative commentator (Who is regularly published in Liberal outlets), and the two expand on themes of demoralization, the need for intentional rites of passage, and the psychological appeal of figures like Andrew Tate. The conversation closes with a stark agreement\u2014we urgently need to reach young men with empathy, structure, and a meaningful vision for life.\n\nThis episode was filmed on July 2nd, 2025\n\nUnlock the ad-free experience of The Jordan B.
