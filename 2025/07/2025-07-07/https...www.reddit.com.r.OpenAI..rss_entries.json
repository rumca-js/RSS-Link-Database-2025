In terms of the voice, I prefer Gemini because it sounds more natural and casual, meanwhile Copilot sounds too optimistic at times. I tried out Gemini live video when I needed help with my car and was impressed. I like how it displays the chat in text. I mainly use Copilot to summarize pages, videos, and pdfs on Edge. It does a great job of keeping it short. One con is that it avoids political question.</p> <p>Btw I have a free one year membership of Gemini. so maybe there&#39;s a difference between the free version? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EveningStarRoze\"> /u/EveningStarRoze </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lu9lmg/copilot_live_vs_gemini_live/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lu9lmg/copilot_live_vs_gemini_live/\">[comments",
