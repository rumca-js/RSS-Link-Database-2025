And if so, is there anyone here who could point us in the right direction or possibly assist us with that? We&#39;re both new to this kind of research and don&#39;t have any technical experience in building such tools.</p> <p>If you have any tips, resources, or advice that could help us with our project, we\u2019d really appreciate it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",

This prevents Playwright from<br/> running JavaScript that writes to the main world/context of the page.</p> <p>While this is helpful with preventing detection of the Playwright page agent, it causes some issues with native Playwright functions like setting file inputs, executing JavaScript, adding page init scripts, etc. These features might need to be implemented separately.</p> <p>A current workaround for this might be to create a small dummy addon to inject into the browser.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So I created this workaround -</strong> <a href=\"https://githu",
