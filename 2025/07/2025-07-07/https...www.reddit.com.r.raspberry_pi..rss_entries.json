Recently, I learned about the PCA9685 PWM driver board, and I would like to know if it would be easier/more efficient to use that to control our hardware instead of another microcontroller. My main concern is that since we&#39;ll also be streaming live video feed from the sub so we can actaully properly control it, is that the load would be too big on the cpu of the pi and it would crash or be delayed or something like that.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I live in Japan and there&#39;s tons of used shops here that sells &quot;junks&quot; and I was lucky to find a raw display panel from Samsung(LTN154AT08) still intact with the wires and inverter board just for 300 yen lol. I did enough research and all I need is a universal controller board and connect it to my Pi with HDMI.</p> <p>My concern is the 15&quot; display overkill for a RasPi (I have 2B and a 4B 8GB)? I was planning to use my 2B first, since my 4B is currently being used for another project (and is headless).</p> <p>I was thinking of turning it into a cyber deck hence I was looking for displays, but 15&quot; seems too big now and I couldnt let go of this chance.</p> <p>Project Idea 1) Static Dashboard - 4B processes data output(PiHole, VPN Server, HA stats) and 2b renders/ deploy dashboard to display. STM32 will be for my aquarium ph water tester. (fun home project that is useful after)</p> <p>Project Idea 2) Raspi Laptop - Be a madman. 4B ",
