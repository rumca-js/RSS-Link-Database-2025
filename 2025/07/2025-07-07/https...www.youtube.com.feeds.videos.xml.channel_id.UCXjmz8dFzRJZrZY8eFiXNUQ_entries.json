        "description": "With Season 17 just around the corner, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia has officially become the longest-running live-action sitcom in television history. But few shows have ever had a more humble beginning. Shot for less than $200, the original pilot stands as one of the cheapest \u2014 and most unlikely \u2014 in TV history.\n\nFrom its DIY origins to its rise as a cult phenomenon, It\u2019s Always Sunny has redefined what a sitcom can be. Irreverent, fearless, and endlessly creative, it\u2019s a show that not only broke the rules but rewrote them \u2014 and it\u2019s still going strong nearly two decades later.\n\n#itsalwayssunnyinphiladelphia #sitcom #dannydevito #wrexham",
