I made another post about powering it using PSUs Molex port, this post is a bit different. So i will be LCing my whole PC in the (hopefully not so far) future, i mean RAM, M.2 drives, CPU, GPU and VRM, i want to integrste RPi5 into this loop. I found <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/s/c9sPzQ0xnp\">this</a> post in which someone LCs it with hard tubing, but it is standalone loop.
