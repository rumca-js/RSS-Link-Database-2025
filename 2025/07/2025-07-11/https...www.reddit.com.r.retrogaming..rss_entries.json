Context: I want to hookup a Wii (and maybe other stuff) to a CRT monitor. For what I&#39;ve gathered, there are some routes: 1. High end transcoders (beharbros/wakabavideos, ~60 USD + shipping. Highly recommended and would probably give the best results); 2. Aliexpress transcoders (~25 USD + shipping. Little to no information, mixed reviews); 3. Wii to HDMI + HDMI to VGA converters (Not recommended, many digital to analog conversions, could provide good results with more expensive gear, but doesn&#39;t seem to make sense compared to other solutions).</p> <p>To get a good result, 1 or 2 are the best option, but I&#39;ve been wondering about GBS, and how it would fare to others. Also, if in the future I get to mod it correctly, I can use it to try 240/480i scaled consoles in a CRT monitor as well, which seems like a cool thing.</p> <p",

Many months later, I finally took the time last night to mix them together. I did not doing anything else to Kirby&#39;s music other than slowing it down to How Sweet&#39;s speed.

I wanted to play this game blind but got tempted and checked if it was important to get new Personas or if you could just beat the game with the starter Personas. I ended up chasing after &quot;good&quot; Personas so I didn&#39;t have much progress from a storyline standpoint. Also worth noting is that I&#39;m playing via emulation, and save states are a major help with negotiations and not having enough save points.

Two games in this vein are &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; and the &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot; franchise, great adventures that don&#39;t take themselves too seriously! </p> <p>Thanks so much for your recommendations, I really appreciate it! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/N7-Spectre-Vanguard\"> /u/N7-Spectre-Vanguard </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1lwxs2m/recommendation_request_looking_for_classic_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1lwxs2m/recommendation_request_looking_for_classic_games/\">[comments]</a></span>",
