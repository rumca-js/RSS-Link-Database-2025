It looks inside each email for suspicious links, weird IP addresses, dangerous attachments like <code>.exe</code> files, and even counts how many grammar or spelling mistakes are in the message. It pulls out some key headers too that can sometimes give away spoofing or bad evil stuff.</p> <p>What makes it different is that, it doesn&#39;t just dump data it actually gives every email a risk score out of 10. The score is based on a mix of things like how many links it finds, whether the email has attachments, how bad the grammar is, and other small checks. I wrote some basic logic that kinda mimics how a human would judge emails. Like if there&#39;s too many links or sketchy files, it just adds points to the risk score. The",

But, I love to program and want to learn to truly grasp malware and I know these are both low level languages hence the abundance of malware written with them. My question is which to learn first logically? What type of malware is each language optimized for? If these questions even make sense lol. Any info would help a lot. Also, where is the best place to learn it? Codecademy seems cool but the pricing is wild imo. I have knowledge in python and java. But not much beyond that.

From what I have heard, Credential stuffing is an upcoming threat and companies are becoming more aware of it, so I thought I would implement some kind of method to test it in my clients. Obvioulsy I could automate testing leaked credentials with burpsuite or caido, or maybe even a python script, but my question is... Where do I find the credentials?? I have seen some options, like Leakcheck.io, but the price point is kind of steep if i want to search for all the credentials on a domain (179$/3 months), or intelx.io, which is ludicrously expensive (2500+/year).</p> <p>I would love to test for this bug, maybe also in bug bounties, but it is not easy, with these kinda of prices.</p> <p>Does anyone use/know about any other solution with better prices and a decent database size?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",
