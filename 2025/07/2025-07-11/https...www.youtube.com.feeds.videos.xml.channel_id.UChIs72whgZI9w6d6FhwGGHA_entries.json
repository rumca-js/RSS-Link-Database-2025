We're reporting on Intel's current position with new information from its Arc GPU partners, plus providing our own commentary and opinions about how Intel's position in the GPU market is more important than it may seem. Intel isn't vying for first -- it's vying for second, and that means someone to keep AMD in check rather than allowing AMD to comfortably sit with status quo. Maybe with the two of them fighting each other, there could be a real chance at better low-end and mid-range GPUs. This is just us talking about it all.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
