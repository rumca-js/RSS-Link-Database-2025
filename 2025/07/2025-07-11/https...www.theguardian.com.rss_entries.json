They\u2019re surprisingly easy to make from scratch, too. The base is an incredibly light genoise sponge that\u2019s topped with a layer of jelly, and it\u2019s this section that allows for some creativity. I chose to go down a summery route with passion fruit.

After spending three years trying to make Test cricket exciting, with quite a lot of success, England have suddenly given up and gone back to the 1950s.</p><p>Yesterday was the 56th time they had scored 200 in an innings under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, and by far the slowest. They pottered along at 3.02 runs an over. (Even at Ranchi early last year, when Ben Foakes was still on board, England managed 3.36.) And the slowest scorer of all was the captain, who faced 102 balls and hit only three of them for four. Even if he is fit for the next Test, Stokes may have to drop himself for slow scoring.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/jul/11/england-v-india-third-mens-cricket-test-day-two-live\">Continue readi",

Today\u2019s glorious noodle salad is perfect for summer, not least because it\u2019s a simple assembly job, while the second recipe, if you make a little effort to devein some shell-on prawns, rewards you with the most magnificent plate of them that you\u2019ll ever eat.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/11/malaysian-home-style-prawns-recipes-noodle-salad-fried-shrimp-mandy-yin\">Continue reading...</a>",

For thousands of years, the wingless herbivore patrolled New Zealand, feasting on trees and shrubs, until the arrival of humans. Today, records of the enormous animal survive only in M\u0101ori oral histories, as well as thousands of discoveries of bone, mummified flesh and the odd feather.</p><p>But this week, the US start-up Colossal Biosciences has announced that the giant moa has joined the woolly mammoth, dodo and thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, on its list of animals that it is trying to bring back from the dead. The announcement has provoked public excitement \u2013 and deep scepticism from many experts about whether it is possible to resurrect the bird, which disappeared a century after the arrival of early Polynesian settler",
