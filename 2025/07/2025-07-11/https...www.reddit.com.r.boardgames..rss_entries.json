And if I remember correctly, one of the players roles was a character who was the only one who could buy and sell (or something along those lines.) I remember each person&#39;s playing peices were contained in rectangular boxes like the ones you find in Dice Throne.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I&#39;ve on a quest to find a board game that can emulate an RPG-ish experience. Basically, if I&#39;ve got a group together that I might normally want to play a TTRPG with but we don&#39;t have the time to set that up, I can whip out a board game that gives you the fun of making a character, exploring a dungeon, finding loot, and finishing with an explosive boss fight all in like 2 hours.</p> <p>The game I keep coming back to over and over is Descent 2e, but the problem is that I just don&#39;t want to play an app run game. I much prefer to experience of having everything in hand and running it myself even if it&#39;s slightly more cumbersome. I know there&#39;s Descent 1e, but that&#39;s difficult to get and is a bit out of date.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been searching for this heartbreaker game for months on and off, hoping someone here can help me make some headway.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/H",

Do I replenish the stacks once they are over (basically turning them infinite)? Or is there another option to this situation? I was playing in 3p and we just hadn&#39;t anything else we could do because there weren&#39;t any parts or blueprints to assemble the bots, so we just ended the game. I searched for an answer in the manual but I couldn\u2019t find anything related to it.
