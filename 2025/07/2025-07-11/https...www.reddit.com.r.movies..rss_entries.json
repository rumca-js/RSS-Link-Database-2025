Not just comedy/light hearted movies either. When watching the Revenant I was like &#39;you don&#39;t get up at 5am in freezing tempratures for months just for the hell of it.

So many cool ideas for a film in this genre like the viewing room where we see a man get cooked alive by the sun. The space craft they&#39;re in has one of the coolest designs I&#39;ve ever seen in a space/scifi film. Personally, I fully believe that the film stuck the landing as well. However the shaky cam at the end is nauseating. But other than that I really don&#39;t have very many other complaints this shit rocks. </p> <p>If you haven&#39;t seen Sunshine and you&#39;re a fan of scifi I highly highly recommend it. This is one of the greatest films to get high to as well if you partake. I was in awe during multiple scenes on my first watch after smoking a bowl. Don&#39;t go in expecting a super realistic and grounded space film. Just go in expecting a fun ass movie and you won&#39;t be dissapointed. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",
