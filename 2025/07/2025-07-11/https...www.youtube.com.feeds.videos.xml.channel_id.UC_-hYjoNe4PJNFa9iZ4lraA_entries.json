Use code GOODWORK at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: https://incogni.com/goodwork\n\nHey, this is Liam - Good Work\u2019s summer intern. It\u2019s been the dream of a lifetime to work here over the last month or so, and everything I\u2019ve done so far has been productive, eye-opening, and under the unexpectedly watchful eye of my boss Dan. In fact, he\u2019s staring at me while brandishing a machete as I type this right now. What a team! \n\nBut not every intern has as clear a goal as I do this summer \u2013 many are wondering what they\u2019re even for! So in today\u2019s investigation, my handsome and well-read boss Dan Toomey seeks to uncover why we keep children like me around for two whole months, where we party and if he\u2019s still got it at beer pong. \n\nEnjoy and do not worry because I\u2019m completely safe and well-fed! Thanks Dan! \n\nFeaturing interviews with\u2026\n\nLydia Moynihan, Reporter at the New York Post  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/moynihanlydia/?hl=en\n\nKory Kan",
