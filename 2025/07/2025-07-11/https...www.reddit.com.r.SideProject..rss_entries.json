It&#39;s designed to analyze any website for common security vulnerabilities (like missing headers, SSL issues, dangerous HTTP methods, open ports) and even checks against malware/phishing blacklists. Because apparently, my personal brand of internet paranoia needed a dedicated, quickly-built tool.</p> <p>Is it a polished masterpiece of cybersecurity engineering? Hah, no.<br/> Did it cause me to question my life choices multiple times? Absolutely.<br/> Does it actually scan URLs and give you results? Well, much to my surprise, yes!</p> <p>I&#39;m exhausted, but also pretty chuffed with how much got done. It&#39;s definitely MVP (Minimal Viable Paranoia-tool), but I&#39;m looking forward to adding more.</p> <p>So, if you&#39;re ever wondering if that sketchy link your aunt shared is safe, or if you just want to judge someone else&#39;s web",

Except i have 2 projects going on, this project was to take my stress away from my main project and ended up turning into something bigger than i expected. I have less than 2 months to integrate them in, no big deal but the main project is almost completed, mobile testing hopefully this weekend and im going to be pushing heavily for acquisition in the cyber market. Any advice, you spend so much time dreaming and building and now things become reality</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Automatic_Deal_9259\"> /u/Automatic_Deal_9259 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1lwtobu/overwhelmed_with_excitement/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1lwtobu/overwhelmed_with_excitement/\">[comments]</a></span>",
