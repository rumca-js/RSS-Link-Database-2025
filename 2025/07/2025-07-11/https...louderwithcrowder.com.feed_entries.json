Yes, I know he will always vote with the Democrats. Sometimes, you just need to sit back and enjoy content for what it is. It's politics on the Internet. It's not that deep. And don't tell me you don't enjoy watching all the new ways Fetterman triggers the left when he chooses common sense over whatever Democrats believe this week.  This specific week, this means abolishing ICE, calling them Nazis, and lying about what they are doing, knowing they can count on most of the media to swear by it.</p><p>Fetterman dissents.</p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twit",

In the eyes of the Democrat Party, the only thing Jesus has ever done is argue for illegal immigration and welfare. Leftist douchelord John Fugelsang tried playing the Jesus card on CNN. Scott Jennings was too busy laughing at him to hit him with an Uno Draw 4.</p><p>Fugelsang first came up during the Bush years when George W.
