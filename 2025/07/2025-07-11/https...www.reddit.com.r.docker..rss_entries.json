All I&#39;d like to do is to enable containers created in the Debian VM to get assigned IP addresses from the router. Just a personal preference of mine so that I can manage IP addresses centrally through the router.</p> <p>I know I need to create a network in Docker using the macvlan driver. However, when I spin up a new container connected to the macvlan network I created, the container never gets an IP address from the router - just a new address on the subnet I specified when creating the macvlan network (which is of course the same as the subnet for the physical network to wh",
