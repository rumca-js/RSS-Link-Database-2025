        "description": "There has been a lot of talk about Velvet Sundown over the past couple of weeks. I was trying to avoid it, but then I realised that their 'music' could actually serve a purpose - if you want to cut off your feelings. It's poor, but I liked the pictures - even if they're not from the \"band's\" official account. Who cares anyway because it's evidence that we've entered The Age of Fookin S***e. \n\nTo come and me in \"Justin Hawkins Rides Again....Again\" LIVE across the UK, you can find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #musicreview #ai",
