LOL).</p> <p>For the past 2 years I&#39;ve been working on an open-source tool that initially came up as an internal necessity on our family company to manage Samba LDAP/Microsoft ADDS from a Web-GUI with stuff like end-user self-service for password changing -without having to use Windows computers that are joined to the Domain-, and slowly also kind of evolved to become an <em>OpenID Connect</em> compatible Identity Provider.</p> <p>The truth is that I&#39;m just now trying to actually spread the word a bit more than before, so if anyone is interested in any of the following features, feel free to try it out! If you find bugs, you can always report them in the corresponding git repositories, but I&#39;ve tested it quite a bit and use it frequently so it should be a relatively smooth experience *knocks on wood*.</p> <p>It has been quite a process",

I want to be able to see graphs on how the pulls, stars and image sizes increase over time. For example, I want to see how many new pulls I get right after publishing a new release, compared to a standard day. Docker Hub itself doesn&#39;t show graphs for these stats, so I wondered if there is a simple solution for this. You can probably set something up with Grafana, seeing that the stats are in a simple JSON response from the API. But maybe something even simpler? Is there not a simple lightweight software where you can set a list of repos and it&#39;ll fetch the stats every day and make graphs out of it all? And be able to select a range and get stats like the pull delta. And have markers in the graphs for events like newly published images. Because otherwise this sounds like a nice new little project to build during the summer vacation...</p>",

Currently I have been using Filen which works great, but I would rather have something I manage myself as using Hetzner storage boxes is almost exactly half the price. </p> <p>I have tried the following: </p> <p>- Seafile: Works fine, but the speeds are extremely slow</p> <p>- Nextcloud: Way too much for me needing only files, also desktop app required for encryption?</p> <p>- Owncloud: Better for only files. The desktop app is still not preferred, and an encryption plugin was needed (no built in support) and seemingly positive and negative reviews for the plugins.</p> <p>- Cryptpad: No easy way to set it in docker, always running into issues. I will be trying to run it from source next.</p> <p>- Filestash: <a href=\"https://github.com/mick",
