I really want to be able to suggest books (specifically novels) that will feel comforting and familiar to students who are from different cultures. Some of my favorites growing up were of course Harry Potter and Percy Jackson and I want to find series that make them feel the same way. I\u2019m just not sure if they felt so wonderful to me because they felt similar to my culture and concepts I grew up with or if they feel that way for everyone.</p> <p>So my question is: what books could I read and then recommend to my students from differing cultures?

I have ADHD as well so especially during these past few weeks where I&#39;ve been on summer break from school, getting through each day has felt brutal. Finding motivation to do the simplest things feels impossible. I keep finding myself wondering if there was anything that gave me true joy ever. I&#39;m wondering if there are any books that might help by giving me some suggestions for finding meaning in life again. I&#39;m open to all kinds of books, books on managing ADHD or depression, philosophical books or even fiction books that, more subtly, offer help (for example, I really liked reading My Year of Rest and Relaxation because I was able to resonate with the protagonist&#39;s desire to sleep everything away lol).
