        "description": "Scientists have created a groundbreaking gelatin-based robotic skin capable of sensing touch, heat, and physical damage like cuts or burns. Developed by a team including Dr. Thomas George Thuruthel from University College London, the skin uses a single conductive layer embedded with electrodes to detect and classify stimuli. It was tested through pokes, burns, and slices, generating over a million data points processed by a machine-learning model. This low-cost, stretchable material simplifies traditional multi-sensor designs, offering a practical solution for enhancing prosthetic limbs and humanoid robots with lifelike sensitivity and responsiveness in real-world environments.",

        "description": "Astronomers suggest that brown dwarfs\u2014dim, failed stars\u2014could transform into \u201cdark dwarfs\u201d by capturing dark matter in their cores. When dark matter particles annihilate, they release heat, potentially lighting up these stars. Physicist Jeremy Sakstein and researchers like Jillian Paulin and Rebecca Leane support this idea, which could help identify dark matter as heavy, self-annihilating particles. These objects may retain lithium-7, unlike typical brown dwarfs. Telescopes like NASA\u2019s James Webb may already be capable of spotting such bodies near the Milky Way\u2019s center, offering vital clues about the nature of dark matter.",
