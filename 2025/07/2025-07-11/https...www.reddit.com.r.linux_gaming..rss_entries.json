I followed the instructions <a href=\"https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler/wiki/FSR4-Compatibility-List\">here</a> except for one thing, which is installing mesa-git - I&#39;m on fedora so there isn&#39;t an easy way to install it, I could build it myself but I kinda don&#39;t wanna go through the trouble of that. But, the guide doesn&#39;t explicitly say what version of mesa is required, as mesa-git essentially just means latest from the gitlab. Fedora is on 25.1.4 which is still fairly modern, though mesa-git is on 25.2 from what I can tell. Is 25.2 absolutely necessary for FSR4?

With no FSR enabled at 1440p, FPS jumps between 80-100FPS. With FSR 3.1 Quality, it&#39;ll bounce between 100-144 FPS. The problem is manifesting as random stutter causing freesync flicker. The framerate caps in game don&#39;t seem to do anything either so I can&#39;t hard-lock it at 60 fps. Note that I am running the game off a spare SATA SSD (I am currently testing bazzite and didnt nuke my windows install on NVME drive). I have tried Proton 9.0-4, Proton experimental and 10.0-1 beta and none really have fixed the issue. The FF XVI Fix mod somewhat helped by disabling the graphics debugging. Not sure what else to do though, my system is plenty capable to run this game. I am nearing the point where I&#39;ll just play this on windows for now.</p> <p>My System:</p> <p>5700X3D</p> <p>9070 XT</p> <p>32 GBs</p> <p>500 GB SATA SSD </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",

I had no problem downloading the Linux version from steam and all that. The game works, but whenever I start a match the ram usage jumps from like 10.3% to average of 85%-90%. As a result the game either crashes or I get the \u201cyou were disconnected\u201d error. Just for reference, I have an average graphics card, intel i5 processor and 16gigs of memory. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fabulous_Leading_686\"> /u/Fabulous_Leading_686 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lx25bu/need_some_help_with_ram_consumption/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lx25bu/need_some_help_with_ram_consumption/\">[comments]</a></span>",

From the proton file browser being forced white mode, having to scale it properly so the text isn&#39;t tiny and the file browser really sucking to having to go through proton in the first place because a lot of tools don&#39;t have linux builds yet, I think that this is a space that needs to reach at least a little more parity with windows. I desperately want to move away from windows but unfortunately I really can&#39;t until there is more work in this department. I saw that valve added support for automatic recognition of dinput DLL files so there&#39;s no need to put a wine command in the launch options whenever you want to use a modded one, and this is a great first step but work still needs to continue.
