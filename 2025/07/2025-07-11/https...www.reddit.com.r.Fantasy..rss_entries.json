Her character is supposed to be all about how she survives powerful enemies with guile and intelligence, but most of the time she lives just by being very lucky. Sometimes it&#39;s because she stumbles on some very competent allies (which within itself would be fine), or because her enemies are cartoonishly overconfident, or because the Assassin&#39;s Guild in her universe is the worst one in history of fiction.

It made me remember how much I enjoyed those books, and also reminded me of the Airborn series by Kenneth Oppel, which was one of my favorite books when I was a teenager. Does anybody have recommendations for similar books, but aimed for a more adult audience? Leviathan is a far more steampunk world than Airborn, which is more of an alternate industrial revolution setting. But I would love recs that feel like either book!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tanzan57\"> /u/Tanzan57 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1lx8dx4/steampunk_book_recommendations/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1lx8dx4/steampunk_book_recommendations/\">[comments]</a></span>",

However, I&#39;ve read 140 pages and at first I loved the idea and I really adore the characters. Here comes the thing: I don&#39;t like plots about step by step plans. I don&#39;t know how to explain it but it kinda reminds me of six of crows with its theft story. I didn&#39;t like six of crows bc the second half only described how they got in there or escaped blabla. This kind of stories bores me. When I read that the plot of the story is going to be about shutting the town down by step by step plans... I was disappointed. I&#39;m afraid of not liking Mistborn bc I love great fantasy stories and everyone I know loves this series. Please tell me if I should continue reading. I mean this series have a lot of books and maybe only book 1 tells the story of the original plan. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",

But I&#39;d love to know what others think; especially the difference in views between those who were introduced to Narnia as children vs those who approached it for the first time as adults.</p> <p>Edit 2: Attempt to summarise the Narnia Code theory for those who are curious. Basically, the Narnia books are sometimes regarded as having sloppy/chaotic world building that lacks consistency. An academic called Michael Ward came up with this theory that the seven books correspond to the seven heavens (or seven planets) of medieval cosmology, and this symbolism is what ties the Narnia books together. I hope this makes sense.</p> <p>Edit: Forgot to mention that I first read Narnia when I was seve",
