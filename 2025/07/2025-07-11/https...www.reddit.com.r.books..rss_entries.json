I don&#39;t know what I am supposed to get, or feel, when reading this book. I understand that it centers the female experience, that Le Guin wanted to do a feminist exploration. To me this feels quite a lot &quot;to your face&quot;. Like quite explicitly stating the fact that they are women at multiple points. Similar with the primitive village witch. Are we supposed to like this character? Feel something other than some kind of disgust? In the last paragraph I read a male mage is attacking Tehanu verbally and the dialogue ends with her saying &quot;I have never understood men like you&quot;.

As the name suggests, the main character is a sort of modern day Don Quixote. From the get-go it was a challenge because it is a story within a story. The main character, Quichotte, is a character in a book being written by another character, Brother. The two stories evolve in parallel and we learn of Brother&#39;s background and family and also Quichotte&#39;s &#39;fictional&#39; family. Another key player is Salma, the Dulcinea del Toboso of the inner story. Quichotte&#39;s quest. All the character&#39;s backgrounds are similar and as they are presented interspersed it was hard for me to recall who was who as the stories went along. Quichotte&#39;s story ends as a science fiction that seems contrived. Still Ruchdie&#39;s prose and the day-to-day action kept me engaged and going along in anticipation of how it might all end but",

I just started reading &quot;Man, the State, and War&quot; by Kenneth Waltz on my Kobo e-reader, and I&#39;m struggling in how to approach it. The books I read for uni were physical copies, so I just used a pencil and some tabs to annotate them and it worked fine. However the only thing that&#39;s available to me with my KLC is different colors highlights so I&#39;m not sure how I should proceed. All of the guides I found online either only refer to fiction books or are not applicable to eBooks. Should I just give up and buy a physical copy for my understanding of the book to be as efficient as possible? The main issue would be that I don&#39;t live in an English-speaking ",

Pure unadulturated fun filled with cosmic adventure!</p> <p>This is a series that is definitely pulpy and full of fun.
