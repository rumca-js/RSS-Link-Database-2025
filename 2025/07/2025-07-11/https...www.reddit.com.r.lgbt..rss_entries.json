In the past My girlfriend identified as bi-sexual and had bisexual relationships with other girls. She says my friend is outright gay for dating a trans girl. We got into a huge argument because I called her out on her bullshit, She says when women sleep together it&#39;s different but when men sleep together it&#39;s gay. Did I flip out on my girlfriend for the wrong reason? Or am I justified for defending my friend against hateful comments.</p> <p>Update: She thinks men having sex is disgusting and women having sex is normal.

I\u2019ve seen a lot of (mostly younger) queer people get all up in arms when someone has an identity that is complex or that they don\u2019t understand, and will try and say what that person can or cannot identify as. But guess what? Queer people have used complex and \u201ccontradictory\u201d labels for FOREVER. There are lesbians who call themselves boys, boyfriends, boydykes, Ect., nonbinary people who call themselves women or men or such. No kne is in ANY position to police anyone else\u2019s identity because each identity is unique and has a unique experience tied to it. Someone has a label/identity you don\u2019t understand? Read up on some history and understand that not every identity is supposed to make sense.

It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s helped me avoid many conflicts as of far. </p> <p>I\u2019ve made a new friend, who is an avid Christian. I don\u2019t mind the Christian part, but he just told me that he was homophobic. Now, I haven\u2019t disclosed my sexuality yet, and he hasn\u2019t said many homophobic remarks, other than the typical high schooler \u201clet\u2019s use gay as an insult for every rando we don\u2019t like\u201d remarks. I\u2019ve been accustomed to this language over the years, but I\u2019m wondering if I should unfriend him, because he seems shamelessly homophobic to a friend he just met. </p> <p>I\u2019ve done quite a bit for him already: talked to him when he\u2019s unhappy, played games with him, tutored him in math.
