Recently I decided I want to get into cybersecurity and hacking, and from what I understand, networking is of most importance. Tryhackme was the first thing that popped up when I googled it, is it a sufficient source of information? Will I be able to study networking through there, or is it a training platformed aimed for people who already have a grasp on the subject?</p> <p>I should point out I don&#39;t know anything about networking, I only studied python so far. </p> <p>Any good sources for me to use?
