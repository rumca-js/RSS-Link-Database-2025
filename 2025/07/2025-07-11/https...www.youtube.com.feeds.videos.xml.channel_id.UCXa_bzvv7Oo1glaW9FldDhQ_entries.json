        "description": "Even for long-time fans of the franchise, it feels like Patapon 1 + 2 could have aspired to more. If you're truly keen on revisiting the classics, if only to witness the more unorthodox side of PlayStation, it may be worth checking out. \n\nBut those who want to recapture the magic from the old days of the PlayStation Portable may find it somewhat lacking, whether it's in terms of the gameplay and various annoyances or the amount of effort put into both remasters.",

        "description": "Destiny 2 is back, or rather, it never really went away. Bungie has been steadily delivering new content to mixed success, but on July 15th, The Edge of Fate, the latest expansion, drops, providing a new campaign, activities, and destination. Granted, it's nowhere near the scale of The Final Shape or even The Witch Queen in terms of content. However, you can still expect new Exotics, weapon frames, and a brand-new raid. Perhaps more intriguing is the significant overhaul of pretty much every aspect of the game (yes, another one). Armor will get set bonuses, tiers, and archetypes to diversify build-crafting while stats are completely overhauled.\n\nThe Portal offers a new way to access activities and select different difficulties, complete with modifiers to increase the challenge and rewards. That's not even getting into the new Artifact, Masterworking changes, Power changes, and - at long last - the shooting range. Join us as we examine all the biggest changes and new features.",
