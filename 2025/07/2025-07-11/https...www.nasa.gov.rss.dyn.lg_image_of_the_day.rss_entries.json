        "description": "Researchers from NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) recently tested a scale model of the X-59 experimental aircraft in a supersonic wind tunnel located in Chofu, Japan, to assess the noise audible underneath the aircraft. The test was an important milestone for NASA\u2019s one-of-a-kind X-59, which is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound without causing a loud sonic boom.",
