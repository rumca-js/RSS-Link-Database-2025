That includes the introduction of a brand-new Fairy occult type, new methods for living off the land instead of in a house, and--most relevant to this article--an entirely new way for your Sims to get sick, called Ailments.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Where the standard illnesses in The Sims 4 don't pop up that often and are easily cured with generic medicine, Ailments are a whole new category of affliction that require specific cures--or help from a magical being with the ability to fix Ailments. Fortunately, Ailments are more annoying than dangerous--they really aren't severe enough to kill a Sim on their own--but their effects can be so disruptive that it's usually better to deal with them sooner than later.</p><div data-embed-type=\"toc\"><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com\">hide</a>]</span><ul id=\"toc_list\" class=\"collapse i",

While most of the digital people who inhabit your Sim worlds will pass on to the afterlife, there are actually several different methods for extending their lifespans indefinitely. Most of those methods have been added with paid expansion packs you'll need to buy in order to try them, but there are some free, base game options as well. If you like a particular Sim, it's possible to have them live forever--you'll just have to put in some work. Let's take a look at what it takes to live forever.</p><div data-embed-type=\"toc\"><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com\">hide</a>]</span><ul id=\"toc_list\" class=\"collapse in\"><li><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com\">Copypasto and cloning</a></li></ul></div><h3 id=\"Copypasto_and_cloning\">Copypasto and cloning</h3><p dir=\"ltr\">Before we get into the specific ",
