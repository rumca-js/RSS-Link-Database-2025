Howells subsequently assembled a team of specialists and secured funding to excavate the site, but Newport City Council refused permission, citing the cost and environmental impact of the search. If the coins are discovered, Howells proposes distributing 30% of the proceedings among the council and the population of Newport.\nAs of February 2025, the missing Bitcoin was worth \u00a3597 million (US$751 million).
