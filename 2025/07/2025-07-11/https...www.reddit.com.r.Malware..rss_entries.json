But, I love to program and want to learn to truly grasp malware and I know these are both low level languages hence the abundance of malware written with them. My question is which to learn first logically? What type of malware is each language optimized for? If these questions even make sense lol. Any info would help a lot. Also, where is the best place to learn it? Codecademy seems cool but the pricing is wild imo. I have knowledge in python and java. But not much beyond that. Thanks again!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maleficent_Yak_5871\"> /u/Maleficent_Yak_5871 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1lxd5li/c_or_c_and_where_to_learn_trying_to_learn_malware/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malwar",
