It was even more enjoyable the second time, as once you know what&#39;s coming and have wrapped your head around the magical realism aspects, you can just lean into it and enjoy. </p> <p>On the second reading, I found myself spending more time examining the recipes and trying to imagine how to cook them. I&#39;m on the other side if the world, so some of the ingredients are unfamiliar, but certain recipes (e.g. the oxtail soup) are kind of universal. But others - like champondongo - are a mystery to me.</p> <p>Mostly I&#39;m curious about the cream fritters - are these a traditional/common Mexican dessert? What about the cake with 17 (?!) eggs in it? </p> <p>Has anyone tried the actual recipes from the book, and can anyone comment on how realistic /authentic they are to Mexican culture? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://",
