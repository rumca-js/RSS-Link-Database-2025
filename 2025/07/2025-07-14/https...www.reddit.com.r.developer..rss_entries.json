I&#39;m working as a software architect and was a developer previously. With me on the team is an experienced UX designer. We&#39;re already being supported by a regional timebank association with around 500 users and gained support by the local council. </p> <p>As a next step we want to release the first version as a mobile app (Flutter + NodeJS on firebase) to test it in my city. If everything goes well, we can roll out to the full timebank association and continue from there. </p> <p>if you&#39;re interested or want to know more, feel free to comment or DM me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Terr0rApe\"> /u/Terr0rApe </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1lzkyqm/looking_for_app_development_",
