In other words, which superhero movie should be the inspiration for future movies to learn from?</p> <p>All admit that I thought of this question after leaving the new Superman.

Leading up to that night as a teen, I&#39;ve never seen a movie better than this( and unbeknownst to me that Christopher Nolan would become one of my favorite movie directors). It was the first time it seemed the entire crowd clapped in unison when the credits started rolling. There are still very few movies that have rivaled or were better than the DKR in my opinions since seeing it. Some would be Godzilla-1, Bumblebee, The Dark Knight(even though I was 10 when the dark knight came out and I didn&#39;t see it in theaters), and I wanna say sinners. I&#39;ve seen countless movies since then and I&#39;m sure there could be some ones that I&#39;m forgetting but as far as a first-time, memorable movie experience, DKR was for sure the best time for me.</p> <p>I&#39;m interested in the responses from all the varying age groups. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
