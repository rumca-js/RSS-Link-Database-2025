My Gf (16F) and me (16M) are trying to figure something out because my parents now think she\u2019s a cover up. I know it sounds ridiculous but they\u2019re like that sometimes. I\u2019ve had relationships with boys in the past and I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll find out.

A decently large population of the school itself is queer, and the school openly &quot;supports&quot; pride. Judging by this exterior, it may seem like an institution where lgbtq+ individuals are welcome and not discriminated against.</p> <p>However, as a queer student, I have noticed a lot of thinly veiled homophobia in the community that is actively supported by the way the school works. For starters, a lot of the students are blatantly homophobic or use being gay as a punchline because they think it&#39;s funny and acceptable. While this is common at many schools, and I&#39;m personally not opposed to anyone&#39;s &quot;humor style&quot; no matter how unfunny it is, I feel like it is kind of disingenuous for the institution to claim to be accepting of lgbtq+ identities which are actively considered the &quot;joke&quot;",
