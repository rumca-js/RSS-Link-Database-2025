Well I think it could be tied to the death of Monoculture. \nMovies, music, shows, social media feels worse due to unlimited options.. as well as algorithm-driven content. The rapid advancement in available technology made it easier to consume. Which was great at first. But then it became extremely oversaturated. Being able to stream anything, anywhere, anytime all while being alone in your room means there is no anticipation, no excitement, nobody to share the experience with and therefore no real reason to watch. And although today\u2019s abundance of choice benefits individuals, it weakens collective cultural moments.\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Social Medias \u2714\ufe0f\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/patrickcctv\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@patrickcctv?lang=en\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/patrickcctv\n\n\ud83d\udfe2Watch My Videos on Spotify: https://op",
