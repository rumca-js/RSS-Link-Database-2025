I\u2019m doing room selection for 2025\u20132026 soon, and I\u2019m looking for a single room in any residence.</p> <p>Are there still any single rooms available in any buildings (Traditional or Suite-style)? If so, what\u2019s the bathroom situation like? I\u2019d prefer rooms where the bathroom is a private space with a door, not shared stalls.</p> <p>Any tips on where to look, or if you&#39;ve had luck finding a single room? Would really appreciate any info!</p> <p>Thanks so much!</p> </blockquote> <p>The AI fixed their capitalization, spelling, and grammar, increasing readability. It removed swearing, which might offend some of my school&#39;s more religious students. Yet it also turned thei",
