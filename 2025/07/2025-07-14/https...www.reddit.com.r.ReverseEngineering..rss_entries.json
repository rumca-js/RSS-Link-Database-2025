For many of us, it was the multiplayer of our childhood, and there\u2019s still a community waiting to come back.</p> <p>If you\u2019re into reverse engineering, game preservation, or just love AC, we\u2019d love to have you onboard.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AgitatedSense7153\"> /u/AgitatedSense7153 </a> ",
