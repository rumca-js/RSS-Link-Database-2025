I was using GrapheneOS and found a specific app (Mumbai&#39;s UTS) couldn&#39;t get a location lock. The fix was to enable &#39;Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning along with Network Scanning&#39; in the main location settings. It&#39;s a good reminder that sometimes a global OS setting is needed to make specific apps work, even when you&#39;ve given them the right permissions.</p> <p>This might also work for other apps as well I think</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ElderberryNo4615\"> /u/ElderberryNo4615 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1lzyqw4/an_interesting_location_services_fix_on_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1lzyqw4/an_interesting_location_services_fix_on_a/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It\u2019s pretty lightweight \u2014 the idea is to skip the heavy browser if all you want is to quickly look something up and watch it. it does it by parsing the youtube website which I wrote my own parser for written in GO and it uses mpv(a video player) and ytdlp as backend to watch the video as I wanted to keep the project straightforward simple and easier to maintain</p> <p>A big part of this is for folks who like to keep older laptops alive \u2014 I run this on an old ThinkPad with 4GB of RAM, where opening a full browser just for YouTube feels unnecessary. For people who enjoy TUIs, that tradeoff \u2014 speed, simplicity, less overhead \u2014 is worth more than a fancy UI.
