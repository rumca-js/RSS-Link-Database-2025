I did some research and found out that it isn&#39;t recommended to boot Steam games from an NTFS drive due to stability issues. I have a lot of games on my drive and it would be a huge pain to reinstall all of them, including some games I emulate. Is it worth biting the bullet and formatting the drive to something like Btrfs?
