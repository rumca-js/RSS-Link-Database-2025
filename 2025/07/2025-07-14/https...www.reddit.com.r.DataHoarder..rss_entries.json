        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, I am here because I have a 10 TB HGST drive and it was working fine last week but now randomly when I switched computers for my data server it decided it didn\u2019t want to turn on anymore. The symptoms are as follows; whenever I plug the drive power into it and the back of it gets extremely hot in one location, but the drive does not spin up. Do I maybe have a dead controller? Or do I need to diagnose further or am I just screwed? I have nearly filled the drive and only have a partial backup finished of it, and it would really be a pain to rebuild all those lost media libraries one by one by hand again. Some of that stuff is long gone and I just had archived luckily. So if anyone has any tips I would love to know </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/flameboi900\"> /u/flameboi900 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1lzsfd2/help_with_hgst_10tb_drive/\">[link]</a></s",
