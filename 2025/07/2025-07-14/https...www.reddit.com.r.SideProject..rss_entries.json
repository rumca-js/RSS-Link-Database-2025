The name means \u201cletter\u201d in Lithuanian, which fits because the product helps you find business email addresses quickly and at low cost. I have been bootstrapping it for a while, and recently I decided to prove it works by using cold email to get clients for my own services. I focused on going local, targeting businesses in Lithuania and nearby regions where cultural ties make the outreach feel more relevant.</p> <p>A bit of background: people have strong opinions about cold email. Some say it is dead, others insist it works if you do it right. After seeing discussions here about outreach strategies, I figured I would share my experience since it turned out well. In two weeks I sent roughly two thousand emails and closed two solid clients. Nothing huge yet, but the retainers cover my costs and give me profit. Here is what I did, step by step, in case it helps fellow hustlers.</p> <h1>Step 1",
