This packed should be skipped, but our calculations for that weren&#39;t quite right, and neither were the old ones, but they were wrong differently! So previously, it had actually just worked by accident.</p> <p>This affected a number of game modifications that many people like to play, such as a Crazy Taxi mod that adds back the proper music from the Dreamcast original, and also a number of modified football (soccer) games which lost their music and commentary.</p",
