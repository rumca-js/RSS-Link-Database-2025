In that case, I generally use a private mode window in Firefox (desktop). That used to work just fine. However, in the last few months, I&#39;ve noticed that not only will I get all sorts of video recommendations in my normal account page, and will even show me in-progress (unfinished) videos that were watched in a private window. I am familiar with browser fingerprinting, but I have those protections enabled in Firefox. Any ideas how YT is tracking so precisely, and what I can do to mitigate it? It&#39;s not so much a privacy thing- I just like to have my account page narrowly focused on a few creators a topics, and not cluttered with random curiosities I indulge from time to time.
