It\u2019s got a dataset of 50,000 real malware samples\u2014stealers, worms, keyloggers, ransomware, etc. Pair it with any Ollama-compatible model (I like deepseek-coder-v2:16b) to generate malware code from basic prompts, using ChromaDB for solid, varied outputs. It\u2019s great for testing defenses or digging into attack patterns in a sandbox. Runs locally for privacy, and the code and dataset are fully open-source. Give it a spin, contribute, and keep it legal and responsible!</p> <p>ps: most of the malware from my other project blackwall like the whatsapp chat extractor are optimized by rabids</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/sarwaaaar/RABIDS\">https://github.com/sarwaaaar/RABIDS</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impossible_Process99\"> /u/Impossible_Process99 </a> <",
