Several of the websites recently went down recently so I&#39;ve been trying to teach myself to try to understand what went wrong, but I&#39;ve been chasing my tail trying to find applicable resources or starting point. </p> <p>Does anyone happen to have any applicable resources to train myself up on Ubuntu/Docker? Specifically for hosting websites if possible. The issue seems to be that the IP addresses/ports of the docker sites seem to have changed so they are no longer interacting with NginX, but I don&#39;t know for sure.
