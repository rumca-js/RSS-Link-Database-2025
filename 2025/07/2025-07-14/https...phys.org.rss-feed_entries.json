This superimposed grid, like what would emerge if two window screens were laid slightly askew, is called a moir\u00e9 pattern.",

The approach could optimize the route one takes and so reduce travel times and fuel consumption if traveling by road, for instance, while at the same time offering surprising and interesting places one might visit that reflect one's individual preferences and practical constraints. The system moves away from conventional travel planning, which typically suggests only the most popular destinations and largely ignores user needs or schedules.",

Unlike direct sunlight, diffuse light can reach deeper into shaded plant canopies, where plants have dense, layered leaves.

Prior research suggests that some diffuse light can also boost photosynthesis, but after an optimal point, the overall reduction in total radiation will decrease photosynthesis.",

For example, when the tiny sensory hair cells in our inner ears are damaged, the result is often permanent hearing loss, deafness, or balance problems. In contrast, animals like fish, frogs, and chicks regenerate sensory hair cells effortlessly.",
