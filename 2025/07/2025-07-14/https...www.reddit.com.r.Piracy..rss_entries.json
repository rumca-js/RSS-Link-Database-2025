So I&#39;m trying to download music, so I went to the megathread to use the links, but they&#39;re not working for me. It blacks out and loads for a bit before saying there&#39;s been an error. Says there&#39;s a gateway timeout and that there&#39;s been an error with the host. That&#39;s been happening with almost every link. Am I doing something wrong? The only thing I can think of, I haven&#39;t done that they explained to do is change my DNS and get a VPN. The DNS reason is because I&#39;m a complete idiot, I don&#39;t know how to do that. I would need help on that if it is the reason. The VPN reason is because I&#39;m short on money. But I&#39;m willing to pay if that is the reason why it&#39;s not working. It&#39;s not much with some of the plans they offer. I will post a screenshot of what it looks like for me for more clarity in the comments. But basically what I&#39;m asking for is help.</p> <p>Edit: I swear I ",

Wanting to start my own plex server, but I don\u2019t have any DVDs at home, and if I go and start buying multiple DVDs, well it basically defeats the purpose as they are not cheap at all (5$/movie at least, up to 20$/movie), so getting a large collection would just end up being super expensive. Obviously I can\u2019t ask in the <a href=\"/r/Plex\">r/Plex</a> subreddit because it\u2019s against their rules, so are you guys just torrenting movies? If so, can you point me to which website from the megathread you guys use?
