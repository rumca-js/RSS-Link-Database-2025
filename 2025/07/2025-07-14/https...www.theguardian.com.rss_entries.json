They matched England\u2019s Euro 2022 record of 14 goals in the group stage. Alexia Putellas is continuing her charge for the Ballon d\u2019Or with three goals and four assists and has lit up their midfield while the 18-year-old Vicky L\u00f3pez has impressed in her first major tournament.

And at least I\u2019m making an effort</p><p>I\u2019ve always been a fussy eater. As a child, I ruined many family dinners because my overly particular palate meant I would simply refuse to eat a range of dishes. Certain ingredients would make me heave and throw tantrums. My brothers loved lasagne, but it rarely made the dinner table as I couldn\u2019t stand cheese, and bechamel triggered a phobia of white sauces (mayonnaise is my No 1 hate). And don\u2019t even think about making tuna sandwiches around me: the smell alone would make me burst into tears.</p><p>I often joke that being a fussy eater has made me feel more like a second-class citizen in this country than my blackness or my sexuality as a gay man. And I\u2019m only being half unserious. Fussy eaters are often derided, belittled for only enjoying chicken tenders and fries, with questions about why we can\u2019t just \u201cgrow up\u201d and get over our aversion to certain foods.<",

To put that in perspective, it\u2019s as distant to readers today as Catch-22 or To Kill a Mockingbird would have been in 1993. If you are anything like me, that doesn\u2019t feel quite right. Because even at such a historical remove, there remains something undeniably resonant, something curiously current, about Welsh\u2019s wiry, demotic, scabrous debut.</p><p>In part, this is explained by the sheer scale of Trainspotting\u2019s success. It was one of those genuinely rare literary events, wherein a critically acclaimed, stylistically adventurous book catches the cultural zeitgeist to such a degree that it also becomes a commercial sensation, going on to sell over a million copies. Its cultural salience was further compounded by Danny Boyle\u2019s cinematic adaptation, one of the highest-grossing UK films of all time, ",
