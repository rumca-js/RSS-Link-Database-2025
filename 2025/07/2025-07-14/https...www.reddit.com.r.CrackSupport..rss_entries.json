Its fully updated and I&#39;ve repaired the files and my graphics drivers are up to date. The game itself keeps crashing without warning, and a handful of times I will get an Last exception report which I&#39;ve popped into the website to try and pinpoint the issue with no luck so far. Being that its a cracked game, I don&#39;t think I can go into the mccc discord to ask for support but im going crazy not being able to play for more than 10 minutes without a crash. </p> <p>I have updated all the script mods I have, but ya girl has...a lot of mods. Most of it is categorized but its still a big pain to do the 50/50 until I pinpoint it. </p> <p>Anyway, if someone has any advice or could help me decipher these reports I would be so grateful! Thank you so much! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",
