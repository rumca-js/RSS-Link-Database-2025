Maybe because I had difficulties connecting with the main character ? Also I find Ged SO ANNOYING in this one. And I usually love Ged but please man, just COMMUNICATE. Maybe also because the book made me think about death and I don&#39;t like it. Who knows.</p> <p>But the final scene, with Kalessin the dragon ? Phenomenal. Give me 14 of them now. Still crying a bit.</p> <p>I think I&#39;m generally a bit annoyed at the trope &quot;the world balance can be restored by one single man&quot;. But the loss of magic was depicted in a way that truly felt original.</p> <p>Also I did NOT understand how Arren is the long awaited King ? He&#39;s not a mage is he ?</p> <p>What do you think ?? Is book 3 your favorite ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WinIntelligent1218\"> /u/WinIntelligent1218 <",
