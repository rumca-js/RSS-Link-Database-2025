I know the campaign has been discussed in here before, with a lot of the backers frustrated by the delays and the lack of transparency that started alongside the delays. I don&#39;t mind the waiting, since that&#39;s pretty common with a lot of Kickstarter campaigns, but the radio silence is starting to get to me after the company promised that all tables for Canadian backers (me) are in the country and awaiting customs clearance. The last timeline estimate suggested that I should at least have a tracking number by this point, but there has been nothing.

You might have a plan, but it always seems to be in flux from one round to the next, just due to what gets rolled.</p> <p>Summoner Wars 2 - While I get the game wants to limit turtling/passive play, the fact that you get punished for not attacking is annoying.</p> <p>Gaia Project - It feels like it&#39;s a game that could be solved from the start.
