        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello Reddit, Im working on a project and im hoping to get some help. Basically I&#39;ll be modding a non programmable Casio calculator. Inside the case, i will place an RP2040 ZERO, that has wires connecting to the points on the casio motherboard, as well as the display. Now that the RP is reading the inputs constantly, it will wait for a combination, eg shift + 7. Then the Sidecar module will override the display, and the the casio now acts differently, or rather the original casio is acting exactly the same, just in the background. Using the keys while displaying the sidecars screen, i want the buttons on the calculator to be 1 to 1. so what i press will still display the same. except now when i type in any sum or equation, the &quot;=&quot; buttons output gives me the first step to solving the equation, not a final answer, to see the next step i would use the right D-Pad on the calc. So i would be able to cycle between steps. Also, I think it woul",

I have already found things like <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-hot-wheels-drag-race-track-hackspace-51/\">https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-hot-wheels-drag-race-track-hackspace-51/</a> which wouldn&#39;t work for what I am trying to do due to many cars going around the track at the same time, with different overtakes, and not every car being in a fixed position. I\u2019d appreciate your help by telling me if it\u2019s possible, and how! Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",
