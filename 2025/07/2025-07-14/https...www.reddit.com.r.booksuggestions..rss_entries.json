A series of tragic events leads Uncle John into isolation before his nephew Pete shows up at his hospital bedside 17 years later. The two attempt to rekindle their relationship after the estrangement, while seeking to understand the past. Pete soon finds he has more questions than answers. As the story unfolds, we see unique perspectives on the human condition, while navigating the ups and downs associated with love, addiction, loss, suicide, religious trauma, depression, mercy, and forgiveness. My Darlin&#39; John is inspired by a true story, about a textbook \u2018American Dream&#39; family, shattered by grief and the various ways we cope.

So I came across a few books that are like action-adventure stories, probably written sometime in the early 20th century, and aimed at teen boys. Can you guys recommend some more of these type of works? The book I&#39;ve read are Tappan&#39;s Burro, The Zakana Gold Affair, and The Valley of Silent Men. A short story with similar vibes is Love of life by Jack london</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bubblegum_pink_\"> /u/bubblegum_pink_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lzoiyg/vintage_adventure_books_recommendations/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lzoiyg/vintage_adventure_books_recommendations/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I love books, especially fantasy, and am an aspiring writer myself.</p> <p>Hopefully this is allowed, but I run this blog called A Literary Garden, where I have a new post daily. Poems are featured on Tuesdays, book recommendations on Thursdays, and quotes on the remaining days of the week. </p> <p>If you&#39;re an avid reader like me, or love inspiring quotes, I hope you take the time to check it out! </p> <p>Link in comments</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/UnderwaterSeadragon9\"> /u/UnderwaterSeadragon9 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lz9pqs/book_recommendation_blog/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"htt",

My attention span isn\u2019t very good and I don\u2019t have lots of free time so something that properly hooks you in from the get go would be amazing. I think I would enjoy mystery/ murder mystery/ drama/ fantasy, except I can also imagine getting into a romance if it has drama and suspense/passion. I\u2019m a sucker for enemies to lovers as well as a slow burn \u2018not admitting they like each other but clearly do\u2019 kinda vibe. A book with a bit of both romance and drama/mystery would be cool but I don\u2019t know where to start with searching. I don\u2019t mind if it\u2019s not a happy ending, and first person is preferable but third person is okay too. I also don\u2019t mind smut as long as it\u2019s not all throughout the book and has meaning to the plot. Does anyone have any suggestions that they loved?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://",
