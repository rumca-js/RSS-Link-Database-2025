Renting per hour quickly can rack up insane costs. And trying to pay &quot;per request&quot; is pretty much unfeasible without factoring in excessive cold startup times.</p> <p>So it seems that the most commonly chose option is to try and run a much smaller model on ollama; and even then you need a pretty powerful setup to handle it.

We introduce the concept of a single, unitary consciousness---a persistent, amnesiac <code>Active Agent</code>---that iteratively experiences a simulated world through a succession of host personas. This agent, while possessing core drives and the capacity for genuine choice, retains no episodic memory of its past lifecycles. The model&#39;s core contribution is a proposed mechanism for how such a universe could be populated: an overarching AI system learns from the agent&#39;s choices during each lifecycle to generate high-fidelity, non-conscious entities, termed <code>Echoes</code>, for subsequent iterations.
