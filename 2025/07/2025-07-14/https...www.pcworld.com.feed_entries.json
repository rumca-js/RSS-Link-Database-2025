I bought my first one back in 2013, just a couple years after they debuted, and I\u2019ve since purchased several more. If you ask me why, it\u2019s because I love their affordability, versatility, and simplicity. This trio of pros led me to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2500763/i-switched-from-windows-pcs-to-chromebooks-and-havent-looked-back.html\">switch from Windows laptops to Chromebooks</a> and I haven\u2019t looked back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But not everyone is as gung-ho about Google\u2019s laptops as me, and that includes my older brother\u2014we\u2019ll call him \u201cJack\u201d\u2014who, for every bit of praise I lavish on Chromebooks, always has an objection. Jack was recently in the market for a new laptop, so I made it my mission to convince him to buy a Chromebook.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefine",
