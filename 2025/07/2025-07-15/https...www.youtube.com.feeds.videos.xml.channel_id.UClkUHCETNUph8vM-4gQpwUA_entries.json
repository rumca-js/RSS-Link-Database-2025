        "description": "The Outer Worlds 2 Gameplay FIRST LOOK - Can Obsidian Get Their Groove Back?\nIn this Fextralife video, we're going to be taking a look at The Outer Worlds 2. This was a game that was announced last year, and they showed off some gameplay recently at Developer Direct. We were right in the middle of Nightreign when that happened, so I didn't have time to get around to covering it. So now that things have kind of slowed down there, I'm getting into taking a look at this game. But in this video, we're going to talk about what they announced, what they showed in the gameplay and what our expectations are for this game.\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 The Outer Worlds 2 First Look\n0:35 Obsidian\n2:11 Arcadia\n3:07 Reactive Quest and Player Decisions\n3:47 Background, Traits, and Perks\n6:21 Weapons and Armors\n7:41 Map and Companions\n8:50 Radio\n9:18 3rd Person Mode\n9:57 Art style\n11:01 Environments\n11:52 Final Thoughts and Cost\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\nFollow us on",
