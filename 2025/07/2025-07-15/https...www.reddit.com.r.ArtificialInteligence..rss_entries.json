What would be needed to transform a LLM into something more akin to the human brain (without all the chemical that make us, well, humans)?</p> <p>Side question, but do we even want that?

But maybe it is?</p> <p>From the looks of what I&#39;ve seen, MCP is just suggestions about how to architect a client and a server for use with LLMs. So with my current understanding, I could just create a Flask server that connects to multiple APIs and then create a frontend client that can pass prompts to the server to generate some content or either automate some process using AI. For instance, I built a LLM frontend client with Vue and ollama and I can create a UI that allows me to call some api endpoints that does some stuff with ollama on the server and sends it to my client. My server could connect to as many databases and local resources (because it runs on my computer locally) as I want it to.</p> <p>From their site:</p> <ul> <li><strong>MCP Hosts</strong>: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI",
