Simulations and X-ray diffraction experiments confirm the presence of nanocrystals in so-called low-density amorphous ice. This surprising finding has significant implications for our understanding of planetary formation, galactic evolution, and how life\u2019s essential ingredients may have traveled to Earth on interstellar ice grains.",
