ANYWAYS, I open up RVX this morning to listen to some music and every single one of my music playlists has had what used to be the official songs converted to the official lyric videos so now the titles are broken, artists don&#39;t detect all the time, and the whole playlist experience is now broken for me. The only thing I can think of that may have caused this is that I&#39;ve recently used SmartTube which I haven&#39;t used since the switch. Is this a bug or does YouTube do this all the time? Is there a way to fix it and prevent this from happening again? I&#39;d really rather avoid finding a crack of Spotify just so I can listen to music without it breaking ",

It basically works by creating a secure pipeline between the content server and your device&#39;s hardware, so even if you try to hijack the video in transit, all you get is encrypted garbage. Level 1 (L1) means full HD or 4K playback, but only if your device has certified hardware support. Most browsers only run at L3, which caps you at 480p or 720p. It\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s how they lock down content these days.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mental_Fortune5316\"> /u/Mental_Fortune5316 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1m0dsqo/has_anyone_spoofed_or_bypassed_widevinedrm_l1/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1m0d",

Chief among my reasons for wanting to switch to something else is that the anime extensions on the single repo I have just don&#39;t work anymore. I&#39;ve got one working extension and it doesn&#39;t work 100% of the time and doesn&#39;t always have the dub available. I&#39;ve tried going online to look for more repos for both anime and manga but I only ever found the same 2(one for manga and one for anime). I&#39;ll keep using it for manga and other comics but I need something more reliable for anime. I haven&#39;t cared in the past because I had moved away from anime mostly when these changes happened but now I&#39;m getting back into it and it&#39;s a damn struggle. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/detonz\"> /u/detonz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments",
