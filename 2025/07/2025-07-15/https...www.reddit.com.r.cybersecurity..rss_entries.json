Even on the job, if we\u2019re doing a config review or something like an Active Directory assessment, I\u2019ll dive into what AD really is, GPOs, security policies, trust relationships, forests/domains, etc. I need to understand how it\u2019s all set up to know if it\u2019s secure. Same with checking firewall rules, encryption configs, IAM.</p> <p>So genuinely curious what does \u201cbeing technical\u201d mean to you in cyber? Does labbing stuff, reviewing configs, digging through logs count?

This tainted data is forbidden from being used by the main LLM until it has been &quot;cleaned&quot; by passing through a strict, multi-stage validation pipeline. A decent pipeline might look like this: Stage 1 (Sanitise): A basic pass to strip known malicious characters, scripts, and control characters.
