        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, As every summer, I find myself reading a ton of extremely old books while visiting my parents, because my father has a huge book collection. By extremely old books I mean greek tragedies, latin treaties, old Norse sagas and other middle ages texts. In the other seasons I find the struggle of approaching those texts unbearable, preferring instead thriller, fantasy and other genre litterature, while in the summer I have far more time and a head more welcoming of thing. Plus they remind me my time as a philology student from a few years back, where the content/plot of the book is only the start of the analysis of such texts. Anyway, one guilty pleasure I have is going to bookreada after the book is over and finding 2-3 star reviews of said text. Am I the only one finding people giving 2-3 stars to Oedipus, a book of 2500 years ago, a tad ridiculous? The entire metrics of literature have changed many times since then, except the desire to entertain",

In a few, the reveals were unexpected simply because the author wasn\u2019t using foreshadowing very well(or at all), making it feel like the author was purposefully hiding info to blindside the reader.

So I&#39;ve finally got to read one of his novels, and is one of his shorter ones, &quot;Jack of Shadows&quot;.</p> <p>Set in a world that is half light and half darkness, a place where science and magic are striving for dominance, there lives one man that is never friendly with either side. His name is Jack, from a realm of shadows, and he is a thief who has been wrongly punished. This sets off a vendetta that he undertakes that would make him the most prominent and, maybe, perhaps a hero.</p> <p>Wandering through strange realms where he encounters witches, vampires and his greatest enemy, the Lord of Bats. He is also friends with a cast down angel named Morningstar, and pursued by the monstrous Borshin.",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is all I remember: The protagonist is somehow transported to a different world where a kind of medieval class system existes. Combatants had advanced armor with plasma(?) swords and targeting in the helmets. There were very sophisticated suits and lower classes of these suits but the users didnt know even a fraction of the capabilities. The protagonist scavenged a lower class of suit from a fallen warrior (&quot;He&#39;s wearing Villers old suit&quot;) and recruited 2 lower ranking warriors to fight in a coordinated attack. He swiftly rose in the ranks. There was also a wholly secondary plot that kinda sucked but I don&#39;t remember anything about that. I know it&#39;s not much to go on.
