        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys,</p> <p>FeedBro was the most convenient browser feed reader, however it&#39;s future is uncertain and development stalled. So I recently switched from using FeedBro exclusively on my Chromium browser (Brave) to self-hosting FreshRSS + RSS Guard Lite on Windows and Capy Reader on Android. Very convenient, syncs across devices nicely and is fully open source too.</p> <p>I was wondering if any of you know if there&#39;s a browser extension to check your FreshRSS instance for the latest unread articles and show them in a small list with clickable links when clicking on the extension icon, like FeedBro does.</p> <p>Instead of having to constantly keep RSS Guard open or to visit the FreshRSS instance. Like a neat extension that lives in the browser, so no more need for external software like RSS Guard, it could also have notifications for when new articles arrive to improve it even more.</p> <p>I know of FreshRSS checker but it&#39;s purpose is kind",
