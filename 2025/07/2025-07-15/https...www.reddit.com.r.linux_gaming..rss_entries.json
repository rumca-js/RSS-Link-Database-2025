I care a lot about CUDA and RTX and frankly am not up for buying a new GPU right now. So, I have tried Zorin OS, Linux Mint and Kubuntu. The worst issues came from Zorin OS, which sucks because I really like the look of the distro. In Zorin OS no matter if I install the latest drivers, or even older drivers once I login my monitor stops working. I CAN play games after a clean Zorin OS install since it comes with Nvidia drivers, but I can&#39;t change my refresh rate and I&#39;m locked into the drivers it installs with. On Linux Mint the drivers will actually install, but on the newest drivers I can&#39;t change my refresh rate. If I go to slightly older drivers, they install fine and I can change my refresh rate, but I can&#39;t use LACT because the &quot;management library&quot; is missing. On Kubuntu, the drivers work perfectly, bu",

I wanted to talk a little bit about it because I have restarted the distro portion of the project. I was very close to finishing the first GUI/DE part of the distro but I completely restarted. Since that post, I&#39;ve made some significant advancements across the project! For Starpack, I&#39;ve completely switched to zstd compression, which has proven incredibly efficient for size and speed (thanks for the recommendations <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BigHeadTonyT/\">BigHeadTonyT</a> and others.) I&#39;ve also significantly sped up parsing and saving operations by utilizing SQLite, and crucially, I&#39;ve lowered the dependency count considerably by moving away from libcurl.</p> <p>Beyond Starpack, the core of SFGOS is evolving rapidly. I&#39;ve created ~63 custom coreutils based off of <a href=\"https://github.com/DiegoMagdaleno/BSDCoreUtils\">BSDCoreUti",
