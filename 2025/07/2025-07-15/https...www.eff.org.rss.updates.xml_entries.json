Paxton</em> did not end the legal debate over age-verification mandates for websites. Instead, it\u2019s a limited decision: the court\u2019s legal reasoning only applies to age restrictions on sexual materials that minors do not have a legal right to access. Although the ruling reverses decades of First Amendment protections for adults to access lawful speech online, the decision does not allow states or the federal government to impose broader age-verification mandates on social media, general audience websites, or app stores.</p>\n<p>At EFF, <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/12/effs-2024-battle-against-online-age-verification-defending-youth",
