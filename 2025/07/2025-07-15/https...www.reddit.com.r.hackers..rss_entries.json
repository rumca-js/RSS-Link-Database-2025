Whenever she blocks them they just make a new profile and continue. They somehow are getting access to her icloud messages and know who she&#39;s talking to. They even made a profile pretending to be her, to harass people she knows. She hired a private investigator for a while but that proved to be too expensive and was taking too long. This situation has been going on for well over a year. Is there anyway anyone can help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KenganAsura_Crufix\"> /u/KenganAsura_Crufix </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1m0h1go/crazy_mystery_stalker/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1m0h1go/crazy_mystery_stalker/\">[comments]</a></span>",
