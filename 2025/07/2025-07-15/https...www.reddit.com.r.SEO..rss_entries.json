He runs a small taxi company in a tiny German town and doesn\u2019t care at all about online stuff so I decided to step in, even though I\u2019m a total beginner.</p> <p>The website loads super fast and all SEO tests say it\u2019s solid. I made sure people can call right away, created separate pages for different services, added an FAQ with stuff people actually Google, and wrote an \u201cAbout Us\u201d page.</p> <p>But we still don\u2019t rank #1 locally. We actually have the best Google reviews in town, so I thought it would be easier, especially in such a small place.</p> <p>My biggest struggle: backlinks. No clue how to build them for a local taxi business in a small village.</p> <p>Any tips on what else I could do? How do I even approach backlinks for a local business like this?</p> <p>Thanks so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sajeelisttoll\">",
