While that\u2019s not necessarily what I\u2019m exactly looking for, it got me interested. Are there any good books that talk about either the history of the ocean, non fiction stories not really about people, but the sea, or anything along those lines. I\u2019m not really looking to hear some guys life story about how he lived by the sea, but maybe something more to learn more about the ocean or grand stories of what lives inside it. Really anything interesting at all, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fatmaninablanket\"> /u/fatmaninablanket </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1m0tbuq/any_historicalnonfiction_ocean_books/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1m0tbuq/any_h",

I really enjoyed Word Freak by Stefan Fatsis (focusing on competitive Scrabble) and I&#39;d like to read some more books along that line - where the game and the competition are really used as an outlet to tell some other story, say the nature of obsession or finding an identity in competition. The Rookie by Stephen Moss does something similar with chess, but ideally I&#39;d like the game itself to be a bit more obscure so you have that sense of discovery with the author.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zellisgoatbond\"> /u/zellisgoatbond </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1m0j9yb/nonfiction_books_about_competition_in_obscure/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/com",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Okay so I was hunting for something different in the thriller/suspense genre I love Lisa Jewell, Frieda McFadden, and Gillian Flynn but wanted a break from traditional format.</p> <p>Ended up picking up The Blackout Letters by Lily Joy found it by accident honestly. And wow. It&#39;s not a typical novel it\u2019s actually a full suspense story told entirely in poetry form.</p> <p>Sounds weird, but it works. It\u2019s emotional, eerie, and the pacing just keeps pulling you in. Felt like reading someone&#39;s personal breakdown wrapped in mystery. I\u2019d give it a 4.8/5.</p> <p>Has anyone else tried this? Or read any other \u201cnon-traditional format\u201d thrillers that are equally good?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mikenolan567\"> /u/mikenolan567 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1m0haxg/just_read_something_that_felt_like_a_thriller/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"ht",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I myself came into contact with the works of Robert Crais and became interested in foreign cultures, especially the United States, where he is based. I was deeply impressed by his works &quot;The Promise&quot; and &quot;The Suspect,&quot; and began collecting his other works. However, nearly 70% of his works have yet to be translated into Japanese, and recently Sogen Mystery Library stopped publishing his works. I felt that we needed to take action together to spread his fascinating works again and give Japanese fans a chance to read them.<br/> But we need your help to make this project a success. I hope that by appealing to Sogen Mystery Library, the day will come when Japanese translations of Crais&#39; works will once again be available in Japan. I need your vote so that not only I, but all the fans of Robert Crais all over Japan can once again enjoy the joy of reading his wonderful stories at their fingertips.

First things first: sorry for any language errors, English is not my first language.</p> <p>So\u2026 I\u2019m looking for new books to read, specifically suspense, horror, drama and mystery genres, but it has to have a good plot and be well written. Some preferences that I find relevant:</p> <ol> <li><p>I really like Stephen King\u2019s work - I like more his older works than the recent ones, such as It, Pet Sematary, The Shining, Christine, Salem\u2019s Lot - especially the way he deepens the characters.</p></li> <li><p>I\u2019ve also read some classics, such as Frankenstein (Mary Shelley), Dr. Moreau\u2019s Island (H. G. Wells) and Dracula (Bram Stoker) - which I liked a lot.</p></li> <li><p>When I was younger, I really liked Sherlock Holmes stories, especially those that involved more supernatural things (like The Hound of the Baskervilles), but I haven\u2019t reread it for a long time and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a kind of story I would like today...</p></li> <li><p>Among the ",

Basically this love heals them. I recently watched a movie where the girl meets the boy who is head over heels for her but she&#39;s still stuck in her previous love who died, his memories wouldn&#39;t let her move on. But this boy&#39;s love heals her and she ends up falling in love with him. I can&#39;t stop thinking about all the emotions this movie gave me, I NEED books with those emotions! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/misty_wolf_875\"> /u/misty_wolf_875 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1m039u8/a_book_with_lots_of_love_and_a_previous_loss/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1m039u8/a_book_with_lots_of_love_and_a_previous_loss/\"",
