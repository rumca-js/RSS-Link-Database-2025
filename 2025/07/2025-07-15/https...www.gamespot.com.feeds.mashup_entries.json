Next month will see one of the best swords-and sorcery-adventures of all time, The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt, leave the library alongside Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in mid-August.</p><p>The other big departures include Koei Tecmo's Monster Hunter-inspired game Wild Hearts, the memetastic Bugsnax, and the hard-hitting EA Sports UFC 5. Several Sword Art Online games are also leaving, and you can check the entire list below to see what else will be gone soon.</p><p>The good news is that a lot of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-plus-extra-premium-games-for-july-2025-include-c",
