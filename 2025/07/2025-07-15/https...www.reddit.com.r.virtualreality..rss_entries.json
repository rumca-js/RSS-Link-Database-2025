My idea would be to have the headset only be the screen and cameras while the hardware and battery be built in to some kind of belt system. Any thoughts? Some of us already use external batteries that clip onto our belt so this would not be much of a stretch and I believe more CPU and GPU power can be had along with more battery without it feeling bulky and heavy on your head.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Paintmasteryates\"> /u/Paintmasteryates </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1m0oqle/keeping_vr_mobile/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1m0oqle/keeping_vr_mobile/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, I\u2019m just trying to set up cyberpunk vr and I have it running pretty well through the Luke Ross vr mod, I just have a few issues with flickering outlines and movement blur. The first problem may be something to do with TAA but I\u2019m not sure what to do about it\u2026 I basically have a thick distorted outline around objects and some complex models like trees and grass are flickering a lot. This is exacerbated during movement, either mine or the models(like a car driving past). I think the movement blur is related but when I turn with the controller everything blurs , not when I just turn my head though\u2026 Is this something that can be fixed, or is it just part of it? I\u2019m running on a quest 3 on a designated router so latency is fine. My pc is 32gig ram and a 9070xt and I\u2019m getting a solid 80-90 fps through virtual desktop.

I really can&#39;t stand the Quest 2 compression. I&#39;m using a cable, everything set at max and I adjusted settings in the debug tool, but nothing, It&#39;s still going to look somewhat bad. Correct me If I&#39;m wrong, but I think that&#39;s because of the compression it gets since it has USBc. Now, Is there any PCVR headset with Display Port (if I&#39;m not wrong that&#39;s what it&#39;s used) that i can get for somewhat cheap? Not 20 dollars cheap but i wouldn&#39;t spend TOO MUCH on it. And why not, If you have suggestions to get a better visual clarity, tell me!</p> <p>edit: I have found a PSVR2 with It&#39;s controller at 450 euro, Is it good?
