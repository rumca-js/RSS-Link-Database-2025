Introduction: The Declarative Prompt as a Cognitive Contract</p> <p>This section will establish the core thesis: that effective human-AI interaction is shifting from conversational language to the explicit design of Declarative Prompts (DPs). These DPs are not simple queries but function as machine-readable, executable contracts that provide the AI with a self-contained blueprint for a cognitive task. This approach elevates prompt engineering to an &quot;architectural discipline.&quot;</p> <p>The introduction will highlight how DPs encode the goal, preconditions, constraints_and_invariants, and self_test_criteria directly into the prompt artifact. This establishes a non-negotiable anchor against semantic drift and ensures clarity of purpose.</p> <p>II.
