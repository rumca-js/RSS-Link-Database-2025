        "description": "It's more Full Spectrum Dominance, the Print-to-Play Sci Fi mass combat game with lovely models and rules all designed by The Lazy Forger. \n\nScientists need to be evacuated as the rampant AI of the Tech seeks to capture them to cripple human war-efforts. Are the mercenary Corsairs friends or foes? We'll find out in this 60pt game of Full Spectrum Dominance as I use the \"First Mates\" list against Bob's Tech!\n\nSTLS for models, terrain and the digital rules all available HERE: https://www.myminifactory.com/users/TheLazyForger?fbclid=IwY2xjawIIYK5leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHeT0TiY_m-RwDp1UxT9QgbgvuwgdksRPLY50fQ75u98jUths1bVMvVo1KA_aem_n9MBH8OZymyIHxIvitCKsg#/\n\nGMG is publicly supported.
