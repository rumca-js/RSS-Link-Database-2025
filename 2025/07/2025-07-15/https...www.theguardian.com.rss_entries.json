The box-to-box midfielder turns 31 in August but has just had one of the best seasons of his career at Lyon \u2013 scoring 10 goals and registering nine assists in all competitions \u2013 and, given the French club\u2019s financial problems, there may be a deal to be done for around \u00a315m.</p><p>After weeks of negotiations, United are also reportedly closing on a move for <strong>Bryan Mbeumo</strong> after agreeing terms with Brentford. The fee is thought to be north of \u00a360m, with the shrewd Bees keen on using some of that money to buy a replacement in <strong>Omari Hutchinson</strong>. The winger flickered in a struggling Ipswich side last season but was one of England\u2019s best players in their under-21 Euros campaign, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025",

Ghosted hews close to the template, to the point of feeling like a tribute act \u2013 but unfortunately not the kind of tribute act that sells out arenas but the kind that plays down the Dog &amp; Duck of a Saturday night.</p><p>Mercy (Jade Asha) is unhappily single, on the hunt for Mr Right, and hoping to improve her career (ideally from waitress to international acting superstar). Part of the film\u2019s problem is that Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary is of its time, and to hear a 30-year-old supposedly modern and progressive heroine in 2025 complain that she is a decade older than the majority of singles definitely feels dat",

Reflecting ideas generated by that convergence, Morrison\u2019s novels \u2013 described by the Nobel committee, when they awarded her the prize in literature in 1993, as giving life to an essential aspect of&nbsp;American reality \u2013 were driven by an unwavering belief in the possibility of African American empowerment through self-regard.

It\u2019s one of those recipes where the ease is almost embarrassing. How can something so delicious be so straightforward? The burgers themselves are a simple food processor job; if you don\u2019t have one, use chicken mince and make sure you really mix in the curry paste and courgette by hand. The accompaniments are also key: the lime-pickled shallots, the abundance of herbs and the creaminess of the mayo all work so well together. Turn up to a barbecue with a tray of these and I guarantee you\u2019ll be dishing out the recipe in no time.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/15/red-curry-chicken-courgette-burgers-recipe-georgina-hayden\">Continue reading...</a>",
