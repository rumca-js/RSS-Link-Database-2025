But one diet stood out: the 5:2 intermittent fasting plan, where participants eat normally five days a week and restrict calories on two. It led to better results in fasting blood sugar, insulin response, and sticking with the plan.",

This large-scale Taiwanese study links sweeteners to hormonal changes and gut bacteria imbalances that can speed up puberty, with effects differing between boys and girls. Early onset puberty has been tied to serious health consequences later in life, including emotional stress and metabolic disorders. The findings could reshape dietary recommendations and encourage genetic screening to mitigate long-term risks.",
