At that time, I was a lonely developer trying to create a lightweight service mesh from scratch. Back then, I started this project in January as a personal software engineering challenge, and I didn&#39;t expect to gain a single bit of support, but after some weeks, I started receiving pull requests from random and interested developers. Right now, the project is slowly growing, and we&#39;re actively maintaining and expanding the feature landscape. We have introduced a dedicated command line interface and network connection tracker leveraging the power of BPF programs and the Linux kernel. We&#39;re working on the next update, where we will finally introduce detailed networking and kernel metrics and hopefully an integrated dashboard for data visualization.</p> <p>For all the curious people who want to know more about it, contribute to a fresh project, or simp",

So, you want to try and generate as many different kinds of inputs as you can. You can probably achieve that based on a Cartesian product approach. However, I went the extra mile and created a library that can generate all possible combinations of those inputs for you. Below is an example:</p> <pre><code>u/Kombine( // Class-level u/Kombine: Provides defaults for unannotated, non-defaulted properties allPossibleIntParams = [100], // Default for &#39;padding&#39; if not specified otherwise allPossibleStringParams = [&quot;system&quot;] // Default for &#39;fontFamily&#39; ) data class ScreenConfig( @Kombine(allPossibleStringParams = [&quot;light&quot;, &quot;dark&quot;, &quot;auto&quot;]) val theme: String, // Property-level overrides class-level for &#39;theme&#39; val o",
