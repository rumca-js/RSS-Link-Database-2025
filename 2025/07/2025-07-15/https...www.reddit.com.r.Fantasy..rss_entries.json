So in the beginningof the book the MC should be already 100+ years old (but not more than a few tousand) and have this maturity/danger and feel different from your average teenage MC although looking fairly young. The MC can be a human, elf or somobody else, it doesn&#39;t really matter. Bonus if the MC has some sort of powerful magic.</p> <p>Also I would prefer few POVs (1-4 ideally) so books with a huge cast like Malazan/ASOIAF are a no-go. Other than that the story should be adult focused, non YA, more serious, can be on the dark(er) side. Morally grey characters are also very welcome. High fantasy or urban fantasy but it must have magic.

I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m on the right sub exactly for this sort of question, but I could really use some help figuring out what kinds of in-person events I could look into for marketing it. The only thing I really know of is book readings/signings at places, say, like a book store. But as someone without a real online presence, I&#39;m leery of using that as my sole option, because I know I&#39;d be lucky to get more than a handful of people, if any, to come. </p> <p>I guess I&#39;m just hoping for some ideas of places where people who might be predisposed to liking my novel might already be gathering. Something like conventions perhaps, or the upcoming local Ren Faire? Anything with local libraries and/or schools, etc?</p> <p>I&#39;m typically very critical of my work, but even though I wouldn&#39;t say my book is perfect, I&#39;m very proud of it and",

And if so, how has it impacted your enjoyment while reading? I have a very small friend &quot;circle,&quot; and none of them are readers (I&#39;ve tried, I&#39;ve tried), and sometimes I just wish I had a few friends who read the same / similar books I do so I have a freaking outlet afterwards (lol). My boyfriend is great, he will listen to me blab about the plot of fantasy and dark fantasy books even though he has not a <em>clue</em> what I am talking about. Sometimes he&#39;ll even look up the book I&#39;m reading just so he knows what&#39;s going on (truly, <em>Gods bless him</em>).</p> <p>Anyway, do y&#39;all have book friends? I&#39;ve always thought it would be so, <strong><em>so</em></strong> cool to have a few friends each pick a book and rotate it, the entire thing annotated by different people by the end!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

Her attention to &quot;where are all the bugs?&quot; just felt like such a proper detail to fixate on that something was *wrong*. It was, overall, a great vibe and I enjoyed reading it.

There&#39;s a lot of viewpoint shifts in this story, more than I remember in any previous Bujold work, and she handles it all skillfully. Loose ends from earlier in the series are, if not tied off, followed farther on. The story is focused on the parent child relationship, especially when the parent is someone the child might feel a need to live up to. Many authors seem compelled to choose between an annoyingly immature character or a 2d one without any internal conflicts, but across her entire career, Bujold has known how to write relatively mature and &quot;good&quot; characters in a way that&#39;s vital and real --- she hasn&#39;t forgotten.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I think the plot of this story is lacking. It&#39;s not an &quot;adventure&quot; in the usual sense. The c",
