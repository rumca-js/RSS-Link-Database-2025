It has come to my attention and to the attention of many others, that more and more projects are posted on this sub, which are either completely vibe coded or were developed under the heavy use of LLMs/AI. Since most selfhosters are not developers themselves. It\u2019s hard for the users of this sub to spot and understand the implications of the use of LLMs/AI to create software projects for the open-source community. Reddit has some features to highlight a post\u2019s intention or origin. Simple post flairs can mark a post as LLM/AI Code project. These flairs do currently not exist (create a new post and check the list of available flairs). Nor are flairs enforced by the sub\u2019s settings. This is a problem in my opinion and maybe the opinion of many others.</p> <h1>SOLUTION</h1> <p>Make post flairs mandatory, setup auto mod to spot posts containing certain key words like <em>vi",
