        "description": "ZipWall dust barrier zipper kit\u2026I measure and mark where I want the door. Then I bond the heavy duty zippers to 4 mil plastic. I love these doors because they can be up when not in use and contain all the dust to one area. You can find them at Lowe\u2019s in the paint section \ud83d\udd25 Many thanks to ZipWall for for sponsoring this video and keeping work areas safe \u2764\ufe0f#dustbarrier #dustcontrol #zipwall #homerenovation #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
