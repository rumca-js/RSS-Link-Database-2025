Does his heart simply \"go out to his fans\"? or is it something more. \n\n\n\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\n\nCO",
