The idea would be that upon a button press, a camera takes a picture, then it&#39;s analysed through a py code (a tensor flow lite model for object recognition) and then from the output it spins a motor a certain number of times. Now on the software part, I pretty much know what to do, but for the hardware I have no idea what to buy so that it would be compatible, as all these components seem to use the same pins, especially the motor which uses 20+ pins if I remember, so if anyone could give advice on what to buy (rather precisely if possible) for it to work out all together. I wish I could have done some research work myself but I don&#39;t have much time rn and it&#39;s for a gift in about a week or so, so if you could take some time to help me it would be solo great, thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",

(EDIT : I can reduce my range to something like 10 km (6,21371 miles) and i have the autorisation to do this by the french administration)</p> <p>I\u2019ve looked into FM transmitters but haven\u2019t found anything that really fits what I\u2019m looking for. I have a Raspberry Pi 2B+ powered by a direct power supply, and a budget of about 100\u20ac (~116 USD).</p> <p>Does anyone know how I could achieve this kind of range?
