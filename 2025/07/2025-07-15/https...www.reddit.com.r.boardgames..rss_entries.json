But hear me out: having played both games within the last 48 hours, I&#39;m genuinely curious why PTC is regularly bashed as a random dice chucker while Arcs is hailed as a masterpiece. I&#39;m trying to hard to convince myself that Arcs is less randomly deterministic than PTC and I just can&#39;t get there. Before reading further, consider that I am talking <em>only</em> about the degree to which randomness and luck determines the outcome of these two games \u2014 not comparing them in any other way. Also, I&#39;m a fan of both games in their own, strange ways, so not trying to throw shade on either one.</p> <p>Argument 1) On the surface, PTC undoubtedly looks and feels more random, but it gives you more tools to mitigate pure luck. Rerolls. Events. Special role powers. The probability space is constrained, but you can shape it. You usually get to act meaning",

My co-creator and I have been working on a board game that blends political strategy with fun, educational mechanics - and we&#39;d really love some feedback from this community as we prepare for a potential Kickstarter.</p> <p>It all started during the long lockdown stretch of COVID. We\u2019re both huge board game lovers, but kept feeling like there weren\u2019t enough games that were truly fun with <strong>just 2 players</strong> and also scalable for larger groups of 3-6 people. At the same time, the election was dominating the headlines, and - embarrassing confession - we realized we had no idea how the Electoral College really worked. Two well-educated college grads\u2026 and we were Googling how many votes each state had.</p> <p>That turned into a challenge: <strong>Could we make a game that\u2019s actually fun to play</strong> <strong><em>and</em></strong> <strong>helps people understand how U.S. elections work - without being political?</strong></p>",
