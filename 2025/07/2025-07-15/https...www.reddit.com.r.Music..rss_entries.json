Her voice, her words, her presence, they just are. There\u2019s no flashy frills, 15 second hook or gimmicks needed with her. We know so little about her and we see even less. She\u2019s always felt like the epitome of a musician and a woman deeply anchored in who she is and what she puts out choosing integrity over trends. Her voice is so soothingly beautiful. Her messages simple, meaningful and necessary. She never shaped herself to fit a mold. Every time I listen to her treasures I\u2019m reminded of quiet strength and peace and that real beauty, in music and in people is raw. Music filters into and shapes society and musicians like Tracy Chapman will always be needed I think as such great examples and as reminders to very essentials in life. Obviously everyone knows Fast Car but I\u2019ve also listened to and loved Crossroads, Freedom Now, Bridges, Material World, Subcity, Born ",

But what about the rest? I mean, I grew up on Billy Joel. Well, rather, my grandparents did, so then my mom did, so I did. That&#39;s my connection I guess.</p> <p>About the cheesy/theatrical labels. Is it THAT bad to be cheesy or theatrical? For a start, it gives it style. Maybe I&#39;m young and 2010s pop has ruined me.</p> <p>Another point I&#39;ve seen is about him being overplayed in Long Island. Does this not happen to all places with a hyper famous music artist?</p> <p>To be honest, I looked into it, about how he was a doechbag and basically fired his band after he got famous, caused the bassist to commit suicide, and that stuff. This I have no opinion on, because half of what I find saids that&#39;s what happened and half said that&#39;s not what happened.
