My account seems to have switched from using GPT-Image-1 to DALL\u00b7E for generating images. The generations themselves are lightning fast now, which is great, but the quality feels off\u2014images are often blurry, and it can no longer render text properly (like signs or labels in the images). I used to get clean, readable text, but now it\u2019s either gibberish or completely missing. Has anyone else with a Pro account noticed this change? Is this a deliberate switch by OpenAI, or is something broken? I\u2019m frustrated because I rely on image generation for my projects, and the text issue is a dealbreaker. I\u2019ve tried different prompts and checked my settings, but no luck. Any ideas what\u2019s happening? Is this a temporary bug, or is DALL\u00b7E just not as good with text? Would love to hear if others are seeing this or if there\u2019s a workaround. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
