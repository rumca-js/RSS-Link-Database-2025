Does it make more sense to install apps into the secure folder apps that are essential like banking along with insurance, etc? Then when needed to access them go into the secure folder to do so and use the main profile for browsing and other kind of crap. Or is it best to do it the other way around? </p> <p>I understand thats only going to do so much, but I&#39;d rather try to do something than nothing. </p> <p>Thanks for any advice. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/S7evin-Kelevra\"> /u/S7evin-Kelevra </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1m0jvge/how_to_keep_some_privacy_on_android/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1m0jvge/how_to_keep_some_privacy_on_android/\">[comments]</a></span>",
