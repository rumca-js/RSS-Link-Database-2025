Should I cancel this plan and get the $2 month plan in the providers deal section? Or am I using a different easynews? Sorry, this is a bit new to me and I have just been using EasyNews the past 4 years manually and I now see with this arrstack that I will hit my limit in no time. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SelectAerie1126\"> /u/SelectAerie1126 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1m060xx/easynews_question/\">[link]</",
