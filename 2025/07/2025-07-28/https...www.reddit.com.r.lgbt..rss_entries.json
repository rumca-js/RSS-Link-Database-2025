Still, i made it pretty clear i had no intrest in dating boys.</p> <p>Until now, my father always used masculine (not a lot but sometimes) or mostly neutral gender pronouns to ask or talk about who i like or am dating. But the other day when he saw me texting and smiling at my phone he asked me who i was texting and who was this GIRL that was making me like this. And if i liked any GIRL right now. GIRL!!!!</p> <p>He said GIRL!!!!!!! I know this sounds stupid but this means the world to me. Like it made me feel so so so accepted. He used it so naturally like he didn&#39;t even esitate or be weird about it or talk about my sexuality. Just a dad teasing their teen daughter like any dad would do. </p> <p>I actually cried a little after even tho this is something so stupid it never happened before and i never tought it could, at least not this soon. I am just so so so happyyyyyy</p",
