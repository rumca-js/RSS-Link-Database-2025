I also have some front-end experience mostly using Django template but I&#39;m currently learning Angular to broaden my skill set.</p> <p>I left my last job and am now trying to switch careers into web development full-time. Despite all the work I&#39;ve done and the skills I&#39;ve built, I&#39;m finding it extremely difficult to even get interviews, let alone land a job.</p> <p>If anyone has advice on how to break through, improve my job search, or better present my experience, I&#39;d really appreciate it. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Solid-G",
