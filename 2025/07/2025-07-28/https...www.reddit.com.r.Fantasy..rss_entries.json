The novel follows the \u201cAlbertian Order of Leibowitz,\u201d a monastic order devoted to preserving remnants of pre-apocalypse knowledge.

Yet they persist, faithfully preserving them for a future in which humanity may be ready to understand and learn from the past.</p> <p>Spanning centuries, the novel is structured in three parts, each separated by several hundred years. Each section focuses on key moments in the monastery\u2019s history, offering snapshots of civilization\u2019s slow, painful climb out of the ashes and raising the question of whether it can truly rise at all.</p> <p>Miller\u2019s tone is humorous, ",

I just think he has potential stories he can keep writing. Plus I want to see Turin again as whoever earning another feather. His name could be something silly like Bandersnatch or Bigfoot.
