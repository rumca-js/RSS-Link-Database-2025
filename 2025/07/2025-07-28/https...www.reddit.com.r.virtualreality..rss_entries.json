I was trying not to chalk it up to pc gamer mentality. For instance, I am perfectly fine playing flat games at like 40-45 fps and see absolutely nothing wrong with the smoothness.</p> <p>But with some of the vr reasoning I thought maybe it does need to be higher. But recently I&#39;ve seen a video from the creator of the satisfactory vr mod saying the game was created on a 2080 and he now plays on a 3080 with 45 fps. The video looks great which means it&#39;s better in the actual headset. I&#39;ve seen other posts as well about people being happy with around 45fps in vr.</p> <p>So apparently (can&#39;t personally confirm because I won&#39;t be home for another month to get my system) this vr fps talk is apparently the same as flat fps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SlowD",
