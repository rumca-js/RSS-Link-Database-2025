Even though it&#39;s been incredibly hot outside and still is the midst of summer, I&#39;m getting increasingly excited for fall and Halloween each day. With that, I am reaching out for book ideas to read during late-August through November to enhance the feeling of my favorite season and holiday :-).</p> <p>To explain what I am looking for, I want to preface the type of fall/Halloween vibe I typically enjoy. I love Halloween, but not so much the horrifying, slasher, true horror, side of Halloween. Instead, I prefer Halloween media that leans into the general aesthetic of fall, a moreso cozy Halloween that might have ghouls or monsters, but is more &quot;spooky&quot; than scary. Think something like the show &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;, and less like Stephen King&#39;s &quot;IT&quot;. </p> <p>I&#39;d also love to hear about more general cozy fall books that might take place during the season of fall, but doesn&#39;t necessarily revolve around",

I&#39;ve been having a really difficult year after my husband&#39;s passing and finally feel like I can pick up a book again.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something lighthearted and humorous. I need to avoid these triggers: major romance, soul mate stuff, afterlife, death, illness, gore, violence, suicide, drug use.</p> <p>I&#39;m not big into fantasy and can&#39;t do horror anymore. I&#39;m pretty open to anything else. The last things I enjoyed reading were The Southern Reach trilogy by Jeff Vandermeer and The Mountain in the Sea by Ray Nayler.</p> <p>TIA!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hbartifacts\"> /u/hbartifacts </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mbqt4t/im_fragile_need_something_light_and_funny/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mbqt4t/im_fragile_need_something_light_and_funny/\">[com",

I love reading for fun myself so I thought some middle grade books may be suitable for reading aloud to her? Recs for engaging stories and themes? Maybe if it has repetitive text, rhymes, and rhythmic language (good for babies as they aid language development and introduce concepts in a fun way?)Or would just appreciate your middle grades recs in general, thanks!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sallyloretta\"> /u/sallyloretta </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mb1o1a/middle_grade_book_recommendations_to_read_aloud/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1mb1o1a/middle_grade_book_recommendations_to_read_aloud/\">[comments]</a></span>",
