        "description": "The gas giant TOI-2109b, over five times Jupiter\u2019s mass, is spiraling closer to its star in a rare planetary death spiral. With a 16-hour orbit and blistering heat, the exoplanet could either plunge into its host star, be torn apart by tidal forces, or evolve into a rocky super-Earth through photoevaporation. NASA\u2019s TESS and ESA\u2019s Cheops data confirm its orbit is decaying by 10 seconds every 3 years. TOI-2109b\u2019s extreme case offers astronomers a powerful chance to study how gas giants die\u2014or transform\u2014revealing secrets of planetary evolution across the galaxy.",

According to a report, the OEM Unlocking setting is nowhere to be found in the One UI 8 stable build. This option enables Samsung users to flash and run custom ROMs on their Galaxy devices.",

There are enough personalisation options for consumers on the companion app. The design is lightweight, and the TWS offers thumping bass for those who love it. The design is a mixed bag and might or might not be liked by everyone.",
