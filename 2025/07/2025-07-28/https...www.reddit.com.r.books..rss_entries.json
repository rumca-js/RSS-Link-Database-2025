It is a work of domestic fiction and is centered around a family living in the town of a fictional town called Ayemenem in Kerela, India. The narrative follows a non linear structure as the chapters alternate between past and present.<br/> Now i must say. The novel is really beautifully written. The prose is dense and descriptive but also very evocative and luscious, detailing every small things just like the theme of this novel which is that every small things contributes to history in a major way and a even a small incident can have lasting consequences in a person&#39;s life.<br/> The novel depicts issues that plague india like caste system, colonialism and love laws which dictates who should be loved and how much.
