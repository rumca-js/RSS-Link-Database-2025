Modern mini PCs are pretty darn good, not just gaming-ready but also budget-friendly\u2014like this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPGDSM92/\">GMKtec K11 mini PC that\u2019s down to just $600</a> with a 25% discount on its usual $800. That might seem like a lot for a mini PC, but not once you see what you\u2019re getting inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This GMKtec K11 comes with an AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS CPU under the hood with an impressive 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a 1TB PCIe 4.0 SSD, plus it\u2019s easy to upgrade for more power, supporting up to 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage. That Ryzen 9 also has built-in Radeon 780M integrated graphics, which is about as good as it gets without a dedicated GPU\u2014which you can certainly add via the OCuLink port. Hook up a modern external GPU for a low-lag, high-performance",

But there is one aspect of putting together a new computer that even I don\u2019t enjoy: the front panel I/O connectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front panel is a bizarre array of USB headers, audio connectors, and push-button pins that are so fiddly and complicated, and often the cables only seem to <em>just</em> reach the motherboard spots where they need to go, so plugging them in can be a challenge. Plus, the connectors you need to plug in can vary depending on your PC case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike RAM and graphics cards, front panel I/O connections aren\u2019t so straightforward. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the different I/O connectors you\u2019re likely to see and what they all mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-l",
