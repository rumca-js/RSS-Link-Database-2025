The only issue is, of course, with the Samsung Frame, you&#39;re locked into their firmware. Also, you need the paid subscription to access &quot;their&quot; library of art to display. I&#39;ve read that you can technically use the art mode without subscribing, but it apparently looks considerably worse (and ruins the matte &quot;framed art&quot; illusion). I know that there are other matte TVs on the market like the TCL Nxtvision and the Hisense CanvasTV, but from what I&#39;ve read (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong), they have similar issues with locking you into their proprietary firmware and requiring a permanent subscription for the basic functionality. I&#39;ve thought of a few potential workarounds, but I&#39;m wonder",
