        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>The Linux kernel provides the ability for cryptographically signing kernel modules during their installation. Thus, when they are being loaded the signature is validated. By doing so we increase the kernel security due to the fact that unsigned kernel modules\\signed modules with an invalid key(s) are blocked from loading. We can leverage different hashing algorithms as part of the signing process like: SHA-1,SH-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512. Also, the public key for singing is handled using X.509 ITU-T standard certificates (<a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/admin-guide/module-signing.html\">https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/admin-guide/module-signing.html</a>).
