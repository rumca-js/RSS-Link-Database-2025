        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, videos have gone viral of violent mobs attacking random people in Cincinnati over the weekend. The corporate media has put a complete black out on the story. Can you guess why? Also, Donald Trump moves to make insane asylums great again. And the women-only gossip and doxing app called Tea was hacked and doxxed. Is this a legitimate case of eye for an eye? Plus a woman on TikTok says she\u2019s considering divorcing her husband even though he\u2019s perfect and does nothing wrong. I have some advice for her, and for all the young single men worried about ending up with someone like her.\n\nTIMESTAMPS\n\n00:00 - 00:31 Opening\n02:05 - 28:28 Violent Black Mobs Beat Up White People In Cincinnati.
