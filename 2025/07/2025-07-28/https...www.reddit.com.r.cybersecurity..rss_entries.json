As an ~13 year intelligence analyst by trade, I am often fighting with modern Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs) to examine and track cyber threats. The work get&#39;s done, but it takes time. Imagine if you had a database that was focused on relationships and you used GenAI to query the database (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and get back highly detailed and accurate responses with no hallucinations immediately. Not only that but the LLM can look what it is in the data set and tell you what is not in the data (i.e. known unknowns). I have a whole blog post about it, but it started getting some traction yesterday on my LinkedIn so I thought I would post it here. Also, my blog is focused on threat intelligence, but knowledge graphs can be used with any dataset, so long as your use case is to understand the relatio",
