At least, not in cinemas. However, for the first time in Bond history, the world will meet a new James Bond in a video game, before a new 007 makes their debut on film.</p><p>As developed by Danish studio IO Interactive for next year\u2019s 007 First Light, the new Bond is blandly handsome in a doll-like way. He is fresh-faced, with blue eyes that appear more cocksure than piercing, in contrast to the refined older Bond of most films or Craig\u2019s ruggedness \u2013 although he is clearly inspired by Craig\u2019s man-of-action approach.

Not for my coffee habit, at least, which slides from the steely resolve to drink just two cups a day, to a wobbly-willed four, five mugs, or more. I\u2019m better at giving it up altogether.

I love its mood-transforming uplift. It revs me up and calms me down. I once gave it up for two months \u2013 my longest abstention \u2013 hoping to shake off a virulent bout of insomnia, and it seemed as if I had entered the wilderness.
