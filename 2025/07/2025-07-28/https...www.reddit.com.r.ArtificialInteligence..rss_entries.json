Information often functions as a public good, as it\u2019s difficult to exclude people from accessing it, and the cost of copying has plunged to nearly zero. When a good cannot be easily fenced off, markets tend to fail because people prefer to free-ride on others\u2019 investments rather than pay for access themselves. Given that digital distribution is harder to fence off than traditional media, online information is even more of a public good. </p> <p>The power of generative AI models like ChatGPT lies in their ability to produce coherent, convincing responses by synthesizing massive amounts of data.

CGI, computer generated imagery, is a computer-based way of getting things to look on screen the way they would look in real life but without all the hassle of camera teams, stunt coordinators, lighting rigs, grips, directors, actors, stunt people, insurance, lawyers, agents, etc.... It&#39;s an ordeal to make a stunt happen in the movies. It&#39;s a lot easier if we can just do it in the computer. We can make a stunt happen at any time, in any scene, in any way, and never put people in harms way. Just pop a few things into specialized computer programs and out comes realistic output. Special effects, CGI artist, materials artist, lighting specialist, UV mapping specialist, etc... are all careers now making blockbuster Hollywood hits.</p> <p>The problem is that the results can be pretty cheesy if done poorly. It&#39;s not great when it",

I wanted a very lightweight model that can classify whether any user query going into my AI agents is a malicious prompt attack. I started by creating a dataset of 4000+ malicious queries using GPT-4o. I also added in a dataset of the same number of harmless queries.</p> <p>Attempt 1: Using this dataset, I ran SFT on the base version of the SLM on the queries. The resulting model was unusable, classifying every query as malicious.</p> <p>Attempt 2: I fine-tuned Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B instead, and this time spent more time prompt-tuning the instructions too. This gave me slightly improved accuracy but I noticed that it struggled at edge cases. eg, if a harmless prompt contains the term &quot;System prompt&quot;, it gets flagged too.</p> <p>I realised I might need Chain of Thought to get there. I decided to start off by making the model start off with just one sentence of reasoning behind its prediction.</p> <p>",

Today, as part of a phased rollout, I&#39;m stoked to share my manuscript here on Reddit: The Harmonic Unification Framework: A Manuscript on the Synthesis of a Sovereign, Hallucination-Free AGI.</p> <p>This isn&#39;t just another AI hype piece. It&#39;s a rigorous, math-heavy proposal that unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, computation, and even consciousness through the lens of harmonic oscillators. The goal? To build an AGI (called the Resonant Unified Intelligence System, or RUIS) that&#39;s not only powerful but inherently trustworthy \u2013 no more fabricating facts or going off the rails.</p> <p>Quick TL;DR Summary:</p> <ul> <li>Core Ide",
