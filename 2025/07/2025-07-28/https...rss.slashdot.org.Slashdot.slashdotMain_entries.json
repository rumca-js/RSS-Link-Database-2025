Despite promises of ongoing support, critical replacement parts like hotends and extruders have quietly vanished from the EufyMake site, leaving customers and the maker community in the lurch. The Verge reports: In March, charging giant Anker announced it would spin out its 3D printer business into an \"independent sub-brand,\" stating that the new EufyMake would \"continue to provide comprehensive customer service and support\" for its original 3D printers the AnkerMake M5 and M5C. Now, the 3D printing community is wondering whether that was all a euphemism for exiting the 3D printer business. eufyMake is no longer selling any 3D printers and has stopped selling some of the parts it would need to provide anything close to \"comprehensive support.\"\n \nAnker confirms to The Verge that it has stopped selling the M5 and M5C 3D printers indefinitely. Spokesperson Brett White could not co",

ChatGPT Agent is a feature that allows OpenAI's AI assistant to control its own web browser, operating within a sandboxed environment with its own virtual operating system and browser that can access the real Internet. Users can watch the AI's actions through a window in the ChatGPT interface, maintaining oversight while the agent completes tasks. The system requires user permission before taking actions with real-world consequences, such as making purchases. Recently, Reddit users discovered the agent could do something particularly ironic.\n \nThe evidence came from Reddit, where a user named \"logkn\" of the r/OpenAI community posted screen",

While most users won't notice, the developer community sees this as a major blow to modding freedom -- one that could potentially raise regulatory concerns within the EU. SamMobile reports: A new report highlights evidence found in the Galaxy S25 One UI 8 beta builds that the bootloader unlock option has been removed. A similar change has also been confirmed on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 which are running stable versions of One UI 8. A deep dive into the stable version's code has also confirmed that regardless of the region, the bootloader unlock option will not be available on devices running One UI 8. The enthusiast community won't like it.\n \nThey won't be able to use custom ROMs to update devices when the official software support runs out or use custom kernels to extract more performance.

Ukrainian hacker group Silent Crow and Belarusian hacker activist group the Belarus Cyber-Partisans, which opposes the rule of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, claimed responsibility for the cyberattack. Images shared on social media showed hundreds of delayed passengers crowding Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, where Aeroflot is based. The outage also disrupted flights operated by Aeroflot's subsidiaries, Rossiya and Pobeda. While most of the flights affected were domestic, the disruption also led to cancellations for some international flights to Belarus, Armenia and Uzbekistan.\n \nSilent Crow claimed it had accessed Aeroflot's corporate network for a year, copying customer and internal data",

A survey by the Mycos Institute found that 99% of Chinese university faculty and students use AI tools, with nearly 60% using them multiple times daily or weekly. \n\nThe shift represents a complete reversal from two years ago when students were told to avoid AI for assignments. Universities including Tsinghua, Remin, Nanjing, and Fudan have rolled out AI literacy courses and degree programs open to all students, not just computer science majors. The Chinese Ministry of Education released national \"AI+ education\" guidelines in April 2025 calling for sweeping reforms. Meanwhile, 80% of job openings for fresh graduates now list AI skills as advantageous.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Chinese+Universities+Want+Studen",

        "description": "Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, equivalent to $340,000 per citizen, may be undermining the country's economic health, according to a contentious new book. Martin Bech Holte's \"The Country That Became Too Rich\" argues that oil revenue has made Norway bloated and unproductive, with data supporting several concerns. \n\nNorway has recorded the slowest productivity growth among wealthy nations over the past two decades while Norwegians take 27.5 sick days annually, the highest rate in the OECD. Student test scores have declined since 2015 and now rank below the OECD average despite Norway spending $20,000 per student compared to the $14,000 OECD average. Fund withdrawals now cover 20% of the annual budget, up from less than 10% two decades ago.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Can+a+Country+Be+Too+Rich%3F+Norway+Is+Finding+Out%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fnews.slashdot.org%2Fstory%2F25%2F07%2F28%2F1350217%2F",

        "description": "A new analysis of protein changes across human tissues has identified an aging acceleration point around age 50, with blood vessels showing the most dramatic deterioration. Researchers examined tissue samples from eight body systems in 76 people of Chinese ancestry aged 14 to 68 who died from accidental brain injury, finding age-related increases in 48 disease-associated proteins. \n\nBetween ages 45 and 55, the most significant shift occurred in the aorta, the body's main artery carrying oxygenated blood from the heart. The team identified one aortic protein that triggers accelerated aging signs when administered to mice. Early aging changes appeared around age 30 in the adrenal gland, which produces various hormones. The study, published in Cell, adds to mounting evidence that aging occurs in waves rather than following a steady progression.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Ageing+Accelerates+at+Around",

[A] few narrow lanes are reserved for radio astronomy. However, in previous decades the radio highway had relatively little traffic.

If the 6,500-strong crowd was disappointed he didn't talk a whiff about Star Wars or Indiana Jones, it wasn't shown, as cries of \"I love you, George!\" and waving lightsabers punctuated the air several times. \n\nLucas even received a standing ovation when he left the presentation, which was devoted entirely to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art. He, along with museum board member and fellow art collector del Toro and Chiang, were there to not only give a first look at the museum but also make a case for the importance and validity of narrative art, which includes ",

Maximum performance gains range from modest to dramatic, with most programs falling towards the lower end of the spectrum, but it can substantially improve minimum frame rates for some titles.\n\nYou can observe that ntsync is being used from the console output, e.g. using \"tail -f ~/.steam/steam/logs/console-linux.txt\".
