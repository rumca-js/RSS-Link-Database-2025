        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi! Ive been trying to figure out how to extract assets from Pink Panther Pinkadelic Pursuit. it was from a french studio, and no method seems to give me good results. I want to extract assets so I can remake the game in UE5. I have basically no technical knowledge, but Ive used ninjaripper with nfs mw 2005 before, with this game however, ripped files don&#39;t seem to work properly and show nothing when imported to blender. Im really lost, it would help a lot to work off of assets instead of starting from scratch. since I know nothing, I cant imagine what info id need to give you, so ask away</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rezuumy\"> /u/Rezuumy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1mbu4t1/pink_panther_asset_extraction/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1mbu4t1/pink_panther_asset_extraction/\">[comments]</a></span>",
