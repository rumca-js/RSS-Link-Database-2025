I tried my best to enjoy my time in the Shire, but these joy killing bugs and performance issues stopped me in my tracks. With life sim mechanics that are shallow as they come, terrible technical performance, and almost nothing original to say, Tales of the Shire disappoints every step of the way. There\u2019s hints of a better game to be found in its slightly more robust cooking mechanics, as well as the occasionally amusing writing and dialogue that prove this setting was indeed ripe for a life sim if executed better \u2013 but like a Silmaril, those dreams have vanished deep in the depths of Angband.",

        "description": "Due to decades of popularity, there\u2019s always going to be new challengers stepping up to try and take the mantle of best survival horror game. Most fail, but when Bloober Team \u2013 fresh off the overwhelming success of their Silent Hill 2 remake \u2013 steps up with an original effort, you take notice.\n\nThat\u2019s why I was eager to try out Cronos: The New Dawn. But does this rusty sci-fi, set in a futuristic Eastern European dystopia, have what it takes to make its own mark, or does it just merge into the pack? After playing the first two hours, the signs are there that Bloober Team could have a new survival horror hit on its hands, even if I do have some slight reservations.\n\n#IGN #CronosTheNewDawn #SilentHill2Remake",
