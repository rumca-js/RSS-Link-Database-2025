        "description": "That 70's Show is without a doubt one of the best sitcoms from the early aughts.  All though the final season may be seen as the worst collection of episodes throughout the shows run, this singular episode of That 70's Show is worse than anything in the 8th season.  Even for marking the achievement of their 100th episode, this storyline fell flat in more ways that one.  But what exactly made this the worst episode of That 70's Show ever to be produced?\n\n#that70sshow #that90sshow #ashtonkutcher #musical",
