This surprising finding, led by POSTECH and Max Planck physicists, redefines our understanding of quantum tunneling\u2014a process that powers everything from the sun to your smartphone.",

This reversal, demonstrated using platinum and palladium exposed to hydrogen gas, could mean chemists have misunderstood a fundamental step for decades. The discovery opens the door to fresh opportunities in industrial chemistry and pollution control, especially through new reaction designs using electron-deficient metals.",
