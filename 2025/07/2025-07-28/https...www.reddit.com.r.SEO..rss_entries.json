Some of these events are more volunteer orientation/&quot;how-to&quot; focused, and some are not.

A couple of months ago, I built this website, which gives you the possibility to view Instagram stories without an Instagram account (spybroski com). So far, these are my last 30 days&#39; results around 4k pageviews from tier 1 countries. I built it because I wanted to dive deeper into SEO and somehow experience my SEO skills (which I gained from tutorials) in real life. I have a legitimate question: is there a possibility that this kind of website (not with current traffic) but in the future can be monetized with AdSense? What suggestions would you have for me? Any hint will be appreciated.
