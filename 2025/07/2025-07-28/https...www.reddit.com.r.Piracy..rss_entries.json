That&#39;s rich. That&#39;s some grade-A, unadulterated bullshit right there. Let&#39;s cut the crap. You&#39;re trying to scare everyone into thinking that every dude streaming a football match on some dodgy site is secretly running an international drug cartel. Give me a fucking break. You&#39;re just trying to justify jacking up prices even more and strong-arming VPNs and ISPs into becoming your personal content cops. You talk about the &quot;sporting ecosystem&quot; failing? How about the &quot;consumer ecosystem&q",

Since there is no PC app, I realized it&#39;s impossible to watch in higher quality on a PC. I suppose, for DRM purposes, you can&#39;t watch in higher quality in the browser. However, there is no such information when signing up from the browser. It says &quot;4K UHD&quot; in big letters. I was going to watch Duster, so I did what?
