I got a 10 bay PC case and some components for super cheap, and that will be the main storage machine once I finish building it. It will be 10 3TB drives in raid 6 to start and I\u2019m using HexOS. I think I have that all figured out, but backing up the NAS data is what I\u2019m wondering about. </p> <p>For now I really only have the ability to do one local backup with an optiplex 5040MT that I already have. The NAS will have a capacity of 24TB to start. I\u2019m thinking of getting two 24TB drives for the optiplex to keep mirrored as the backup target. Is this a logical thing to do? </p> <p>For context: My current storage needs are roughly 12TB between all the random drives I\u2019ve accrued over the years. I\u2019m hopping to centralize everything and have double the capacity of what I have now so I don\u2019t have to think about it for a while. </p> <p>I\u2019m open to any and all suggest",

I recently transfered the data from my daughter&#39;s laptop (Where she had run out of space due to hoarding every bit of CC she could get her hands on for The Sims 3 and 4) by using windows&#39; built in backup software. I created a disc image of the data, no problem... except because of the way the drive is formatted, it will not let me expand her 500gb &quot;C&quot; drive to the full 1 TB. Even though there&#39;s a ton of unallocated space on the drive. here&#39;s like system information drive, and then there&#39;s some other recovery partition between her &quot;C&quot; drive partition and the empty space. What do I need to do in order to access that space and expand her drive? Will deleting that recovery partition (idk how) do the trick?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mershaltec\"> /u/mershaltec </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1",

Anytime i need to move data from one drive to another or data from a hard drive to an sd card i just open up my windows file explorer and select the files i want to transfer over click copy and then just wait till it all goes through.. Should i be looking into other software? Is windows not recommended to do data copy?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ballin_Like_Curry\"> /u/Ballin_Like_Curry </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1mb4o8b/copying_files/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1mb4o8b/copying_files/\">[comments]</a></span>",
