Then the sims came out with a patch update so I updated my game and went to update my cracked game on sims 4 updater, then I got the critical error saying that it was down. I understand that it\u2019s just the updater that\u2019s down so I did some troubleshooting to fix the issue, like trying to manually install the enchanted by nature game and uninstall sims 4 updater and then reinstall it and I seen it worked for some but when I did it, nothing changed. Still got the critical error. So I was wondering maybe if I just delete anadius related files off my computer completely and then reinstall all the DLC manually, if that would work instead.

I\u2019ve been looking at a bunch of posts on Reddit and it seems like a lot of people are having a similar issue to me but I haven\u2019t really figured out how to fix it.</p> <p>Basically, I have the fitgirl repack version of sims 4, and recently I\u2019ve been wanting to play it but it just keeps closing after a couple minutes, sometimes even seconds after starting the game. There isn\u2019t an error message or anything, it just closes completely.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen some people say that it needs to be repaired but I don\u2019t have an official base game since I downloaded that, along with dlcs, in the repack.</p> <p>My friend is having the same issue too and we\u2019re just really stuck on what to do. Not sure if it has anything to do with the updater going down either since I haven\u2019t updated it in months.</p> <p>If anyone\u2019s figured out the problem and how to fix it I\u2019d really appreciate some help!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",
