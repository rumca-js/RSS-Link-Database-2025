I have a basic understanding of Linux, but I\u2019m not sure how to properly start my journey.</p> <p>My ultimate goal is to pursue a career as either a cybersecurity analyst or a penetration tester. I\u2019m currently studying IT at university, but unfortunately, they don\u2019t offer dedicated cybersecurity courses.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to start learning cybersecurity on my own, preferably with free resources (if possible), to build a strong foundation before moving on to more advanced topics.I am using Kali because it has more communities to reach out to. </p> <p>What would you recommend as the best starting point for someone like me?</p> <p>Are there any free courses, websites, or labs that you suggest?</p> <p>How would you structure a learning path for a beginner?</p> <p>Any advice, roadmaps, or resources would be incredibly helpful.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!--",
