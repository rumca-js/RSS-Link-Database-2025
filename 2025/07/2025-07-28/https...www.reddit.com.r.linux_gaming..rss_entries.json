The issue is, nowdays, I mostly play small indie games, and old games from the 2000s, and most of them don&#39;t even have Mac versions, let alone Linux. So I wanna check, is there some sort of emulator or cross OS software you can use to run these games in Linux?</p> <p>Edit: Okay, appearantly I didn&#39;t know about Wine, nor that is has been baked into Steam.

This is an almost completely fresh install, the setup was done offline and the only significant changes I&#39;ve made are adding the sources and updating my system, and installing network and graphics drivers.</p> <p>I&#39;m completely unable to use proton. Native games will launch, but any game using proton won&#39;t. My old game drives are NTFS however every game I&#39;ve tried I moved to my main drive. Following tips on protondb or using GE proton doesn&#39;t change anything. I&#39;ve tried Overwatch 2, which doesn&#39;t launch at all, HL2 running on proton is the same situation, and Ultrakill which I completely reinstalled, this game manages to show the Unity preloader but closes soon after without launching the game. This happens on both X and Wayland.</p> <p>Sysinfo: <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/7yNpveaY\">https://pastebin.com/7yNpveaY</a></p> ",
