First time poster in this sub so please go easy on me!</p> <p>I have been self hosting services for a very very long time... my first &quot;Self-hosted&quot; application was SharePoint 2010. I have slowly been extracting myself from Microsoft stuff and have embraced FOSS. To get some of my services out of my network I started searching around and discovered NGINX Proxy Manager; and it has been great so far.</p> <p>Recently while searching around about reverse proxy info I discovered Traefik and saw that you could just add labels to your docker containers to configure the reverse proxy and I was floored. It&#39;s so easy to setup and add containers to the config and I don&#39;t have to go through all my nginx entries and try to remember which ones are still active.</p> <p>I still had to use NPM to get services externally as my traefik instance is on my docker server and serves those containers internally, so any external requests come in ",

TL;DR Simplecontainer is a container orchestrator that currently works only with Docker, allowing declarative deployment of Docker containers on local or remote machines with many other features like GitOps, etc.</p> <p>In the meantime, I have changed approach and created a full setup that can be self-hosted with open-sourced code on GitHub. The dashboard is now also free to use. Dashboard is the UI for container management via Simplecontainer. I think it can benefit selfhosted management.</p> <p>I have made improvements on the orchestrator engine and also improved the dashboard.</p> <p>In the article below, I am explaining the deployment of the setup of the following: Authentik, Postgres, Redis, Traefik, Simplecontainer, Dashboard, and Proxy manager.

The problem I don&#39;t quite see how to do &quot;best&quot; is how to deal with the reverse-proxy.

So I set up Tailscale so at least I can access my stuff, and it&#39;s been really cool, but it still doesn&#39;t let me publish anything.</p> <p>To get around my ISP, what if I rent a small and cheap AWS EC2 instance as a reverse proxy server, add it to my Tailnet, and then port forward from the EC2 instance to my server?
