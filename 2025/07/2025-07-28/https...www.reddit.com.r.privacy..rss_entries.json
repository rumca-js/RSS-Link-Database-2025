The problem is, until now, I&#39;ve been using tracked devices, ans now I&#39;m planning to register, download and install more lrivate software onto these. My question is, is there a risk of the stuff tracking me to link my big tracked profile to all the private stuff I&#39;m about to install. For example, if something tracks my IP, and I use that IP to register a Protonmail adress, can they know it&#39;s my Protonmail adress by seeing the IP I used to register?</p> <p>If so, what precussions amd steps do you recomment preventing my provate stuff getting into my big bad obnline profile the trackers create? I&#39;m not trying to get away from the dang Pegasus or anything, just the basic stuff: google, microsoft, android, samsung, ASUS and the rest.</p> <p>Basically my question is: how mich do these trackers see outside of their territory?

The AI only operates on my google search, and I don&#39;t seem to have the app installed. However, I am seeing videos and comments from people saying how Gemini is requiring login information from people, which could possibly just be an account theft attempt from something else. But, I am still concerned. Gemini has only sent an email to one of my emails, and has it&#39;s own setting section.</p> <p>When should I be worried about Gemini? What does it have access to and how do I know if it stores private data outside my google search? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MilkyDilkySilky\"> /u/MilkyDilkySilky </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1mbaxri/gemini_ai_steals_information/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1mbaxri/gemini_ai_st",
