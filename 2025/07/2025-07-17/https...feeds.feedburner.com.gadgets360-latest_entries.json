Only 8 million years old and orbiting a red dwarf, this Jupiter-sized planet is losing gas at a rate equal to Earth\u2019s entire atmosphere every 200 years. Astronomers believe the planet may eventually shrink into a barren rocky core. The discovery offers a rare, real-time glimpse into atmospheric erosion and shows how intense radiation from young stars plays a key role in shaping the long-term fate of planetary systems.",
