However, outside of the exhilarating playable cameo from ED-209, there\u2019s really not enough new here to make another 10 hours as everyone\u2019s favourite baby food-slurping supercop worth going out of your way for. Peter Weller\u2019s deadpan delivery is as endearing as ever, and the cryo gun is an icy blast (though ironically still not quite as cool to use as the Auto 9), but the supporting cast of characters is seriously shoddy and the raft of performance issues on PlayStation 5 make for a bumpier ride than accelerating up the exit ramp from the Metro West carpark. If you thirst for some more Auto 9 bursts flourished with TJ Lazer-inspired twirls then RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business ",
