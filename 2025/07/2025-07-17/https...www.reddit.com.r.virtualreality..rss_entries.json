(i know i need a T6 Torx driver) but how difficult is it to do? can i reattach them if i do change my mind? and how difficult would it be to go back if i wanted to?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kat_Schrodinger1\"> /u/Kat_Schrodinger1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1m2ncwo/questions_on_removing_the_speaker_arms_on_valve/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1m2ncwo/questions_on_removing_the_speaker_arms_on_valve/\">[comments]<",

I am nearsighted and have little astigmat so i tried using glasses kinda looks better but still not satisfied.

Beat Saber, Half-Life Alyx, all the shooting and action games. But what about those chill, relaxing experiences that you can just sink into for hours? The kind of games that don&#39;t stress you out but still keep you engaged?</p> <p>Think about the potential here. Imagine being inside a Stardew Valley-style farm, physically planting crops and caring for animals. Or solving puzzles in a beautiful, peaceful environment where you can actually reach out and manipulate objects with your hands. The presence VR provides would make these experiences incredibly immersive without being overwhelming.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been playing games like Ocean Keeper lately - it&#39;s got this methodical, almost meditative quality to its underwater mining gameplay.
