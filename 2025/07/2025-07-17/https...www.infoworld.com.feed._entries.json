Each new project started with a database schema. The DBAs or whoever was in charge of Oracle would have a long discussion and many meetings, and then you, the developer, would be \u201cblessed\u201d with a schema. The schema was usually a bit wrong and inefficient, and didn\u2019t match what you were doing, so you wrote inefficient queries to work around it until you got yelled at and everyone agreed to fix things. This changed with object-relational mapping tools like Hibernate in Java and Entity Framework in .NET.
