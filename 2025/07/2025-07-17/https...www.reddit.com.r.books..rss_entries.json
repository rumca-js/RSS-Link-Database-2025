Every other story has a physical tie-in along the way to lead you to the next story (the journal, the letters, etc) but that one begins with the tie-in already established. It expands on it later when Zachary talks with Meronym and through the hologram egg thing, but the worship of Sonmi is there from the start. Am I supposed to infer that the trial of Sonmi became legend and the result was this island tribe believing she is a god based on the scraps of that legend? </p> <p>I did a search on the web and I&#39;m not finding an answer. As I said, I may have missed something since it&#39;s a bit of a tough read.

Sure, it didn&#39;t really live up to what it promised with the Wallfacers and such, but it was a really fun and wild read. It was also a very finished story, making me doubt that Death&#39;s End was planned before the release of The Dark Forest.</p> <p>I&#39;m really dissapointed with Death&#39;s End though. It somehow drags out the plot to fill pahes and rushes the story at the same time. I knew it would be a collection of crazy ideas by Liu loosely connected by plot, but it was more frustrating than i thought.</p> <p>The constant weird twists that increase in frequency as the book goes on makes some really fucked up and well made Cosmic Horror possible, but it&#39;s so exhausting to read 400 pages of &quot;Things are going well .. but!&quot;.</p> <p>The ending is a very sweet concept, all the civilisations den",
