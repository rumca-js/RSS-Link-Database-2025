        "description": "SharkBite ball valve installation tips\u2026I deburr the inside and outside of the copper pipe. Then I shop vac the inside, mark the depth and push the SharkBite Max valve to that indicator. Note, the valve can rotate 360 degrees after installation and no tube liner is needed for PEX A or PEX B. I also deburr and mark the depth on my PEX A to ensure a tight fit. Many thanks to SharkBite for sponsoring this video and making great plumbing supplies \ud83d\udd25#plumbing #sharkbiteplumbing #bathroomremodel #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
