My favorite author is Cormac McCarthy, followed closely by Vonnegut, which is about as close to sci-fi as my taste gets. I also like Steinbeck, Ralph Ellison, Frank McCourt, Larry McMurty, Alex Haley, Flannery O\u2019Connor, and Donna Tartt (she\u2019s contemporary yes, but who knows when her next book will come out)</p> <p>For contemporary books, I read Running The Light by Sam Tallent which I loved and highly recommend, it\u2019s a pretty quick read. The Orphan Master\u2019s Son was great, too, I\u2019d never read a fiction book about North Korea before. I recently read Tree Of Smoke by Denis Johnson and while the story fell flat for me, I really liked his writing style and there were moments in the book that stuck with me.

I&#39;d love something that plays in some idyllic small town somewhere near the mountains, like in the Rockies or something like that. It may but doesn&#39;t have to dive a bit into the nature and surroundings of said town. I&#39;d rather have something not particularly Romance, for I am a boy (or man), who isn&#39;t really into such books. But it may touch a bit into the mystery genre or contain some kind of crime solving or whatever. I think, to describe the exact vibe, the video games &quot;Life is Strange&quot;, especially &quot;True Colors&quot; fit it perfectly (I&#39;ve read Catcher in the Rye - I know, this is recommended a lot when talking LiS-like)<br/> It can be anything from a teens book to adult crime.</p> <p>thank you guys in advance &lt;3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Orbi",

After everything i have experienced with people in the past few years I\u2019m scared to meet the same type of people. One example is that when i see one new person with the characteristic of someone who hurt me in the past i immediately start to hate them and distance myself but i dont think thats good cause one similar thing doesnt mean they will definitely hurt me the same way haha.
