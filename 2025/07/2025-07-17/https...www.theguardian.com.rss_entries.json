It had been all Sweden, England were down and out, headed for the Euros exit, their crown relinquished, but you can never bet against Wiegman in a major tournament and, although many were screaming for changes to come sooner, it was her late cavalry that delivered two goals in 102 seconds to level the score and forced the game beyond 90 minutes. England became the first team to come from two goals down in the knockout stages of the women\u2019s Euros since the tournament began in 1984 and Hampton was the superstar, emerging from Mary Earps\u2019 shadow, saving two spot-kicks with Sweden missing three others.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardia",
