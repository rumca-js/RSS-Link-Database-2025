However, the catch is that I want/need to configure it into a 1u setup for a 10&quot; rack.</p> <p>I&#39;ve figured out the rough layout, and have a working mockup... after having having spent a lot of time testing/trying out different pieces.. and it works (the pieces are more/less designed to work together); however, the form factor is just a little bit off and doesn&#39;t fit.</p> <p>So..
