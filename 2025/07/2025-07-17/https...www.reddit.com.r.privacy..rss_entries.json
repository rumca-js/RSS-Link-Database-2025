Now in Gmail I use rules for that that create same-named label and assign email to that label, so that I can easy switch to the emails sent to this alias from the folder panel. Is there any similar or even more polished UI for that in other mail providers? I want to get out of Google. I know about alias services like SimpleLogin, Addy.io, DDG that do aliasing by mail forwarding, but they do not have alias transparency I require, as they simply send it to third-party mailbox.
