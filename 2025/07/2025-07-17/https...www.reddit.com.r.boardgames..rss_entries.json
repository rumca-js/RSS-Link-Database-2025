I&#39;m interested in sleeving the cards for the games that I want to keep around for a long time and/or that see a lot of shuffling/movement with their cards. So far, I&#39;ve only sleeved my copy of 7 Wonders (2 ed.) w/ the Leaders &amp; Armada expansions using the Sleeve Kings 8811s, which are &quot;standard&quot; glossy, economic sleeves. I haven&#39;t gotten to play with them yet, but the primary thing I noticed immediately is just how slippery the cards became - they were sliding all over the place when I tried to stack them. Apparently this is normal and gets better with more use of the cards as you &quot;break in&quot; the sleeves?</p> <p>I&#39;m curious what you gamers would recommend - I&#39;m not a MTG/TCG guy or an intense collector/trader, so I don&#39;t want to get into double sleeving or sleeves with colored",

I watched a video of this a while ago and can no longer remember what it was or what theme it had. All I remember is watching a let&#39;s play video of a guy playing with his family where trick shotting meeples was a thing. I hope trick shot is the correct term, but it was things like after getting a certain card or roll of dice, you had to flick something at someone else&#39;s meeple to complete the task for points or something. I want to say it involved dinosaurs or eggs, but I can&#39;t find it when looking for boardgames involving these things. Does anyone know what I&#39;m talking about?</p> <p>Edit: It was \u201cDodos riding dinosaurs\u201d!

So, when I (26) was very small (3 or 4)I remember me and my sibling eating the hungry hippo marbles, but they tasted good, like candy. I remember we always ran out cause we would eat one upon winning. So I told my friends about this and they were very perplexed and said they were never edible.

I was typing out a post for the &quot;What did You Play&quot; stickied thread on Monday, figured this was long enough to be its own post. If anyone has any questions or comments about these games, I&#39;d love to see them.</p> <p><strong>Galactic Cruise</strong> (4p \u2013 1<sup>st</sup> Play) \u2013 Very solid. It seems like a standard worker placement game, but the mark of a good worker placement game is that players\u2019 actions feel impactful to other players. Galactic Cruise succeeds in this. Unfortunately, we only played about 90% of the game because two players had another game scheduled. Everyone still very much enjoyed the game. <strong>8/10</strong>, with potential to climb.</p> <p><strong>Guards of Atlantis II</strong> (6p \u2013 3<sup>rd</sup> Play) \u2013 I can see why this is popular. The game moves at a great clip, and it\u2019s",
