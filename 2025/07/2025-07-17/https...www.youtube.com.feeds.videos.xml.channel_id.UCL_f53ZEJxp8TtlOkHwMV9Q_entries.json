        "description": "Dr. Jordan B. Peterson interviews Stanford professor and prolific biotech entrepreneur Dr. Garry Nolan, covering the cutting-edge of cancer research and atomic-level imaging as well as his work with the U.S. government on anomalous health effects linked to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs). Nolan explains how his scientific curiosity\u2014and integrity\u2014led him from debunking the infamous Atacama \u201calien\u201d mummy to analyzing bizarre materials and biological effects tied to UAP encounters. Artificial intelligence, intuition, consciousness, and the blurry line between science fiction and scientific frontier, culminate in Nolan\u2019s provisional belief: \u201csomething non-human has been here a long time.\u201d\n\nThis episode was filmed on July 7th, 2025\n\nUnlock the ad-free experience of The Jordan B.
