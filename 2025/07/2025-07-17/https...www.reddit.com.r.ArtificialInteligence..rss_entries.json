We\u2019ve identified 4 different categories that help make up bias and are fine tuning a model and want to use it as a multi label classifier to label bias among those 4 categories. Then make the model accessible via a chrome extension. The idea is to use it when reading news articles to see what types of bias are present in what you\u2019re reading. Eventually we want to expand it to the writing side of things as well with a \u201cwriting mode\u201d where the same core model detects the biases in your text and then offers more neutral text to replace it. So kinda like grammarly but for bias. </p> <p>Again appreciat",

Google&#39;s threat intel team had a few scattered clues, but Big Sleep was the one that put it all together and flagged the exact issue. This is the first time (at least publicly) an AI has actively prevented an exploit like this, not just analyzing logs or suggesting fixes, but acting as an actual security layer.
