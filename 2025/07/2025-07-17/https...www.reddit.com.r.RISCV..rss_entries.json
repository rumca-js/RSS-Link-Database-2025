        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am fairly new to assembly coding, and although I have learned how the risc-v and other assembly languages work, I (from the lack of a formal education, learning on the internet) never really learned where and how people actually write assembly code. I really want to make my own simple OS, but every emulator I can find online is basically useless for any practical purpose, since all they do is simulate registers and memory without any inputs or outputs. Downloading emulators via the console also didn&#39;t work out. Please, can someone suggest a way I could code risc-v asm with inputs and outputs like keyboard, graphical display, importing and exporting files. I am on an 8-core intel macbook.</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/indemkom\"> /u/indemkom </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1m23jvo/please_help_find_input_ouput_riscv_emulator/\">[li",
