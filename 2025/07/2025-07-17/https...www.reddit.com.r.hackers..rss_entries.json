Saw a few people sharing cheese pizza, reported them , forgot about it, stumbled on it again recently... there&#39;s updates on the chat section with games like Tetris, tic tac toe, and connect 4... there&#39;s people who have a guest name &quot;want to play Tetris?&quot; AND There&#39;s people dick in hand, with a guest name &quot;here for the cp&quot;. </p> <p>How tf is that known as one of the top searches when you google &quot;chat roulette&quot; but there&#39;s nothing, literally nothing, about it being a pedo hotbed if you Google Beeg and child abuse.</p> <p>It&#39;s a fucked up place and it needs to be taken down sabotaged. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Empir3D",
