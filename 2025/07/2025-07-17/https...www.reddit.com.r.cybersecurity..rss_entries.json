If you\u2019ve ever wasted hours trying to identify common library functions manually, this is a solid shortcut.</p> <p>A lot of Windows binaries pull in statically linked libraries, which means you\u2019re left with a big mess of unnamed functions. No DLL imports, no symbols \u2014 just a pile of code blobs. If you know what library the code came from (say, some open source lib), you can build a Function ID database from it and then apply it to the stripped binary. The result: tons of auto-labeled functions that would\u2019ve otherwise taken forever to identify.</p> <p>What\u2019s nice is that this approach works fine on Windows, and I ended up putting togeth",
