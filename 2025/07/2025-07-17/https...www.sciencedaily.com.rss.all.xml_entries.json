In a groundbreaking study, citizen scientists taught their dogs to sniff out the pests\u2019 hard-to-spot egg masses with impressive accuracy. The initiative not only taps into the huge community of recreational scent-detection dog enthusiasts, but also opens a promising new front in protecting agriculture. And it doesn\u2019t stop there\u2014these canine teams are now sniffing out vineyard diseases too, hinting at a whole new future of four-legged fieldwork.",
