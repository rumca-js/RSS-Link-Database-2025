From all the reviews I&#39;ve read and watched it kind of sounds like that these books are more historical fiction in another world than &quot;fantasy&quot;. I know that there&#39;s this &quot;Silkpunk&quot; technology which apparently plays a central role in these books and that the God&#39;s of Dara are real. </p> <p>But I am still unsure, because I&#39;m not really a big fan of historical fiction but in a fictional world. For example; most of Guy Gavriel Kay&#39;s novels weren&#39;t really my thing, as well as the books I&#39;ve read by K. J. Parker. Not saying that these are bad authors, they aren&#39;t, but I&#39;m just not into &quot;Historical Fiction in a fantastic world but with nearly to no magic at all&quot;. If I read fantasy I want magic and monsters and gods etc.</p> <p>Maybe it would be important to add that I am not against historical",

So my goal here is to both expose people to great speculative fiction in comics, and point towards comic creators that are worth exploring further beyond.</p> <p>A couple of notes, I have created a kind of masterlist of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tCsfYaSrLfx3lZ-kU1gd000F-PZ7PLU-aJ1I-1MzWzM/edit?usp=sharing\">SFF comics</a>, which anyone should be able to access and view through the link.

It\u2019s a market that I managed to get in on the ground floor before the MCU managed to make it explode. There\u2019s a benefit to superhero novels that aren\u2019t often brought up and it\u2019s the fact that the stories can have a beginning, middle, and end in a way that larger named franchised ones don\u2019t. The rules of each supervillain world can also be dictated by the author as well, emphasizing or changing the rules so it may be a magical or technology-based world.</p> <p>Here are my favorite superhero novels that I\u2019ve enjoyed and things that have served as inspirations to my own work. I\u2019ve tried to keep a balance of traditional and indie published works.</p> <p><strong>10] The Case of the Claw by Keith R.A. DeCandido</strong></p> <p>Review: ",

Release Date is November 11, 2025.</p> <blockquote> <p>Fern has weathered the stillness and storms of a bookseller\u2019s life for decades, but now, in the face of crippling ennui, transplants herself to the city of Thune to hang out her shingle beside a long-absent friend\u2019s coffee shop. What could be a better pairing? Surely a charming renovation montage will cure what ails her!</p> <p>If only things were so simple\u2026</p> <p>It turns out that fixing your life isn\u2019t a one-time prospect, nor as easy as a change of scenery and a lick of paint.</p> <p>A drunken and desperate night sees the rattkin waking far from home in the company of a legendary warrior, an imprisoned chaos-goblin with a fondness for silverware, and an absolutely thumping hangover.</p> <p>As together they fend off a rogue\u2019s gallery of ne\u2019er-do-wells trying to claim the bounty the goblin represents, Fern may f",
