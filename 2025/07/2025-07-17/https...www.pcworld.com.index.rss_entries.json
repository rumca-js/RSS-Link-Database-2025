But now the next generation of the standard is picking up speed with <strong>Thunderbolt 5 (TB 5) </strong>and <strong>USB 4 version 2 (USB 4 v2)</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These catapult the data transfer speed from the 40 GBit/s of the previous generation all the way up to 80 GBit/s. And in asymmetric mode, which is optional with USB 4 v2, data transfer is even possible at 120 GBit/s from the host to connected peripheral devices (downstream) to let you run multiple high-resolution monitors at once. (In the opposite direction, 40 GBit/s are still possible.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phew! That\u2019s a lot of information. My head is spinning.
