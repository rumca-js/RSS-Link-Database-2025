I hadn&#39;t been too impressed with browser for awhile and thought it had gone downhill. I switched over to Waterfox. I liked it, and thought it was better than Firefox for privacy and security, but I could have been just trying to convince myself because Firefox is bad now. The one complaint I had aboht it is how slow Waterfox is, especially with loading pages.</p> <p>Then I went to Vivaldi, a browser I keep coming back to. Sure, it&#39;s slow when it first starts up, but once it actually loads, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s speed is bad, just somewhere in the middle.</p> <p>Today, for no particular reason, I decided to revisit Firefox and reinstalled it.

When I press Cmd+T, I want a fresh new homepage, not a prompt to search on the already open tab \u2014 if that makes sense.</p> <p>Second, I use the Tabliss extension as the default home screen, and I love it. But it only works the first time I open the browser window. Let\u2019s say I close all the tabs, I want the home screen to be Tabliss again. But it doesn\u2019t work like that.
