This update is significant because it transforms ChatGPT from a basic chatbot into a capable virtual coworker, able to handle complex, multi-step tasks on its own.</p> <p>The agent comes with a comprehensive toolset that acts like a virtual computer. It includes a text browser for quick web searches, a GUI browser for interacting with websites, a terminal for running code and managing files, and an image generation API for creating visuals. The agent can also connect with services like Google Drive, Calendar, GitHub, and SharePoint.</p> <p>One standout feature is its intelligent tool selection. The agent uses reinforcement learning to decide both how and when to use each tool. For example, it can scrape data from the web, interact with a site, process information in Python, and export the results to slides, all in one workflow.</p> <p",

It can also ask you clarifying questions mid-task if needed.</p> <p>The OpenAI team also highlighted the risks of a tool like this. Agent is trained to stay vigilant against prompt injection attacks, and there appears to be a hidden observer process monitoring for suspicious activity in the background.

We\u2019ve identified 4 different categories that help make up bias and are fine tuning a model and want to use it as a multi label classifier to label bias among those 4 categories. Then make the model accessible via a chrome extension. The idea is to use it when reading news articles to see what types of bias are present in what you\u2019re reading. Eventually we want to expand it to the writing side of things as well with a \u201cwriting mode\u201d where the same core model detects the biases in your text and then offers more neutral text to replace it. So kinda like grammarly but for bias. </p> <p>Again appreciat",

What&#39;s peculiar is the reasoning models switching from the usual &quot;thinking&quot; interface to the old &quot;reasoning&quot; interface, and only &quot;reasoning&quot; for seconds at a time before outputting a subpar answer. I&#39;ve also tested the image generation and its also only taking second to generate, but outputs horrible quality images. I&#39;ll include an examples in this post. I suspect its due to the launch today, as they often have issues on launch days. I just don&#39;t see a ChatGPT issue listed on their status page and want to make sure I&#39;m not the only one lol. Edit: Now they&#39;re showing image gen error, but still not anything regarding other models:</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6gr5ks1lbgdf1.png?width=3331&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2adec3f349bb61df391bd658b8a24e7431920daa\">https://preview.redd.it/6gr5ks1lbgdf1.pn",
