However, it does a good job staying within the bounds of existing architecture. </p> <p>I&#39;m partway through reworking it a bit. The structure will change a bit, but i think it&#39;ll be cleaner (better use of polymorphism, less handling of special cases). Curious what y&#39;all think would be the best way to handle presenting this second solution. I don&#39;t want to overwhelm the maintainer (there&#39;s just one admin who&#39;s active).
