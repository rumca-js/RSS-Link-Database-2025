We\u2019ve identified 4 different categories that help make up bias and are fine tuning a model and want to use it as a multi label classifier to label bias among those 4 categories. Then make the model accessible via a chrome extension. The idea is to use it when reading news articles to see what types of bias are present in what you\u2019re reading. Eventually we want to expand it to the writing side of things as well with a \u201cwriting mode\u201d where the same core model detects the biases in your text and then offers more neutral text to replace it.

AI is currently the most sought-after skill in the job market, but I think it won&#39;t be in demand for long. It has now gotten a lot more advanced than it used to be. Considering the fact that DeepSeek was trained with ChatGPT, people who work for AI will be the last victims of &quot;losing the job.&quot; It wouldn&#39;t take long for AI to get advanced enough to train itself and create its own models. The more the AI content on the internet, the more it would begin to eat its own tail. From what I could see, it would just take 1-2 years for the work &quot;AI modeler&quot; to disappear.
