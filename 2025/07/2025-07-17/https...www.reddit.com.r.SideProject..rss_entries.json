I am interested in the parallels between that and how we use AI now. Both systems are structured black boxes that find patterns/correlations, but they leave the meaning-making up to us.</p> <p>The site connects you to a live bird webcam and an AI &#39;augur&#39;.<br/> You can ask it a question, and it will help you find an &#39;answer&#39; by helping you interpret the birds&#39; movements.</p> <p>It&#39;s an experiment about how we assign meaning to things we can&#39;t fully explain (when there might not actually be meaning there).</p> <p>Keen to hear what you think.
