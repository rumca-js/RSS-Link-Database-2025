The only thing about one I found was <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Lutris/comments/xhziea/creating_a_new_native_to_linux_alternative_to/\">this reddit post</a> which has had no update since. I know it&#39;s been done for other launchers (namely <a href=\"https://heroicgameslauncher.com/\">Heroic</a> for Epic, GOG, and Prime) but supposedly there&#39;s also the very WIP <a href=\"https://crates.io/crates/maxima\">Maxima</a> for the EA app. Also, if relevant, I only need it for WoW.

I mostly play pvp titles like Overwatch and Marvel Rivals, and while im getting smoother performance with cachy than windows, the only thing thats lagging behind a little is the fps. </p> <p>I did read online that other people were having fps drops when playing like Marvel Rivals on linux for example. For people who play on a pc with higher specs, I just want to know how much of a drop of fps performance you have so I can guage how much I should upgrade my pc (which is happening very soon). </p> <p>For a reference, my pc is pretty basic right now. My CPU is an amd I3 processor which is what im gonna upgrade first, and I have a nvidia geforce 1650, which I want to switch asap. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Comprehensive_Pin688\"> /u/Comprehensive_Pin688 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming",

I use 1440p120 on my TV, so I thought I got away with it, but I just discovered last night that despite HDR &quot;working&quot;, even 2.0 has a problem, revealed by Plasma 6.4&#39;s new HDR calibration tool.</p> <p>My display is capable of 1000 nits full field, but with Plasma&#39;s tool over HDMI, there is a clear cutoff at 500 nits, even if I go down to 60Hz. Using the (in)famous CableMatters DP 1,4 -&gt;HDMI adapter, despite being buggy, gives me a full 1000 nits with the calibration tool.</p> <p>Can anyone confirm/deny similar behavior?</p> <p>Using a 9070 XT on NixOS unstable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/njdom24\"> /u/njdom24 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1m2770e/hdmi_20_hdr_too_dim_on_amd/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/",

As it says in the title, I have a third party Xbox controller (Gamesir) that was my daily driver while on Windows. After switching to Bazzite, whenever I use it, it auto-detects as a PS4 controller, oddly enough. I connect the controller through the 2.4 ghz dongle, and it shows up as a PS4 controller in both Steam as well as my Controller section in my Settings. I was under the impression that Bazzite came installed with xone, which could handle both 1st party and 3rd party controllers. Is there something that I&#39;m missing? Is there any way for me to check if I&#39;m missing any drivers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vinnabon\"> /u/vinnabon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1m1upml/third_party_xbox_controller_only_identified_as/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.redd",
