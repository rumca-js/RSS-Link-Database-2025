        "description": "<p><strong>Glyndebourne, Sussex</strong><br>Mariame Cl\u00e9ment allows the story of the predatory Count to resonate across the centuries in this exhilaratingly well performed and eye-catching production </p><p>When Glyndebourne opened its doors in 1934, it did so with The Marriage of Figaro, the first in a fabled line of productions of Mozart\u2019s comic masterpiece to grace its stages over the last 90 years. If the director Mariame Cl\u00e9ment felt any pressure, it didn\u2019t show. Hers is a nuanced staging that manages to be astute, funny and moving all at once. It\u2019s also extremely well sung.</p><p>The opera is about many things, but a great deal hinges on the ancient concept of <em>droit de seigneur</em>, a barbaric medieval custom whereby a feudal lord was entitled to have sex with a female servant on her wedding night. Mozart\u2019s Count, we learn, has made a show of ending the tradition, though he still hopes to bed the feisty Susanna, maidservant to his estranged Countess. Cl\u00e9ment sets the show in",
