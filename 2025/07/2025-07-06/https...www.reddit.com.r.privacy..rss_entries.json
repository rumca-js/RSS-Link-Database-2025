Every bit of help I found online was either foolish AI stuff that didn&#39;t work or just nonsense because nowhere can I find even a hint of these 10 recovery codes I need. Also they were demanding to text my phone BEFORE I had 2-factor authentification. Is it not possible to have email not tied to a phone? It feels awfully fragile.
