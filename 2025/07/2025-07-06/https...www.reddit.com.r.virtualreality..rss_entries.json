But, in games like TWD, It feels super unresponsive and really annoying when you&#39;re in gun fights that are closer than 50 yards (roughly guessing). I have to jolt my controllers so I can freely aim, making getting a quick sight picture very difficult, so I just resort to shooting without aiming at all because it&#39;s far more effective and responsive. But. I don&#39;t play any online VR shooters, so I&#39;m not too familiar with any other games that have implemented Virtual gun stocks.

If anyone\u2019s curious about how it performs or just wants to see how the game plays, feel free to check it out.</p> <p>Let me know what you think if you\u2019ve tried it already, or if you\u2019re planning to pick it up.

It looks like a piece of military hardware from Ghost in the Shell or Cyberpunk 2077. I really like the CV1 as well, especially compared to most of the newer meta headsets. The 3S however looks cool as hell with the spider eyes, especially the black and green one.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a fan of white headsets; they look too \u201ccleaned up\u201d, idk exactly but like, sanitized in a way? I also don\u2019t like glossy black plastic which is unfortunate for the Index; it\u2019s otherwise really cool looking, I just wish it wasn\u2019t so glossy.</p> <p>I\u2019m hoping I really like the bigscreen beyond 2; had a hell of a time deciding between the clear and the nuclear orange, but overall I\u2019m not actually sure how I feel about its aesthetics yet; it seems so tiny compared to the halo mount and audio strap i",
