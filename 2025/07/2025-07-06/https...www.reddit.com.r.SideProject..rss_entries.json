You take Znapshots of people and the more interesting the actions and locations the higher the score. The images are &quot;translated&quot; into ZorCode and highest scoring go on the Leaderboard.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working on building it and letting my friends test it and I knew I was on to something when every day tons of new pics started appearing.

This means all notes as well as uploaded attachments like PDFs or images are serialized, encrypted and stored as encrypted blobs until you pull them down client side.</p> <p>Users can create notes, add TODOs then extract those TODOs directly into a GTD based task view which shows the note context from where those tasks came and lets you organize them in a traditional GTD fashion. </p> <p>Searching notes has never been easier either with the ability to click a folder then shift click tags to filter your notes by any combination you can think of. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",
