I\u2019m currently trying to set up the Cashfree Payment Gateway for handling payments.</p> <p>I\u2019ve entered all the required Cashfree credentials (app ID, secret key, etc.) into Lovable AI\u2019s backend settings. The \u201cPay Now\u201d button successfully redirects to the Cashfree payment landing page, but when it loads, it throws a \u201cSession Error\u201d and the payment doesn\u2019t proceed. \ud83d\ude13</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried so far: \u2022 Double-checked API credentials and environment (sandbox/live) \u2022 Confirmed webhook and return URLs \u2022 Tried both test and live modes \u2022 Ensured CORS settings on Supabase allow proper origin</p> <p>Still no luck. I suspect the session token might not be getting generated or passed correctly from Lovable AI to Cashfree.</p> <p>Has anyone here successfully integrated Cashfree with a Lovable AI site using Supabase as backend?</p> <p>Any help,",

I&#39;m looking for someone who is skilled in full stack, backend development, with a willingness to work full time. I&#39;m going to be paying a decent amount so if you feel you&#39;ve got it then we can negotiate whatever. The website is essentially a music sharing application which shares similar features to those of soundcloud and spotify but we&#39;re going for something even bigger. Heavy on the ui/ux so skills in functionality are important (obviously). If anyone on here would be interested in finding out further information please dm me and we can continue communication via whatsapp. Alternatively, if anyone has any suggestions on good places to look for such people, please let me know also :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Gain5171\"> /u/Successful-Gain5171 </a> <br/> <span><a",
