Since i\u2019ve downloaded that, i\u2019ve had this RAV Endpoint \u201cantivirus\u201d software which is obviously some type of malware. it pops up a browser window every time i open my PC and opens up the application, and every time i delete them they seem to be back when i get back on my PC. is there a way to get rid of these permanently and still be able to use the cheat engine? or would I have to download a different one, or just not use it all together? or could i just remove the malware while keeping the application i downloaded</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EstablishmentClean60\"> /u/EstablishmentClean60 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1ltflh9/rav_endpoint_malware/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1ltflh9/rav_endpoint_malware/\">[comme",
