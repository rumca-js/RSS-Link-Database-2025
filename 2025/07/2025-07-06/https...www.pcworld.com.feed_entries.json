And over the long term, a robot lawn mower will cost less than hiring a landscaper\u2014and it won\u2019t expect a tip every week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top-of-the-line models cost a pretty penny, but they can climb slopes and handle very large yards (we\u2019re talking acres of grass). While early robot lawn mowers required you to lay down a boundary wire to prevent them from wandering out of your yard, each of mowers listed here use advanced navigation technology that eliminates the need for any wires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that we\u2019ve already spotted some great deals on robot lawn mowers ahead of Amazon\u2019s Prime Day sale, and we expect there will be more when the sale actually gets underway on July 8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated July 6, 2025</strong>: We\u2019ve spot",
