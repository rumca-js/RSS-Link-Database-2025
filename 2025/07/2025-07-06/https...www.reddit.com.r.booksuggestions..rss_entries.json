She hasn\u2019t read a fiction book in over 30 years. It needs to be fairly easy read with a straightforward plot, but with enough substance that we can have meaningful discussions about it together. Anything fantasy/scifi, or anything with too much sex/violence is a no-go for her. It could contemporary or classic, as long as it isn\u2019t too difficult to read.

It\u2019s about a young man who has his heart removed because of how heartbreak prone he is, and his doctor tells him he has to give his heart away to a woman who loves him. Search \u201cThe Hearts Of Argyle Godfrey\u201d on YouTube. This isn\u2019t really conventional horror, but it\u2019s gothic literature. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/poetnicholasleonard\"> /u/poetnicholasleonard </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ltd10z/the_hearts_of_argyle_godfrey/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ltd10z/the_hearts_of_argyle_godfrey/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The one that started really clicking for me was Mockingbird Wish Me Luck by Charles Bukowski. I&#39;ve tried others and they just did not fly, like some Allen Ginsberg and more classical stuff like Lord Byron. But Bukowski is really intriguing, I like that a lot of it just seems to be flow of consciousness stuff with a little embellishment. And it doesn&#39;t rhyme, to me it comes across like small scenes from his life or idle musings. In any case, would appreciate some recommendations of poetry that doesn&#39;t necessarily rhyme but conveys thoughts in a beautiful way. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lostandforgottensoul\"> /u/lostandforgottensoul </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ltcbv1/poetry_recommendations_but_alternative/\">[link]</a></s",

However I&#39;m just under 4 chapters in out of 12 and so far nothing interesting has happened. I looked up the book to see if maybe I just haven&#39;t gotten to the good part yet, but no. I found out that it&#39;s apparently a romance. I hate romances. So like I haven&#39;t really been able to get myself to read it. Did the Barnes and Noble employee just lie to me? Or did I just not get to the good part yet? Like literally the only things that has happened was the protagonist (I dont even remeber her name if Kaline mentioned it, and I dont know if she did) just took care of a seaman from the 1600s who was brought to the current day. We didn&#39;t even get to see the events of how the Ministry picked him up other than &quot;time portal go back time and back&quot;.</p> ",

And a text comes that changes everything. Tillie and her friends meet and school and tell her they found a text of someone saying the would like to meet Alex somewhere.She and her friends know someone might be cheating but they need to figure out who... Something in there text seems familiar. They know someone from their friend group that&#39;s has this kind of style when texting. One by one they go through everyone in there friend group to figure out who cheated. Please comment because I want to know ways to improve this storyline and just tell what you think. Any comment would mean the world!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Live_Revolution_2220\"> /u/Live_Revolution_2220 </a> <br/> <span><a",
