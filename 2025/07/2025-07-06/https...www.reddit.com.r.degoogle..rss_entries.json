To provide you context on my request, I was using multiple subscriptions and decided to move most everything from Google to Apple services (ICloud+) to reduce costs. I am still using Gmail for two accounts I have. After some v\u00eddeos from Pewdiepie and Mutahar, I finally decided to move away from Google and add more privacy into the services and technology I use. I am not a privacy freak and I value ease of use with minimum costs. I already created two Proton accounts to replace my gmail accounts (still ongoing) and enabled the ADP from ICloud.
