Animals were placed around 3, humans at 10, and AI at 1000. That tiny gap between us and animals, just 7 points, was enough for us to create entire realities beyond their grasp. We\u2019ve invented complex fields like math, physics, music, philosophy, biology\u2026 the list goes on. And everything we do seems to serve three main goals: survival, improvement, and exploration.</p> <p>Animals are mostly stuck in survival. But because of our intelligence, we\u2019ve moved beyond that. We\u2019ve used it to improve our daily lives in every possible way, and we\u2019ve pushed even further, we explore. We put a man on the moon.</p> <p>Now, if we apply that same logic to AI, which will be far ahead of us on the intelligence scale, I believe it will follow a similar trajectory, just on a much larger scale.
