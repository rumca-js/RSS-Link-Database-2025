I read online that Tom Cruise originally wanted to do this film but it was too late, Sheen was already cast. Now that I know that, I can literally picture young Tom Cruise doing his own version of &#39;Bud Fox&#39;. There&#39;s definitely a Wall Street with Tom Cruise and Michael Douglas in an alternate universe.</p> <p>Another example, I also saw Ransom (1996) with Mel Gibson. The cinematography reminded me of The Fugitive (1993). Then I just thought of the idea of Harrison Ford doing Ransom. It would definitely still be a tense thriller. Harrison Ford actually fits pretty well for Ransom.</p> <p>Any other movies you can see someone else doing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Myhole567\"> /u/Myhole567 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lt69h7/what_movies_can_you_litera",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been doing a self-imposed challenge this year. Every Monday, I watch a different Nicolas Cage film. I&#39;m halfway through the year now, and I&#39;m loving it! Forcing myself to watch a thing I otherwise might not ever touch has forced me out of my normal film taste, and having such a defined structure has been a way to keep myself going through it.</p> <p>With that said, I want to do it again in 2026 with a new theme. Nicolas Cage has been a great subject, but has some limitations. A lot of his work can be pretty samey, and basically everything is feature-length. Sometimes finding an entire 90 minutes on a Monday is super difficult, and I want to give myself some leeway.</p> <p>So I&#39;m trying to do robots next year. Anything robots. I thought asking people here would be better than just googling and making a list on my own. All recommendations will go into a list on Letterboxd for myself so I can pick through it through the year.</p> <p>",
