(A little about me is I like reading smut and I am very dirty when it comes to jokes and such). I have dated men before but I have only been with women sexually. I have been in a relationship with a woman for 5 &amp; 1/2 years (lost my virginity to her, so she\u2019s the only person I\u2019ve been with sexually). The past 2.5-3 years we probably have only had sex about 5 times. I have a high sex drive and she has a low sex drive. I also don\u2019t really like masturbating even tho I have a high sex drive. I\u2019ve asked her about why we don\u2019t do anything and she has said that she doesn\u2019t really like being touched anymore/as much, and she might be asexual (she does masturbate when I\u2019m asleep or not home tho, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s done that in a while tho). Recently she has tried to hug and touch and kiss me more but now I\u2019m kinda uncomfortable with it and I think it might be because I\u2019ve been turned down so many time",
