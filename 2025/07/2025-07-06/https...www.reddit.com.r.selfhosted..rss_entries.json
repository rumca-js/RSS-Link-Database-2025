So I bought an N100-based minicomputer and a big storage drive (eventually move to raid 1 on the storage when I have the funds, but not anytime soon). I tried to set up regular Nextcloud on it, but I was really struggling with Docker. I do not understand how to do anything on that setup. Had Filecloud up and running and then suddenly the Sync clients suddenly died and wouldn&#39;t connect, either timing out and errors that they couldn&#39;t create files/directories. Chased that for a while and then not finding answers have decided to reimage and do the setup again from the start...but now I can&#39;t even get to Filecloud&#39;s install guide.</p> <p>Can you guys suggest an alternative?
