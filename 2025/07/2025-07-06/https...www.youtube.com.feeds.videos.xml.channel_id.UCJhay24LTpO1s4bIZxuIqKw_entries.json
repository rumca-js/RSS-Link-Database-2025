        "description": "ACCU Membership: https://tinyurl.com/ydnfkcyn\n---\n\nThe C++ Execution Model - Bryce Adelstein Lelbach - ACCU 2025\n---\n\nAt the heart of the C++ programming language is the multi-threaded abstract machine and its execution model, the platform-agnostic formal model that generically describes how to run a C++ program. In this talk, you will learn the rules that govern how your C++ code is executed and see how those rules impact the C++ code you write every day.\n\nWe'll explore the C++ execution and memory model, and discuss fundamental questions such as:\n\n -  What are threads in C++ and how do they interact?\n -  What is memory in C++?\n -  In what order are things in my C++ program executed?\n -  How are C++ expressions and statements executed?\n -  What are the semantics of calling a function in C++?\n -  What does \"happens before\" mean?\n\nIf you're interested in gaining a deeper understanding of how your C++ code is executed and how concurrency works in C++, you should watch this talk.\n\nSlides",
