Sure he ends up king, but it just kind of lands in his lap.</p> <p>I know sophisticated readers of fantasy these days want tropes to be subverted and lean towards an ensemble cast of characters in which no single character is the pronounced &quot;hero.&quot; I just read dense, intricate work for school, and when I have the time to read a fantasy novel, I&#39;m looking for pure reader-projection escapism.

It is sufficiently specific that I assume Williams had some very concrete image in mind. Does anyone have any idea what the squeezers might be, or look like? Is there a connection to some 90s era technology that I&#39;m not aware of? Has he ever talked about it?

Typically, he likes violence and action and I like romantasy. Do you have any suggestions that arent overly smutty or too descriptively violent?

It was a really solid work, well-written, but ultimately I wasn&#39;t enamoured with the setting (Moorish Spain) or the characters. The book is historical fantasy - it is so close to being actual historical fiction that it almost raises the question why it had to be made-up. But also it didn&#39;t have the rough-and-tumble more assertive/aggressive style of historical fiction I like, being more of a historical romance, which I&#39;m much less interested in. Indeed, all the theoretically most exciting stuff - all the warring and changes in power - happens at lightning speed in the last couple or so chapters, like a summary of events. The story itself isn&#39;t interested in these things despite how much they were all built up to. It&#39;s like the author ran out of steam and decided to finish with the cliff n",

While I do like a world that generally feels believable, what I like in fantasy mostly is characters and general sense of exploration of real world themes and topics through an abstracted lens. Ursula Leguin and Tamora Pierce (when i was younger) are fantasy authors I have quite liked for example, and I recently quite liked Magic for Liars and how it sucked all the air out of a harry potter type fantasy.
