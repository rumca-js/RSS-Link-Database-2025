But what I want to do is have one character say that the easiest way to gain full access to another character&#39;s phone is to get hold of the physical phone for a short time, rather than try to hack it remotely. That&#39;s what would work best for plot reasons! But is it true? If you could choose between borrowing the physical phone and trying to get into it remotely, you&#39;d borrow the phone, right? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GoodEnough468\"> /u/GoodEnough468 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1lt1rd1/advice_for_something_im_writing_if_you_wouldnt/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1lt1rd1/advice_for_something_im_writing_if_you_wouldnt/\">[comments]</a></span>",
