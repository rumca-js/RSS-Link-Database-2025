I managed to get it up and working to a degree. Without having much knowledge of how, to the point where I can get the workbench up and use calculator. But we seem to be missing what we think is some kind of &#39;boot&#39; disk to allow it to go further and play his collection of games and test those.</p> <p>I ask because we know my cousin held onto it with intention of selling the system and it&#39;s games one day. We plan to give the money to a suicide prevention charity when we sell it. But looking at Ebay solds the prices seem to be kind of crazy. We saw one where just the like keyboard unit sold for about \u00a3600 on the 27th of June this year. Then the day before 26th June there was a unit that sold with a bunch of games, all working and everything looked great and it sold for slightly less than just the keyboard itself (no power no nothing)",
