        "description": "<p>In <b>Warhammer 40,000</b>, or to be more accurate, <b>Warhammer 30,000</b>, nothing is more important than the saga of the Horus Heresy. When Horus Lupercal of the Luna Wolves turned his back on the Emperor, that was when the Imperium came closest to utter annihilation. Fortunately, the brave loyalists on Terra prevented Chaos\u2019 schemes, but at great cost.</p>\n<p>The Saturnine box set contains 50 miniatures that are sure to scratch the 30k nostalgia itch. The most exciting aspect is the MkII Crusade armor, which makes the Space Marines look wickedly knightly.\u00a0 The single visor, the battle-damaged silver, and the abundance of broadswords over chainswords certainly lend themselves to the crusading aesthetic. As you go through the <a href=\"https://www.wargamer.com/horus-heresy/book-order\">Horus Heresy books</a>, these \u201cprimitive\u201d yet reliable armors will be quite a familiar sight.</p>\n \t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tContinue reading <a href=\"https://www.wargamer.com/warhammer-the-horus-heresy/saturnin",
