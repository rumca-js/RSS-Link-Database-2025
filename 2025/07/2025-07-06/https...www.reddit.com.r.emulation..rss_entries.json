It isn&#39;t enabled by default though, you&#39;ll have to turn it on manually in the config file yourself, as this is still a very experimental feature, and will break some games, plus it comes with a not insignificant hit to performance as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NXGZ\"> /u/NXGZ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/1lt9ew0/shadps4_v0100_stable_release/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href",
