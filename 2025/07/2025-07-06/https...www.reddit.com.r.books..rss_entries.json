I picked up the books by Uketsu, and went on to buy pretty much based solely on the cover art! The cover is very visually appealing with bold colours.</p> <p>I have realised that I can almost instantly consider or reject a book based on it&#39;s cover. I have never really thought about how much this has influenced my habits before!</p> <p>Is a cover important to you? How do you add new authors to your list of authors you would buy?

As of writing this post, I&#39;ve finished reading the book, and I&#39;m incredibly disappointed.</p> <p>The title &quot;Victorian Psycho&quot; promises a thrilling story of an unhinged governess in Victorian era England that doesn&#39;t really deliver on that promise. The first half of the book is a slow burn peppered with anecdotes of her troubled upbringing that barely scratch the surface, supplemented with random, seemingly unhinged thoughts. To me it felt expositional. While there&#39;s bits and pieces to inform us, the reader, that she&#39;s meant to be mentally disturbed, she still comes off as someone who simply hates her job. Right off the bat, Mrs. Pounds resents Winifred due to her husband, Mr. Pounds, obvious lust towards Winifred. While the book felt like it was buildin",

The plot sounds great, but the writing! Run-on sentence after run-on sentence, each one meandering to the point where he has to add the character&#39;s name in parenthesis so you can keep track of who is speaking. If Miss Coldfield is representative of the people in this small Southern town, the inhabitants are just drowning in their past. </p> <p>Does it get better?
