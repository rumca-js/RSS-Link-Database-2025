I am new to raspberry Pis, and I need to figure out how to collect temperature data from a -80 C sample fridge, and after doing a bit of research into the probe I currently have, I decided I probably needed something that doesn&#39;t plug into my mic input! I keep bumping into pages discussing the same common DS18B20 probe, but this only goes as low as -55 C, and I&#39;m not quite sure what to look for when it comes to compatibility with Pis. What probes are cost effective, and work well?

Basically just for light coding with vs code, web browsing and then typing / printing menus and orders in libre office. Then I had the idea of getting a pi 500 keyboard and a official pi monitor and travelling with this instead. With the cords, mouse and booting from an SSD via USB. However, I don&#39;t see many posts on the pi 500 or making a pi portable other than people linking it with little touchscreens or doing experimental kind of projects.
