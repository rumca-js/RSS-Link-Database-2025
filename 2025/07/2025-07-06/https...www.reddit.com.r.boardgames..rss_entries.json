Most if not all like board games and I was thinking, what&#39;s a good game to bring for easy summer playing in a room where people circulate? Few moving parts, quick (5 min) and easy to slot people in or put as well as reset. I&#39;m bringing Coup after talking about it with a couple of friends, but open to ideas. Skull could be fun but feels like slightly more of the same?

Losses would pile up to make the game harder and harder. Or a loss at the wrong time on a branching-path game would make it impossible to get the \u201cgood\u201d final outcome (I\u2019m looking at you, Wing Commander.)</p> <p>So while many modern campaign games have little or no punishment for failing - or some even have Kobayahi Maru no-win situations - those sometimes break my momentum entirely and cause me to put the game aside entirely. Intellectually, I know that most contemporary games won\u2019t let early- or mid-campaign failures break the experience. But I\u2019m a little broken from those \u201880s and early \u201890s punishers. </p> <p>What are yours?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi there! I&#39;m looking for a game that I can enjoy with my family. Myself, I love a bit higher complexity games my favourite being:</p> <ol> <li>Spirit Island </li> <li>Unmatched (though I didn&#39;t enjoy Tales to Amaze unfortunately)</li> <li>Gloomhaven </li> <li>Sky Team</li> </ol> <p>Some other games I like but don&#39;t love 5. The Crew Deep Sea 6. King of Tokyo (especially with powerup) 7. Evolution Climate 8. Azul 9. Agricola 10. Carcassonne </p> <p>I think what all these games have in common is that they are modular, have a lot of replayabiltiy and some complexity. However, the games I love are very long. I&#39;m trying to find a shorter game that still has complexity, but is also accessible for 8+ year old and my wife who just doesn&#39;t enjoy these heavier games. I think in terms of complexity I&#39;m looking at games like Catan, Carcassonne, Azul, Machiavelli, Codenames, Pandemic Legacy (1,2,0)(these are all games my wife endures). </p>",
