So i&#39;ve been looking at vpn tried airvpn which was very nice but sadly too expensive for me, that is when i heard about warp (privacy aside) i was wondering if using warp would be something okay for me (i download about 50 to a 100 gb of data each month and i don&#39;t want to get spoted at all).

I was surprised that a proper version was already out, and though I found it sus that there was like only 1 seeder I downloaded it nonetheless. </p> <p>So I open the movie and it starts playing. The scene opens in outer space. An unmanned ship grabs a floating rock and brings it back to earth. Inside a room, scientists in hazmat suits are using a laser to drill into the giant rock. I&#39;m like, huh this looks nothing like what I expected. I guess the zombie virus is alien and this is the origin scene? So they break the rock in half and wheel away whatever was inside. The camera pans into the inside of the split rock, and the outline of the creature can be seen on the inner rock wall. I&#39;m thinking wait a minute, that looks just like a xenomorph.<br/> The movie of the title proceeds to slide into frame. Deadass.<br/> <strong><em>Alien Romulus</em></st",

I want to enable port forwarding so I can achieve higher speeds and better upload ratios when torrenting, but the last time I tried to do this, I ended up immediately exposing my computer to a malware attack that required a reformat to fix. Granted, this was 20 years ago, when I was in high school, and I was not using a VPN.

I tried linux for her, since she is going to do basic work on it, but shes just too used to windows and is annoying the hell out of me to get windows for her.
