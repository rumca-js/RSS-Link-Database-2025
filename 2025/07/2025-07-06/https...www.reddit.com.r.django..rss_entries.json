I&#39;ve been working on something that might be useful for fellow Django developers.</p> <p>I created an API that handles video file processing completely remotely. Basically, you give it your S3 file URL and credentials, it processes the video on our servers, then uploads the result back and cleans up. No need to handle video processing on your own infrastructure.</p> <p>The cool part is I also built a Django app that integrates directly with this API, so you can drop it into your Django project pretty easily. Some features include:</p> <ul> <li>Automatic video processing after upload</li> <li>Chunked uploads for large video files</li> <li>Automatic resolution selection for video elements</li> <li>Handles all the S3 stuff behind the scenes</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m looking for developers who&#39;d be interested in trying this out. I can offer 2 months of free premium access (maybe longer depending on feedback) to anyone willing to test it ",
