How to set up authentication via Authentik/Authelia/Pocket ID etc. in such a case though? I might be wrong but I suppose that if I spin up two separate instances (public and internal) of e.g. Authentik I&#39;m either gonna have to set up a synchronization of the user database (which I&#39;m not sure is even possible) or create two separate user accounts (public and internal) for each user which is not ideal.
