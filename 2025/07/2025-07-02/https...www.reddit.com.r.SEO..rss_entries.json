I see some studios with thousands of backlinks, all with very low spam score, but almost all of them are something like &quot;dancestudio123412321 dot win-blog dot com&quot; or &quot;dancestudio7893415 dot loginblogin dot com&quot;.

Add in a trust building paragraph that has brief company history. Another paragraph with snippets of customer reviews pertaining specifically to that item and more.
