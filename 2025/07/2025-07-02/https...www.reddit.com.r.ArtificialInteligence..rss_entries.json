It outlines a 10-point plan to secure Australia\u2019s place as a regional AI leader. While the potential economic gain is significant\u2014estimated at $115 billion annually by 2030\u2014this vision carries both opportunity and caution.</p> <p>But how real is this blueprint? OpenAI&#39;s own 2023 paper (&quot;GPTs are GPTs&quot;) found that up to 49% of U.S. jobs could have half or more of their tasks exposed to AI, especially in higher-income and white-collar roles. If this holds for Australia, it raises serious concerns for job displacement\u2014even as the new report frames AI as simply &quot;augmenting&quot; work. The productivity gains may be real, but so too is the upheaval for workers unprepared for rapid change.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to remember OpenAI is not an arbiter of national policy\u2014i",

Not least of which is as LLMs and other AI tools advance, there&#39;s going to be more and more businessmen, doctors, lawyers, engineers, scientists, teachers and others using these tools to assist in research, set up algorithms for what they need and make their work go by faster. Only the most experienced and skilled of software developers will be able to get to a point where they have zero use of these LLMs and other tools. So does that mean that only those software developers in the upper echelon retain their intelligence?

To actually replace most content out there be it films, actual real commercials and not just mobile ads, full on content creators. I\u2019m seeing a lot more AI content out there and even people experiencing it in public as they walk around and I hear this VEO 3 voiceover.
