It&#39;s about war, destruction, and the absurdity of it all. &quot;So it goes&quot; is Vonnegut&#39;s detached way of dealing with all the negativity around him. It\u2019s kind of a resignation, but I see it, like I said, more as a detached response, almost as if he&#39;s saying it with a sad smile, thinking, &quot;This is how life is, and will always be, and that\u2019s okay in a way.&quot;</p> <p>I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m just imagining things...</p> <p>Anyways, I quite like the novel, especially the sci-fi side of it, and the dark humor.

What I liked most about the trilogy was how batshit crazy it was, beyond what one could imagine. I have read The Martian. I found it to be good but ultimately a bit too sciency for me. Since the discriptions of how to grow potatoaes in space and so on was really boring for me and many terms went over my head. I am now wondering if I would enjoy Project Hail Mary, since it&#39;s so widely praised. Those of you who have read it, what do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/apple_porridge\"> /u/apple_porridge </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1lpr59r/question_about_project_hail_mary/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1lpr59r/question_about_project_hail_mary/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I remember attempting to read <em>On Earth We&#39;re Briefly Gorgeous</em> thinking it was going to be this magnificent piece of literature, but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to enjoy nor finish that book. Now I know both authors are published poets, but I feel as if Akbar managed to do what I wanted Vuong to accomplish! </p> <p>Anyways, I&#39;m an easy reader, and genuinely love a good story. The story for me may have been a bit predictable, but I thought it was executed well enough! I&#39;d love to hear some responses from the community!</p> <p>P.S. not including manga I&#39;ve only read One Day Everyone Will Have Always Been Against this by Omar El Akkad (Looking to read What Strange Paradise next!) and No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",

I just love how she\u2019s so unapologetically\u2026 herself. She talks about screaming at her kids, returning expensive presents to pay the bills, having a nervous breakdown over the kids\u2019 sport socks and considering her husband \u201cbasically a roommate who has to pay all the bills and sleep on the couch.\u201d And she doesn\u2019t seem at all embarrassed about any of these facts. She accepts herself on such a basic level that I can\u2019t help but feel jealous. </p> <p>I especially liked her take on parenting. I raise my kids to get straight A\u2019s and say \u201cyes ma\u2019am, no ma\u2019am\u201d and I expect absolutely nothing less. In speaking to other parents, I have been starting to doubt how much of a hard-ass I\u2019ve been. But Zarna validated the hell out of me! She should write a funny parenting book! It would kill! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MinxyMyrnaMinkoff",
