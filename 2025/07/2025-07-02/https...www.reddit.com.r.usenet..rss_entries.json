I rebilled in March for a year so, I know it&#39;s fine in those terms. I went to my account and, all seems fine there. My account is also unlimited which shouldn\u2019t be an issue too. I&#39;ve tried reaching out to support but all I get now, for hours, is that they&#39;ll be back in 2 hours. Any advice would be really appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Due_Association_7712\"> /u/Due_Association_7712 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1lps88c/can_somebody_help_issue_with_newsdemon/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1lps88c/can_somebody_help_issue_with_newsdemon/\">[comments]</a></span>",
