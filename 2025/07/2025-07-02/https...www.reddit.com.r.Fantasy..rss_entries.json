That&#39;s how I feel about this book series.</p> <p>1, The Fidele-Maquin romance. The pairing was great, really well written, loved their character arcs and how they came together. Could&#39;ve definitely be done without mind control rape, but what was worse imo is the ending of their story arcs. They went through so much loss and grief, I think them being able to live happily would&#39;ve made more sense than both of them dyeing.</p> <p>2, Edana marrying Conall. It felt like we had 3 books building up the Edana - Camlin relationship. A sheltered princess turning into a great leader, a queen of her people, and Camlin turning from an outcast into a honor",

It has been out for well over 2 years now and I would think that it would be much better known, especially given how the writer, Dr. Philip Chase, is rather famous in the Booktube fantasy community.

More and more authors seem to be visualizing MCU-style movie adaptations while they write. I don&#39;t think fight scenes should be excessive in books. It&#39;s a different medium, and at some point it becomes very repetitive, and as a reader I think to myself, \u201cYeah, okay, but just tell me how it ends.\u201d It becomes particularly tedious when it&#39;s clear to the reader that the characters are protected by plot armor and the fight will end well anyway 50+ pages later.</p> <p>I&#39;ve noticed this repeatedly now, and I&#39;d be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter. Maybe I&#39;m weird and long battles like this are the most important thing for many fantasy fans. I just read the ship raid in \u201cThe Devils\u201d by Abercrombie, but I felt the same way about the endless boss battles in DCC or Kaladin&#39;s endless air battle at the end of \u201cThe Way of Kings&q",

I think back to a few years ago when I went to my local Ren Faire and was asked by a worker who my favorite Knight of the Round Table is, and I answered Gawain because I was vaguely familiar with the Green Knight story and it was an answer that was Not-Lancelot. If I were asked that question again today, I would end up on a twenty minute rant about Sir Aglovale.</p> <p>So yeah, I\u2019m exactly the target audience for <em>The Bright Sword</em>.

The plot is good, the Chinese names themselves fine as well, just\u2026</p> <p>What on earth led to Joan He choosing to write all the names translated like this? All the characters have surnames, and they practically go unnoticed because of this deduction (known through the character illustrations inside the book)</p> <p>An example: the character \u2018Cloud\u2019 has the Chinese name \u9ad8\u4e91 (G\u0101o Y\u00fan), which translated directly into \u2018high/tall\u2019(\u9ad8) and \u2018cloud\u2019(\u4e91). So, technically correct, just\u2026 Really jarring? To me, at least.</p> <p>In no way am I saying this decision by the author is wrong or bad, just strange to me. Any ideas as to why it\u2019s like this, especially when some of the other characters with \u2018harder to translate\u2019 names (the poetic ones?) are kept in romanised Mandarin?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Awkward_L",
