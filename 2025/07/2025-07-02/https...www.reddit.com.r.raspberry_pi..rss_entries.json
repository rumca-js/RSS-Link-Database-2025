Turns out my LCD connector board won&#39;t* pass through HDMI, and the RPI doesn&#39;t have a standard audio out jack.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently running TwisterOS, and am not at all familiar with driver support for something like this, and I can&#39;t find any direct articles on this. Hoping someone can help point me in the right direction here.</p> <p>It doesn&#39;t have to be high fidelity or anything, just good enough for a small arcade cabinet, with something powered and connected via a single USB cable, I can hotglue or 3dprint mount somewhere in the case, for when the machine is in demo mode and not plugged into a proper TV and such.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mansen_\"> /u/Mansen_ </a> <br/> <span",

The best power solution I found is the Geekworm X1206 4-Cell 21700 battery pack. For the display, I want to use the official Raspberry Pi Touch Display 2.</p> <p>The challenge is that both components are designed to connect to the <strong>bottom side</strong> of the Pi 5. My initial idea was to 3D print some spacers to position the screen on the top side while attaching the Geekworm battery to the bottom. However, I\u2019m concerned that the provided ribbon cable for the display might be too short or incompatible with the necessary right-angle connection.</p> <p>Has anyone tackled a similar setup or have suggestions on how to manage the connections and placement? I\u2019d appreciate any advice or solutions you could share!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",

While talking with Chat GPT, he adviced to use TXS0108E level shifter to power up MCP2515 with TJA1050 which needs 5V. So... I&#39;m using RPI connected to USB port so I&#39;ve used VBUS pin from RPI to connect it into TXS 5V pin and 3V3 from RPI to connect TXS 3.3V and OE. But unfortunately this setting is not getting any data from CAN bus (6 and 14 OBD2 PIN). I&#39;m connecting GND from OBD2 5th pin to RPI and TXS/MCP. Any ideas what I&#39;m doing wrong?
