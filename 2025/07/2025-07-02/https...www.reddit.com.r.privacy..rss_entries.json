It won&#39;t take a charge through the USB-C port and the wireless charging doesn&#39;t appear to be doing anything (whichever method of charging, the screen/tiny LED light won&#39;t turn on or flash). Impossible to do any of the factory resets as well. I think the battery just straight up died.</p> <p>Thing is there was a lot of info on this phone: accounts, password lists, etc. I don&#39;t need to recover any files; luckily I backed up all my photos/music to my PC about a month ago. </p> <p>What&#39;s the best way to destroy the phone and prevent the data from being accessed?
