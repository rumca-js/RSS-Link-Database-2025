The A18 Pro is 46% faster than the\nM1 in single-core tasks, and almost identical to the M1 on\nmulti-core and graphics tasks. If you wanted to get rid of the M1\nMacBook Air but have decided that even today, its performance\ncharacteristics make it perfectly suitable as a low-cost Mac\nlaptop, building a new model on the A18 Pro would not be a bad\nmove. It wouldn\u2019t have Thunderbolt, only USB-C, but that\u2019s not a\ndealbreaker on a cheap laptop. It might re-use parts from the M1\nAir, including the display.</p>\n\n<p>I like that Apple sells a laptop at $649, and I think Apple likes\nit, too. A new low-end model might steal some buyers from the $999\nMacBook Air, but I\u2019d wager it would reach a lot of customers who\nmight otherwise not buy a full-priced Mac\u2009\u2014\u2009the same ones buying\nM1 MacBook Airs at Walmart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My first thought when I saw this rumor pop up was to dismiss it. But upon consider",
