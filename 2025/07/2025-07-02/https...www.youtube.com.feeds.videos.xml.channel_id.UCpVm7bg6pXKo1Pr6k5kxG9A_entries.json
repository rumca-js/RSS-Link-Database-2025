The wilderness isn\u2019t just an escape; it\u2019s a return to something essential. In one week, I found sanctuary in the silence of a glassy lake, a proving ground on the basalt walls of Smith Rock, and a playground mountain biking through pine lined trails. The wild has shaped how I see, how I work, and how I am in the world. It reminds me that discomfort is a teacher and that beauty is everywhere if you\u2019re paying attention.\"",
