When his team emailed customers, about 2% would respond. When they called them, 20-30% picked up. Most of us assume no one answers phone calls anymore, but that\u2019s not true if someone has just signed up or asked for info. These are high-intent people.</p> <p>I always thought voice AI was too clunky to be useful.
