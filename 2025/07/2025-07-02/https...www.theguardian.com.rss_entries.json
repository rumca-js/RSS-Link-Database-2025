Now he has turned his attention to Debussy\u2019s Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, an opera on which he assisted Pierre Boulez at the Welsh National Opera more than 30 years ago. The results are no less unmissable and authoritative as his Wagner.</p><p>From the dark chords of the opening bars, Negus conjures a fluently idiomatic reading of the translucent score. The pacing is beautifully controlled and Negus is always attentive to Debussy\u2019s many tone colour changes and subtle dynamic contrasts. He draws some ravishing woodwind playing from the Longborough orchestra.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.co",

The manicured pitches and lush green outfield stand out like a velvet rug draped over cold concrete. The pavilion is no mere clubhouse.
