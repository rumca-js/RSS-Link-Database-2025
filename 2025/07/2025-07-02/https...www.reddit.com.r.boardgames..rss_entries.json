Like, in Terraforming Mars, the cards where you must pick 1 player to take resources from. He feels like this decision is personal, and he feels uncomfortable when he has to choose between multiple players. So, which of the two games makes you make these types of decisions more?

The key differences from what I have seen is the first edition having more variance, less balance, more moving parts, and more replayability while the second edition is a more streamlined and cleaner experience but loses a bit of depth. </p> <p>Another note from what I heard is the 1st edition is way better with the expansions, especially nightfall. </p> <p>From what I read, I would typically favour and enjoy the first edition more. My main issue is the price. Currently I can get the 1st edition with both expansions for $90 second hand, while a new second edition is purchasable widely for $50.

For example, I love birding and fossil hunting but she is more into knitting.</p> <p>Despite that, we both love board games but unfortunately, never really got into playing them together. On the rare occasion we do end up playing, we have a blast though. Recently, she has mentioned to me several times on how she wants us to start playing board games more frequently once we start living together and I am 100% on board and excited. As such, I got us 12 different board/card games that intersect our interests. I tried to also make sure that I didn&#39;t find anything extremely difficult because we are both entry level.

The core idea is that players play different characters, each with unique actions, inspired by real historical roles and the social dynamics of that time </p> <p>After reading and research, my current prototype has 8 character roles abd all of them are Italian men. That\u2019s pretty true to the actual makeup of these mobs / roles / responsibilities in that era</p> <p>Playtesting has been going well for months, but in a recent session, one player refused to play when he realised there were no women or black characters, saying the game felt exclusionary. I understand where he\u2019s coming from - I also understand the value of inclusion and representation, but I\u2019m torn because adding characters outside the historical context would feel inauthentic to me, like tweaking historical fa",

The game uses Uno cards (but not the full deck) and a 3x3 Rubik&#39;s cube. I&#39;ve played it three times and have beaten it all three times. The basic premise is that you are tasked with mapping out a magical, colorful dungeon. You do this by making moves on the Rubik&#39;s cube to form an unbroken path using edge pieces ",
