My goal is to build a solid foundation in Linux system administration, and eventually move on to things like cloud computing, Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes.</p> <p>Before I dive in, I\u2019d really appreciate your input: \u2022 Any recommendations for good courses or platforms for Linux Admin 1 &amp; 2? \u2022 What topics should I definitely focus on at the beginning? \u2022 Any common mistakes I should avoid? \u2022 How much hands-on practice do I really need? \u2022 Should I go for certifications like CompTIA Linux+ or RHCSA, or focus on learning first?</p> <p>Any tips or insights from people who\u2019ve gone through this path would mean a lot. Thanks in advance! Some people suggested this course to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Man-2-man\"> /u/Man-2-man </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/0vktkxk",
