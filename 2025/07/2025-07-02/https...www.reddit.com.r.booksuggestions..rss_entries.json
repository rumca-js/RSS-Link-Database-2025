I need something that\u2019ll hook me <em>immediately</em> to get my momentum back\u2026</p> <p>But I don\u2019t want to be reminded of the heaviness of reality right now. Please nothing that plays on current events or mental health issues\u2026 I want an escape. No smut or primarily romance please (a romance in the book is fine; just not the only / primary plot). </p> <p>Any recommendations?

I really like how in both books they are sort of investigating and attempting to figure out why another character killed themselves. And I want it to be the main storyline, not a side plot. I really like how in The Virgin Suicides the boys or the narrators you could say knew so much yet so little about the Lisbon sisters. I also enjoy the coming of age aspect and how it&#39;s set in High-school, thank you for any recommendations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TouchRealGrass\"> /u/TouchRealGrass </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lpwfpp/a_book_from_the_pov_of_knowing_someone_who_killed/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lpwfpp/a_book_from_the_pov_of_knowing",

Some examples of the types of books I love are The Secret History by Donna Tartt, most of Tana French&#39;s work, Kate Atkinson&#39;s suspenseful novels, some of Karin Slaughters books, all three of Gillian Flynn&#39;s books (apparently I like exclusively female authors in that category!) And I would absolutely love to get recommendations from this amazing community. Thank you so much in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dokelyok\"> /u/dokelyok </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lpixjd/please_give_me_your_best_recommendations_for/\">[link]</a></span> ",

The books I\u2019ve been reading have just been too this or too that or not enough of something else. I feel like Goldilocks, trying to find just the right one. I don\u2019t even know what I want at this point.</p> <p>For context, I like different genres and enjoy reading more than one kind (and at the same time, for variety). I\u2019m not so much into fantasy or sci-fi anymore. If there\u2019s a romance, I prefer it as a side plot and not the main plot between the main male and female character. Not looking for dark themes, SA\u2019s, or existential philosophy.</p> <p>I would say I have read most classics and liked the majority. I think I like mentally stimulating reads that also have character depth.</p> <p>Past reading hits: My Family and Other Animals, A Year in Provence, All Creatures Great and Small</p> <p>The Reading List by",
