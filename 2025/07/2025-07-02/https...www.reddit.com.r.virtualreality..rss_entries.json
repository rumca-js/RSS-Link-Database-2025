I find it unreliable and a bit flimsy; the obvious drawbacks like the limited cone of view which doesn&#39;t allow you to even put your hands to your sides, issues caused by IR emissions from other devices, lighting issues, and issues caused by obstructions, such as one hand resting on the other. I simply want accurate and reliable representations of my hands, though I don&#39;t need full haptic feedback as I do not wish to &quot;feel&quot; the environment. I could shop for pair of gloves, but I often find them too pricey, and they usual come with haptic feed back which increases the price. My question is, is it possible to make minimalistic gloves that track the positions of your hands and fingers through, perhaps, nodes of some kind? Rather than being tracked by IR light and contrast, it would be recorded as movement through space, if that&#39;s the correct way to phrase it.</p",

I&#39;ll try to give some context:</p> <p>So, I&#39;ve owned a quest 2 since launch (Oct. of 2020) and unfortunately it doesn&#39;t really work anymore. It refuses to charge properly and has had controller issues. Anyway, I&#39;ve mainly used the PSVR2 since 2023.</p> <p>I have used the PSVR2 for PCVR, but unfortunately it&#39;s just stopped working recently on my pc due to tracking issues. (And I know it&#39;s not my pc, as it&#39;s a 4070 Super.) So, I was wondering if the Quest 3S is worth it for PCVR? I know it doesn&#39;t have the pancake lenses that everyone insists on, but would it be worthwhile? Also, would it be clearer and less blurry than a PSVR2? I like my PSVR2, but it can be very blurry frequently. I would like the 3, but it just seems a bit too outside of my budget.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cokelord88\"> /u/Cokelord88 </a> <br/> <span><a href",
