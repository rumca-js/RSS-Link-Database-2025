I mostly play singleplayer games like Subnautica, Kingdom Come Deliverance, BeamNG, Assetto Corsa. Are most games just install and play, with no tinkering, no messing with config files and whatnot? I have an NVIDIA GPU, which is why I&#39;m asking as I know the support for those is a bit worse on Linux.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/liright\"> /u/liright </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lq5o6l/does_linux_gaming_in_2025_just_wo",

The two games are majorly CS2 and War Thunder but other games. So my guess is either wayland has some problems with my multi monitor setup and or native linux games just have some problems with wayland(xwayland) in general, but for example setting cs2.sh to wayland doesnt really make it better, if not even worse :/ Gpu gets loaded up to 60-70% and VRAM at most 10 of my 16 gigs, but i cant figure out what the problem might be.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

Around a month ago I have fully switched to linux on my desktop (which has 1070) and everything worked perfectly, but I have an old laptop (2nd gen I5, gt 525m and 8gb ram) running windows 10 that I use from time to time, mainly to do some office or browse the internet and sometime when I&#39;m away from my desktop play warframe on it. The game runs fine on the lowest settings. My question is: if I switch it to arch how can I play warframe on this card which doesn&#39;t support vulkan?

After a while the list became too much to maintain here on Reddit, so I put together this little site.

So my question is - how effective is this strategy to sandbox games and isolate them from my private files (e.g., compared to other solutions like firejail).
