        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Some guy on YouTube recommended RSS to use as a central site for reading information and for taking back control over your information input. This supposedly boosts productivity, because you are not distracted by algorithmic recommendations anymore, like on social media sites. Plus, you won&#39;t have to deal with ads. It was exactly like I was looking for. So over the last 2 days I installed a local FreshRSS instance.</p> <p>Oh boy is it bad.</p> <p>Most sites want you to read articles on their website to generate traffic, so they only provide headlines and small summaries in their feeds. So I&#39;m forced to read the article on their website. This defeats the ENTIRE purpose of RSS. I&#39;m sorry, if you are fine with this, you should configure google news for 5 minutes (lets you subscribe to topics and websites) and you will have a better and more beginner friendly experience than RSS. I didn&#39;t set this up for hours just to read it on the origin",
