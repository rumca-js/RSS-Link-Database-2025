My goal was to create a robust, browser-level solution for IP masking and combating common web tracking techniques, especially for those who want more control over their online anonymity without necessarily needing a full system-wide VPN.</p> <p>Basically, it routes your browser&#39;s web traffic through the Tor network (via a local Tor service) and implements several features to make you less trackable while browsing.</p> <p>The reason why I made it is I want similar browser-level protections of Tor browser but within my regular Chromium browser. Cloaxa aims to fill that gap by integrating Tor proxying with essential anti-tracking features directly into your browser.</p> <p>Check in the github repo if you are interested.
