Let&#39;s say it&#39;s a rugged phone because I only buy them ... mainly because I drop my phone nearly daily from nerve damage in my arm and their battery life is better in the freezing cold. I don&#39;t want something to only last for 2 or 3 hours and when it dies it doesn&#39;t boot back up due to the temps. I go out door to dooring in temperatures such as around -15-24*C in the winter time because it&#39;s simply my job. Let&#39;s say I got a DOOGEE V MAX Plus. How do I use a local account that doesn&#39;t connect to google? I use google voice but I don&#39;t want it my phone to be log into my google account. Neither do I want it to send back information to google because that just drains the battery. Like how to I do it. And let&#39;s say I accidently log in my google account on the main phone, how do I log out of it? I can never figure that out.

What did finally pop up when I did &quot;top cop&quot; in quotes with no AI, was just a few government websites and literally nothing else. I compared the results to Yandex using the first search I tried and the first result was urban dictionary, and the rest on the first page were slang term websites. Night and day difference. First search on Google didn&#39;t show anything relevant.</p> <p>Idk what the problem actually is but this just seems like extremely weird search censorship or something on Googles part.
