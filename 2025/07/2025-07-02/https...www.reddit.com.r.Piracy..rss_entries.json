Could the cyber-crimes-feds not immediately shut down a usenet provider for distributing copyrighted content? I thought the idea of torrenting was that it was fairly anonymous and furthermore the file pieces came from all different places so it was hard to prove any one person broke any laws.

I went through every website linked on the mega thread and could only find the second book in the series. I could probably find them on a torrent website but I don&#39;t even know where to start setting up a torrent on mobile. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated &lt;3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mini_Moron\"> /u/Mini_Moron </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1lpz5cp/need_help_finding_an_audiobook_mobile/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1lpz5cp/need_help_finding_an_audiobook_mobile/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I then give them to them through gmail. The problem being, I don&#39;t have any income and thus don&#39;t have money for extra storage for Google Drive, where I keep all their mp4s. They lead busy lives so most days don&#39;t have time for movies, but I&#39;d like to give the mp4s a permanent home that&#39;s just for them that they can access whenever they have time. My Google Drive only has room for like 10 full size movies and tv episodes. I don&#39;t want to have to make them download them onto their computers because theirs are significantly slower than mine and each file is like 1GB which takes FOREVER to download.</p> <p>Anyway I had an idea that I could upload them all to YouTube, but obviously I can&#39;t because of copyright.

Both apps crash all the time, the search is awful, the video is buffering and low quality because they are currently in court with my countries ISPs, they ban your device for password sharing even though I don\u2019t do it and it\u2019s my f***ing main device. Even though I was paying, the service was so bad, I often switched to a pirate site, because I couldn\u2019t watch the content. While pirate sites with an adblocker just work. And I haven\u2019t even talked about the ads even on the highest tier plans!! Now I am just no longer paying.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fun_Atmosphere8071\"> /u/Fun_Atmosphere8071 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1lplgb6/pirate_sites_are_better_quality_t",
