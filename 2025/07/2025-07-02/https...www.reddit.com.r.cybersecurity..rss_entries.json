        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is a pretty big challenge for a lot of organizations, including ours. Scams these days are getting incredibly sophisticated, way beyond just obvious phishing emails with typos. Attackers are using really clever social engineering tactics, making it super hard for anyone, especially non-technical staff, to tell what&#39;s legitimate and what&#39;s not. They&#39;re often the first point of contact for these things, which puts a huge amount of pressure on them and on our security.</p> <p>We run training, of course, but it sometimes feels like we&#39;re always playing catch-up, and it&#39;s tough to make the material truly stick and be effective against constantly evolving threats. What methods or approaches have you found genuinely work to empower your non-technical teams to spot those subtle, high-level scams before they become a problem?
