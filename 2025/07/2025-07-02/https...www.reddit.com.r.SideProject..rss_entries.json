It\u2019s all pirate-themed, which I know is a little out there, but I wanted something fun that still felt premium.</p> <p>I\u2019m doing everything myself \u2014 the branding, the label design, product photography, scent testing, packaging, Etsy setup, all of it. The oils are small batch, all-natural (jojoba and castor base), and I\u2019ve got two scents so far: The Captain and The Smuggler.</p> <p>I finally launched the Etsy shop about 2 weeks ago. I\u2019ve had 74 views and 47 visits so far, but no sales yet. Right now I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to get early traction without spending money on ads.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the shop if anyone wants to check it out or give feedback: \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://thebeardedcorsair.etsy.com\">https://thebeardedcorsair.etsy.com</a></p> <p>Stuff I\u2019d love help or feedback on: \u2022 Does the pirate theme help or hurt in your opinion",
