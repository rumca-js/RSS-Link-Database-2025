It captures your imagination and you immediately want to be a part of it, you want to learn more\u2026 then you see it\u2026 the Eldar Ulthwe Dreadnought. Tall and slender armed with huge crushing fists and shoulder mounted plasma cannon. You\u2019re blown away by how freaking cool it is. Well, that was me 31 years ago and it had such an impact on me that I decided to channel it\u2019s awesomeness into my Aeldari Wraithlord. I\u2019ll share more pictures and my painting guide in this article. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/07/showcase-aeldari-farseer-and-spiritseer-inc-painting-guides/\">Showcase: Aeldari Farseer and Spiritseer (inc. painting guides)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
