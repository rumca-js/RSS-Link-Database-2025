        "description": "A new computer-modeling study reveals that dust devils on Mars\u2014swirling columns of dust and air\u2014may become electrically charged enough to spark lightning-like discharges. Led by researcher Varun Sheel, the study simulates how dry Martian conditions and frictional collisions between dust grains can generate strong electric fields inside these vortices. These charged whirlwinds pose potential risks to Mars rovers, as electrified dust may cling to solar panels, wheels, and antennas, reducing power and disrupting communications. NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover may have already detected a small electrical discharge during a dust devil encounter. The findings highlight the need for robust, dust-resistant designs in future Mars surface missions.",
