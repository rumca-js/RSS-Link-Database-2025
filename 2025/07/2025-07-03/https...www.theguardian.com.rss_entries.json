It is impossible not to feel a deep sense of pain, sadness and shared heartbreak at news of the sudden death of Diogo Jota and his brother Andr\u00e9 Silva in a car crash in Spain. Jota was 28, father to three young children and a husband to his long-term partner, whom he married 10 days before his death.</p><p>Things that happen in sport are often described, with due dramatic licence, as tragedies.

It is devastating news and still hard to get our head around. Jota was 28, a father of three young children and married his long-term partner Rute Cardoso less than two weeks ago. His younger brother Andr\u00e9 Silva, a footballer for Penafiel, also died in the crash. It is an unimaginable loss for their friends and family to process and we hope they get all the support and love they need. At Anfield, where Jota was adored by Liverpool fans for his goalscoring instinct, pace and combative dribbling style, the club flag is at half-mast and scarves, shirts and other tributes bearing the forward\u2019s name are still being left.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/03/football-daily-email-diogo-jota-rip\">Continue reading...</a>",

She lets the other one sit for 40 minutes before drinking it once it has reached optimum temperature. It is an efficiency \u2013 albeit a tiny one \u2013 that she has been perfecting for two years. A copywriter and online trainer, Pullen, who is 54 and lives on the Isle of Wight with her husband and their chihuahua, says it takes her five minutes to boil a kettle, so she saves five minutes with every other cup.
