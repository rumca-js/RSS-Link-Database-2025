I&#39;m a heavy user of the Save feature on Instagram and I find it really doesn&#39;t do the trick. I have like a dozen or more categories for various countries (especially the Caribbean) or different meme genres (people dancing, people getting hurt, people gagging). Sometimes I find myself wanting to find an old meme or funny video and I can never find it.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried to use instaloader but Instagram definitely does not like it. Saving individual posts isn&#39;t that big a deal, I don&#39;t need to have absolutely everything.</p> <p>On the self-hosting side I think some of the image hosting options like immich kinda sorta work. I would definitely have to develop a good tag system.</p> <p>Has anyone already solved this problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

It took a fair amount of fiddling, but I got it working with Kodi </p> <p>It occurred to me later that because of the way I installed and configured MariaDB, the database itself is being stored in the Buffalo OS boot disk (which I think is probably some kind of flash storage, but don&#39;t really know so pls correct me if wrong!) and not on the NAS disks/RAID array. For some reason that seemed like a bad idea so I got a mount created on the array to be MariaDB&#39;s new default location for databases, and was just about to reconfigure it to point to the new path instead... and <em>only then</em> did it occur to me that maybe leaving it on the OS disk is <em>not</em> a bad idea. It appears to have a capactity of 4gb and with the database fully populated, the disk still has 70% free space due to the lightweight Linux OS </",
