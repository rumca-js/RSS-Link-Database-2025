Hilary Swank is so good in it like you feel everything she\u2019s going through, even in the quiet moments. And Gerard Butler... the way they handled the letters? Literal heartbreak.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a perfect adaptation they changed some things but the feeling is the same.

What sets <em>Palm Springs</em> apart from other romcoms is its balance of genre and emotion. It\u2019s a story about emotional stillness and the fear of moving on. Despite its thematic richness, it never loses it fun charm and clever wit. Not only that, we have very well-written nuanced characters that represents the relationship of the mind and the soul. Whether you see it as an offbeat summer poolside love story or a philosophical cry, Palm Springs sticks the landing by saying: if you\u2019re stuck in hell, at least fall in love with someone who makes it bearable, but in a cool Hawaiian shirt.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CinemaWilderfan\"> /u/CinemaWilderfan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lqitlj/palm_springs_2020_is_another_breezy_feelgood/\">[link]</a",
