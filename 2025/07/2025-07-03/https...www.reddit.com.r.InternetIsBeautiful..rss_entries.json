A lot of people liked it back then, and it\u2019s still actively used today. Since then it gained several new features, but it remains free, app- and account-free and also ad-free! :D</p> <p>Just this week I added \u201cAI\u201d powered suggestions (using embeddings in the background &amp; no third-party service) that connects added items with relevant categories. (Still some bad suggestions at times because the categories are to broad)</p> <p>The best way to get feedback is still by talking to people so if you find this little tool helpful I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!</p> <p>What is it?</p> <p>It\u2019s a simple group packing-list tool to decide who brings what to an occasion (festival, birthday, holidays, camping trips, BBQ, Christmas/Thanksgiving dinner, or any other gathering). With it you avoid duplicate items, forgotten i",
