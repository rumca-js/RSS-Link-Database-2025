So I have a friend who is trans ftm. He uses he they pronouns and identifies as male and I respect that (I am nb and use all pronouns). What I don&#39;t understand is that my friend presents fully femme. He puts forth no effort to look masc. he says that he doesn&#39;t experience any dysphoria and enjoys looking like &quot;a hot woman&quot;. I genuinely don&#39;t get this. For me the way I present is a bug part of my gender identity so I don&#39;t understand him. Is there anyone else who feels how he does, and can you please explain it better to me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BelleTheGemini\"> /u/BelleTheGemini </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1lqt7j7/i_dont_fully_understand_my_trans_friend/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
