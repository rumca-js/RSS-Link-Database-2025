It is designed for Linux systems and prioritizes simplicity, transparency, and user control. There are no background processes, no sync services, no accounts, and no telemetry. The editor runs entirely on your local machine, using standard system tools. It is, in every sense, just cheese and code.</p> <p>The interface supports multiple open files across tabs, with persistent tab state and real time dirty tracking. The UI is dark by default, with soft gold and pastel highlights chosen to reduce visual strain during long editing sessions. Saving and committing are explicit actions.</p> <p>Cheesy Mamas includes syntax highlighting for Python, C, and LaTeX. A built in language toggle allows you to select the appropriate highlighter for each file, and a run button executes code directly: Python scripts are pass",
