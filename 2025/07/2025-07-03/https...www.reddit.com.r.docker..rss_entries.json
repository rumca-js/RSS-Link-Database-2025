If I use this image on the device that built it to create a container, the containers works as expected. However, if i save and load it on another machine, the containers do not work. I have found so far that if I manually install Windows SDK on a running container on the second device, it does not work, but if I do that on a Dockerfile with the original image as base image, it does not. Calling mt.exe shows no output and if I echo status code it shows as -1073741819, which online says access violation. Does anyone have any idea what this might be?
