        "description": "Marissa Dionne Mead, an architect known for designing inclusive, story-rich environments, explores how public art can foster equity and civic connection. Mead demonstrates how community-centered design and integrated art can transform public space into a catalyst for dialogue, belonging and lasting social impact. Drawing on her experience leading public projects, Mead argues that the process of creating public art is as vital as the final work itself.",
