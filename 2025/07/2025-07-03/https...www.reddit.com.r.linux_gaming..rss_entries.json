Whenever I launch games that use proton they will stop responding for about 45 seconds and then load like normal. Any idea what&#39;s causing this? It&#39;s very annoying as it happens every time I launch the games.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So for whatever reason on LMDE I lost the ability to play Robocop on steam. Tried different proton versions and Ge proton versions but it still wont launch. I already beat the game but wanted to replay it. So I have two puters on my desk, a sff with a 3070 and a 57003xd and my main rig with a 4070 super ti, 58003xd. Both were running LMDE but haven&#39;t used the little guy in awhile. I have never used an arch distro. So I said what the hell and installed Cachy OS on the little guy. After install I downloaded a meta gaming package offered by Cachy OS. Installed steam, downloaded Robocop, used cachy proton version and Robocop booted right up. Its a rolling distro, have never utilized one and its my first arch distro. Now I&#39;m thinking about trying LMDE SID. What would be the best way to transition from LMDE to LMDE SID? Or should I try LMDE Trixie? Thanks for any tips</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

So I went ahead and installed it on my main PC and &quot;it just worked.&quot; It installed properly, installing the nvidia driver was super easy. I was really enjoying it but there were some things that were annoying. The POP OS Store always runs an update check when you open it which I was doing constantly. It was also slow and laggy with searches and found myself using apt searches to find stuff. Later I found out there is the Cosmic store which fixes all this. Also I was having random lock ups which sometimes would be for a short while or would require a reboot. Gaming I only tested a few things.

As a test, I installed Linux on my old gaming laptop a Lenovo Ideapad Y700ISK (17-inch).</p> <p>I\u2019m having some random negative experiences with games, mostly involving soft locks. Sometimes when a soft lock occurs, I can fix it by pressing alt+tab. Other times, if I hold alt+tab, I can see the game continues to run in the background, but as soon as I release the keys to return to the game, it soft locks again.</p> <p>One of the most frustrating parts is that sometimes during the soft lock, my keyboard stops working entirely, even though I can still move the mouse.

I was able to get battle.net and wow installed but then was getting &quot;your 3d accelerator is not supported&quot; error. Just too old now?</p> <p>If someone has it running, could you share your setup? Would a particular distro or runner be more compatible? </p> <p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AmSometimesFunny\"> /u/AmSometimesFunny </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lqciwn/world_of_warcraft_mints_of_lindari",
