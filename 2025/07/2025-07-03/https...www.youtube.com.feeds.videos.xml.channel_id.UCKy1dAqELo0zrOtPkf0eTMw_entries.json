To name a few, Jason Mamoa is Blanka, Roman Reigns is Akuma, David Dastmalchian is M. Bison, and 50 Cent is Balrog. It\u2019s completely all over the place, and considering director Kitao Sakurai\u2019s background is in comedy like The Eric Andre Show and Bad Trip, we\u2019re thinking maybe it\u2019s not going to take itself totally seriously? The more we think about this movie, the more excited we are, so here\u2019s hoping that - if nothing else - it\u2019s not boring.\n\nThis week\u2019s show is Max Scoville, Jada Griffin, Brian Altano, and is produced by Nick Maillet\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
