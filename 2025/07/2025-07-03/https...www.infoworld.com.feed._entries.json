Meanwhile, the growing toll of telemetry data that keeps piling up, such as logs, metrics and traces, becomes costlier by the minute. But one thing is clear: You do not have to compromise visibility just to reduce costs.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is all about strategies and top practices that can help optimize your cloud observability spend for you to derive value from your monitoring investments without breaking the bank.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" ",
