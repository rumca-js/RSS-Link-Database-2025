I typically enjoy fiction, but am not really interested in fantasy or romance. I am feeling quite lost in my healing journey and part of it feels like it comes from my lack of connection with other people and their stories - I feel like I need something that tells me that everything will be okay, no matter how crazy life has become. I am hoping to avoid things that reek of &#39;toxic positivity&#39; or anything overtly optimistic - I want something more on the realistic side.

So I think I have a very specific interest in book tropes that I haven\u2019t felt like I\u2019ve seen a lot (very well written ones that hit you in the right spot I mean). Here are some of my very detailed preferences in books or any other media that can be consumed to be honest. Please let me know if you have any recs for me that feel like this or anything similar to it :) </p> <p>My Ideal Genre &amp; Vibe: - Romantic Fantasy (with dark or high fantasy settings preferred) - Angsty, character driven romance - Often fits into Upper YA or New Adult territory (even if it\u2019s classified YA, I like mature emotional and sensual intensity)</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>My Romance Type (Core Preferences): - Straight romance, male/female pairings - Male-lead: obsessed/possessive/down bad trope - Female lead is powerful/emotionally distant/reserved (but still central) - Male lead yearns, suffers, aches for her: he\u2019s the emotionally intense one - Mutual pining but unbalanced i",

I also love a lot of classics like The Count of Monte Cristo, Peter Pan, and anything Jane Austen. I read Novik&#39;s other similar setting book Spinning Silver and also really liked it. But something about Uprooted&#39;s wild forest and baba yaga soft magic and Earthiness plus fierce female friendship absolutely tore a hole in me. Any recommendations? I dont looooove Romantasy with heavy panting spicy scenes. But if they feel earned in the plot/by the characters then I dont mind them.

But I am wondering if there\u2019s any books similar to Signalis! I also really enjoyed I saw the tv glow and Tokyo ghoul! Based on these three things I picked out can I get some recommendations please? I hope to get some on Signalis mostly since that\u2019s what I came for! Any book recommendations work too! So far I\u2019ve read blood meridian, touching spirit bear, devils arithmetic, tangerine, I\u2019ve read more than that I\u2019ve forgotten what else but those were really good books and I am in the process of reading The road! Thanks for the book recommendations in advance!</p> <p>Edit: I am not sure if my music taste will do any good but I\u2019ll add it just for safe measure maybe I\u2019ll find someone with similar taste and I\u2019ll get a good book! I like Radiohead,the smiths,mitski, yeule, and alex g!</p> <p>Se",

I haven&#39;t sat down and read a book probably since middle school. I am working on my mental health, and I figured a good way to do that was to get some reading done. Back in middle school, I loved Margaret Peterson Haddix&#39;s &quot;Shadow Children&quot; series, along with &quot;The Missing&quot; series. With that being said, I suppose I would like science fiction, maybe some mystery/suspense.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey! I was looking for a book recommendation for a fantasy book that takes place in a town/village. I was a big fan of the Belgariad series as a kid so I was looking for something with a similar vibe. Think something that gives the feeling of a D&amp;D campaign but instead of following a quest it just takes place in a single town. I also just finished the show Frieren: Beyond Journey\u2019s End so if any of yall have seen or read that something with that kind of vibe would be great! Genre doesn\u2019t matter too much to me but a chiller slice of life or romance would be preferable. Not sure if it\u2019s important but I\u2019m a guy \u2014I don\u2019t mind whether the central character is a man or woman however.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fluffy_Seesaw4129\"> /u/Fluffy_Seesaw4129 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lqco6i/slice_of_life_fantasy_that_takes_place_in_a/\">[link]</a></span",
