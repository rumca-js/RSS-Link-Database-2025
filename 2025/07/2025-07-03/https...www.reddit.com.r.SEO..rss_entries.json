I&#39;ve been trying to optimize our core web vitals a lot, slowly but steadily getting the hang of optimizing for LCP and CLS.</p> <p>Now that INP is one of the metrics that Search Console is reporting on, I&#39;m having a hard time pinpointing and identifying the source of the issue, therefore having trouble optimizing it to go lower than 200ms. I&#39;m trying to look at it through Inspect &gt; Performance and just clicking identifiable buttons that could lead me to a conclusion but nothing as clear as what LCP or CLS reports. Does anyone have any recommended resources to learn this? Or any resources to help learn the Inspect elements?</p> <p>That would be a great help.

We\u2019re trying to reach 100,000 signatures and are currently at 60,000, which has been a lot of effort. But one of the stumbling blocks we come up against is a difficulty working out where our current flow (c.620 sign ups per day) is coming from. And then overnight last night we had 3,000 new sign ups and we have no idea what drove that!</p> <p>Maybe I\u2019m being naive but is there any tried and tested ways of retrospectively ascertaining where traffic is coming from? The petition is hosted via the government petitions platform so we don\u2019t have access to analytics there (beyond geographic data for some reason). Any tips gratefully received.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PottedNick\"> /u/PottedNick </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1lqjx61/analysing_tra",
