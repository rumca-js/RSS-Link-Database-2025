On Tuesday, July 1, Kimalu, who was born at Shedd, underwent a first-of-its-kind surgery to remove a growing network of cysts near her blowhole on her head and neck. In the process, Kimalu became the first known beluga in the world to recover from general anesthesia. The surgery was supported by nearly 30 experts from Shedd and across the country in the fields of zoological medicine, surgery and anesthesia.",
