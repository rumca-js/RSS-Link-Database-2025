I loved Wheel of Time (but I&#39;m not looking for another epic like that right now!). I&#39;m sorry to say I hated A Song of Ice and Fire. I gave it 3 tries - once when book 1 came out, and twice over the years when I was older. </p> <p>I love lyrical prose or prose that can be crude (one of the best books I read has paragraphs dedicated to a prank where the characters played on this one character that made him have the runs and it was described in vivid detail). </p> <p>I&#39;m a huge fan of Anne Bishop&#39;s Black Jewels series as well as lighthearted reads like Song of the Lioness and the rest of the Tortal books. </p> <p>When it comes to fantasy, I&#39;m pretty much open minded. So hit me with your favourite series! Your could not put downs and your keep going back for mores! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",

I was wrong. The prose is remarkable. The power system makes sense. And if you\u2019re a fan of Grimdark, Kristoff will continue to pull the rug under you every time you develop feelings of hope.</p> <p>As for criticisms, yes the protagonist is an edgelord with one liners that get exhausting. But keep reading, he does become more nuanced towards the end and in the second book. </p> <p>I\u2019m looking forward to the 3rd book coming out this November!

Consider a LI who is a princess, but turns out she is oppressed by the king or the prince, the hero has to save her. No thank you. I want a LI who is powerful in both name and action. She can be a princess with power, a leader of an organization,a queen etc.</p> <p>Also. I dont want the guy chasing after her for number of books, then she finally realises but too late they can&#39;t be together shit(Eragon). I also don&#39;t mind if she is introduced in later books.</p> <p>If she is older than he, it is even better.</p> <p>MC does not need to be a poor boy. He can be of high status too..</p> <p>Lastly, they must have a happy ending.</p> <p>I look for your vast suggestions(no harem pls)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impossibl",

Looking for some advice on what to read next (well\u2026 more so listen to next as I\u2019ve mostly been opting for audiobooks as of late).</p> <p>What I\u2019ve read/listened to and enjoyed recently: Stormlight Archive, First Law Series, The Devils, Kingkiller Chronicle, Wheel of Time (in progress, but need to take breaks.. will get back to it eventually)</p> <p>My favorites would probably be the First Law Series (characters, humor &amp; Steven Pacey) or Kingkiller (prose, world building, magic system).</p> <p>A few more notes\u2026 Gave the first Mistborn book a shot a few years back and although I may return to books 2 and 3 at some point, I\u2019d like to take a break from Sanderson for a while after Wind and Truth. Tried Lies of Locke Lamora, but it didn\u2019t really pull me in.</p> <p>I\u2019ve come up with some options for my next read/listen based on browsing previous posts on this sub, Goodreads lists, etc.: Dungeon Crawler Carl, The Tainted Cup, The Blacktongue Thief,",

I&#39;m looking for a very specific genre/niche that I&#39;ve been interested in but have been struggling to find it in western novels. I&#39;ve read many eastern novels with this general theme where an engineer or an alchemist gets transported to another world and uses their modern knowledge - be it medical, alchemy, or even engineering to improve general life, hygiene, or even for political/business reasons. I tried a bit of AI to find a few recommendations but man they are really really bad at that. Hopefully you guys can get me a few picks? I personally prefer a slight emphasis on slice of life, but im down for whatever the pacing or &quot;genre&quot; it would be. </p> <p>Examples: Ascendance of a bookworm, Dr.Stone (Sorta), Release that Witch, A chemist&#39;s rise in another world, World Walker Park. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",
