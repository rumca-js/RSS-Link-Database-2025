        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It was an absurdist type comedy adventure game. It&#39;s Medieval Steam Punk fantasy. Sort of like a Discworld. It has three protagonists, soldiers of fortune. One human character who wears a red bandana mask in the fashion of a Western Stage robber, a humanoid person with an eagles head, and some abiguous thing in a suit armor. The human has Blunderbuss type weapon, and don&#39;t remember the plot, but think a baby is involved somehow. I think it&#39;s windows 95-98 game, it came on CD Rom. I lost it over the years and it seems like nobody else has heard of it. The human also had a cockney english accent. I thought the title was in the vein of smoking barrels or lock and loaded something. It had cut scenes and part of the game was tower defense type stuff like manning some type of heavy artillery or repeating swivel mount type weapon. Its graphics were pretty cartoonish, and it was 3D, but not open world,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",

I bought an &quot;adaptor&quot; that passively converts my modern USB keyboard so I can plug it into the system. It is a keyboard from &quot;wasdkeyboards.com&quot;. It is a TKL version (without the number pad on the right size), and I wanted a full size one, so I went there to buy one and they were out of business.</p> <p>Since then I have tried about a dozen keyboards and can&#39;t get any other keyboards to work via the USB to PS/2 converter. I googled around and apparently need an &quot;active&quot; converter, since most modern keyboards don&#39;t have whatever they need to be recognized on an older system.</p> <p>I can only find &quot;activ",

So I just finished a play through of Vagrant Story (PS1) for the first time in over a decade and was kinda shook by how much it feels like a proto-Souls game. The battle mechanics, cryptic world, weapon systems and general desolate tone remind me a lot of what we see in later on in games like DS3 or Bloodborne. </p> <p>Makes me wonder about and appreciate just how many more retros were ahead of their time that might not have gotten the credit they deserve due in their hey day; pushing boundaries with things that influenced or flat out became core staples now. </p> <p>Anyone else see the connection(might be the only one and I\u2019m alright with that..haha!), or have any other retro games that feel like they influenced what we get now?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gamer_Rx\"> /u/Gamer_Rx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1lqug5d/vagran",

It was a open world and you were a wizard, there were also a lot other players and everyone had a own name you could choose. I don&#39;t remember much of it, like what u were supposed to do in the game. I know the characters had a wizard hat. I think there were animals, like horses but im not sure. You could also fight with monsters i think? As i said I dont really remember but i really want to find this game.
