Loaded up Rush VR and had some fun till my arms got tired. Then I loaded up Stilt and played for 3 minutes. Then I realized how sick I was getting, but I tried to power through. Big mistake. Soon after I threw my headset off and put a trash can in front of myself. I was going to vomit. Just a matter of time. Oh god.. Here it comes.. I feel my stomach start to jump up.. and.. it went away. Right at the edge of no return. WTF? I have never gotten that sick from VR... And you&#39;d think with all the experience I have it wouldn&#39;t be possible. But I guess I lost my VR legs? It was bad. I was literally thinking about selling my whole VR set up during that feeling and I am a bit scared to jump back in.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NES64Super\"> /u/NES64Super </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

Obviously, there weren&#39;t many real games but I do remember one game that had full movement and I did get motion sickness. I remember after a few days or so being able to play for like 30 minutes while having slight motion sickness. I eventually abandoned the headset after a year or so because lack of games.</p> <p>From my experience, playing stationary games do not help at all with building tolerance. So what I&#39;d like to do now is come up with like 5 games that I can play in order that start from low motion sickness and then progressively gets a little more intense with each game.

Into The Radius 2 is currently my favorite VR game and the first ITR is the only VR game where I&#39;ve played all the way through over 4 times.</p> <p>Both games offer their own unique experience, while still capturing what makes Into The Radius so special. Between the atmosphere, the best storage system in any game, modularity of backpacks and armor, unique enemies, eerie environments, realistic lighting, audio, weapon variety &amp; attachments, gunplay, the co-op, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Astienth/IntoTheRadius2_bHaptics_ForceTube\">now bHaptics &amp; ProVolver mod support,</a> it brings that &#39;WOW&#39; factor every time I load up.</p> <p>Not only have the developers been doing updates to improve ITR2 regularly, but you can see they care about what their community thinks. It&#39;s really cool to see suggestions that have been made, on Discord or Reddit, make it into the game.<",

I don&#39;t want to spend all that money to load it up and not play any games, I&#39;m confused by the whole scene tbh. Do I have to buy a specific brand to connect to Xbox? Will I be able to just use the VR headset alone to play said games? Will the fact I&#39;m on my phone slow down the games and make it jittery? Sometimes I&#39;ll experience lag and input delay, but if I&#39;m doing all of that and playing VR, just feels like it would end up unplayable. Don&#39;t know enough and anytime I try to educate myself, it feels like they&#39;re just selling the product and not giving me the fine print. I don&#39;t want to was",
