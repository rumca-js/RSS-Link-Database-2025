I have talked to him and tried to settle it to no avail.</p> <p>I have gone on to research ways to hijack it or turn it off, and have found you can use a raspberry pi to do some kind of attack and turn off the speaker. The problem is, I have a very basic understanding of the raspberry pi, I know it is a small cheap computer you can use to program cool projects, but I&#39;m not a coder or very tech-savvy at all. </p> <p>I could spend weeks learning how to use it and try to figure something out, but I thought I&#39;d come here to see if I could get some help first. Would using a raspberry pi to disable a nearby bluetooth speaker be possible? If so, would it hard? And how would I go about it?</p> <p>I would greatly appreciate if someone could tell me how to do this, I&#39;m desperate at this point. It would be so helpful and relieving to h",
