Andrews saga: Flowers in the Attic, Petals on the Wind, If There Be Thorns, Seeds of Yesterday, and even the dark prequel, Garden of Shadows. I was fascinated by the macabre, by the gothic resilience of those flower-like children withering in the dust. The story was terrible, yes, but it was a dark fairy-tale kind of terror. The incest, the cruelty, the abandonment\u2026 they were pieces of a hideous puzzle that I could assemble from a safe distance. The transgressions were just that: broken rules in a grim game of survival. I understood everything, and nothing shook me. Honestly, I don&#39;t think it was premature reading. At that age, I had already read considerably worse things, and I believe it helped me mature.</p> <p>What astounds me is what&#39;s happening now, in my thirties, upon deciding to return to that attic.
