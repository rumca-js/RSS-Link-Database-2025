        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am excited to see notebooks and desktops on RISC-V in the near future. In my search about any news on that topic i stumbled upon the announcement of RVA23 and how it was being haled as a step towards end-user CPUs. But many Lignux distros already are building for riscv like Debian for example.</p> <p>So my question is do i understand this correctly that currently that for example Debian is building against generic 64 bit little endian riscv cores that will be compatible with RVA23 Cores.<br/> And builds for rva23 like ubuntu is/will be doing are not compatible with all generic 64 bit little endian riscv cores?</p> <p>If so what are the bonuses of compiling against RVA23 for distros? Are the performance gains really that high? Because even before RVA23 riscv cpus had reasonable performance for their specs. For me a person with little to none knowledge about riscv is look like a x86_64, x86_64_2, x86_64_3, x86_64_4 situation. Please explain this to me",
