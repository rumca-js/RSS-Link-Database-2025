        "description": "Everdark Sovereign SENTIENT PEST UPDATE & GAMEPLAY, TIPS & New GEAR\nSo the new Everdark Sovereign Sentient Pest boss just dropped. I'm going to be showing you guys the gameplay of our boss fight here. This is another boss we got down on the first try. I actually think this is the easiest of the three bosses that we've faced so far, which kind of sucks if I'm totally honest. I feel like maybe they should have changed the order of these bosses a bit because the Gaping Jaw was so difficult compared to the Darkdrift Knight and Sentient Pest. I feel like they set an expectation and now it's kind of a letdown as the bosses are getting easier and easier. If they maybe flip the order of these bosses and ramp up, getting harder and harder. I think people would probably be happier.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign Wiki: https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Nightreign+Wiki\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 Everdark Sovereign Event\n0:34 New Relic\n1:57 Sentient Pest Gnoster Event\n5:30 Ending the Fight ",
