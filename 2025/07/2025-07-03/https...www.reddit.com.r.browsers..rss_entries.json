I must say it is quite nice and especially all the features it has and integrations with windows make it really good and easy to use.</p> <p>Now that summer is here i had time to use different browsers and found out i dont like most chromium browsers.</p> <p>Chrome is instant nope<br/> Brave UI felt clunky and bloated<br/> Opera is crap.</p> <p>So already having tried numerous firefox forks i decided to use edge since of all the advantages and integrations it had with windows and the fact it was already installed.</p> <p>I have a powerful system with 32gb ram, Ryzen 7 5700x and an RX 7800xt.
