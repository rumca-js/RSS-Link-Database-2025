My understanding is that the most secure way to use it is to enable Tailnet lock and not expose any self-hosted services to the internet (ie, you can only access the services when connected to Tailscale), but I&#39;m a bit confused what information this setup still <em>theoretically</em> exposes to Tailscale? If they wanted to, what information would I be trusting them with in terms of the actual data being sent across the network, what I&#39;m hosting, etc. </p> <p>Related to the above point, I know that a potential solution for enhanced privacy is to run Headscale on cheap VPS. However, if you go that route, are you not then trusting the VPS company with a lot of information? Couldn&#39;t they easily access the VPS and see what you&#39;re running and be able to connect to the services running on your network?</p> <p>I&#39;ve also seen some people runni",

It&#39;s pretty basic, but it looks nice and has all the expected controls. There isn&#39;t a user system, so anyone hitting the service will share feeds.</p> <p>I made it deployable by docker compose, so you should just have to copy the git repo to your server, deploy with &quot;docker compose up -d&quot;, and then browse to &lt;ip address&gt;:3000. Since it was 95% coded with AI, I made it open-source MIT license and <a href=\"https://github.com/hexydes/rss-reader\">tossed it on Github</a>. Feel free to use it, fork it, or do whatever with it. If I think of anything else I want to add, I might update the repo, but it was hard enough getting the AI to pump this out before it lost all context of what it was doing.\ud83d\ude02</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
