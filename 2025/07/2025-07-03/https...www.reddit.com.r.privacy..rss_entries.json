I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s bc my country that I&#39;d rather not mention here recently passed &quot;age verification&quot; laws, do you think that&#39;s it ? Is there a workaround ? If it&#39;s country related, I guess a VPN could do, unfortunatly I don&#39;t have one bc I only rely on my cellular data and things won&#39;t load with my VPN on, so a VPN is out of the question. Is there any other option ? Can I expect this for NewPipe as well ?
