But if you want to go big and beautiful to show off your four-figure gaming desktop\u2019s raw pixel-pushing power, you want 4K resolution. And today you can get it in OLED monitor form for a great price. Amazon has an MSI 32-inch 4K OLED <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MAG-321CUP-QD-OLED-Adaptive-Synch/dp/B0DPXZP328/?th=1\">for just $749.99</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MSI MAG 321CUP (catchy!) was already something of a budget design, at least in the very specific subcategory of 4K OLED monitors, at $900. With a $150 discount it\u2019s cheaper than any 4K OLED gaming monitor I\u2019ve seen, at least in new condition. It has a pretty standard array of specs for OLEDs at this point, including 165Hz of refresh and .03ms response time. That\u2019s not the fastest in the world even for OLEDs, but",

Or even just making a quick grocery run while leaving your pets behind? A home Wi-Fi security camera with a remote live feed that you can check in on whenever you want, wherever you want!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m talking about something like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG2VS5FD/\">this Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Cam</a>, which is now down to its best price ahead of Prime Day: $40 (was $80). This is an early Prime Day deal, so you\u2019ll need a Prime sub to take advantage\u2014but if you aren\u2019t a Prime member, all you have to do is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime\">start a free 30-day Prime trial</a>. With it, you\u2019ll also be able to score Prime Day deals next week!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need for this security camera is the Ring app. Once you\u2019re connected, you can peek in at any time via the Live Vie",

A grifter can steal money faster by flooding the world with so many different tactics, like fake text messages, deceptive emails, malicious websites, and bad search engine results. Trying not to get tripped up is complicated. It\u2019s something I\u2019m always aware of when sharing best practices with others.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But when I recently spoke with ethical hacker Mike Danseglio, I got a surprise tip that makes avoiding scams so much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be suspicious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people start from a place of trust first. But constantly scanning for ill intent is more work for our brains\u2014especially now as scammers get more sophisticated and persistent. Instead, if you default to thinking it could be a trick, you\u2019ll naturally screen more carefully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least, I know I do. I ask my",

Here\u2019s one such deal: the gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BFC7WQ6R/\">Amazon Echo Spot has been slashed down to just $45</a>. That\u2019s 44% off its $80 MSRP and matches the best price it\u2019s ever been.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 version of the Echo Spot has a sleek redesign that sets it apart from previous models. Instead of the big speaker we normally associate with the Echo line, this one is more of a proper digital display with the speaker as more of a supplement. This change in design makes it easy to spot the time, weather, or media playback at a glance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you won\u2019t need to ask Alexa about the time anymore since it\u2019s all there on the display, the voice assistant is still easy to access.
