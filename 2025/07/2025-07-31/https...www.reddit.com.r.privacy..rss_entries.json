This is alone is understandable, since it allows Tuta to send emails between two accounts in fully encrypted fashion.

This helps mask your use of Tor from censors by making it appear as though you\u2019re on a audio or video call instead.</p> <p>Snowflake is a relatively new circumvention technology, part of the Pluggable Transports family, that is continuously being improved. Pluggable Transports disguise a Tor bridges\u2019 traffic by making it look like a regular connection rather than a Tor connection, adding another layer of obfuscation.</p> ",
