The plan is to focus on SEO, grow traffic organically, and eventually monetize through affiliate links, maybe some ads or sponsored posts if it gains traction.</p> <p>The main goal is to make it one of those sites people actually <em>bookmark</em> or tell their friends about when they say \u201cWhere can I learn about all this AI stuff?\u201d. Does this sound like something worth pursuing? Or has it been done to death already?</p> <p>I\u2019d really appreciate any thoughts(good or bad) especially from anyone who\u2019s tried something similar or just has a good sense for online content businesses.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jess1990ya\"> /u/Jess1990ya </a> <br/> <s",
