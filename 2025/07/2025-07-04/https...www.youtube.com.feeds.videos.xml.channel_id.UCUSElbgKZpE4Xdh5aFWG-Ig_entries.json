        "description": "Poppy fields during flowering are considered one of the most beautiful sights. The bright red color of the poppies against the green grass creates a stunning visual effect. Many people come specifically to admire these fields and take photos.\n\nDon't forget that this is 360\u00a0video: you can change the angle of view.\r\nIf you enjoyed this video please like, share, comment, favorite, subscribe: https://goo.gl/NZMdaz \nWe regularly publish new 360 videos of the most beautiful places on our planet!\n\n360\u00b0 photos and videos, stories of our shootings, articles and FAQ you can find on our website: http://AirPano.com\n\nHere is the answer for a frequently asked question about true resolution of an 8K 360\u00b0 video. Unlike standard videos, in a 360\u00b0 video you can see only a part of original image (approximately 30 degrees out of 360). As result, the real resolution of the part you can see isn't bigger than 1.3K.\n\nPlease note that AirPano team originally shoots its films in 16,12,10,8K resolution, dependi",
