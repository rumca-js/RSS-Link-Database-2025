I&#39;ve been trying to get into reading lately and I know I LOVE books with adventure - like the plot is interesting and going somewhere. Romance - preferably a enemies/friends to lovers but any will do! TWISTS AND TURNS or shock endings are always my fave. Any form of crime like murder mystery or planned robbery etc. </p> <p>I would also like the book to feel like it&#39;s real life. Not a book about robots or supernatural or something lol, although this is a minor thing </p> <p>I really liked books such as the money heist series by ally carter. </p> <p>If anyone has any suggestions please share, I would really appreciate it! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dstar242\"> /u/Dstar242 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lrvxod/looking_for_a_book_with_romance_adventure_twists/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksugge",

And thanks to that book, I started to read other books you could call &quot;disturbing&quot; (I have no mouth and I must scream, Frankenstein, No longer human). </p> <p>Now I need other books that can make me feel the same things.

This is a bit of a weird thing to ask but I\u2019m really tired of seeing little representation in features that aren\u2019t stereotypical blue/colored eyes, and straight blonde/lighter hair. Most fantasy romance books I see are always describing blonde hair women, with colored eyes and I honestly would just love to know of a fantasy romance book with a female lead that actually looks like me! I\u2019m usually chill and just forget about it when reading a book with a character that has the stereotypical description of colored eyes and light hair, but sometimes I just really crave a character that I can see myself in, not just personality wise but also in her looks. I also would love to see similar features of mine being appreciated by the male love interest (: so if anyone has any book recs where the character has curly hair and dark eyes please list them! P",
