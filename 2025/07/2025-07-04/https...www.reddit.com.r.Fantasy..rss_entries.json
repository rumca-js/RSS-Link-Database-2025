There are things i did not get from the first trilogy that I would appreciate being explained without spoiling anything from the tawnyman trilogy. So if any of my questions will most like key be answered in the second trilogy please say so.</p> <p>1- How did the red ship raiders made the kidnapped ppl &quot;soul less&quot;. Was it the skill or the wit? Or were the red ship raiders the first victims of the skill? Honestly I read it in french so maybe I&#39;m using the wrong terms.</p> <p>2- whats up with that white ship Fitz used to be the only one to see?</p> <p>3- what was the ghost city about? why was it so &quot;futuristic&quot;? Which power allowed fitz to see it? I get that there was a river of skill? And thats how verity got a boost of power to free the dragons from stone? Why were they even in stone. </p> <p>4-what was that woman on the drag",

Some listed it as an anticipated book this year, but perhaps didn&#39;t find it discussion worthy or talked about it elsewhere.</p> <p>This series is a retelling of Caesar and Cleopatra (Book I) and Antony and Cleopatra (Book II) with gender swapped characters and set in the far future. The Egyptian ruler has a pearl that allows her to speak with the ghost of the Alexander the Great character, as well as access to a significant amount of wealth generating resources. Book 1 ended with the Caesar character&#39;s assassination. </p> <p>Book 2 picks up with the Liberators War already over and only one assassin of the Caesar character alive. And this perhaps illustrates the biggest weakness of book 2. While the pacing of book 1 wasn&#39;t perfect, it didn&#39;t detract from the story. Book 2 is very uneven. Sometimes the passage of a paragraph can be the passage of years",

And that made me think, what is it about fights in the snow that makes me appreciate them more? I came up with a few reasons:</p> <ol> <li><p>The warrior nation in fantasy is often in the colder region of the fantasy world so you are just more likely to have a good fight scene.</p></li> <li><p>The clumsiness of the fight because of the snow makes it better as the author has to include the importance of weather and terrain.</p></li> <li><p>Just the aesthetic in general. When I imagine the fight in my head, the image I get is more vivid if it&#39;s in a winter landscape (This might be just personal, you tell me).</p></li> </ol> <p>What do you guys think?

A few things really bother me:</p> <p>First off, Cristoff always describes Dior as the &quot;orphaned street urchin and thief,&quot; but in the book, I find it hard to believe. The extent of her thievery seems limited to picking a few locks here and there. I expected her character to be much more morally ambiguous, given her background, but she&#39;s surprisingly kind and helpful to everyone. I think a character described as a thief should have more complexity and selfishness. It feels like a case of &quot;show, don&#39;t tell,&quot; where Cristoff tells us she&#39;s a thief but doesn&#39;t really show it.</p> <p>Secondly, the back-and-forth between Gabriel and Dior, while enjoyable initially, becomes tiresome in the second book.

However, the only real reason for this that I can find is because it\u2019s his only \u201cWestern\u201d book, and a bit of a departure from his other, more straightforward fantasy novels. </p> <p>This feels like a strange reason to dislike a book, or even rate it lower than the others, especially given the fact that, in my opinion, every other aspect from the character building, plot, action, etc. is easily up to par with the rest. </p> <p>Is there something I\u2019m missing here that contributes to the mixed opinions? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/atticus-redfinch\"> /u/atticus-redfinch </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www",

I did ditch The Witcher and Skyrim after only 2-3 hours but I played like quarter way into act 2 of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.</p> <p>I really want to get into one but I just can&#39;t, but I want to because I love the setting and all the elements in it like magic, dragons, adventurer guilds, different races, everything about it. are there any fantasy game recommendations you can give me or should I try again with ones I&#39;ve played before? I really don&#39;t get it because its almost every fantasy game I own, there are a couple exceptions like monster hunter but I want to play more.</p> <p>The issue with Baldur&#39;s gate 3 for me was that when I got to act 2 there were a lot of places I felt like I shouldn&#39;t be in because I was losing so hard",

I keep trying to read the popular fantasy series&#39; and finding they are fun reads, no regrets, but just not the depth I&#39;m longing for.</p> <p>I read a comment referring to Ursula K LeGuin&#39;s A Wizard of Earthsea as &quot;philosophical fantasy&quot; and that term resonated with me. Are there others that could be called philosophical fantasy? </p> <p>Other books I love deeply that I feel could fit this are below. Many are middle grade because I have been rereading some with my children but they are still so rich and beautiful: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe - CS Lewis The Girl Who Drank the Moon - Kelly Barnhill The Beatryce Prophecy - Kate DiCamillo (Possibly even Holes by Louis Sachar) A Wrinkle in Time - Madeleine L&#39;Engle Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell - Susanna Clarke (my favorite) Piranesi - Sus",
