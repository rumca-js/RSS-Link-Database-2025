        "description": "In this third episode of our Behind the Scenes series, discover how Cercle Odyssey went from a vision on paper to a traveling immersive experience. \nBehind the scenes, a silent ballet was playing out. A dance between technicians, scenographers, and artists moving together with precision to brought this nomadic structure to life. Each step, each placement was carefully choreographed, driven by the search of emotion, to become what was experienced.\n\nTo capture and amplify this moment, We worked with L-Acoustics to create a fully immersive 360\u00b0 sound experience, where every note is felt as much as heard.\nWith Synology, we secured and organized every bit of footage captured across continents, ensuring every moment could be safely preserved and shared.\n\nFrom the first light to the final note, every detail was designed to move, connect and resonate.\n\nJOIN EVENTS & DISCOVER MUSIC\n\n\u27a4 Join Cercle Odyssey immersive events: [https://Cercle.lnk.to/CercleOdysseyID](https://cercle.lnk.to/CercleOdys",
