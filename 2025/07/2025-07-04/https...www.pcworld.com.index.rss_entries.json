The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKTG7LSF/\">Bosgame P3 Lite is on sale ahead of Prime Day for a mere $349</a>, 24% under its $459 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not only a superb deal but also a fantastic device with a configuration that\u2019s absolutely not a joke. The P3 Lite comes with a Ryzen 7 6800H processor and a decent 24GB DDR5 RAM. That\u2019s more memory than we\u2019re used to seeing in devices within this price range, and definitely not in laptops under $1,500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s also a 1TB SSD on board, so you won\u2019t get to complain about storage space anytime soon.
