I haven&#39;t downloaded music in many years (really decades) so I&#39;m looking for recommendations for public sites with quality breadth of content (not after current pop stuff in general) and relatively safe and high-quality files before I go spearfishing. I&#39;ve looked over the megathead and am familiar with torrenting and public trackers in general but only for movies/TV in recent history. Any good places to start (or avoid)?
