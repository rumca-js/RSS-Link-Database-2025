I really enjoyed it....but I&#39;m not 100% sure what happened? haha am I alone in that? Like, I cried at the end as she&#39;s lighting that match, but I ant help but think I missed some critical message or story beat. Like....is the bird alive or dead? Is Kyungha? </p> <p>Seems like a book that&#39;s a prime candidate for a re-read in 5 years or something. Things I Loved: the snowy depictions and how they link different periods of time; the agony in how the Jeju massacure and it&#39;s lead-up are described; the relationship between Kyungha and Inseon; the sort of ethereal vibe of the whole novel. </p> <p>Highly recommended to anyone on the fence. Can totally see why this is celebrated....even though I&#39;m apparently too dumb to understand it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",

However, I feel like American psycho is just an excuse for Ellis to write gore porn at this point. This is the only book which has made me physically cringe and feel a little queasy. It&#39;s currently 10:20am in the morning, my day off work, coffee on the table, reading about Bateman shoving a rat up a girls vagina. What the fuck is going on with this book?

Her timidity, reserve and introverted nature seem to be the main causes of criticism, but it was those same features that made me relate to her a lot and thus like her. Given my similar tendency of character, i find her to be the most relatable of all Austen characters that I&#39;ve read.</p> <p>After the first few chapters, the narrative does get dull and drags for much of the remaining first volume. But things get significantly better after the return of Sir Thomas, beginning Volume Two. He becomes a totally different character after his trip.</p> <p>In Volume 1, Fanny, the heroine, being only a bystander and audience to the interactions and relationships, with little contribution on her side, adds to the dullness. Fanny now takes center stage from volume 2 on, contributing to interactions, forming and being part of relationships than being an onlooker to others&#39;.</p> <p>Crawford&#39;",
