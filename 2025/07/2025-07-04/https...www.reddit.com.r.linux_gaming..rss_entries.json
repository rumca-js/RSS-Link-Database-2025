Even though I thought it was weird, I didn&#39;t really search for the reason why. But yesterday, I reinstalled <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> to replay it and oh boy, it had a lot of stutters (on Windows). The average FPS was okay, but there were constant stutters.</p> <p>So, I searched for benchmarks for my system because I knew it could handle the game. I saw that other people weren\u2019t having this problem. Then I switched to Linux (cachy), and there were no stutters and it even looked better. Now I&#39;m very sure this is an nvidia driver issue.</p> <p>The strange part is that it started happening more frequently over the past week, and in a broader catalog of games.
