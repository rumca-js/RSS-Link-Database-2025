At first glance, it looks like just another diagram editor. But stick with it and there&#39;s more to this little gem than meets the eye. </p> <p>Yes, you can draw with Dia. Proper flowcharts. Network diagrams. Timelines. Process maps. It\u2019s great at all that.</p> <p>But here\u2019s where it gets interesting.</p> <p>Dia handles layers. You can paste a calendar behind your diagram and sketch your week out visually. Drop in your TaskJuggler Gantt chart or project export, and annotate right over it. Planning becomes visual and fun. You can even slap a screenshot into the canvas and start drawing arrows, notes, or little reminders like a digital whiteboard that\u2019s always yours.</p> <p>No cloud. No logins. No surprise updates. It just runs. Even in Wayland, thanks to XWayland. And it saves everything locally, so your thoughts are always within reach",
