Essentially, you take a tool and build an abstraction on top designed to make it simpler and end up creating a less powerful version of the same underlying system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence is producing something similar at the level of learning. We begin by using AI to control the underlying technology by telling it what we want. Then, we come to the gradual realization that we need to understand those underlying technologies and AI\u2019s role in using them. We try to build an \u201cinner platform\u201d of understanding inside AI, only to dis",

My presentation focused on the many opportunities of public cloud and the essential need for risk management. Just before the event, I received an email stating that three of my slides, which discussed cloud outages and the risks of over-reliance on providers, had to be removed. Mentioning failures didn\u2019t align with the host\u2019s narrative of reliability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frustrated but not surprised, I removed the slides. During my presentation, I highlighted the importance of preparing for outages, disruptions, and ot",
