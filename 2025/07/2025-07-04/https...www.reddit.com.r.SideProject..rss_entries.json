One thing I\u2019ve noticed is that many of these projects are vibe-coded, built quickly, often as side experiments and frequently lack a proper <code>.gitignore</code> file. In some cases, the keys are even hardcoded directly into the source without using a <code>.env</code> file.</p> <p>To help prevent this, I created envveil, a Python library that scans your project folder for API keys and either adds them to <code>.gitignore</code> directly or encrypts them before storing. It\u2019s a simple extra step to reduce the risk of exposing sensitive credentials, especially helpful for new developers or students just getting started with AI.</p> <p>Please let me know your thoughts on this: GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Satarupa22-SD/envveil\">https://github.com/Satarupa22-SD/envveil</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",

It monitors the most active subreddits 24/7 and fetches new content every hour to find the perfect lead for your product. It\u2019s dead simple: just enter your product URL, and that\u2019s it you\u2019ll start getting leads in no time and begin acquiring users on autopilot. I hope you guys love the idea.

Some PDFs are fine, others are scanned or somewhat messy, and it becomes a slow and tedious task.</p> <p>Since I&#39;m a programmer, I started building a tool to do this automatically: read the data from the PDF and convert it to a CSV or Excel file ready to upload or analyze, even if the PDF is scanned.
