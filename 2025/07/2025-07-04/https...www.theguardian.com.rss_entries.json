Serve with a ta-daaa!</p><p>There\u2019s a certain charm to jelly in summer: its playful wobble, its glassy sheen, its ability to delight adults and children alike. This dessert leans into that charm and the unbeatable pairing of a softly set strawberry jelly with a silky vanilla panna cotta. It\u2019s light and cool, and ideal for long, warm evenings when no one wants anything too heavy: simple but balanced, the berries bright and tangy, the cream smooth and gently sweet. Best of all, everything can be made ahead, so all that\u2019s left to do is unmould and enjoy the wobble.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/04/strawberry-jelly-panna-cotta-recipe-helen-goh\">Continue reading...</a>",

I could hear them, feel them</p><p>It was a chilly autumnal morning in October 2009 when I woke in my tent in Primorsky Krai, Russia, near&nbsp;the border with North Korea and China. My team of&nbsp;six had&nbsp;been catching wild Siberian tigers&nbsp;with snares and putting radio collars on them<strong> </strong>before releasing them,&nbsp;so we could better understand their behaviour and protect the endangered species.</p><p>I\u2019d been working as a tiger biologist for 14 years, and had tagged about 70&nbsp;tigers with my team. Each morning, we\u2019d travel in pairs to check the snares \u2013 they consisted of heavy-duty cables attached to a tree. Each was equipped with a radio transmitter that would alert us to a capture so we could anaesthetise the animal as quickly as&nbsp;possible to minimise their stress, before fitting a collar and releasing it back into the wild.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/04/experience-i-",

I rented rooms in centrally located flats for \u00a380-\u00a3100 per month. Fast forward to 2025 and a similar room in a shared flat would set you back at least \u00a3200 \u2013 double the price of 15 years ago.
