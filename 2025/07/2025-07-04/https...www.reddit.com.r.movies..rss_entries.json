Norma Desmond and Madeline Ashton are basically cut from the same cloth. They\u2019re both living in fantasy worlds, surrounded by reminders of their past glory, doing everything they can to pretend time hasn\u2019t touched them. Norma clings to old film reels and delusions of a comeback. Madeline drinks a potion and literally becomes immortal.

The performance Ben Kingsley gives as Don Logan will leave you genuinely chilled to the bone. I sincerely do find Don more scary than Anton because Don Logan is the sort of psychotic you might have even experienced in life - he wears violence on his sleeve, he is unhinged, and needs to be in absolute control, but under the surface, you have this tormented soul who is anything but in control. When Gal tries to leave his life of crime behind him and just relax in Spain, Don is tasked with offering him a job to do, when Gal refuses, things get tense. </p> <p>This film does not have masses of physical violence.. the violence is psychological, and it comes in",
