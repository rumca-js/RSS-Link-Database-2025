I&#39;ve been using a 1TB HDD from Toshiba, but I was planning to switch to an SSD from Samsung because SSD transfers are faster, and the speed of my file transfers is very important to me. I also plan on storing personal photos and videos from iCloud on my hard drive as well, and maybe even as a Time Machine backup for my Mac.</p> <p>I know that&#39;s a whole lot, which is probably why I&#39;m gonna get 4TB or multiple hard drives - but I just need to know if SSD is the correct solution, or if HDD is the better way to go. I&#39;d love everyone&#39;s thoughts to weigh in on this. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/torrphilla\"> /u/torrphilla </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1lr8bin/ssd_vs_hdd_for_my_situation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>",
