        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>With the new requirements on 47 Days certificates organizations are now expected to rotate certificates automatically, which is great for the edge, but do we need to do that same on the origin servers? I think it is way easier and still completely safe to use Origin Certificate that lasts 15 years on the k8s ingress, as it is only accessible from the Edge provider and automatically rotate the edge certificate. The only issue - how to use a single origin certificate (like Cloudflare origin CA) for Fastly/Akamai/Any edge provider? The reason here is a failover, maybe organizations configure multiple providers as failover, so when Cloudflare fails - something else can handle the traffic, but that something else might not accept Cloudflare origin certificate.</p> <p>I wonder if anyone have already handled similar situation in their org.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ParticularAnt5424\"> /u/Particular",
