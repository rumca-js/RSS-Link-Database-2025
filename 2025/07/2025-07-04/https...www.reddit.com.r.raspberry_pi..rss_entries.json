I tried using the Pimoroni USB-C/PWR splitter hoping it would let me power the Pi and connect it to my PC simultaneously, but unfortunately, that didn\u2019t work.</p> <p>Has anyone found a reliable splitter, hub, or device that can act as a middleman between a PC and the rpi5 handling data to/from the Pi while also providing power through the same USB-C connection?</p> <p>Would appreciate any recommendations or even DIY workarounds that\u2019ve worked for you guys.
