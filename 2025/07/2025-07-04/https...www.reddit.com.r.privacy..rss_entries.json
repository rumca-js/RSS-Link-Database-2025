I&#39;m trying to learn more about privacy policies, and I&#39;m trying to become better at being aware of what kind of data you leave behind you whenever you use the internet. And I&#39;m wondering what kind of information is kept by reddit and is associated with deleted accounts. I&#39;ve read the policies and found out that all your posts and comments are disassociated and on the website is tagged as (u / deleted). But does that mean that reddit them selves remove all the traffic data that is associated with the account? For example will reddit still keep the associated trafic and data information they have about the deleted account, so if there would be a data breech, emails and ip addresses and all that is still traceable to accounts. Even if the user deleted their account. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/swedish-seeker\"> /u/swedish-seeker </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
