SEO and content farm has made the Google search model useless, and Google itself has sold out its quality to turn a quick buck.</p> <p>The best way to get answers, knowledge, recommendations, and find new things is with Copilot, Microsoft&#39;s interface to ChatGpt. Yeah, I don&#39;t like Microsoft either, but they are far less vile than Google today, and you get better results.</p> <p>Want to learn something? Ask Copilot, &quot;describe the strong nuclear force.&quot;</p> <p>Want a product recommendation? Ask Copilot, &quot;recommend some gift ideas for a four-year-old girl&quot;.</p> <p>Want to know where to go on a night out? Ask Copilot, &quot;what are the hottest bars in Manhattan&quot;.</p> <p>You are getting recommendations from Reddit and TikTok? Copilot compiles them all.</p> <p>Still stumped?
