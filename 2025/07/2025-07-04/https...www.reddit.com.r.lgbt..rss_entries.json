I\u2019ve been in foster care since March of last year because my mom is transphobic. She\u2019s okay with me being gay, but she told me I could only come back to her house if I dressed as a boy. I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that, so I said no.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m staying at a place called Job Corps in Louisiana, but I\u2019m not happy here. I\u2019m ready to start my transition and work on getting my high school diploma, but it\u2019s a long process and there are a lot of things I can\u2019t do while I\u2019m here. I literally have nowhere else to go, and I was wondering if anyone was looking too adopt or foster 17-year-olds.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Old-Reserve8754\"> /u/Old-Reserve8754 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1lr7cpk/please_read_im_literally_begging/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https",
