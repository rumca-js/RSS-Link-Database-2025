I primarily like playing racing games like dirt rally 2 and assetto Corsa, but i also would like to play gorn. I would prefer a wireless headset for practicality. I am on PC btw. Ive heard the meta quest 3s is a good option, but is the quest 3 noticeably better for 200 dollars more? I wear glasses so im not sure how much that might mess up the sellection process. If anyone could help me out it would be appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Leather_Incident_847\"> /u/Leather_Incident_847 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1lr7lrn/what_vr_headset_would_be_best/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1lr7lrn/what_vr_headset_would_be_best/\">[comments]</a></span>",
