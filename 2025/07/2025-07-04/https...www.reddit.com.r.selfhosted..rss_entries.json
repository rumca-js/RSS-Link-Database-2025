Maybe if for storage a way just to sync between the VPS and the RPi, or maybe even just use the VPS as a sort of gateway or VPN for the RPi for certain things? But I wonder still if maybe there&#39;s a way or you guys are doing something else.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t really tried Nginx much aside from a couple Jupyter servers either.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of using the RPi as an alternative to Google Photos for one. Perhaps try hosting the few scripts I run over there at times. And of course for exploring other self-hosted stuff. Maybe even try accessing it as a virtual desktop for accessing certain light apps from my phone on the go. Though probably gonna just host the other web dev stuff I do on the VPS still.</p> <p>Advanced thanks for any replies!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",
