So a year or so a go I was bought a R36S as a gift. I&#39;d never heard of anything like this before but I was blown away by it and use it all the time. Unfortunately from the very beginning I felt the control system felt quite awkward in my hands (they&#39;re quite large) and I have been suffering with cramping more and more. Looking online I have seen other consoles that look like they would be suited better for me. These are the ones shaped more like a Switch (or a Sega Gamegear if you&#39;re more from my generation) The only issue is that there seems to be dozens of different makes and I don&#39;t know which I should go for. Any advice for something like this that preferably won&#39;t break the bank would be greatly appreciated, thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"http",

The game was simple and linear. You only used the arrow keys to move back and forth and the space bar to jump. You could choose a boy or girl character. Both looked like children. Short and stout, I don\u2019t even think they had necks. The lower levels were set in the daytime. I remember grass, blue skies, bushes and grey brick or stone underneath the grass that you traveled on (all very pixelated). The higher level was space themed, but I don\u2019t remember any other details about it. For the lower levels, the only obstacles I remember were jumping over gaps in the row you were traveling on and avoiding purple blob monsters. Once you made it all the way across a row there was a small ladder to reach the next and you\u2019d repeat that same concept across another row but in the opposite direction to the next ladder.

The goal is to keep everything as clean and streamlined as possible\u2014ideally no unnecessary boxes or overly complex chains of converters IF I can help it.</p> <p>That said, I\u2019m new when it comes to this sort of setup. I\u2019ve never done direct feed capture before from old arcade hardware. There\u2019s a bunch of info floating around out there, but it\u2019s easy to get lost trying to figure out what works best\u2014especially with weird signal stuff from CRTs and arcade boards.</p> <p>If anyone\u2019s been down",
