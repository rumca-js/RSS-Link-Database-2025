        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys I&#39;ve created the main part of a website with a team of developers who will be moving on. I&#39;m looking for someone who is skilled in full stack, backend development, with a willingness to work full time. I&#39;m going to be paying a decent amount so if you feel you&#39;ve got it then we can negotiate whatever. The website is essentially a music sharing application which shares similar features to those of soundcloud and spotify but we&#39;re going for something even bigger. Heavy on the ui/ux so skills in functionality are important (obviously). If anyone on here would be interested in finding out further information please send an email to [<a href=\"mailto:marketing@twixify.com\">marketing@twixify.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:marketing@twixify.com\">marketing@twixify.com</a>) (I&#39;m paying nicely as well).</p> <p>Alternatively, if anyone has any suggestions on good places to look for such people, please let me know also :) </p> </di",
