Scientists have proposed the existence of \u201cdark dwarfs,\u201d strange glowing objects potentially lurking at the center of our galaxy. These stars might form when brown dwarfs absorb enough dark matter to prevent cooling, transforming into long-lasting beacons of invisible energy. A specific form of lithium could give them away, and if detected, these eerie objects might reveal the true nature of dark matter itself.",

This rare meteorite, studied by UK scientists and unveiled at a major geochemistry conference, reveals that the Moon was volcanically active far longer than previously thought. With a unique chemical makeup and an age that bridges a billion-year gap in Moon rock samples, it suggests the Moon had internal heat sources that persisted for ages.",
