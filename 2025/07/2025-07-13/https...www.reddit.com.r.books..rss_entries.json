This post contains spoilers.</p> <p>As a book concerned with therapy and the effects of trauma, I think one of the central themes of Big Swiss is the unacknowledged (some might say unconscious) gap between what people mean and what they say, or the importance of what&#39;s missing in the text, and I&#39;m especially interested in how the book explores this theme formally. To be clear, the book tips its hand early on, when Greta tells Om she wants to &quot;transcribe ... silence&quot; because &quot;the pain is rarely in the actual words, which nine times out of ten are imprecise, or the wrong words altogether. People are almost never articulate about their pain, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve noticed. Their pain can only really be felt in the pauses, which aren&#39;t included in the transcript.&quot; But that&#39;s just content! Big Swis",

It\u2019s happened to me a few times. After finishing <em>Demon Copperhead</em> by Barbara Kingsolver, I found myself really connecting it with Zach Bryan\u2019s <em>I Remember Everything</em>\u2014something about the vibe just felt in sync with the book. I had a similar experience while reading <em>The City and the Stars</em>, where the music of A Winged Victory for the Sullen seemed to deepen my connection with the story. Anyone else experienced something like this\u2014where music unintentionally enhances the reading experience? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spinnocks\"> /u/Spinnocks </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1lytgmf/music_to_match_the_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1lytgmf/music_to_match_the_book",

Recounting the real-life stories of a Scottish vet working in mostly farms in North Yorkshire during the thirties and forties in a humorous, self-depreciating, first-person narrative, the stories stayed with me- the farmers, the pets, the rich landowners, the awkward courtship and subsequent marriage, his attempts to sign up for WWII as a RAF pilot, the country events, fairs, races. Oh the stress of the pet competition when he awarded the blue ribbon to a well-kept goldfish which was definitely not the crowd favourite! The grief of a young farmer at slaughter time, sitting on a low wall howling with misery as his wife and daughters bustled around with sharp knives! The social cat-about-town! Laughing out loud at his shock in seeing a farmer shove raw onions up a horse&#39;s ass as some kind of folk remedy!</p> <p>Oh the animals- cats dogs cows horses pigs the odd bird and more cats and dogs. </p> <p>This was my great ta",
