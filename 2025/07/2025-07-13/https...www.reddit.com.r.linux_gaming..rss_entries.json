I really want to get into playing games with my younger siblings but I need some help upgrading my graphics card. I want something decent (not the best) that isn\u2019t going to absolutely destroy the bank max $600 and AMD. Right now I have a 1650 super I got during Covid prices. Any recommendations? It can be older if it\u2019s known to be a good deal. I\u2019m not a complete noob just new to AMD cards. </p> <p>Any help is appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ImJohnnyV\"> /u/ImJohnnyV </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lz3bib/left_windows_and_leaving_nvidia/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1lz3bib/left_windows_and_leaving_nvidia/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Example of how it works for OpenGL:<br/> It uses <code>glxinfo</code> to get a list of available GPUs/renderers by testing various environment variables. It then saves the matching environment variables associated with each renderer string. Users can simply pick the desired GPU/renderer from a dropdown without needing to deal with the variables. Once the apply button its clicked the env vars are added to a script called `volt`.</p> <p>The Vulkan selector works similarly, using <code>vulkaninfo</code> to identify and the Mesa Vulkan Layer to configure available devices (it works for NVIDIA too, i have myself a GT710 with the 470 drivers).</p> <p>If ",
