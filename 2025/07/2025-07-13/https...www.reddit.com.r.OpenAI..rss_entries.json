It was fine when I did it, but each month since it\u2019s been catching me out \ud83e\udd23</p> <p>I want to unsubscribe and then resubscribe later (aka payday). Obviously I\u2019ll lose access to my GPTs while I\u2019m un-subbed, but will they still be gone when I pay again? Will I lose all the chats I\u2019ve had with them and what happens to my organised project folders?</p> <p>Basically any and all info would be great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kairismummy\"> /u/Kairismummy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lym7xp/unsubscribing_and_resubscribing_to_chat_gpt/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1lym7xp/unsubscribing_and_resubscribing_to_chat_gpt/\">[comments]</a></span>",
