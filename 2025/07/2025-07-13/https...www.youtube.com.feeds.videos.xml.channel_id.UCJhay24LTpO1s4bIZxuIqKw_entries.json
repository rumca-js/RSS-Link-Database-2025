A simple look at the RAM usage of the browser you are currently using to read this abstract will likely tell you something.\n\nBut what of the runtime performance cost? How much (or little) should you be concerned about it and keep it in mind while implementing new features or designing software?\n\nIn this talk, we will present a set of about 10 guidelines to keep in mind when dealing with dynamic memory allocation and mitigate its potential performance impact on execution speed. From quite simple to somewhat advanced, everyone should be able to walk away from this talk having learnt something.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJoin think-cell as a C++ Developer and work on cutting-edge challenges with a focus on code excellence, innovation, and working alongside an int",
