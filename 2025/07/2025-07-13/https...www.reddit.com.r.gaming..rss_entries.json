I played Apex Legends for a year, nearly all my time going to it. After trying Apex again recently... I think Battle Royale might just be a bad genre.</p> <p>The gameplay loop has become so predictable it&#39;s almost depressing. Everyone does their damnest to drop away from anyone else. So now you spend five to ten minutes looting and wandering. There&#39;s no real &quot;fun&quot; fights, just a terrible chain of third partying because every player knows the best way to win is to kill a group already fighting. </p> <p>Ultimately the things I loved about BR games feel all gone or optimized away. Perhaps it&#39;s the way of all &quot;competitive&quot; games, to whittle away all but the optimal strategy. Unfortunately, what&#39;s left is in my opinion, a soulless and boring experience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit",

Although this can vary from game to game as Skyrim for example a playthrough could have minimal werewolves or you could do the werewolf quest early and spend most the game as a werewolf, definitely making it a werewolf game.</p> <p>I just love games centred around these creatures and was curious what people consider the absolute best.</p> <p>Of what I\u2019ve personally played.</p> <p>I would say the best vampire games are Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines, Legacy of Kain series and Cabernet. Various Castlevania games are definitely up there too.</p> <p>And the best Werewolf games are Nightmare Creatures and The Wolf Among Us. Unfortunately I\u2019ve found a big portion of werewolf games are really bad or mediocre.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RemusLupinz\"> /u/RemusLupinz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.r",
