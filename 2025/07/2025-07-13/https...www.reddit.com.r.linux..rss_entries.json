It\u2019s called \u201cDAPU\u201d (Distro Agnostic Package Utility) it\u2019s a simple open source Python script that aims to be lightweight and with minimal dependencies. Its main scope is to facilitate package management across distros by providing a text based menu that lists all the possible operations. It\u2019s mostly automated and only requires user input on what to do and in some cases on what packages to manage. I made this script with beginners in mind, but also trying to cater to more experienced users,so that they don\u2019t have to memorize all the package manager\u2019s syntax if they don\u2019t want to. It wraps around the automatically detected pm so the only dependencies are Python and your distro\u2019s package manager. It also tries to follow best practices. Currently, the supported package managers are apt-get, pacman, dnf and zypper, with more to come, I also plan on adding more advanced features for each ",

I\u2019ve been using Linux for a long time now, have distro hopped a bit and finally landed on (you guessed it Arch Linux btw).</p> <p>Making this post today because I\u2019ve seen many Linux users/Youtube content creators talk about their love for Debian and praise its \u201cstability\u201d. Out of all the computers in my home, only one of them runs Debian right now. And unfortunately that computer is the least used. Really just sitting there running a single Docker container that broadcasts a service to my network that I\u2019d like to use more, but alas I do not.</p> <p>My question is simple. Is Debian\u2019s stability really a feature that people like? In my experience, what seems to be \u201cstability\u201d really means \u201coutdated\u201d. And I mean extremely outdated. 5 years out of date on some packages on Debian. </p> <p>Now to admit my own bias, as I am on a rolling distribution, even Debian based distro like Mint and Ubuntu at least have much more up to date packages",
