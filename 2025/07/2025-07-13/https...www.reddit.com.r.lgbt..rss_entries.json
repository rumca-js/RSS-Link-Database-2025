Until the time came to go back home, he walked me to my house then continued alone. Then after around two hours his father asked me about him, I told him that I thought he was by home now but he said that he isn&#39;t and he hasn&#39;t been responding on the phone. I said maybe he is ignoring his father (even though he doesn&#39;t usually do it) so I decided to call him myself, I called him and texted him and he didn&#39;t answer. Until around 1 in the morning I got a text from his dad telling me that he is home. Later my boyfriend told us that a group of boys from our school who used to laugh at him jumped him and beat him up. He has been so quite since yesterday, he also seems insecure. When I put my arm around his waist then moved it to his chest like I usually do he pushed my hand away. Then he texted me &quot;do you really think I am a man?&quot;",
