My favorite game I found on SNES was metal marines. It&#39;s a really brilliant game. I probably play through it like once a year. It&#39;s great for long flights. I mostly play these days on a SBC. Currently rocking a timiu brick. I always try to play the classics but there&#39;s something about metal marines, it&#39;s like the perfect fast paced strategy game. I feel like it could come out now as an indie game. Anyone else love metal marines?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mista-666\"> /u/mista-666 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1lz6b4a/metal_marines_on_snes/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1lz6b4a/metal_marines_on_snes/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Whether they&#39;re the best bc they are a perfect example or because of the changes they bring to the table, I wanna know it all.</p> <p>Just want to see what people consider great and why, as well as retro games being wonderful to play on weaker systems like some of my stuff lol. </p> <p>Can&#39;t give much of my own opinions cause idk if what I grew up with counts as retro at this point yet lol. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KazM2\"> /u/KazM2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1lyifw8/best_of_their_genres/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.",
