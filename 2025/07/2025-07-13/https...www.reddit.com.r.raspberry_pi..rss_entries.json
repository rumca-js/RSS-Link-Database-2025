As you can see in the video it looks like it\u2019s going to boot fine, then it switches to av2 and won\u2019t go back. I tried snipping the resistor that av2 leads to to see if that would fix it but it made the screen black and white. The only other info I could find about the screen board is another post with a different issue I will post in a comment. The only buttons on the board change contrast and color settings. I\u2019m at a loss what to try, any help would be appreciated.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-",
