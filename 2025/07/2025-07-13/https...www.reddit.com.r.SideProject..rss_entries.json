This is my 4th product as a solopreneur, I just launch a platform where you can create and deploy your own Solana token just in seconds. Without any coding required.</p> <p>So basically, when you want to create a standard solana token you need to do it with Rust programming language. And not many people know how to coding especially with Rust. In my platform, you just need to fill some token information in form and do click click click, and boom your token is deployed to the solana blockchain.</p> <h1>What can you do with your token?</h1> <p>You can do an Initial Coin Offering to raise funds for your project, business, or product. Another example case is you can use your coin/token to make it as store points where later on your users can exchange to some voucher or merchandise.</p> <p>Don&#39;t have a business yet? No worries, you can use it just for fun. We call it a &quot;meme coin&quot;.</p> <p>Th",

We&#39;re exploring an idea for a new app and wanted to see if it resonates with you all.</p> <p>The core idea is to make productivity genuinely fun and collaborative:</p> <p>1/ Deeper Gamification: Instead of just a timer, imagine an app with real progression. Completing your real-world tasks helps you level up, unlock rewards, and see meaningful growth over the long term. 2/ Social Motivation: Add a layer of accountability by allowing you to team up with friends. You could work towards shared goals or simply cheer each other on. We&#39;re still in the very early stages, but we believe making productivity a shared adventure is more motivating than doing it alone.</p> <p>Does this sound like something you would use?
