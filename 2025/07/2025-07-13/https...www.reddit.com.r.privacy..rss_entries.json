Recently, I discovered it is stuck in a bootloop and I cannot access it at all. I contacted the seller and they told me I could return it for a replacement. The only issue is, I&#39;m logged into the iPhone with my personal details. What are the chances when the phone gets shipped back to them they are able to fix it access the phone? I am using a 7 digit password, all numbers. And if possible, is there any way I can erase everything on the phone remotely?
