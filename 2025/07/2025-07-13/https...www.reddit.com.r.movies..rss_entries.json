Kicking the raptor out the window, Nuking the fridge, swinging with Monkeys, the entire character of Mac in Crystal Skull, I\u2019m sure there is more.</p> <p>But man, there is some genuinely brilliant filmmaking in both, some of my favorite scenes from Spielberg. Everything with the T-Rex\u2019s in Lost World is incredible. The Raptors long grass scene, all impeccably shot and tensely crafted filmmaking. Lost World is far and away the best Jurassic Park sequel. I really enjoy the San Diego 3rd act but it does absolutely feel very disconnected from the rest of the film. </p> <p>I love Crystal",

He didn\u2019t even pause didn\u2019t even have to think. He said Life is Beautiful. At the time, I watched it but I don\u2019t think I fully grasped it.

I thought it was sweet, sad but now after life has carved itself into me now I really see it. </p> <p>Now at 29, rewatching it hit differently. I felt it in my bones. This film isn\u2019t just a piece of cinema. This isn\u2019t just a movie. It\u2019s a father\u2019s quiet rebellion against despair. A love story in the middle of a war. A reminder that sometimes the most heroic thing you can do is protect someone\u2019s sense of wonder even as the world around you falls apart. It\u2019s a meditation on love in it\u2019s purest form.

From then, my dad would always let me watch any R-rated movie, and then would just cover my eyes if there was any nudity in a scene. If there was a sex scene, he&#39;d send me out of the room and tell me come back later (these were always movies playing on tv, so he had already seen them and knew when those scenes were coming up). The only movies I wasn&#39;t allowed to watch were slasher horror movies, mainly because they just knew that&#39;d give me a nightmare.
