So you can tell when they&#39;re coming up in the deck. There are games where that doesn&#39;t matter, like if it adds a lot of cards, so that doesn&#39;t narrow it down. But the two I just got add only 2-3 cards to both decks. The colors/artwork is the same, but it&#39;s way more saturated, standing out completely. </p> <p>In the one game, it&#39;s ok, it has standard size cards, so I was able to sleeve the game with solid color backs. Unfortunately loosing out on the back art, but not affecting play.</p> <p>The other is a problem, because it has mini cards. I haven&#39;t seen any mini sized card sleeves with solid color backs, so I am not sure how to help this one. </p> <p>Anyone have solutions they do when they have mismatched mini cards?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",
