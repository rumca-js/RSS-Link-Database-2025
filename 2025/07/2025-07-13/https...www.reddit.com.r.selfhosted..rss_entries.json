Phone Link from microsoft does this, but of course the data still leaves my ecosystem. KDEConnect does this, but it&#39;s more difficult to set up with my machines when i swap networks with my phone, or when i&#39;m constantly on different networks with my laptop. part of what makes pushbullet nice for me is that notifications can be mirrored to both my laptop and my desktop without me thinking about any setup if my networking situation changes. </p> <p>can i set up ntfy to do this too with, say, a tasker ",

I will send it to a self hosted solution. I need a way to better monitor elderly relatives from phishing. They almost got scammed last week, \u201cwaiting for Microsoft to call them back\u201d. I try my hardest to block most things using DNS but idk what else to do. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic_Celery_136\"> /u/Fantastic_Celery_136 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1lyg1hf/ios_callimessage_logging/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1lyg1hf/ios_callimessage_logging/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I am using a 1U server chassis and a &quot;standard&quot; 1U Dynatron A46 cooler. The issue I am mainly facing is that the Broadcom NIC chip is running hot. I have a bunch of Arctic 6k RPM 40mm fans already installed and they are helping, but it is really not ideal. Does anyone possibly know where to buy a pre-made airflow baffle or have any files for 3D-printing one? The idea is to direct the airflow more directly through the CPU heatsink and towards the NIC chip heatsink.</p> <p>I have searched for one on multiple sites hosting 3D-printing files, but have not had any luck. I saw that a specific server also made by ASRock (Rack) includes an airflow baffle that seems to fit exactly my use-case, since the chassis is listed to also support the above mentioned board. However, said baffle seems to not be sold separately. Any he",
