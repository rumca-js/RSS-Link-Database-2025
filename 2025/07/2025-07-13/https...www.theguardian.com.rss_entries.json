A realistic future military and diplomatic strategy for Kyiv has to accept that fact \u2013 and formulate a new approach.</p><p>The past six months have been dominated by the erroneous assumption that it would be possible for Trump to negotiate a ceasefire, even an armistice. That would be followed by the arrival of an Anglo-French led stabilisation force to secure the future of Ukraine.
