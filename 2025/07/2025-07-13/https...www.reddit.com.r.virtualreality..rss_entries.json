Please note, your experience may vary.</p> <p>\ud83c\udfa7 Comfort</p> <p>I tried the Pimax Crystal Super during a one-hour session in AirCar. Initially, it felt heavy and pressed hard on my forehead. After tweaking the top strap and adjusting fit, the weight balanced nicely and forehead pressure was nearly gone. I used the thicker facial foam comfort kit (instead of the default), which helped\u2014but it\u2019s clear this headset isn\u2019t ideal for active games like jumping or dancing; a slightly loose fit improves comfort, but tight fit is important for stability in titles like Beat Saber. Compared to my Meta 3 (for room-scale VR) and my Pimax units, the Super stands out visually, though it retains some heft that requires adjustable fitment for longer sessions.</p> <h1>\ud83d\udd0d Lenses &amp; Visuals</h1> <p>The headset delivers outstanding visuals.

Using the audio booster doesn&#39;t solve the problem; it just makes three bars too loud.</p> <p>We really need a finer way to adjust the audio in the Meta OS. I don&#39;t know what happened, but there was a time when the audio was only too loud when it was almost at the maximum. It felt better and like we had more precision when changing the volume.

For flight sims that don&#39;t need hand control/tracking, would it be possible to make a budget VR headset without the need for extensive tracking stations by getting a cheap pair of screen glasses and a head tracker? I know it wouldn&#39;t really allow for 360 head movement, but otherwise would this be practical? Has anyone tried this before?</p> <p>I&#39;m primarily looking for something that&#39;s easy to wear, easy to setup and take down, and something not too expensive. I&#39;m curious if anyone else has tried my idea above, or if it&#39;s a stupid idea.</p> <p>I&#39;m also down for reccomendations for other cheap headsets I could use in IL2, War Thunder, and DCS.

For example: A VR livestream that can be recorded and viewed again later in VR - not 2D. VR input to VR output, basically.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s probably not possible to do this, but wanted to ask anyway.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Howboutnow82\"> /u/Howboutnow82 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1lyfzf8/recording_vr_vr_not_vr_2d/\">[link]</a",
