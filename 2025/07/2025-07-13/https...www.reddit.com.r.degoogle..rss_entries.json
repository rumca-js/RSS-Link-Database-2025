Heard CrDroid is not being audited by third parties yet and LineageOS is audited, well-known and trusted.

And I have gotten 2 own domains.</p> <p>So long term I want to switch away from gmail, but I have basically a 2 step plan:<br/> 1. Over time, switch as much as I can, things that dont require two way communication, over to be on the domains, but just getting forwarded to the gmail.<br/> 2. Switch from gmail to a mail service I dont know what is.</p> <p>For now, I have not decided how to do it for different services and email. I have read about 3 different ways to do it I have thought about:<br/> 1. Have a few aliases, but group them together. eg. social media may be social@domain while game accounts may be <a href=\"mailto:game@domain\">game@domain</a>.<br/> 2. Have individual alias for every single website, just have the website as alias, eg. steam@domain, discord@domain<br/> 3. As mumber 2, instead of having the name of the website/service, having just some number letter combo as alias. Because its harder for spammers to just guess",

Randomly got notified earlier this year that all my cards were removed. Tried to re-add, 4 different cards failed. All 4 are through different banks. Contacted each bank, no issues on their end. Gave up. Fast forward to this week - was going out and didn&#39;t want to have a wallet or purse stuck to me. Tried to add cards back to G-Wallet. All failed again. Contacted banks again, no issue on their end. Tokens were generated, G-Wallet did not authorize them. Filled out a support ticket and got a callback from Google, they said it&#39;s my bank problem. I said &quot;4 different banks? All of which confirmed they had no issue?&quot; Yep. Apparently 4 MAJOR BANKS all have issues, separately, at the same time, with only one app. Crazy how nature do dat. Google refuses to admit their Wallet app has issues and would rather blame four sep",
