I\u2019ve identified a developer behind a heavily adopted software program who appears to be prepping for a malicious pivot. Possible spyware or malware. A digital forensics expert uncovered strong technical red flags, like injecting its own trusted root certificates into Windows without user approval, but I haven\u2019t gone public yet to avoid alerting them or give them the jump that they&#39;re about to be exposed.</p> <p>My plan is to quietly document everything, then escalate once I&#39;m confident in the evidence. I\u2019m looking for advice on:</p> <ol> <li>Best practices for covert evidence collection and preservation (tools, chaining, OPSEC).</li> <li>Which authorities or CERTs are best suited to handle suspected pre\u2011malware deployment? or even popular individuals that I could also enlist, who the public has established credibility with?</li> <li>Trusted cybersecurity journalists or outlets",
