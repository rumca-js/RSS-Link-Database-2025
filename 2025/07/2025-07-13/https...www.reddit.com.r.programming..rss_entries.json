I have solved maybe 3 leetcode easy\u2019s with the help of Chatgpt towards the end of the problem (did most of the problem on my own). I have made some decent projects from school but it was with the help of AI. And now I am working on my own app to put on my resume. I have been using a lot of AI and not really understand the finer details of my code. I have a rough understanding of what\u2019s going on, on a high level. But I don\u2019t understand every single line or how everything is necessarily connected. I want to get better at programming fast and just want to improve. I want to be a great programmer. Do I just stop using ai and only google? Do I try writing the code manually for a while first than get help elsewhere? What are your methods on how to get better? Tips?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WarmSatisf",

I often found it annoying when starting a Java project meant doing more than just cloning the repo. I like how Maven and Gradle wrappers make builds reproducible without requiring global tools, so I wanted something similar for the JDK.</p> <p>So I built a CLI that lets each project define its JDK version, handles downloads automatically, and supports wrapper generation. It also shows all available JDKs from Foojay\u2019s Disco API directly in the CLI, so everything is in one place.</p> <p>Still missing a few things, like an IntelliJ plugin, CI integrations, or a Homebrew tap, but it\u2019s already usable and I\u2019d be happy to get feedback or hear from others interested in contributing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished_Cup4912\"> /u/Accomplished_Cup4912 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.zero-jdk.dev/\">[link]</a></",
