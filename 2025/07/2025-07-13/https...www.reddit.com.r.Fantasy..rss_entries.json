And right now, both are in dire straits. Since the death of their parents, Ryn and her siblings have been scraping together a meager existence as gravediggers in the remote village of Colbren, which sits at the foot of a harsh and deadly mountain range that was once home to the fae. The problem with being a gravedigger in Colbren, though, is that the dead don&#39;t always stay dead.</em> </p> <p><em>The risen corpses are known as &quot;bone houses,&quot; and legend says that they&#39;re the result of a decades-old curse. When Ellis, an apprentice mapmaker with a mysterious past, arrives in town, the bone houses attack with new ferocity. What is it that draws them near? And more importantly, how can they be stopped for good?</em> </p> <p><em>Together, Ellis and Ryn embark on a journey that will take them deep into the heart of the mo",

I know because MB is genderless, some people picture it as more androgynous, but Skarsg\u00e5rd is an amazing actor and he balances the &quot;robotic&quot; posture and expression with the soulful eyes and sardonic tone that showcases Murderbot&#39;s duality. I pictured him as MB the entire time I was reading the series.</p> <p>The Preservation Alliance characters, at first, left absolutely no impression on me. IMO they weren&#39;t introduced super well. It seemed like, at first, the show was trying to get us, the audience, to care about them, but hadn&#39;t actually given us a reason to yet. That being said, their personalities eventually shone through, especially Ratthi and Gurathin. The sho",

What made your starting point a great (or not-so-great) entry into his works? Were there specific things about the book/series (like world-building, characters, pacing, or complexity) that worked well for a beginner or felt like a hurdle?</p> <p>I\u2019m open to standalone novels or series, Cosmere or non-Cosmere, and I\u2019m excited to explore his magic systems and epic storytelling.

Some personal standouts for me being Rogues, Old Mars, Old Venus, Warriors, Songs of a Dying Earth, and Book of Swords. I&#39;ve always liked the idea of short story collections but it seems like they usually have more misses than hits. I feel like the ones Martin is involved in editing consistently have a high hit rate. I think my favorite is Songs of a dying earth but my favorite individual story comes from one of the weaker ones, in my opinion, (the book of magic) called The Fall and Rise of the House of the Wizard Malkuril by Scott Lynch.
