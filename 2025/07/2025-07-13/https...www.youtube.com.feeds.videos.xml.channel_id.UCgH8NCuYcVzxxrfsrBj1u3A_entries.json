I liked it, but need help to describe its genre. We had some issues with copyright on this, so please listen to the song in its entirety (link is below).\nI'd also like to apologise for my squeaky chair in this episode. I will sort it out. \n\nTo listen to \"My Mind is A Mountain\" in its entirety, you can find it here: https://youtu.be/cgh_jEm5twE?si=UkghnqikttTh7cfz\n\nTo come and see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK, find tickets here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #musicreview",
