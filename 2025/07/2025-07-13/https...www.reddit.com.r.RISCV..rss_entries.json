But a key functionality is that there are &quot;calls&quot; like system-calls in the service&#39;s source code that is handled by a decentralized protocol in the kernel layer. the &quot;call&quot; references some work to do, and nodes on the network do the work. </p> <p>A similar analogy would be a standard system call to use a GPU for heavy repetitive calculations. So a device can use a call to defer work to another remote CPU.</p> <p>From the perspective of the network, A node donates their device to the network, and received a virtual device that can run apps on the combined network(decentralized scheduling).</p> <p>According to AI, I should use wasm. But I&#39;ve been considering the option of risc-v as an alternative to web assembly, I wanted to ask the community whether a risc-v based VM would be",
