I\u2019m looking for similar books that give the creepy, raising hair on the back of the neck feelings. I liked the octopus &amp; global warming theming. Mystery aspect is a must. The AI &amp; tech stuff is fun to read but not necessarily a must have in the book. </p> <p>In the same vein as under water exploration, I also liked Into the Sunken City by Dinesh Thiru. </p> <p>I\u2019m also open to space exploration recs; I just finished Fractal Noise by Christopher Paolini &amp; enjoyed it as well. It has the same spine tingle vibes. </p> <p>No body horror.

When I was at school I never had any friends and no real interests and I hated books, like I was gifted jules Verne 80 days around the world and I was screaming at my aunt to take it back because I hated reading and she did so. Now at 18 I got the comic civil war and it got me hooked into comics and then to books, with my first ever proper book being hp Lovecrafts complete tales and it made horror my favourite. I then started Stephen king as of recently. Anyhow since I missed quite a bit of reading I wanted to ask if you guys have any essential reading suggestions regardless of genre (could anything really that\u2019s considered a must read for everyone and note I am not American if that counts). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tasos303\"> /u/Tasos303 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions",

But it doesn&#39;t have to be a &#39;deadly game&#39; theme. For instance, I loved ,,When we were lost&#39;&#39; by Kevin Wignall (one of my favs) and, when it comes to a slightly different genre, I really enjoyed the Wayward Pines trilogy by Blake Crouch.

I\u2019m mostly into enemies to lovers, forbidden romance, fantasy, and time period settings but I\u2019m open to a lot. So far I have read the Twisted series which I didn\u2019t really enjoy except for Twisted Lies but even that was just okay. I want something that is well written with a good story because it feels like that\u2019s hard to find in this genre. Also no Colleen Hoover or Ali Hazelwood because I didn\u2019t like their books.

I really enjoyed the fourth wing series and court of thorns and roses but I found myself skipping over the multi page graphic nsfw scenes. Does anyone have any recs for fantasy books for adults that isn\u2019t so heavy on the \u201cromance\u201d? I\u2019m totally down for a relationship or love theme just tired of the bed breaking and bad women\u2019s anatomy scenes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bemer33\"> /u/bemer33 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lyjsyl/fantasy_book_thats_not_half_nsfw/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1lyjsyl/fantasy_book_thats_not_half_nsfw/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I want to start my own bookshelf, but I\u2019m afraid of some of the cons of buying books: cost, only reading it 1-2 times, growing out of the book, etc. Then again, I yearn for the feeling of reading a book that I myself own and having a bookshelf. So my question is, are buying books worth it? Or in other words, what books do you recommend I get for my bookshelf that are worth buying?</p> <p>Here are some of the series I read that I liked ranked:</p> <p>- Hunger Games</p> <p>- Percy Jackson</p> <p>- Divergent</p> <p>- Ranger\u2019s Apprentice</p> <p>I also want to read \u201dBetter than the Movies\u201d and \u201cThe Summer of Broken Rules\u201d because I think that I would like them but I haven\u2019t read them yet so I don\u2019t know. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PinkDog0129\"> /u/PinkDog0129 </",

I am enamored by his detailed descriptions of nature, his views on spirituality and mysticism, along with the way he writes horror. I love how even the horror of his stories seems to be underlined by a sense of awe in the face of nature and the mysteries of the universe. I prefer him over Lovecraft as Lovecraft strikes me as very pessimistic, maybe even out right nihilistic, where as Blackwood takes a more balanced view (imo at least).
