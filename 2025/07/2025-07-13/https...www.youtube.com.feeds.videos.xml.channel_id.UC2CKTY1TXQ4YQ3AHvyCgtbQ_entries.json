        "description": "I've really loved looking for new 3D printing projects recently - for both models AND terrain stuff. I've got some great 3D printed figures on my desk right now that I'm really enjoying, and more in the queue. I'll talk about that, and of course I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made ANOTHER game! Check out Reign in Iron - miniatures-agnostic robot vs. demon skirmish combat at http://www.reigninirongame.com\n\nI'm a member of The Army Painter Factory Team - and I'm passing the savings on to you! Use code 'FactoryUncle5' at checkout to get 5% off of your entire order at http://www.thearmypainter.com or check my favorite Army Painter products at https://thearmypainter.com/tabletop-minions\n\nI'm now a partner on Twitch!
