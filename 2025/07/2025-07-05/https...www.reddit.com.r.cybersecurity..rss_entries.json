Unfortunately it just doesn&#39;t excite me and I&#39;m really missing the hands on technical stuff when I was a Sys Admin previously.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been working to become a pentester due to the hands on nature and the enjoyment I get from looking at new technologies. I&#39;m wondering with the PNPT and hopefully CPTS soon enough what hands technica roles I could do.</p> <p>From reviewing options online I&#39;ve been currently thinking of AppSec roles but would really like advice from other people as I was away on my honeymoon recently to refresh and relax with my wife but after being back in work for a few days",

There is a role open for leadership, i.e. line manager for managing architects like me and pentesters. This role is a product security manager aligned to identify/protect function of NIST CSF. </p> <p>My question is how is being a people leader in Cyber. This role will have no hands on work. Those who are in this kind of roles or are even higher up as director/CISO etc. I want to know if this is a good career move, will there be better opportunities in the industry. The pay is more but that is beside the point. I guess I want to how being a leader in Cyber is different to say a SWE manager, or other. Does this potentially open to other tech management role in future.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bilby2020\"> /u/bilby2020 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybe",
