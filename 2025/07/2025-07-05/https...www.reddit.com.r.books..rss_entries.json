But the ending is a bit hopeful because it seems she decides to live on and to try and forgive herself. In a way it reminds me of how Harry Potter accidentally put his god father Sirius Black in danger because he wasn&#39;t able to stop Vodermort from entering in to his mind and luring him in to a trap. The anguish poor Harry feels is akin to what Cadence would feel except for Cadence its 3 loved ones she lost.",

The first one helped me understand very much the mixed feelings parents of chronically ill/ disabled children feel. At the same time, they love their children, they also sometimes wish raising them were not such a burden and to an extreme, even wished they had not been born. For John Green&#39;s book, it helped me grasp how teenagers with a sense of a foreshortened life view the world and what they hope to experience before their passing. </p> <p>Along a similar line, are there any books that astounded you with the insight the authors had into a character or situation despit",
