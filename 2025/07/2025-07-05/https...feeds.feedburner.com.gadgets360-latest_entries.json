Captured during a survey of missing clusters, this image provides new insight into stellar evolution and the early Milky Way. It marks a vital step in resolving the structure and origin of ancient star systems hidden within our galaxy.",

A new study reveals that their powerful stellar winds strip outer layers early, reshaping theories of star evolution, black hole formation, and gravitational wave events. This research challenges previous models and helps explain observed features of stars like R136a1 in the Tarantula Nebula.",
