        "description": "Death Stranding 2: On the Beach might bring a massive new adventure for its players to experience but things don\u2019t necessarily end the minute the credits roll on Sam\u2019s new adventure. There\u2019s a lot to do and find in the game\u2019s take on Mexico and Australia, and more than a few individuals who could use Sam\u2019s help in exchange for some very useful rewards. \n\nThe Strand System, APAS Enhancements, and secret bosses are all part of the experience, and as exciting as the main story for those who like to stray off the beaten path. The game rewards curiosity in ways that can impact the way it is played, making engaging with as much of its world as possible a very rewarding path of action well beyond the runtime of its story - and perhaps makes things even more convenient for Sam Porter in the bargain!",

        "description": "One of the most iconic franchises of all time returns in 2025 with not-one-but-three new entries (if we\u2019re counting the already released Ninja Gaiden II remake Ninja Gaiden II Black as new). Before the new 3D adventure Ninja Gaiden 4 comes later in the year, a return to the series\u2019 roots in 2D side-scrolling action platformer Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is incoming. \n\nImbued with the spirit of the series\u2019 original trilogy but with a host of modernisations and quality of life improvements, Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound looks to tap into a perfect middle ground between vintage challenge and modern design. \n\nNew characters, new story, and fresh mechanics reinforce the series\u2019 marquee combat fluidity, with a challenge not quite as brutal as what those who were old enough in 1988 remember.",

        "description": "Imagine, if you will, that you've been working on a new sci-fi MMORPG with Titanfall-like movement. Things are starting to come together after a long pre-production period, but it's okay because Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming's CEO, loves your game. He loves it so much that he reportedly couldn't stop playing it and needed Xbox's Matt Booty to tear the controller away. Microsoft executives didn't just like the game \u2013 they were, as sources told Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, \u201cblown away by it.\u201d Not in development hell either. Going places, good times.\n\nNow imagine that those leadership figures approach you and your team to tell you that your project, which you've poured years of your life into, has been cancelled. Actually, don't, because what happened (allegedly, of course) is that studio leaders locked your team out of their Slack accounts while telling them that the same project has been cancelled. Oh, and hours later, you don't even know if you're still employed.",
