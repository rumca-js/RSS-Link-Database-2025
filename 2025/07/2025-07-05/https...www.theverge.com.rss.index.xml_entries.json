Then I usually hear some version of the same thing: \"Oh, I thought about getting one of those! But then I just got a [insert slab-style phone name here].\" My anecdotal data matches the actual sales figures; there are many more people curious about folding phones than there are <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/foldable-smartphone-market-to-see-its-first-decline-in-2025-before-robust-comeback-in-2026/\">buyers of folding phones</a>.

The first chapter of the episodic, parallel story to Toby Fox's acclaimed RPG <em>Undertale</em> came out nearly seven years ago. But the newly released third and fourth chapters are so good that I highly recommend playing everything that's available right now - even if there are still three more episodes to go.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>Deltarune</em>, you play as Kris, a teenager who lives in a town inhabited by friendly animals and monsters. Kris is assigned a group project with Susie, an aloof bully, and together they stumble into a place called the Dark World (hidden in a closet",
