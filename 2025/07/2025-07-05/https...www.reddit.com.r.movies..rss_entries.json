It&#39;s a revenge drama that goes out of its way to make the act of getting vengeance completely emotionally draining and traumatizing. Weaved into the narrative is a fair bit of important social commentary on rape culture and sexual assault.</p> <p>Carey Mulligan gives an absolutely fantastic performance, simultaneously funny, charming, badass, broken, traumatized and vulnerable. The casting in general is on-point, especially the movie&#39;s conscious decision to use well-known &quot;good guys&quot; to play rapists and rape enablers. </p> <p>The climax of the movie is an absolute gut-punch and I can see why so many people hated it.
