I found that the subway and stations had the\nworst air quality of my whole day by far, over 1k ug/m3, and\nconcluded:\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nBased on these readings, it would be safe from a covid perspective to\nremove my mask in the subway station, but given the high level of\nparticulate pollution I might as well leave it on.\n\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen I stopped masking in general, though, I also stopped masking on\nthe subway.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nA few weeks ago I was hanging out with someone who works in air\nquality, and they said subways had the worst air quality they'd\nmeasured anywhere outside of a coal mine.
