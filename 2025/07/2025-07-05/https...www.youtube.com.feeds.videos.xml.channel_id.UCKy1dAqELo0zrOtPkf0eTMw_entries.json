        "description": "So, you want to be a porter in Death Stranding 2, but why can\u2019t you fit one more piece of cargo in your backpack? Why won\u2019t Sam get back in the truck even though you're under the weight limit? In this deep-dive guide, we break down exactly how weight and capacity work in DS2, and why they\u2019re not the same thing.\n\nWe\u2019ll explain how cargo units are calculated, how much space you really have in your backpack, carriers, and vehicles \u2013 and what items secretly don\u2019t count toward capacity at all. Learn how the game handles small, medium, large, and extra-large cargo, why kangaroos take up a ridiculous amount of space, and why the Coffin Board might just ruin your entire inventory strategy.\n\nWhether you\u2019re trying to min-max your deliveries or just want to know why the \u201cworthless scale\u201d actually matters, this is the guide for you.\n\n00:00 - The problem with capacity in Death Stranding 2\n00:44 - The difference between weight and capacity\n01:48 - How to measure capacity in Death Stranding 2\n02:57 ",
