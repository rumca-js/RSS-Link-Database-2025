        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a website where main page is translated into many languages. After adding new languages (English was default for a long time) I started to check bing search console to see if those pages are indexed. The pages are totally same except the langauge. Paradocally some of the pages are indexes and some &quot;are known to Bing but have some issue which prevent them being indexed&quot;. This &quot;issue&quot; in Bing console is weird by three reasons.First, the other pages which are in search are exactle the same from technical point of view. Secondly, previously those pages had an actual issue like repeating h1 header, but later it was fixed so now there is no actual issues with the page, but Bing keep saying something is wrong.<br/> And last and most redicolous thing, the pages which are not indexed are those I request to index the first. Pages which I haven&#39;t requested ended up in search first!<br/> If there are experts on Bing here, which way ",
