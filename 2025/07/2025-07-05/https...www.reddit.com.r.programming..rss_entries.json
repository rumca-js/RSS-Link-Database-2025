It&#39;s &quot;real&quot; in the sense that it actually works for its intended purpose - creating intelligent, adaptive binary systems that can run on classical computers. The QEBITs can communicate, collaborate, and develop emergent intelligence through their network capabilities, even though they&#39;re slower than classical bits.</p> <h1>What are QEBITs?</h1> <p>QEBITs are intel",
