I&#39;m not talking about UAE in particular, btw. I don&#39;t mind cameras everywhere, tracking cars/people on the street. But would not be happy with government checking my phone/messages, even if I have nothing to hide. That&#39;s &quot;private&quot;. Walking on the street is public.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, a while ago I received a message on Telegram from a friend saying, \u201cIs this your photo?\u201d with a link next to it. I clicked on the link and it took me to a page showing only two members and an image sent by a deleted account. It looked like one of those sensitive Telegram images, and below it, there was a button saying &quot;Click to view image.&quot; I clicked it, and it took me to another site, then a bot appeared and told me to press &quot;Start&quot; to view the image. I pressed it, and it said that a friend had uploaded photos of me and asked for permission to access my contacts. At this point, I got worried and didn\u2019t give it any permissions. I contacted that friend, and he told me his account was hacked. Now I\u2019m scared my own account might have been hacked too, especially since I have photos on it that I don\u2019t want anyone to see.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Calm-Housing4430\"> /u/Calm",
