Addictively unputdownable.</p> <p>Matea Reed delivers a masterclass in psychological tension with Pretty When She Kills, a seductive, suspense-laced thriller that blurs the line between love and obsession.</p> <p>Set in a haunting small town where secrets crawl beneath the surface like vines waiting to strangle, this novel follows Rory\u2014a broken but brilliantly sharp heroine running from a past she can\u2019t escape\u2014and Cade, the mysterious man whose darkness rivals her own. But the real thrill? A string of gruesome murders that tie everything\u2014and everyone\u2014together.</p> <p>This book is slow-burn meets explosive revelation. Reed crafts tension so thick it feels like holding your breath through every chapter. Her writing is raw and visceral, filled with emotional depth, steamy tension, and just the right amount of gore to make your heart race. The dual POV keeps readers on edge, and the killer\u2019s interludes? Chilling",

I&#39;m a bit of a picky reader and also lowkey am guilty of buying a book based on reviews \ud83d\ude14 I also haven&#39;t really read a lot, just getting into it. </p> <p>I want to read a book that feels unsettling and eerie in a way. like nothing too scary, I am not the biggest fan of too much gore and horror, but i love horror thriller movies; something with interesting lore too. </p> <p>The only book I have read that COULD go in this direction is Verity by Colleen Hoover. Wasn&#39;t too unsettling except the manuscript which i found evil and fucked up (but was also my favorite part to read lol)</p> <p>So yeah, it can go into ANY direction, i&#39;m really open.

I&#39;ve never read a book outside of the context of it being assigned work back in school, so I don&#39;t really know what I like or dislike in a book. My only somewhat similar hobby is playing video games, but my tastes in those are based on things that don&#39;t really apply to books. </p> <p>I&#39;m also not really sure how people go about finding out about new books. When it comes to video games, there are developer directs and events like Summer Games Fest and The Game Awards where a bunch of new titles are revealed and teased. Are new books even popular? Is everyone just reading the old classics? I don&#39;t think I could name a single book released so far in this millennium other than the Harry Potter series.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YouCanBCum\">",

I know that it would be beneficial for me mentally but being forced to read books that didn&#39;t intrest me at all in highschool with one exception really made me put off reading.</p> <p>The 2 books i&#39;ve read in recent years were Metro 2033 by Dimitry Glukhovsky and To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee. To Kill a Mockingbird interested me because of its depictions of real characters in realistic situation and how there is no real monsters. Metro 2033 got my attention because of its description on Audible and listening to it and how Glukhovsky managed to describe the environment and the politics of the world enough to start the journey and drip feed information continuously as the main character Artyom traverses the metro system to deliver a message, learning about the rest of the system and how Artyom is written as a character to be realistic.
