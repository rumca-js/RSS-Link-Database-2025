Kuang heavily drew inspiration from Chinese culture as well as the Sino-Japanese War. The worldbuilding was so greatly influenced by real world that you can practically call Nikan the &#39;fantasy China&#39; and Mugen &#39;fantasy Japan&#39; and you would barely see the difference if you would just swap the names.

The contender would be Travis Baldree, and it&#39;s mostly because his novels are mostly centered on women.

It stands out even if the author writes light, low-stake fantasy because it&#39;s usually the other way around.</p> <p>The other example would be Alex Marshall and his Crimson Empire trilogy.

But i always see people request something with monsters or dark fantasy or female main characters or urban fantasy or something along those lines. People do recommend books that have these things, but often theres someone commenting that they found the characters to be very bland. It turns me off from reading most books because badly written characters ruin a book for me even if the story and world building are good.</p> <p>So i ask for some recommendations with greatly written characters. It can be anything. Dark, literary, sword and sorcery, adventure, epic, urban, cozy, sci-fi, horror.

Does it increase? Would you guys recommend it for someone who is a Ririya Revelations fan but not the biggest Ririya Chronicles fan?

Not because I enjoyed a zombie novel but because this <em>really is not a zombie novel</em>!!</p> <p>The same way that Kushiel&#39;s Dart is an epic fantasy quest/political intrigue novel that happens to also be a romance, World War Z is a geopolitical war novel that happens to be about zombies. The zombies are really not that important to the book (which I&#39;m pretty sure is the point), it&#39;s just about people and governments (which are also people) responding to threats against themselves, their families, their countries. Zombies could be &quot;Fascism&quot; and the book could be maybe 70% the same.</p> <",

His bond with Fitz is unique, almost like a second narrator at times. While I&#39;ve read a good chunk of the series, I just haven&#39;t been able to finish it yet.</p> <p>Beyond <em>Realm of the Elderlings</em>, what other stories feature such interesting companions? I&#39;m particularly interested in more grounded relationships, not necessarily telepathic talking animals<strong>.</strong> For instance, a talking bird like Cotton&#39;s parrot from <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> is memorable for its colorful personality, and basic vocabulary.

And I realized something - while I am usually less keen on non-fantasy classics, I tend to absolutely love old fantasy stories. </p> <p>Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie (1911) was one of my favourite books as a kid. I went through a serious Shakespeare phase in my teens. And more recently, I have very much enjoyed A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens (1843), Lud-in-the-Mist by Hope Mirlees (1926) and now Frankenstein (1818). I get excited by those works in a way that&#39;s unique compared to my experience with newer fantasy novels. </p> <p>I now want to chase that feeling. So I&#39;m wondering, which fantasy gems from before the mid 1900s am I missing out on?
