        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, I will soon change pc and for various reasons I will get a MacBook Pro with M4 Pro. I just have a doubt, my main job is to develop apps for a big company and we are still stuck with odoo 14 (for at least another 2/3 years we will not change). I currently use docker to run odoo and postgres. For postgres I know that there is arm version and so it works without problems but for odoo no. By the way the odoo 14 image we use is not the official one but a modified one with some patches. I ask the experts or those who are in the same situation as me, is the performance that poor? And if so, is there any way to increase the performance? Thank you very much</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RiccardoBen\"> /u/RiccardoBen </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1lsem9f/odoo_14_docker_on_apple_silicon_m4_pro/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/doc",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m using postgres and pgadmin4 inside docker as part of learning how to use docker, and I&#39;m having problems with my Spring Boot project that simply doesn&#39;t see my database inside my container. I created an internal network inside docker for pgadmin4 and postgres to be able to communicate. So far, everything is fine. I can use pgadmin normally and manipulate the database. However, my project outside of Docker simply doesn&#39;t see the databases. It can apparently authenticate because I didn&#39;t receive any errors related to credentials, but it simply doesn&#39;t find the database. In my project, I&#39;ve already configured and reviewed the application.yml a dozen times and there&#39;s nothing wrong with it. I&#39;ve deleted and recreated the containers several times and nothing solves it. I also deleted the volumes and rebuilt them, but nothing solves it. Please help me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
