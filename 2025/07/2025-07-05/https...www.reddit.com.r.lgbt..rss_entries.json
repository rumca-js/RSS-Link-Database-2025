        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Josh Stein just vetoed House Bill 805, which defines sex in a way that will block gender changes on birth certificates and ID and raise costs for insurers covering gender affirming care. This is either to simply make it unaffordable or make providers leave the state. Either way, it&#39;s really damaging.</p> <p>It&#39;s scheduled for a vote to override the veto on July 29th. Republicans would need at least one democrat to vote for it in order to pass.</p> <p>Unfortunately, they seem to have one. Rep. Dante Pittman voted for it. If he votes for it again on the July 29th vote then it passes into law regardless of Stein&#39;s veto.</p> <p>I&#39;ll be writing a letter to him.

But haven&#39;t worn it to work since I work for a trucking company and was expecting it to cause conflicts or smth. But that morning was in a rush and just snatched whatever hat I got my hand onto. I was surprised positively when this old-school masculine elderly trucker came up to me and commented &quot;dude has found a cool cap&quot;. Thanked him and he continued &quot;big respect&quot;. Gonna wear it everyday from now on lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EnvironmentalLab7342\"> /u/EnvironmentalLab7342 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ls2zye/yesterday_accidentally_wore_my_pink_cap_with_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ls2zye/yesterday_",

My experience with drag shows has been small, local events. The last one I went to was held in a church hall and the priest won the lip sync contest. HOWEVER, two of my favorite drag race queens are appearing at 3 Dollar Bill in Brooklyn, NYC and I bought a ticket. I need someone to walk me through what I can expect and any unspoken rules that may not be obvious. Like, how does tipping work? Both with the queens and at the bar. I&#39;m not a shut in, I&#39;ve been to theaters and concerts where you sit in a seat, but the club scene has always been super risky considering my condition.

I would like to probe this subreddit to find out for myself by talking with you all about two issues impacting trans people: dating preferences and sports.</p> <p>First, cis people have often said they don&#39;t want to date trans people because they want a partner with genitals looking a certain way. For example, many trans women have penises instead of vaginas and vulvas. I myself an a trans woman with a vagina and vulva, but I am unable to gestate a fetus. I bring up this diversity in genital configuration to say that it&#39;s impossible to know the genital makeup of a person based on transgender status. So, when discussing dating preferences, the focus should be on genital configuration (e.g penis/vagina/testes/uterus) rather than transgender status.</p> <p>Second, there&#39;s been controversy about trans women competing against other women in sports.

The first song was &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot;, which is a regular song, so of course I didn&#39;t know I was playing MY FUCKING &quot;BI PLAYLIST&quot; UNTIL &quot;I KISSED A BOY&quot; BY JUDE YORK STARTED PLAYING. AT FULL FUCKING VOLUME. I turned it off and ran to the bathroom and locked myself in and now I&#39;m hiding. I&#39;m scared because I&#39;m a guy and there&#39;s no way they DON&#39;T know now. They&#39;re not homophobic or anything, but I&#39;m literally shaking in the corner because I&#39;m embarrassed so bad, like it literally hurts. I can&#39;t go back out, I will actually die.
