From communing with Watto&#39;s team for the Game Extractor aswell as ResHax, the .w32 format appears to be less of a game archive and more of a large file with a bunch of pointers, and it&#39;s apparently quite the challenge to navigate. One of ResHax&#39;s regulars is taking his best shot at it, but he&#39;d appreciate someone with Visual Studio experience to aid in its development. The entire game is easily accessible via links in the forum aswell as any of his work.</p> <p>I&#39;m also game to pay for any necessary assistance with anything pertaining to the .w32 format or the mod tools themselves (via Paypal or preferred payment gateway)!</p> <p>If you&#39;re interested feel free to reply here, DM me, or join in on the ResHax thread.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gagnetar\"> /u/Gagnetar </a> <br/> <span><",
