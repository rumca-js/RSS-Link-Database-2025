If you can get past the bright visuals there is a deep, complex game being built. Try the demo on steam but know that the demo build is older than the release build so rarity and weapon balance is much better in the full version.</p> <p>I&#39;ll leave you with a story from last night. I was tasked to find a stolen shipment of artifacts for a black market broker. It was stolen by the insurrectionist faction and was being held in their base 2 zones over. I loaded up on 9mm and healing and made my way over. </p> <p>The zone was a large forest with a lumber mill at the center. From the outside it appeared to have few guards. A duo was patrolling the front but they were easily avoided. I snuck my way through the lumber yard and into the mill. There were more insurrectionists inside and I was quickly spotted. What followed was a 10 minute gunfight as more insurrectionist",
