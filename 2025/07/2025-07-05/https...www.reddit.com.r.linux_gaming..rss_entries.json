My holy grail of Linux Gaming is to be able to play modded Skyrim flawlessly on Windows, which is doable but there&#39;s always some issue somewhere preventing my mods from running perfectly like they do on Windows, especially since modding on Windows is already a headache in it of itself. However, I remember a while ago someone posted that they made a Linux native mod loader that fixes a lot of issues like fixing file name capitalization, and it looked way more promising than running something like Mod Organizer 2 over Wine (of which I heard the RockerBacon script for was discontinued on GitHub???), but I can&#39;t remember what it was called?

I read about it for gaming and everyone was saying using X11 and disable compositor to enhance fps in gaming. Can I disable my compositor in Gnome when I have WM: Mutter (X11)?

Went trough all the possibilities and now im just lost. This error is happening on windows the same as on manjaro. Tested and stressed every component i have for hours at a time. Ran memtest for the ram for 12 passes with 0 errors. SSDs are 96% and 91% healthy. Stress tested the GPU and the CPU with FurMark and mPrime separately and at the same time for hours each, resulting 0 errors (not counting 2 or 3 segfaults of mprime). Highest temperature recorded was 96 degrees C on the CPU. Tested even the network card, no errors. But, after 2-3 minutes of DarkSouls for example, either the system hangs or the kernel panics. Please ask for any logs and ill happily provide them.</p> <p>PC Specs:<br/> -CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 4800HS<br/> -GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3050M<br/> -RAM: 24GB<br/> -Storage: 2x M2 500GB SSD (Intel and Samsung)</p> <p>EDIT: <a href=\"https://forum.manjaro.org/t/hang-ker",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I have this issue where when I play most of the games after a bit they start lag-spiking or sometimes crash, sometimes it even freezes my whole os and I have to force restart my laptop. I only play steam games with proton GE. I use Nvidia 550 drivers. I&#39;ve been trying to fix it for about a month and nothing seems to work. The system isn&#39;t overheating it also doesn&#39;t seem to leave any crash logs. The games I play mainly are: cs2, path of exile, russian fishing 4. This issue only appeared when I switched to linux. Some games lag-spike, some are unplayable and keep freezing my system.

To take the standard Android Roblox APK running inside my Android phone or on Waydroid environment and modify it to run in full desktop mode, just like the closed-source &quot;Sober&quot; client does. I wanted the left-side navigation bar, access to PC-only games, and a true mouse-and-keyboard experience. I had no idea this would become a deep dive, I mean not that much deep than I thought into the very core of software engineering.</p> <h1>First modifying the App Code (Smali Patching)</h1> <p>I started with the most logical approach: if I could decompile the app, I could change its code.</p> <p><strong>My Tools:</strong> My first toolkit was simple.
