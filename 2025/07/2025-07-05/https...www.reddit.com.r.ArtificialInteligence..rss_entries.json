I searched for similar questions before writing this, but none of them were quite right. Sorry in advance if this is a waste of time. I&#39;ve been grappling with AI and what it can do for a long time. I used to be ambivalent/mildly excited about the technology, but as I&#39;ve learned more and been exposed to more about it, the more I&#39;ve come to hate it, distrust, and fear AI.</p> <p>I&#39;m young, and I&#39;m an aspiring writer. People have told me that I&#39;m actually in a good position to make better use out of AI than the average person. Hearing that makes me sick. I&#39;ve been told &quot;adapt or get left behind.&quot; so so many times. From where I&#39;m sitting, I won&#39;t be able to adapt. So what am I to do? How does a person make themselves okay with the fact that they don&#39;t have a place in the future?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

However, it seems the LLMs we have today are more than capable of being the brains of AI agents that perform just about any task. I ask because, I see all the big tech companies, and a few AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic) investing billions in building bigger, better LLMs. I work for one of those big tech companies. It feels like FOMO on steroids. The teams developing LLMs basically have Cart Blanche to spend as much as the want. Their only limitation is how fast nVidia can make GPUs and how fast data centers can expand. I don\u2019t see the pay off, and think the effort should be focused in agentic development instead. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IanTudeep\"> /u/IanTudeep </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1ls05va/have_we_reached_peak_llm/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
