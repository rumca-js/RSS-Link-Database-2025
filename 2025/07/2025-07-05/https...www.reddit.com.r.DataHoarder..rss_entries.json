I currently have that drive in an external case with USB C so I can connect it to my Windows computer. Is there an app that I can use in Windows 11 that could make an image of the drive that I could restore later if I wanted to use the Mini PC with Windows 11, the way it was shipped?</p> <p>The app I looked at, Clonezilla, needs to be installed on a USB and you need to boot the PC from it. Is there an app that can run in Windows 11, where I could just select the external NVME drive and have it save a bootable image to a drive on my computer?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kevalemig\"> /u/Kevalemig </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comme",
