Right now, I&#39;m using a regex pattern to get rid of in-text citations and dangling page numbers. However, I have to manually remove author names and journal article (e.g., Journal of School Leadership 31(1-2)) information that usually appears in the headers/footers of the document. Ideally, I want to reach a point where I drop a file into a folder and automation takes care of all of this.</p> <p>How have others cleaned text they&#39;re generating audiobooks from? I looked for a self-hosted tool that would take care of this, but I didn&#39;t see any.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FormFilter\"> /u/FormFilter </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1lrz373/best_way_to_clean_an_ebook_of_nonnarrative_text/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1lrz3",
