The tracklists are often a mess, or the specific versions of songs are impossible to find.</p> <p>I got tired of manually recreating them, so I built a little tool to do it for me:</p> <p><strong>Discogstify</strong>:<a href=\"https://discogstify.com/\">https://discogstify.com</a></p> <p>You can search for artists or albums as you do in Discogs, or just give it the Discogs link, and it builds the correct Spotify playlist. It\u2019s been a game-changer for me, especially for listening to old electronic compilations and soundtracks in the right order.</p> <p><strong>Looking for Beta Testers:</strong></p> <p>I&#39;d love for some fellow music lovers to try it out.
