After all, using GPT seems as simple as asking anything and instantly getting a magical answer.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s a big difference between using ChatGPT and using it well. Most people stick to casual queries; they ask something and ChatGPT answers. Either they will be happy or sad. If the latter, they will ask again and probably get further sad, and there might be a time when they start thinking of committing suicide. On the other hand, if you start designing prompts with intention, structure, and a clear goal, the output changes completely. That\u2019s where the real power of prompt engineering shows up, especially with something called modular prompting.

I am trying to get it to bulk update (a couple thousand products) with seo content descriptions. however, it keeps messing up even after giving it prompts like &quot;run a qc check based on the guidelines given&quot;. It will still not catch its own mistakes. Has anyone had any luck with bulk editing product content with chat or any other A.I counterpart? I tried even doing it with smaller batches at a time, but it still messes up.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/UNoUrSexy\"> /u/UNoUrSexy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ls115t/looking_for_guidance_in_regard_to_bulk_excel/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ls115t/looking_for_guidance_in_regard_to_bulk_excel/\">[comments]</a></span>",
