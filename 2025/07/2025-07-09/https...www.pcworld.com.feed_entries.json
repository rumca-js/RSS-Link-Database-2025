I\u2019ve used a tool called Steps Recorder in Window 10 and 11 in a lot the past. Basically, it lets you record a problem and its solution as an easy visual explainer. I\u2019ve found it a great way to show family members how to navigate through multiple layers of Windows settings changes without having to go into great detail verbally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\u2019re always impressed, but it\u2019s really not hard. You can still access Steps Recorder by typing Steps Recorder into Windows Search. The thing is, though, Steps Recorder is being phased out. So, I\u2019ve switched to using record function in the Windows Snipping tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use it the same way to record solutions to problems for easy troubleshooting with family or colleagues, or you can record something cool you\u2019re doing on your PC that you want to share. Here\u2019s how to use it:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-b",

And over the long term, a robot lawn mower will cost less than hiring a landscaper\u2014and it won\u2019t expect a tip every week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top-of-the-line models cost a pretty penny, but they can climb slopes and handle very large yards (we\u2019re talking acres of grass). While early robot lawn mowers required you to lay down a boundary wire to prevent them from wandering out of your yard, each of mowers listed here use advanced navigation technology that eliminates the need for any wires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve already spotted some great Prime Day deals on robot lawn mowers, and we expect plenty more as Amazon\u2019s four-day shopping event continues. Just remember that Prime Day wraps up on July 11, so don\u2019t wait too long to scoop up the best discounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>T",
