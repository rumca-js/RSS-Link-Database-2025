I\u2019ve even tried deleting anadius from my pc completely and just re-download it again but even after running the uninstall but on the set up and redownloading all the packs are still there? I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being stupid or there genuinly isn\u2019t a way but it\u2019s really frustrating. </p> <p>I first noticed when I went to update and download the new pack enchanted by nature and I couldn\u2019t download it as the menu to download more packs wasn\u2019t coming up when it usually did.</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Spell3378\"> /u/Ok-Spell3378 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1lvqkp8/uninstalling_a",
