I would like to launch an adf game without having to enter the amiberry GUI. If I run it from the command line I get an error src/osdep/window_cpp, line 1066. From what I understand it is an error caused by the amiberry GUI being loaded incorrectly. By doing a python script I somehow magically got around this error but now I see the boot kickstart v1.3 screen with an hand and a blue floppy disk. I haven&#39;t been able to read up on the possibility of doing these things but I don&#39;t want to display this screen, I just want to run the game that I give it by command. By now I have tried countless commands, the most current is this one:</p> <ul> <li><code>path_absolute_amiberry --model A500 -0 path_game.adf -r path_kickstart_v1.3.rom -G.</code></li> </ul> <p>Or, again</p> <ul> <li><code>path_absolute_amiberry --config path_basic_amiberry-uae -0 path_game.adf ",

What I want is for the forthcoming A1200 from Retro Games Limited to come with a floppy disc drive or the ability to add one externally. In the past few weeks I have traded in my C64 from Retro Games because it didn&#39;t feel retro enough. I want a datasette so I can research, collect and play the retro games from my childhood. When I left home aged 18 one of the first things I bought was an Amiga 500 Cartoon Classics, but I have no idea what I did with it. I probably need to get a refurbished Amiga 500 actually. Anyway, can anyone relate to the modern remakes not feeling retro enough?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Which_Information590\"> /u/Which_Information590 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1lvf5gu/thoughts_on_forthcoming_a1200_from_retro_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#",
