I know many browsers can do the split screen/window thing, where you can put for example 4 tabs in one window on the screen.</p> <p>But.... Is there any way to really split a screen, maximizing the different splits and go back? The reason for this is I&#39;m only allowed to do one live connection at a time to this trading company in TradingView, so when opening several tabs/windows, I can only connect to one tab/window at a time. Therefore it would be convenient to use one connection for one window, divide that window into parts and being able to trade different instruments at the same time while being able to maximize/minimize the different sections when needed...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ztevie65\"> /u/ztevie65 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1lvmkad/browser_split_window/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comm",
