The primary way I handle my eBooks right now is to put them in a folder structure that is included in a Jellyfin Library using the OPDS plugin. Then I use Librera to transfer books to my android phone and read them. It works decently. The Jellyfin stuff is clunky and so is transferring to Librera, but browsing and transferring is less frequent with books than with other media, so it&#39;s not a big deal. Librera is a pretty solid reader for the downloaded files.</p> <p>So if this is working, why mess with it? I want to get an eBook reader. I&#39;m tired of reading on my phone all the time.
