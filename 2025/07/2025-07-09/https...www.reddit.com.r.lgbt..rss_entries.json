I&#39;m a lesbian cis woman who has experienced a lot of trauma and homophobia by men in my life, which is why I&#39;ve often struggled with my femininity. The person who encouraged me to explore my feminine side is a trans woman. She uploads a lot of fashion and makeup tips on YouTube, which have helped me a lot, but which are aimed at trans women. It was through her that I first gained an understanding of fashion, how to dress according to my body type, etc. She has good style. I don&#39;t push myself into the spotlight there, and I don&#39;t comment on anything. When I told a trans friend about it, she reacted with a lot of incomprehension and said I was an imposter. What do you think? Is it bad if a trans woman is my fashion role model, if she primarily creates content for trans women?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_lilas",

She said that being trans didn\u2019t make sense because your gender was already decided biologically at birth (she didn\u2019t understand that gender and sex are two different things). But what really threw me off was her saying that her one trans friend is \u201cactually really nice though.\u201d What was so weird about it was that it implies that trans people who can\u2019t be nice? Like trans people are people.
