        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve never read a non-fiction book (maybe for school as a kid but I can\u2019t remember) but in the last two weeks, A LOT of not so great things have happened in my life causing my life to change drastically which is really effecting my mental health. I want to put down my romance &amp; thriller books for a bit and pick up some books about mental health, spirituality, growth, etc., to see if it\u2019ll help improve my mental health &amp; mindset! </p> <p>I would really love some suggestions on good non-fiction books that have to do with growing mentally and spiritually (I\u2019m not religious but I\u2019m open to reading one! I say spiritually loosely) and/or self-help books. I really need to grow as a person and better myself, I think reading non-fiction books that encourage growth will help me a lot! Also, I would prefer if it\u2019s on KU as I\u2019m moving out and won\u2019t have any more space for physical copies (plus money is tight \ud83d\ude05) but if I do have a library card so any sugge",

I read the book not knowing what it was about or who the author was, after reading it and being in awe of how good the writing is I took time to look into it and was even more impressed by Solzhenitsyn\u2019s credibility. </p> <p>My question is, are there any books that are similar in writing style to this one? Maybe even books by the same author? The way he describes certain things makes you feel as if you\u2019re in the situation with the characters. For example in one part of the book describing how cold the room is he talks about how the floors are \u2018earthern and the ceilings high\u2019, a room with an earthern floor holds in cold so this made me admire how well researched the book is. </p> <p>Another line I really loved was \u201cCan a man who\u2019s warm understand one who\u2019s freezing?\u201d Just amazing.",

Some of them were utter dogshit but I read and finished them anyways. Anyways, I\u2019ve started reading novels and such about a year or two ago and have taken an interest to dive back into romance. Now I don\u2019t really trust booktok because the last time I bought a book from there I read some incest love story that I dropped very quickly. I came here for suggestions! These aren\u2019t necessary but I\u2019d love if this romance was centered in the jazz era or just involves music in general. I\u2019m also a big huge music nerd and something I always fantasized about is a romance where music takes a big part. I don\u2019t mind smut but if your recommendation has any please let me know.

I have recently been getting into Japanese literature and would love some recommendations.</p> <p>I have read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami, Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata, and Days at the Morisaki Bookshop.
