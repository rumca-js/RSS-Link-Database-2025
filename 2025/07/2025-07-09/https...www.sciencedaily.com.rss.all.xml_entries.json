        "description": "A groundbreaking collaboration between Los Alamos scientists and Duke University has resurrected a nearly forgotten 1938 experiment that may have quietly sparked the age of fusion energy. Arthur Ruhlig, a little-known physicist, first observed signs of deuterium-tritium (DT) fusion nearly a decade before its significance became clear in nuclear science. The modern team not only confirmed the essence of Ruhlig s original findings but also traced how his work may have inspired key Manhattan Project insights.",

Using the UK\u2019s e-MERLIN radio array, the PEBBLeS project found these rocky seeds in unprecedented detail, bridging the elusive gap between dusty discs and fully-formed worlds. The discovery hints that systems even larger than our own could be commonplace and sets the stage for the upcoming Square Kilometre Array to map hundreds more planetary nurseries.",

        "description": "Astronomers using the Green Bank Telescope spotted surprisingly cold, dense hydrogen clouds embedded inside the Milky Way\u2019s vast, super-hot Fermi bubbles\u2014structures thought to be created by a recent, violent outburst from the galaxy\u2019s core. Because such chilled gas should evaporate quickly in million-degree surroundings, its survival hints that the bubbles are only about a million years old. Ultraviolet data from Hubble backs the discovery, and the clouds\u2019 million-mph speeds reinforce the bubbles\u2019 youth. The find forces scientists to rethink how energy and matter flow through galaxies.",

These micro-crystals, just nanometers wide, were identified through simulations and lab experiments, revealing that even the most common ice in space retains a surprising structure. This has major implications not just for astrophysics, but also for theories about the origin of life and advanced materials technology.",
