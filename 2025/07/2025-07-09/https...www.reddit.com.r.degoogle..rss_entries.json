But I&#39;m continually fighting the situation of being the <em>only</em> person in the family group who doesn&#39;t use either Google Messages or Apple iMessage - making me the problem when it comes to group chats. One particular example is recently on a family vacation (cruise ship) with no cellular, but ship wifi... everyone else could coordinate locations, meet-up times, etc. Except me. Some always had to relay the messages to me, because no one else in the family uses Signal, etc. - nothing other than the default &#39;text&#39; app that came on their phone. Asking them to install and use something like Signal for the sole purpose of talking to me... isn&#39;t realistic. </p> <p>Please tell me there&#39;s a better option! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/memilanuk\"> /u/memilanuk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments",

I degoogled it best as i could but the lack of full privacy ROM on samsung is baffling. I&#39;m looking to sell the Samsung to buy a pixel 9 pro, mainly for the crazy good camera. My question, does GrapheneOS support the original Google camera with the upscalling taking place after you snap a pic ? I dont need no Gmail, Gemini, AI search and shit, i just want the exact same picture quality as on a stock pixel. I remember back in the days i installed lineage on my pixel 4a but the pictures were so bad compared on the stock ROM even with Google camera installed. Thanks !</p> <p>Also, are the pixels 9 and 9 pro good today ? Ive read horors stories on pixel phones before, getting hot or suddenly dying etc...

Absolutely unacceptable how hard they try to lock people out of accounts if the person doesn&#39;t have their old phone sitting near them right then.</p> <p>Anyway, I know about Proton. What other email services WILL NOT force me through multiple stages of BS just to login from a new location?</p> <p>Alternatively, has anyone ever figured out how to FORCE Gmail to actually work with just a password from any location? Even when I remove all phone numbers, recovery emails, etc... it still refuses when tested from a new location! WTF!?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any and all suggestions. I am definitely open to reliable email providers FROM ANY COUNTRY as long as there&#39;s a belief they will stick around and are trust worthy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",

The ads are getting more obnoxious by the day, and I&#39;m not even sure how much data they&#39;re collecting on me anymore. Has anyone else had enough? I&#39;ve been trying to switch to alternative search engines, but so far none of them have really met my needs.</p> <p>Some options I&#39;ve tried include DuckDuckGo (which is great, but doesn&#39;t always return the most relevant results), StartPage (which is good for privacy, but still seems to be crawling on Google&#39;s back), and Bing (which is... well, Bing). But none of these have really impressed me. So I&#39;m turning to you all - has anyone else found a search engine that truly lives up to its promises? What are some alternatives to Google that you&#39;d recommend, and why should I switch?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious_Stop7537\"> /u",
