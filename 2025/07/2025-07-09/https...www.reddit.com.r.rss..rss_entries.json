The ios syncing and clean, consistent design has been a dream, and beyond a few blips here and there fetching sites, the experience has been essentially flawless. </p> <p>Therefore I was among those not particularly looking to change things up when the new Reeder was announced, but it&#39;s been almost a year, and I was curious to hear from those who made the switch or who have used it fairly recently. </p> <p>I recall the initial release being a bit buggy and a lot more features were more &#39;coming soon&#39; than functional at launch. How is it these days? How does the &#39;flow&#39; feel of the feed vs Classic? I understand the dev is a single guy, but I&#39;m curious how much of the functional requests have been fulfilled at this point? Ho",
