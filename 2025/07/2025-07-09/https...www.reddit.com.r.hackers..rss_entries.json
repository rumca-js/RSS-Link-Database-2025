Then you leave a malicious script somewhere, that if they click on it, it will potentially turn their system into a farming setup for your chosen token. I even suggest making a new token that has its value directly tied to how horrible legislations are around spams.</p> <p>I feel like even making the spammers/people looking for phishing attacks worried with the possibility of them making money for someone else is a good step on its own.</p> <p>And finally, I cannot quite understand how this can be legally challenged, since the attacker was at fault in the first place.</p> <p>(Note: I am genuienly eager to learn. Please don&#39;t be a jerk explaining your points, because my nervous system would then physically prevent me ",

Some pictures not nude but they were suggestive. I\u2019ve done everything I need to because I have dipped my toes in security. Changed the password, isolated the device they used. Kicked anything strange off the network and ran a scan of every device I had. I just am wondering if there\u2019s anything I can do about the pictures. Is there a software I can run, and how do I ensure that the hacker hasn\u2019t planted anything within a file in the google drive without opening myself up to more intrusion?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NosyKestrel766\"> /u/NosyKestrel766 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1lv7qka/hacker_got_me/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1lv7qka/hacker_got_me/\">[comments]</a></span>",
