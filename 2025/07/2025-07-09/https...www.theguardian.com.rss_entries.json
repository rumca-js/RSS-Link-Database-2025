Once the darling of the Emmys, The Bear initially called itself a comedy, despite not really having any jokes or levity or fun in it. And this was down to some bad maths about its duration. The Bear was a half-hour show, and sitcoms are half-hour shows, therefore The Bear must be a sitcom.</p><p>However, in its fourth season, The Bear was no longer a half-hour show. Of its 10 new episodes, none are less than 30 minutes long. True, one is 31 minutes and three more scrape in under 35 minutes. But one is 38 minutes long, two more stretch on for 40 or more, and one somehow manages to be one hour and 11 minutes long.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/09/tv",

Just look at Friends!</p><p>Now in its third season, it\u2019s safe to say that HBO\u2019s Sex and the City revival And Just Like That has struggled to capture the zeitgeist in the same way as its mother series. But that all changes now because, in its most recent episode, shrugged off its tired old premise to become something new. Now it is nothing less than a show about the miracle of human reanimation.</p><p>The most recent episode was entitled Silent Mode. In it, Nicole Ari Parker\u2019s character Lisa learned that her 90-year-old father had died. As she prepared to deliver a moving eulogy, sharp-eyed And Just Like That loyalists were all grabbed by the same sudden thought: wait, hadn\u2019t he already died once before?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/09/my-dad-just-died-again-a-close-inspection-of-tvs-most-shocking-plot-holes\">Continue",

At their best the touring team look sharp and dangerous but, with the Test series fast approaching, they are still not firing on all cylinders in some key areas. A first-half injury to full-back Blair Kinghorn has also come at a delicate moment ahead of the first Test in Brisbane on Saturday week.</p><p>Fielding close to their best starting XV, the Lions finished up scoring five tries with Ollie Chessum, James Lowe and Marcus Smith crossing in the first and Garry Ringrose and Josh van der Flier following suit in the second. The in-form Finn Russell also contributed 11 points with the boot to cap another assured performance.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/09/act-brumbies-british-and-irish-lions-rugby-union-t",

The country was in a state of high alert, but the Australian cricket team, who had landed in early June, stayed to play in the Ashes.

Now Perry has made a film about Pavement and it seems to be his intention here to avoid, strenuously and at all costs, obviousness \u2013 and perhaps the most clunkingly obvious thing for any newbie to ask about is the name.
