The album was produced at the Damon Recording Studios also in Kansas. They were also associated with a group named Jonogle Music which I also can&#39;t find anything about. The only other name attached is that the composers name is N. Pack.</p> <p>Any help with finding a recording of Yellow Daisy or anything else the band released would be greatly appreciate",

When Cyndi Lauper made it big, I thought her voice was quirky and she was colourful and fun.</p> <p>Then, a couple years ago, her cover the song I&#39;m Gonna Be Strong showed up on my You Tube feed. As the song builds I grew more and more impressed. Then at the end? Wow. I was floored.</p> <p>So, then I clicked on the vid for her cover or Etta James&#39; At Last. While I prefer the original, Cyndi truly showed her pipes again!</p> <p>What was that one song that changed your opinion about a singer&#39;s voice?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbx7ss4F7JE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbx7ss4F7JE</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhRTUbv5J_Q\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhRTUbv5J_Q</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Casual_Observance\"> /u/Casual_Observance </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1lvoy8d/song",

Well tonight I listened to the Toxicity album by System of A Down for the first time and it legit brought tears to my eyes. The vocals, the drums, guitars, the harmonies, the screaming! lol ALL OF IT! I think I had an out of body experience. That shit was so beautiful. I had to sit down, collect myself, and tell someone. I ended up here \ud83d\ude02 If you could recommend any more classic rock albums I should know about\u2026.it would be much appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hot_Veterinarian9788\"> /u/Hot_Veterinarian9788 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1lv7v75/is_this_a_safe_space_i_know_im_late/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1lv7v75/is_this_a_safe_space_i_know_im_late/\">[comments]</a></s",
