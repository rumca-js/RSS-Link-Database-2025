The main reason i believe you wouldnt be able to play that game and others on Linux is because of the anticheat or something.

I was able to get around 60 fps at high settings. Yesterday, I decided to try out the game on the same system, but with Linux Mint installed. I&#39;m not dual-booting or anything like that -- this is a clean install. I&#39;ve updated the drivers, set the preferred GPU to my NVIDIA card at performance mode, used Proton on Steam, and have done everything. But the game just -- runs like ass!</p> <p>I&#39;m getting like 2 FPS, and I just can&#39;t seem to find out why. What&#39;s going on? I&#39;m VERY new to Linux, and I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m doing yet. Do y&#39;all know what could be the potential reasons why this is happening?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <p>My specs:</p> <p>Intel i5 13th gen</p> <p>16 gb RAM</p> <p>RTX 3050 4 gb (yeah, it&#39;s not much -- but it still ran game fine on Win 11)</p> <p>Linux Mint Ci",
