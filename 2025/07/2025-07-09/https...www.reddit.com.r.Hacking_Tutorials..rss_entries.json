So I am curious how do I start with game cheats potentially getting to understand more of other stuff like hacking in general or just breaking and poking into stuff for fun. Where do I start? What do I have to do? Since I am studying CS I already know a little bit, but I have not taken much action myself than what is taught and I want to change it now. Maybe some reverse engineering or using cheat engine? I do not really know myself, so here I am thinking if YOU could help me in anyway.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Accomplished_Rip8078\"> /u/Accomplished_Rip8078 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1lvwve1/how_do_i_get_into_this_stuff/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hack",

His family has already reached out to us (his friends) asking for help, but we feel powerless.</p> <p>Please, if anyone has gone through something similar or has any ideas, we\u2019re looking for a real solution \u2014 ideally something that could help limit his screen time or help him regain control without making him feel attacked or alienated.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if this is the right place to post th",
