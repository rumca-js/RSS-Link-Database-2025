The UIs were clunky, the features were either too basic or buried behind paywalls, or the apps forced me into cloud sync and signups.</p> <p>I wanted something that\u2019s:</p> <p>- Modern and clean (Material You design)</p> <p>- Fully offline and private \u2014 no tracking, no ads</p> <p>- Focused on the classic Eisenhower Matrix method</p> <p>- Easy to use: add, move, and complete tasks effortlessly</p> <p>So I built **Focus** \u2014 an open-source Flutter app that\u2019s just that. It uses Hive for local storage, has light/dark mode, and stays 100% offline. No accounts, no push notifications, no distractions.</p> <p>If you\u2019re someone who wants a simple and effective way to manage your tasks without the bloat, check it out:</p> <p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Appaxaap/Focus\">https://github.com/Appaxaap/Focus</a></p>",
