I may as well sus this out haha... I&#39;m looking for someone to create an app that&#39;s going to work similarly to vsco/prequel (Photo editing) with experienced developer skills, that branch into management, ui/ux design, reactjs , really any backend framework... Oh and experience using AI models to edit images. Midjourney or stable diffusion are both fine. We&#39;ll be requiring a mobile app for ios and android as well. Same deal as last time, if you&#39;re up for it hit my dm&#39;s, if you know of anywhere I could find such a person, also hit my dm&#39;s :) </p> <p>Oh and I&#39;m paying nicely too... </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Gain5171\"> /u/Successful-Gain5171 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1lvltcq/need_help_finding_de",
