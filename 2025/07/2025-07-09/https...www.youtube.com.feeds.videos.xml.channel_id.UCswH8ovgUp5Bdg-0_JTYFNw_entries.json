We talked about his journey from addiction, chaos, and demonic encounters to finding peace and purpose through faith. We went deep on spiritual warfare, masculinity, and the raw power of discipline\u2014both in the ring and in life. Plus, Bas explained the science and story behind his O2 Trainer\u2014a device he developed to dramatically improve breathing and stamina. You can check it out at www.o2trainer.com.
