Im trying to make a backup station for cold storage at home. Im a bit torn whether I should use the built in hardware raid controller (which I believe is Jmicron JMS562, correct me if I&#39;m wrong!) or use software RAID (either in Bios or OS). My plan is to use it with many systems, both MacOS and Windows, which is why I&#39;m planning to use EXFAT to format it. </p> <p>From a convenience standpoint, hardware RAID with the built in controller would of course be the best, as you then don&#39;t have to configure it with every new system. The problem with that is I have read a lot against using these hardware controllers as these can be a big problem if that controller ever fail and you can&#39;t get an exact replacement. Im planning to use RAID 1 if that is of importance. </p> <p>Thankfull for help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",

But what I do know is that they&#39;re all stored on LTO tapes in a closet. </p> <p>I just recently watched a few youtube videos to get familiar with LTO, LTFS, etc. and I feel committed enough to rent a MagStor tape drive, and download MYLTO for Mac to get copies of these files. But is it really as simple as getting the tape, popping it in the tape drive, and using MYLTO to copy files over onto an external SSD? Is there any detail that I&#39;m missing here, or things to be aware of so that I don&#39;t do anything to disrupt the source LTO tape?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Present_Boat_9663",
