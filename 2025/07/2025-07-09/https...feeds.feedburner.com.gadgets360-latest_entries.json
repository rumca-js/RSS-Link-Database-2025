        "description": "Scientists have proposed a new class of stellar objects called \u201cdark dwarfs,\u201d sub-stellar bodies that may glow faintly from the energy released by annihilating dark matter particles. Found near the galaxy\u2019s core, these objects could hold crucial clues about the elusive nature of dark matter. Powered not by fusion but by WIMP-like particles, dark dwarfs would retain lithium-7 in their atmospheres\u2014providing a unique observational marker. Researchers believe telescopes like JWST may soon detect them, offering new evidence in the decades-long hunt for dark matter\u2019s true identity.",

It is based on Android 16 and is said to carry fixes for a couple of bugs discovered in previous iterations. Following the update, Pixel users can expect improved Wi-Fi connectivity and performance.

        "description": "Phone 3 is the best yet from the house of Nothing, and as I mentioned in my first impressions, it is the first complete smartphone from the company. It has all the traits of a flagship smartphone, but due to its high pricing, it is a phone tough to recommend. The processor can handle everyday tasks and some gaming, but the Snapdragon 8 Elite at this price would have made more sense. The cameras and display are decent, but we have seen better in this price segment. Overall, it is a great first-gen flagship product from Nothing.",
