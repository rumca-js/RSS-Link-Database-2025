Come learn about the libraries and techniques that make writing CUDA C++ code easier and more performant. Through examples, we'll explore all aspects of writing modern C++ software for GPUs, including heterogeneous memory management, algorithm design, and synchronization.\n\nDuring this talk, you'll:\n- Learn to evaluate when you should use a CUDA library versus writing your own kernel.\n- Explore popular CUDA C++ libraries such as Thrust, CUB, and libcu++.\n- Understand how you can easily compose different CUDA libraries and your own custom CUDA C++ code together.\n- Build intuition about the performance implications of CUDA libraries.\n- You'll leave confident about how to select the best tool for the job to accelerate your C++ applications fo",
