In the beginning, it looked like the (now forgotten) Betamax was going to win the video recording war. By 1976, Universal Studios and Walt Disney Productions feared revenue loss and sued Sony in a CA court. The court ruled in favor of Sony. Universal appealed in 1982 and the 9th Circuit court reversed the decision, which held Sony liable for contributory copyright infringement.

It brings me almost everything I need.</p> <p>BUT, what is not nice, is the subtitle management. And I&#39;m always watching movies with subtitles. They are always out of sync, broken encoding, displayed then disappeared...</p> <p>So the big question is : does Streamio + Torrentio + RD handles the subtitles perfectly ?
