Several new VPs hired in the last month, with layoffs already beginning as they prepare to outsource everything.</p> <p>Some functions, I understand can be effectively outsourced (ignoring whether I like or agree with the practice or not). But some functions, I\u2019m struggling to see how it will be even at least bit successful. Compliance analysis, risk analysts, program managers in charge of regulatory requirement programs, I have already been given notice and are currently preparing to transition their work (those that have accepted the retention offer that is). To me, bunch of that work doesn\u2019t translate to someone overseas, given language/accent barriers, I need to work closely with local IT and business tea",

We want it to be able to connect machines both in our internal network and DMZ back to the SIEM server. I am wondering where the best placement for the server would be on the network. Common knowledge would be for me to place on our internal network so it is not exposed to the internet, but that would require me to create rules in our firewall to allow the machines on DMZ to talk to this one server on the internal network. These rules would be very granular for only the specific machine IPs and Ports needed but I do not like the idea of opening connections from the DMZ into the Internal network. The other option would be to place the SIEM server on the DMZ but then I have a highly sensitive server exposed to the internet. </p> <p>Is there a better way to do this?

Boss bought it because it has &quot;AI&quot; list in its marketing. But really, the AI part is crappy chat bot that can&#39;t do anything useful. The platform is filled with bugs, the query language Yara-l is a mess, and worst is the support. Overall, it a crappy SIEM made by a venture capital pump and dump startup bought by google. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/InternetIs4Losers\"> /u/InternetIs4Losers </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1lv7jvr/google_secops_siem_is_vaporware/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1lv7jvr/google_secops_siem_is_vaporware/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Our Global Cyber Defense team is relatively new\u2014only about 4 years old including leadership\u2014and now the company is undergoing a major cultural shift. There\u2019s a big emphasis on KPIs and performance metrics, even more so than before.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had SMART goals each year, but now there\u2019s pressure across the board to step up and redefine what \u201csuccess\u201d looks like. Since I\u2019m the only one handling red team operations, I\u2019m involved end-to-end: planning, vulnerability discovery, credential harvesting (phishing/leaked creds), deploying payloads, establishing C2, and getting past our EDR. Naturally, engagements take time\u2014especially with no support roles in the process.</p> <p>My concern is that not every engagement yields results. Some are successful, others don\u2019t meet the initial objective, and that variance makes it tricky to frame performance in ",
