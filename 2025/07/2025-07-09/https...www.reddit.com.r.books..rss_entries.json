What did strike me, and I\u2019m not quite sure why, was how much she came across to me as a kind of female Henry Miller. Maybe it was the sense that both (my opinion, natch) are probably best read, appreciated and obsessed over in your 20s and 30s. There\u2019s an eccentric, bohemian, street intellectual brio to both.
