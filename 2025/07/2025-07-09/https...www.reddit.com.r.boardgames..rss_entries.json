We managed to sort out most of the rules, but there&#39;s still some stuff that&#39;s not clear, like: 1) If someone activates a trap/defense in the middle of my action/card, do i get to finish resolving my action/card or do they resolve theirs first? And what happens if i die in the middle of my action/card? 2) if a summon has 2 movement, do they get to move 1 and attack one twice, right? So in a single action a summon can attack twice the same target(?) 3) if we got it right, an upgrade can be used on a mage; but when is it discarded? 4) if I discard a card for the black rose room, does it go in my memories or what? 5) summons ASSIGNED to a mage disappear when said mage die, but do normal summons disappear when their owner dies?</p> <p>If you can answer some or all of these question i&#39;ll be very gratef",

I very rarely see people selling European games from recent years. For example, the Anno 1800 Expansion, Family Inc, Kuhandel Master, Kuhandel Festival, Hit Extreme (available in France), and a number of other games are only available in Germany. You can order them to the US on amazing with steep shipping costs (and maybe tariffs?) so I could imagine that\u2019s why; it\u2019s harder to get things sent from Japan without using a service for it.</p> <p>What other games are only available in Central Europe that people should bring back with them and sell/trade on BGG?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OxRedOx\"> /u/OxRedOx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1lvn87w/do_people",

One thing I find fascinating is that it has a clear, hard scoring cap at 96 points. Like a 147 in snooker or a 180 in darts, it gives you something to chase beyond just beating your opponent. In some sense, you\u2019re trying to beat the game itself.</p> <p>My best is 93, but hitting 96 doesn\u2019t just require perfect play. It also depends on your opponent failing to block what you need.</p> <p>Almost any game technically has a max score, but they\u2019re usually so high or opaque that they don\u2019t feel obtainable. In Naishi, the ceiling is close enough to make you try.</p> <p>Are there other games like this?

My local game store has a used copy of Rails &amp; Sails for $40 right now and I was considering grabbing it. Does it change up the gameplay/meta enough to justify $40 if I already have the U.S.A. version? Or would I be better served looking into another game? Would appreciate any thoughts.

It is mean, unforgiving, and often pushes players to prey on the weak on their way towards possible victory. If you want board game interaction and proactivity in decision making, this game may be up your alley. Attackers have all the advantage; they may choose what type of dice is being rolled, how many dice are being rolled, and which ships take damage. Some say the game feels limiting, but it is a matter of perspective. In many games, 1 action per turn is the norm. So whenever I get 2-4 turns, I see it as a bonus.</p> <p>As my fleet got destroyed, I smiled as I was thinking of how I could exact my revenge. I flooded the council with influence in an attempt to secure all 3 vox cards and swing the game back in my favor. However my plans were foiled as the other 3 players avoided aggression and discarded their aggressio",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So my wife and I just started playing Sky Team and aren&#39;t sure if the flaps are required on the final round. The instructions don&#39;t explicitly say whether it is required for this round but our reasoning is that there are 3 dice for brakes (2,4,6) and it says they have to be used in order. So if the pilot plays a dice for the engine, and all 3 for the brakes, there isn&#39;t a die left for the flaps and it doesn&#39;t make logical sense that the flaps would be required on the ground. Followup question: if it&#39;s not required can one be played to flatten the plane or does the plane need to be flat before advancing to the airport?

Corruption piling up, skulls dropping everywhere, and our resources stretched to the limit. That final boss fight always feels epic. Push a little more, or weaken and retreat!</p> <p>I\u2019m always impressed at how well Restoration blended old-school nostalgia with modern mechanics. The game has a strong sense of progression, and every decision feels like it matters.</p> <p>Anyone else playing this? Which expansions do you favor? I love the guilds Alliances brings!

I wanted to know if anyone had recommendations on games to bring that would be great for younger children (I also work with children with intellectual and learning disabilites) that are quick to play and easy to teach and best at 2 player count. </p> <p>I have a copy of sushi go that seems good but wondering more so on games like dixit or maybe even Kingdomino( though ive never played this before)</p> <p>Thank you in advance !</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Rooster16",
