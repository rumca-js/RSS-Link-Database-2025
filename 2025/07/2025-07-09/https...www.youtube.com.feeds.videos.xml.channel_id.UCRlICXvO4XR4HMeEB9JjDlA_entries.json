        "description": "You\u2019re essentially immortal\u2014at least on an atomic level. While you might see just one human being talking on the screen, that person is actually made up of 78 organs, five of which are crucial for survival.\n\nThese organs, like the rest of the body, are composed of cells that regularly regenerate\u2014around one percent, or about 330 billion cells, are replaced every day.\n\nHowever, unlike cells, the atoms that make up those cells don\u2019t regenerate; stable atoms last indefinitely. Scientists aren\u2019t sure if proton decay, a process that might break down atoms, really happens, and if it does, it could take longer than the universe itself will exist.\n\nSo, effectively, the atoms inside you are eternal, meaning parts of your body will outlast even the universe. Forget mythical remedies for immortality\u2014this is the real deal.",
