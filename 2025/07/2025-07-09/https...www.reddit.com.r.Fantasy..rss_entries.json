Im craving to read about a male main character thats willing to sacrifice EVEYHTING including themsleves and their own sanity to save their loved ones. I need them to be tortured OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, to SEE how much worse things are getting th emote they try, but have them sei obsess over acchiving the perfect result, more than having general hope and faith actually.</p> <p>I need someone whos bound to duty like how phainon is, but mostly sunday is. How the thorns bind him to obey and be molded into the perfect angel-like creature when hes nowhere near perfect. I need my maine male chacratcer to suffer for others</p> <p>Im not a hugeee fan of high fantasy, as im more into character development than rushed plots or huge books orrrr super detailed books tbh.

It\u2019s not that there\u2019s truly anything wrong with the book, just my taste, but the prose was (for lack of a better term) mid and the plot failed to suck me in. I also wasn\u2019t a fan of the global world-building, like how the continents are amalgamations of several real cultures and nations instead of being inspired by one or two. Normally in fantasy this works fine, but for an urban fantasy it seemed out of place and a missed opportunity, especially with how much global trade and western colonialism were present in the narrative. </p> <p>I also agree with the one other major critique I\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s a lack of female characters. I\u2019m fine with books that are male heavy (I\u2019ve sat through multiple Brandon Sando books lol) but it gets to a point where having so few female characters feels limiting. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --",
