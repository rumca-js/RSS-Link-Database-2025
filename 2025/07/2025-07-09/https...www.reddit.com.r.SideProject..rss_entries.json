The stories are gentle and designed especially for young kids, and all the art is generated in a classic storybook style using AI.</p> <p>We\u2019re looking for honest feedback, ideas, or suggestions for what features you\u2019d want in an app like this\u2014or just to hear what works for your bedtime routine!
