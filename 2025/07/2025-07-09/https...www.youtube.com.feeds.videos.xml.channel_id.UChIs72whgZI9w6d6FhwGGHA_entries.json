In this graphics card comparison and benchmark, we first test the marketing claims against each other, then we bring them to battle in our hemi-anechoic chamber for acoustics, our thermal test room for GPU and VRAM temperature testing, and even through some games we hand-selected for their biases towards waifus or evil beings.\n\nWatch our Yeston RX 9070 XT Waifu standalone review and tear down here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs1O21ibuKM\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
