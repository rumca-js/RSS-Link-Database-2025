        "description": "Thrown into the chaos of Jurassic World Rebirth, their characters panicked\u2014but the actors never did.\n\nIn this episode of Seen on the Screen, Jacqueline Coley sits down with Luna Blaise and David Iacono, two rising stars who play Theresa Delgado and Xavier Dobbs\u2014a young couple belonging to the Delgado family storyline. Swept into a world of dinosaurs, mercenaries and mission specialists, their characters bring a relatable civilian perspective to the prehistoric pandemonium.\n\nLuna and David reveal the whirlwind casting process that brought them into the iconic franchise, what it was like filming the epic T-Rex raft sequence, how they built real-life family dynamics with co-stars Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Audrina Miranda, and why director Gareth Edwards encouraged them to play on set. Plus, they reflect on their earlier breakout roles (Luna on Fresh Off the Boat and David on The Summer I Turned Pretty) and bring their behind-the-scenes competitive spirit to life.\n\nFollow and listen to Seen",
