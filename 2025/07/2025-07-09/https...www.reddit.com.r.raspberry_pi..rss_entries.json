It can be used for all sorts of things, from automating repetitive typing tasks to being used in penetration testing.</p> <p>My project uses a simple scripting language that&#39;s inspired by DuckyScript but adds a ton of modern programming features that make it much more flexible.</p> <p>Some of the key features include:</p> <p>* Variables: Declare variables with $ and use them anywhere. (VAR $user = &quot;admin&quot;)<br/> * Conditional Logic: Use IF/ELSE/END_IF blocks to make your scripts dynamic.<br/> * Loops: Full WHILE loop support for complex, repetitive tasks.<br/> * Math Operations: Perform math directly in your scripts (VAR $new",

The research I did pretty much tells me it could be something dumb like the is needing to be reinstalled, the SD itself went bad, or it could just be a dead board. My question is, how common is that double solid LED on the 4b 4GB? I couldn\u2019t really gauge how often they died and exhibited that symptom. Anyway, take the gamble?

I had an old PC that was able to use WiFi direct to create a hotspot connection that my pi could connect to and that worked fine and I was able to connect to it on the old PC. The new problem is that my new laptop doesn\u2019t support WiFi direct for some reason. To counter this, I created a guest network on my WiFi router that had the same IP and login info as the hotspot on my old computer, and this also worked.</p> <p>Now, the problem is that when I made the guest network I kinda ruined all the electronic WiFi connections in my house so I had to disable it. I went on the pi and connected it to the 2.4 GHz network from my home router and also connected my laptop to it, but this time it will not connect. I\u2019m thinking it could be the IP of the network but I\u2019m not sure any thoughts? Any help is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=",
