Each film has to also not be so bad that it makes no money and justifies a sequel.

Through the course of the movie, the viewer really gets into the weeds with how the station itself works and, to a lesser degree, how a WW2 era train works. Great stuff and an excellent film.</p> <p>THE FINAL COUNTDOWN (1980) with Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen, directed by Don Taylor.<br/> The film concerns the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier. A time vortex opens and the carrier gets sent back to 1941 and the captain and crew must decide whether or not to interfere with history. The plot itse",

And vice versa, a bad title can ward people off a movie as much as bad marketing or bad word of mouth. For example, William Friedkin&#39;s &quot;Sorcerer&quot; had the miserable luck of being released in the wake of the unexpected phenomenon that was &quot;Star Wars&quot;, but it wasn&#39;t helped either by a title that many found quite misleading. People who expected a fantasy film with that title were surprised to find it was actually a new adaptation of &quot;The Wages of Fear&quot; and that &quot;Sorcerer&quot; actually referred to the name of a truck. (Friedkin later said he got the title from the Miles Davis album and that the &quot;sorcerer&quot; in question was the hand of fate.) So while &quot;Sorcerer&quot; had a bad hand dealt to it already, the title didn&#39;t help matters any.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mst3Kgf\"> /u",
