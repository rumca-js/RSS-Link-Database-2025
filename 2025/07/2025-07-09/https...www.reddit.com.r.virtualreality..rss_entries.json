You get games like, gran turismo 7, RE4 remake, RE village, red matter 1 and 2, half-life Alyx, modded Skyrim, modded Beatsaber etc etc. the pcvr adapter will likely require some tinkering but the long term playability of the setup outweighs any cons there and you can always return it if it\u2019s too much of a hassle.</p> <p>However, if you value plug and play and better graphics (by maybe a 15% margin objectively) go Quest 3.</p> <p>Sony partnering with Valve was a genius move to boost sales for both parties and expose a specific audience to the widest array of amazing VR exclusives. </p> <p>I\u2019d also argue that the increased competition with Meta from this move is positive for the VR community so Meta doesn\u2019t monopolize.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

Having both the USB-C capture card and the transmitter as one unit would be amazing.</p> <p>",
