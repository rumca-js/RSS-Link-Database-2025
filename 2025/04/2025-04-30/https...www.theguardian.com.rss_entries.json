After all, I knew about rescue dogs. Cabbage, our lovely collie cross who had died at the beginning of the year, had come from a Dogs Trust rescue centre 15 years earlier, and had also been pretty nervous at first. I was confident that Sophie, a one-year-old of indeterminate breed (but with a lot of German shepherd), brought to us on a van from Romania, would, like Cabbage, quickly settle down in her new home. How wrong I was.</p><p>Our new dog seemed frightened of my wife and I, and our house, and desperately searched for the smallest space she could find, eventually settling behind a sofa.

A joint of meat is a magnificent offering, but it can sometimes be hard to carve cleanly, and you end up leaving chunks of meat and flavoursome fat on the bone. These scraps are perfect for turning into succulent, tasty tacos. Cut any meat and fat off the bone, then shred with two forks. I\u2019ve added black beans to bulk out the meat; if you have less meat, or want to make a vegetarian version, just use an extra tin of beans.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/30/how-to-turn-leftover-roast-lamb-inito-mouthwatering-quesadillas-recipe-zero-waste-cooking\">Continue reading...</a>",

Raphinha, to be fair, misses a lot. Most common of all, perhaps, is the low screamer, dragged across goal with the left foot, disappearing into the advertising hoardings with an unseen thud as the goalkeeper calmly strolls off in search of a fresh ball. If you close your eyes and try to picture Raphinha missing, this is almost certainly the miss you are imagining.</p><p>But Raphinha can miss in a plethora of other ways, too. The wild slice at the back post is another favourite. The free-kick into the wall. The mistimed header sailing harmlessly over the bar and Raphinha has never been the greatest header of a ball, but he is going to keep making the run nonetheless, again and again, all night if he has to. If it feels weird to begin a discussion of one of Europe\u2019s most prolific forwards by listing all the ways he can ",

De Menezes, a 27-year-old Brazilian working as an electrician in London, boarded the tube at Stockwell station on the morning of 22 July 2005. Moments later, before the carriage doors could close, armed police sprinted on to the train and shot him seven times, point blank, in the head. De Menezes had been mistaken for a suicide bomber; he was entirely innocent of any crime.</p><p>Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, a four-part drama by Jeff Pope, portrays the horror of that moment with breathtaking clarity.
