        "description": "Sponsor: Arctic Liquid Freezer III on Amazon - https://geni.us/NrMtDT\nThis review of the new Montech HS01 and HS02 cases benchmarks them for thermal performance, acoustics, and tests for build quality. We're specifically looking at the HS01 Pro and HS02 Pro, which include fans and have an MSRP of $130 to $140. The fanless variants will be $100 to $110. Montech's HS02 and HS01 have a lot of competition and alternative ATX cases on the market, so we'll benchmark those as well. Common alternatives might include the Lian Li Lancool 207, Fractal North, Antec C8, and others we've looked at over the last year.\n\nWatch our be quiet!
