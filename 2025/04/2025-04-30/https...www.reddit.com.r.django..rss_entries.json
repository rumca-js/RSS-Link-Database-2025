I want to know if there is easy ways to host it without paying. I know some services like netlify that offers free hosting but only for static webs. If i want to have a CMS (wagtail) its mandatory to use a vps like digital ocean or self-host it? or there is a better (and preferently free) option to do that?

The whole thing is in DRF and almost every request to DRF calls other external APIs and user needs data from these APIs. I&#39;m using currently requests library and I have some issues when one of the APIs is down (or when there are like 100 users just using panel in the same time). When one of the external APIs is down then whole API built in DRF starts lagging and working very slowly because it hangs on the waiting requests for the response even if there is set timeout like 1 seconds. It&#39;s even possible to handle it in other way? I was thiking about making these external API calls async using like celery but user need this data instantly after making request to my DRF API. How to handle this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fine_Interest6039\"> /u/Fine_Interest6039 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

So I have this problem when trying to load up my web app which uses react as the front end. Once I run my development server to load up index.html, the page loads halfway through and I get a 404 error that fails to detect my static folder which contains both my css and js files. I\u2019ve restarted my development server and I\u2019ve even tried using ai to fix the problem but honestly I\u2019m stomped. Everything else works, but my static front end files in my build directory are not being detected.
