My business has about &lt;$300/mo available to spend. I can spend on ads but first I want to spend some on SEO. What would be the best bang for buck? - I can hire freelancer with fixed budget to do content research and backlinking (won&#39;t they just send me the list of paid backlinks?) - I can find paid backlinks myself and spend money on that - I can try a bazillio",
