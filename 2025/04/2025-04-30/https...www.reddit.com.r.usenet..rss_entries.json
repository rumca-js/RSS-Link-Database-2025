This covers most of my needs for movies and TV shows.</p> <p>But, really, I find the indexers I am using a bit underwhelming in terms of PC software (some of them don;t even have a software category). What are good indexers when looking for PC software? Perhaps some Android too? Also, hi-res pics would be great too (to be used in presentations).</p> <p>And academic books, these are not easy to find either.</p> <p>I am also looking for indexers that have music production content (digital instruments, samples, VST&#39;s, etc.), but these may be too specialized to be covered well by the indexers and may be more easy to find as torrents?</p> <p>Anyway, I really would appreciate some suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/scubaro\"> /u/scubaro </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1kbfyu",
