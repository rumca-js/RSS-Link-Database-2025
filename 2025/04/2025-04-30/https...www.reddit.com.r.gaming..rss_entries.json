That&#39;s the maximum you can use until the next rest point. If you find a special item you can permanently make them 4x revives for example, or from another special item permanently increase the percentage that health potions heal.</p> <p>This reduces the clutter issue in JRPGs where you end up hoarding items because you might &quot;need them later&quot; only to never use them. It also has 3 items, that&#39;s it. The rest of the functionalities like cleaning debuffs is handled through skills.</p> <p>So you end up actually using items and frequently.

It&#39;s as if Round 8 Studios studied the FromSoft Souls games and created a perfectly distilled experience based on them. The world is wonderfully crafted and combat, music, art design, tone and atmosphere are all stellar; I still adore the FromSoft Souls games but Lies of P is special. Something in particular that I absolutely adored is how it embodies the spirit of Bloodborne with a hint of Sekiro, engaging with the Perfect Guard mechanic makes combat significantly easier but you can also play less aggressively and still enjoy the experience. I actually have the urge to start New Game+ already but there are too many other games which I&#39;m currently anxious to play. </p> <p>I&#39;ve played through all seven FromSoft Souls titles and the Demon&#39;s Souls remake so relative to my familiarity with the genre this is how I fare",
