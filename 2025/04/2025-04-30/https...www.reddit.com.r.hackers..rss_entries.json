First she tried through the official govt. Site but once the tickets sold out, she referred to a Facebook post ( I know hella sketchy) the operator convinced her and even me that the company was legit and my stupid self didn&#39;t think of doubting the operator itself. My mother spoke to them on whatsapp only and once the payment was done he shared our tickets in pdf form. The payment was done on 15th april, I know it&#39;s too late and it&#39;s our fault we should have verified the second we received them. It was my father&#39;s friend who questioned the way the whole process worked out and that&#39;s how we figured it being a fraud.</p> <p>Is there any way of recovery? Details of the fraudster is below. I know it&#39;s not worth just leaving it here.</p> <p><em>Here Are Our Account Details:-</em> <em>UCO BANK</em",
