Last year gave us the amazing Metaphor ReFantazio and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, as well as several other GOTY contenders like Astro Bot, Balatro, and Silent Hill 2. This year, there several games that could earn high review scores, like Split Fiction, Doom: The Dark Ages, and Assassin's Creed Shadows, to name a few.</p><p>On top of that, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-sign-up-for-notifications-at-best-buy/1100-6528859/\">the Switch 2 is expected to be arriving this year</a> and Nintendo typically has a few launch game aces up its sleeve whenever it brings new gaming hardware to its fans. You can also count on indie games to surprise and delight, as some of the best and weirdest games are often found in this category. Lik",
