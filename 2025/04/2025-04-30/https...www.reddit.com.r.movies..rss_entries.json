You could argue he doesn\u2019t get to do anything that reaches into, say, DDL level emotion for There Will Be Blood for abandoning his child or De Niro smashing up a concrete wall in darkness in Raging Bull, but the scene where Murray reads Mozart\u2019s music for the first time is the best acting I think I have seen in a film. </p> <p>Comes down to personal taste rather than anything objective I suppose.

Obviously it was executed perfectly, but just the idea to do that seems insane to me. I haven&#39;t really been able to think of a movie series that did that today.

When I watched it again much later with context after watching the series, I was certainly more engaged then the first one since I understood the characters and the overall world, but also didn&#39;t have much of an emotional reaction as I expected, and I&#39;ve always wondered whether that was just down to me having seen it before without realising it, or if it was down to my tastes and the way I think about films just being different then it was before.</p> <p>But that&#39;s just my experience; has anyone else been in this situation, and what was your experience during or after?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",

Michael and the girl walk past the camera bashfully flirting, followed by a group of female relatives chaperoning and chatting amongst themselves, and then followed by two guys with shotguns. You can see the whole story of Michael&#39;s time in Italy in a single moment.</p> <p>It&#39;s a great shot, and funnily enough I can totally see the resemblance to some shots in Fury Road -- where the camera kinda lingers and lets different characters and groups fall in and out of frame, in a way that tells an effective mini-story.</p> <p>What are some of your favorite shots that tell their own stories?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/InspectorMendel\"> /u/InspectorMendel </a> <br/> <span><a ",
