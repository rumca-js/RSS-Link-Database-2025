I recently started a project which I have to finish and there is no going back anymore (deadline isn&#39;t that far away). If I started over I would probably not try to program a mail service again but here I am needing some help. The question is pretty simple. I already built a frontend and now I need a functional backend using something like postfix (or other mail servers if you got recommendations). The backend won&#39;t require much resources because it only exists for testing purpose. Can anyone please tell me a vps provider that doesn&#39;t block mail traffic (so open ports like port 25)? I bought a plan at cloudzy before realizing they are blocking port 25 as most providers do. Did anyone have luck with another provider? Thanks again! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/T",

I won&#39;t host these on my own servers. I would really appreciate if someone could recommend a hosting provider that values their users privacy, is relatively affordable and fits my needs. For the image gallery I was thinking maybe nextcloud (because one can do way more with that in the future and I only want certain people to be able to see my gallery [I&#39;d hand out password and username for their accounts that I&#39;d have created]). For the blog I consider Jekyll to be an good option (because I love Jameson Lopp&#39;s blog and he seems to use that). I&#39;d get the domain at njalla (because they don&#39;t really follow KYC guidelines) and for mail I&#39;d use mail-in-a-box. I&#39;m still not sure about the VPS provider. The VPS should offer about 80GB of SSD (or more) and min 6-8GB of RAM, I guess.",
