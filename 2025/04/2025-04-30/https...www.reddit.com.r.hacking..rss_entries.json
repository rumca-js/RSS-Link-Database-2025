I fetch the answers manually from the News app each morning and this is getting a bit time consuming. I am looking into automating this and have a few questions. Obviously, Apple takes their security quite seriously and they have employed several layers of security around the fetching of the Apple News content. Does anyone here have experience with Apple endpoints and some guidance on how to go about untangling it? I was able to sniff the traffic from the app and I see several endpoints but the data returned is all encrypted.
