I read the Odyssey in preparation and have checked on some chapters in spark notes after the fact to make sure I\u2019m understanding at least at a surface level. I\u2019m wondering if anyone knows of any in-depth resources about this book, especially any broken down into chapters. Would love to read outlines, read books about the book, and most of all I\u2019d love if anyone can recommend a lecture series.

More often than not, the reason for these disappointments is that the books have great settings/ideas but fail to stick the landing from a thematic/plotting perspective.

Almost always, I find a number of posts titled something like &quot;Disappointed with [Book]&quot; where the POST is interesting and engaging, but then I get to the comments...</p> <p>Invariably, the comments are filled with dozens of comments made up of some variation of the same thought: &quot;The book isn&#39;t for everyone, I just loved the vibe of the book&quot;.

There are many hints:</p> <p>a) There are hints that Tsukuru&#39;s dreams are not simple dreams. He dreams about engaging in a sexual act with Haida, yet there are hints that it really happened. What if his dreams of ejaculating inside Shiro are also real in a way? Murakami makes a big deal about how Tsukuru ejaculates inside Shiro in his dreams. It has to be significant somehow. </p> <p>B) There are multiple references to Shiro being haunted by a dark presence.
