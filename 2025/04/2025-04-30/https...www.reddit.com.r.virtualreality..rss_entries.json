I eagerly awaited the release of the virtual boy, thinking that nintendo would usher in a golden age of VR games. A friend of mine&#39;s parents bought him one and it was supremely disappointing. The red color, the barely-better-than-gameboy animations, the fact that it was attached to a stand and had no movement detection... This period of time was pretty disappointing. </p> <p>In 1998 I paid for a half hour session in a VR pod (a forte VFX1) It was fun, but disappointing at the same time and finally painted a prop",

While a wired link works perfectly, the office with the PC is too small for standing VR games. However, over wifi there are constant micro-stutters, even if you&#39;re in the same room as the modem. The wifi modem is from our internet provider, and I&#39;m not willing to go through the hassle of replacing it with my own modem. So it looks like a wifi access point wired directly to the internet modem is my best option.</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to keep the budget under $100, and have found good reviews from VR users for both the Prismxr Puppis S1 and the GL.iNet GL-MT3000. I&#39;d love to hear any other device recommendations in my price range, or anyone&#39;s experience with those two products.

In reality, it\u2019s just okay.. With the Quest\u2019s 200Mbps cap, AV1 ends up way too compressed, especially in distant grass or foggy scenes where artifacts become obvious. Thus, this makes H264 running @ 500mbps bitrate FAR superior.. Sure, h264 is less efficient and sure, having less color depth is more of a trade off, but at least the image is not muddy due to the low bitrate limitation of AV1 and h265 HEVC. </p> <p>My Settings: - Codec: H.264+ - Auto Bitrate: Disabled - Resolution: Godlike (maybe turn this one down depending on specs) - Framerate: 90 FPS (120 Hz was too compressed) - Bitrat",

I&#39;ve thought to myself that it would be nice to get one of those old Google cardboard type headsets and just use it to make my screen bigger while I use a Bluetooth controller. I scoured the internet for any app that let&#39;s you view other apps through that type of headset to no avail. </p> <p>I&#39;ve read a lot on this subreddit about how phone vr is dead. It makes sense with how cheap headsets are getting but it seems like this could be a good idea for an app. It doesn&#39;t need any of the vr motion tracking. It just needs to convert the display to work with the lenses and let you open other apps. It&#39;s kind of like a poor man&#39;s vision pro.</p> <p>I looked into VRidge and a couple other things but they all require a computer.
