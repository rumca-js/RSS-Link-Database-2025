This was really useful - I know have two OSes on a single partition, and since it&#39;s UEFI, I can choose the boot loader at startup by spamming esc after hitting the power. I still keep the default Windows boot loader as the main for anyone else who may use the computer and have no idea how to use Linux.</p> <p>Anyway, are there any other Linux distros that have similar installers that you can just run from within Windows like it&#39;s a normal program?

Following his recommendations I was able to reduce my boot-up time from 47 seconds to 35 seconds on Linux Mint. Firmware, bootloader and kernel boot times are still the same, but the user space boot time was reduces from 15 seconds to 5 seconds.
