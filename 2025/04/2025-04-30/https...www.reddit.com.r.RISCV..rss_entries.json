Board works great and looks beautiful but sadly it&#39;s not faster than qemu on Zen2 and pretty slow in general :(</p> <p>Is there currently a similar board that would be worth upgrading to? This would be perfect:</p> <ul> <li>Faster than qemu</li> <li>Standard Linux distro</li> <li>WLAN</li> <li>gdb works</li> <li>perf works</li> <li>RVV</li> <li>$50 or less (optional)</li> </ul> <p>I haven&#39;t found a good CPU comparison yet and since my MilkV Oasis preorder was cancelled I&#39;m not sure what to wait for. Would love some recommendations :D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gorv256\"> /u/gorv256 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1kbk5w4/worth_upgrading_from_mangopi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/",
