I was advised to install a kickstart Rom and to clean the floppy drive, but at the same time to stay away from floppies as all of them are likely worn dead. So I&#39;m planning to order the USB drive and I&#39;ve got a power cable on the way. Any better way to go? I&#39;m in no hurry as I&#39;m busy with career and coding on my C64 bit I&#39;m very excited to power it on for the first time</p> <p>Bonus question: can I use my c64&#39;s joysticks or will I have to find other models?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",
