In the final entry Emily and Wendell finally return to the latter&#39;s kingdom in order to retake his throne, but as to be expected, things do not go as planned. One of my favorite aspects of the series has been the various fairy tales that Emily includes in her entries and how she uses them to determine what actions to take, with her having to figure out how to track down the former queen and ensure that Wendell has a happy ending. Overall this was a very good book and if you enjoyed the series up to this point, you&#39;ll find that this one gives a satisfying conclusion to the story.</p> <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5 Stars <strong>Other Squares:</strong> High Fashion, Impossible Places (HM",

This book was my first bingo read, and I&#39;m using it for the LGBTQIA+ square, on hard mode since the main character is also a person of color. While his race is not marginalized in the context of the story, it seemed like the spirit of the square was more about representation, so I think it still counts. On to the review!</p> <p>This book was honestly a bit of a mixed bag for me. The setting of a mythological and fantastical version of Africa was interesting, and very different from most other fantasy settings I\u2019ve read about. The creatures encountered along Tracker\u2019s journey were memorable, and in many ways frightening. Lightning birds, vampire apes, shape-shifting hyenas- all felt new to me, and the threat each one posed was clear. The locales and cities each had a very distinct vibe.
