I was very successful and am just working on tidying it up for release now. Once it&#39;s done, I have realized no one really cares about my code and I am going to spend my remaining time with my wife. I feel like I made a grave mistake spending my time coding. I wish anyone cared to look at what I&#39;ve done. I feel like I wrote some useful stuff. BrightChain is incomplete but it is a huge endeavor and is largely done. There is a ton of code. My other MERN code i think would be useful to people. It is with deep sadness that I acknowledge the end of this chapter and start preparing for my last one. It has been the privilege of my life writing code with others at Microsoft and in the open source community.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Game_Genie\"> /u/The_Game_Genie </a> <br/> <span><a href=",

Over the past year working on audio applications, we often ran into the same issue: open-source TTS models were either low quality or not fully open, making it hard to retrain and adapt. So we built Muyan-TTS, a fully open-source, low-cost model designed for easy fine-tuning and secondary development.The current version works best for English, as the public training data is still relatively small. But we have open-sourced the full training and data processing pipelines, so teams can easily adapt or expand it based on their needs.

But Sometimes, Contributing to an OSS project is like arguing with someone in reddit. </p> <p>The first reason why i say this is because, the other day, i made a new PR on an OSS project that fixes a small bug in their software, and the maintainer have reviewed the changes but told me to <em>write it properly</em> - So I did, I rewrote the fix again and added it to the doc. Then it got rejected because i did <em>test it properly before pushing</em> - even though i did. Seems like a waste of time, ain&#39;t it? 2 hour to fix the bug, then a day to wait, then another 2 hour to rewrite then to be just rejected...</p> <p>The second reason is, we the contributers don&#39;t get enough credits, as much as maintainers. Like... We work so hard to fix or add a thing, sometimes rejected, sometimes accepted, we may get credited in the changelog but those big softwares, such as Firefox ",

And whether this sort of thing had come up before; things like a link to your homepage at the very top of a github page, splash screens etc. The reason for this is obvious - the author of the project gets slightly more payoff from creating a project. This isn&#39;t so different from a BSD license apart from the the license is being display prominently.</p> <p>Is this fundamentally incompatible with open source philosophy? Has it been tried before and found problematic - like the BSD anti advertising clause.
