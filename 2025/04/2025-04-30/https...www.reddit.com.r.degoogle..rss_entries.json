        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all, I just switched away from Google&#39;s Chrome browser to Firefox. But it&#39;s pretty inconvenient when you have to enter your username and password every time. I&#39;m hoping someone here is familiar with this and knows what to do. I checked all the settings, and it looks like it should be working. (link below)</p> <p>Is there anyway I can force that little popup to start appearing? The one that usually appears in the top left that says something like &quot;Save username and password for this site?&quot; The little popup will show your username, and your password (as dots) filled into two fields. IIRC you can click yes, or &quot;never save&quot; or some such.</p> <p>I want that to start asking to save my credentials every time, as it does at my school. And for it to always auto fill my usernames and passwords. The settings look like this should already be happening. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p><a href=\"https://imagizer.image",
