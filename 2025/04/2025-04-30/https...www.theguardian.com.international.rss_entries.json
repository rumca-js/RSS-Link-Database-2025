I hauled my TV from the living room of my small, unpleasantly warm flatshare into my bedroom so I could play uninterrupted; it was all I could think about. My character was a Khajiit thief, a kind of manky lion in black-leather armour with excellent pickpocketing skills.

Fifty years later, mythology about US media coverage of the war is locked into the faulty premise that news outlets were pivotal in causing Americans to turn against it. Some say that mainstream media undermined a noble war effort, while others say that coverage alerted the public to realities of an unjust war. Both assertions are wrong.</p><p>Scapegoating the media fits neatly into \u201cstab in the back\u201d theories of Americans who can\u2019t stand the fact that their country lost a war to impoverished Vietnamese fighters. And praising the media as catalysts for the nation\u2019s roused conscience gives undue credit while fostering illusions about mainstream news coverage of America\u2019s wars.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/co",
