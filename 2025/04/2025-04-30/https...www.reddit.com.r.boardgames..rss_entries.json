It takes place in the old times where the country is divided into 6 feudal states, each one of them are trying to become the rulers of Georgia. The game starts by putting feudal state sigils into a small box, after that each person picks the random feudal state and becomes the ruler of that territorie. The thing is, there is no \u201cFriendship wins\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s a tie\u201d there will only be one king or queen to the Georgia, that\u2019s it.

We are all gamers, but prefer our games to not have too much overhead or to constantly be introducing new rules or mechanics. (Think less than a weight of 3 on BGG).</p> <p>If it has role playing elements such as character progression and a branching campaign that would be preferred. If the game has legacy elements as well that would be a nice bonus to add to the excitement of playing through the campaign.</p> <p>I would also like for there to be a minimal amount of long stoppages in play for story or narration, so ideally the campaign would be shaped more by gameplay decisions than anything else. Despite this, a bit of CYOA would actually be nice as long as it is kept brief and to the point.</p> <p>I like boss battlers, roguelites, and dungeon crawlers, so if it fits in one of those categories that would be preferred. I also have an affinity for card based games",
