So of course today in the middle of playing World of Warcraft, I started getting popups from <a href=\"http://battle.net\">battle.net</a> saying something was wrong. I ignored them for a bit but they just kept coming. So I closed out of WoW and <a href=\"http://battle.net\">battle.net</a>, and now when I relaunch <a href=\"http://battle.net\">battle.net</a> it tells me that the <a href=\"http://battle.net\">battle.net</a> update agent failed and doesn&#39;t allow me to launch wow. I removed both from Lutris and reinstalled the <a href=\"http://battle.net\">battle.net</a> launcher, but still the same issue.</p> <p>Anyone else having a similar issue? Not sure what I could have to cause this while I was in the middle of a game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IShitMyFuckingPants\"> /u/IShitM",

I&#39;ve got Linux experience from work and running servers at home, but haven&#39;t touched Linux with a GUI for a looong time. I couldn&#39;t game using it so it was always basically a no-go as a daily driver and I stuck with Windows.</p> <p>For the past few months, my laptop started to BSOD constantly. Like, leave it on for 5 minutes and it BSOD. The strange thing was that it didn&#39;t happen if I was playing World of Warcraft. I could play for hours straight with no issue, but if I closed it, 5-10 minutes later it would BSOD. If I tabbed out for too long it would BSOD as well, and also even if I had the game open but went AFK I would come back and there would be a BSOD. But when I was actually playing? Never a problem.</p> <p>Anyway, I checked event viewer, had some errors referencing ntfs so I ran chkdsk on both my SSDs and it came back clean. I also ran Windows Memory",
