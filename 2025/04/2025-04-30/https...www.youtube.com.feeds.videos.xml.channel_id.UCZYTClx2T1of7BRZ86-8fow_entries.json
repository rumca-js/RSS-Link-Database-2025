        "description": "India's Roopkund Lake, also known as Skeleton Lake, is the site of gruesome sculptures of human bones.

Hundreds of people have died at this lake... at least twice.\n\nHosted by: Savannah Geary (they/them)\n\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon supporters for helping us keep SciShow free for everyone forever: J.V.
