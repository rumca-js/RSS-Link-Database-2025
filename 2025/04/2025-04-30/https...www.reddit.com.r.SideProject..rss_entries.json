I&#39;m a current CS student and thinking of an idea that I think would be useful for cross-functional teams slightly and trying to gain feedback on it. Thinking of building a Retool-like dashboard tool for startups that consolidates your data from Stripe, Supabase, AWS, etc. into one clean interface (MRR, user growth, infra status). On top of that, it\u2019d include \u201cmagic link\u201d onboarding: new hires get signed into everything they need (Google Workspace, VSCode, AWS) with the right permissions and company context automatically. Admins can see team-wide metrics, new hires just what they need.

Now I have a product that can collect, organize, and notify you about errors. And it\u2019s installed with a single command: type it, wait five minutes, and boom, you have your own private error-tracking system.</p> <p>It\u2019s fully compatible with Sentry SDKs, so migrating is really easy, just change one line (your DSN) and you\u2019re done. You also get the source code and can modify it however you like. If you want free updates, just stick to the default installation.</p> <p>Now I\u2019m not worried about my data being shared with someone, and ",

After all that waiting, we started questioning whether it was even worth trying again. The worst part? You never really know why you got rejected, or what to do differently next time. There\u2019s no feedback, just silence.</p> <p>Still, we gave it one more shot with a second application rewrote everything, clarified our use case, and crossed our fingers. A few months later, we actually got approved.</p> <p>If you&#39;re building with Spotify and feeling stuck in quota limbo, don&#39;t give up. The system is frustrating, opaque, and slow but persistence can pay off. Just don\u2019t expect clear guidance or fast answers along the way.</p> <p>Curious has anyone else gone",
