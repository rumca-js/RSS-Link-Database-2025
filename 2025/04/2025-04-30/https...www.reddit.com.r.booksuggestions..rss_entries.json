Thorough explanations of high (fictional) tech in the style of Peter Hamilton might not appeal to me as much, but that&#39;s not an issue. I&#39;m more interested in stories that delve into a fresh concept and not so much in hard sci fi.</p> <p>I feel there are classics to discover yet and I need a bit of help in the right direction. Throw in any books you think might interest me, even if it&#39;s a long list, I promise I&#39;ll have a look at them all!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",

The way Lewis portrays the long shadow of trauma\u2014how it affects not only the survivor but their children and relationships\u2014is heartbreaking but deeply real.</p> <p>What really struck me was how it explores silence as a tool of both survival and destruction. Elle\u2019s voice feels like a cry for every person who\u2019s been forced to bury their pain just to function. There\u2019s also a powerful commentary on the societal and family denial that allows this kind of suffering to continue across generations.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a light read\u2014but it\u2019s an important one.

I\u2019ve also read The Testaments (sequel to The Handmaids Tale) and the Hunger Games trilogy and enjoyed those too.
