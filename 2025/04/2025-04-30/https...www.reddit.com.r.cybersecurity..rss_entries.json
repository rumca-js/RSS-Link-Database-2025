For the past week I am trying to improve my threat modelling skills, but I find it cumbersome to try and find threat assessments done by companies. Does anybody know any good links to resources where I can find database for threat modelling or any repository which mantains a database for threat models?

I started to grow much more interested in cybersecurity recently, and I had the money (and a hefty student discount) to buy a pass to the RSA conference so I figured why not, it can\u2019t be that bad of an investment. It\u2019s also in San Francisco and I grew up in Oakland, so I basically get to come home and go to a conference which sounded like a win-win.</p> <p>Obviously, it\u2019s only day 2 of the conference, but man, I genuinely feel like I wasted my money. I don\u2019t know much about cyber at this point into my career, but I at least thought I would be able to grab some bits of information here and there. All I do is walk around and get harassed by vendors who don\u2019t even seem interested in talking to me the second I mention I\u2019m only a student and not part of a bigger company who they can sell their product to.</p> <p>I have genuinely tried my hardest to network with some of the folks",
