Opening bittorrent client stops internet. I just don&#39;t know what to do, it has worked fine till now but it&#39;s just now... I can still torrent from my phone but that is not really practical I can&#39;t seed my files from my phone... Before you ask I don&#39;t use a vpn, and here it&#39;s not really necessary. But what can I do to get my torrents seeding again. I have my connections all down to 10. Speed limited. Port between 50k-60k.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Equivalent_Bug880\"> /u/Equivalent_Bug880 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1kbjvlw/is_my_isp_doing_something/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1kbjvlw/is_my_isp_doing_somethi",
