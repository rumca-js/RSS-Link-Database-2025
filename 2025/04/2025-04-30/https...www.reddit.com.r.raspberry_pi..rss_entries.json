Neither of my laptops have Thunderbolt ports either, so the eGPU enclosure + CRT emudriver that some ppl do won&#39;t work either. </p> <p>So ideally I&#39;d like a small dedicated device with composite out that I just load old shows and movies into with an SD card or whatever. Maybe an extremely simple GUI so I can navigate it.</p> <p>What device is the best for my needs?
