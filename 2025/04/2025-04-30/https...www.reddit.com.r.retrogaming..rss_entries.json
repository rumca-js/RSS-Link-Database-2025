With it comes updated ROM definitions for Tattoo Assassins that finally, after 30 years, fixes all of its sound issues. For decades when people have played this cancelled fighting game from 1995 via emulation they&#39;ve commented on how the game&#39;s sound was super-jank, assuming that this was due to it never having been fully finished and released.</p> <p>Well, turns out the game was much closer to completion than some might have assumed. Playing the game now with its fixed sounds/music results is a much more polished experience that matches that of the small handful of original cabinets that are out there in the world (one at Galloping Ghost, one at Game Terminal, and then a few private owners).</p> <p>I highly recommend that anyone with an interest in obscure, broken-in-a-fun-way fighters give the fixed Tattoo Assassins a try sometime.

Meanwhile all the video games have him running and jumping and fighting and saving people. Yeah, that lines up perfectly with the spirit of the original source material. I mean, I guess I understand how making a video game about a lazy house cat that does nothing might be difficult, but I&#39;d argue it isn&#39;t impossible.</p> <p>Now, Superman, on the other hand, seems to be completely impossible to make a compelling video game about while sticking to the source material. I mean, he&#39;s Superman. Having him walking around on the street punching thugs and, more ridiculously, getting punched back and actually getting hurt by it, is just plain incorrect. You can&#39;t hurt em, he can fly so platforming is out, I mean, what do you do?? It really says something when the best game from a huge licenced franchise chara",
