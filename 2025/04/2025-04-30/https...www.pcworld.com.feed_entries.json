You\u2019ll see it first in handhelds, specifically the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and MSI Claw 7 AI+, but it will be rolled out to other <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2350967/lunar-lake-deep-dive-intels-new-ai-laptop-cpu-is-utterly-different.html\">Lunar Lake / Core Ultra 200V</a> systems soon, Intel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, the driver allows higher performance at the default power level of 17W, Intel said. There are two improvements: the higher frame rate, and a 25 percent improv",

Normally priced at $1,000, today you can get a refurb version of the 13-inch base model <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/226714780969\">for $599 on eBay</a>.

The 10-core Snapdragon X Plus processor will make the battery last for a crazy amount of time, but it also means that this laptop won\u2019t be able to h",

The Nitro XV250 F6 is labelled as \u201cUltraSpeed,\u201d which means a blistering 600Hz refresh rate.

First, it\u2019s a 24-inch, 1080p monitor, so pretty small and low-res by today\u2019s standards \u2014 though the ideal size for esports pros who want to easily watch their entire screen at once. It\u2019s also a TN LCD panel, one of the least-desirable options if you want accurate colors and wide viewing angles. Such is the life of a gamer who feels the need for speed, as other technologies can\u2019t easily hit blazing 600Hz refresh rates. Other specs for the monitor include a 350",
