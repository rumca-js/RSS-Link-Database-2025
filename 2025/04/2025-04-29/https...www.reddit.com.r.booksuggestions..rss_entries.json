He\u2019s also into philosophical type stuff if that helps at all, one of our friends got him a copy of The Art of War and he was thrilled to read that. </p> <p>From the bit of research I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve found the Hyperion Cantos series, The Book of the New Sun series, and The Expanse series which seem to be things he would like.

It&#39;s ok if it deals with loss, too.</p> <p>Not interested in classics. No shade to the romance or BookTok picks, but I&#39;m not looking for that.

It\u2019s about this woman, Nora, who\u2019s struggling with life and ends up in a library that lets her explore the different lives she could\u2019ve lived if she had made different choices. The book really made me think about the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d in my own life and how our choices shape who we become. It\u2019s a quick read, but it&#39;s filled with so much heart and reflection on life, regret, and the importance of embracing where you are.</p> <p>If you&#39;re into books that make you think about life from different angles, I highly recommend it.

Open to all kinds of fiction but I will say I\u2019m not huge on contemporary settings. I think what I loved the most about the Locked Tomb series was my absolute utter upside down inside out confusion during most of Harrow the Ninth and then experiencing it all come together\u2026 incredible payoff. For the Red Riding saga I love the characters the most (this is a Sevro stan account). Darrow\u2019s internal dialogue and growth keeps me coming back to the books time and time again. He fallible but just keeps going. Like everyone else I\u2019m relying on Darrow for something. Can\u2019t wait for book 7. </p> <p>Anyways feel free to recommend whatever even if it doesn\u2019t seem related but somehow makes sense to you. I prefer series over standalone since I like to spend time with the story and also read way too quickly. Thanks in advance y\u2019all!</p> </div><!-- SC_",
