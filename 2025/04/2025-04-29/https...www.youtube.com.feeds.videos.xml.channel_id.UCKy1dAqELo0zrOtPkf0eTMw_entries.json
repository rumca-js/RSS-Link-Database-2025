        "description": "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered reviewed by Travis Northup on Xbox Series X, also available on PlayStation 5 and PC. Stick around after the score for an interview with Travis about the review process and his RPG tastes.\n\n\"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is an awesome nostalgic adventure that recaptures most of what I loved about the 2006 original, while sanding down many of its roughest edges. The result is a fantastic open-world RPG that\u2019s aged quite well, with questlines and stories that are better than I remembered, modernizations (like the slightly improved leveling system) that remove some of the friction of the original, and loads of opportunities to make this adventure whatever you want it to be via the plentiful freedom afforded to you. On the other hand, not enough has been done to make this thing significantly less buggy than it notoriously was back in the day, and some design choices \u2013 like the enemy scaling and procedural Oblivion levels that become dul",

Not only is that good news for Borderlands fans, but also Grand Theft Auto 6 fans. GTA 6 does not have a confirmed release date, only a vague \"Fall 2025,\" but with both games falling under the watchful eye of Take-Two Interactive, it could be that Borderlands dev Gearbox may have gotten word internally on GTA 6's release date, and moved accordingly to make room. Could both games be releasing in September? In other release date news, upcoming action soulslike Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has a confirmed release date of July 24th, along with details of its Deluxe Edition and pre-order bonuses. And finally, A Minecraft Movie madness is getting the official okay from Warner Bros., with the studio supporting \"Block Party\" screenings where viral acts of Chicken Jockey insanity are encouraged.",
