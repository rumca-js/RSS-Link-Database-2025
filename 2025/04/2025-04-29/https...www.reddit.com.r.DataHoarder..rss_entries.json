I have read that disks dedicated for NAS are pretty much better in every way, especially reliability, and there&#39;s also the fact that in near future I want to get a proper NAS (or make one myself) which I would switch over there. Both of these disks are very similar, only real difference is recording technology (Seagate TGMR, WD CMR) and that the WD has firmware that makes it better to run on NAS. I know that the best way would be having 2 of the same models, but getting 2 WDs is not in my budget right now and if it was fine to use the WD with my current SeaGate then I don&#39;t see any reason not to.
