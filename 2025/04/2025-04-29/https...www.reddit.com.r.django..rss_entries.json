The goal is to allow me to control multiple devices connected to more than one Node-RED instance with ease and flexibility.</p> <p>The most important point is access control. For example, you can grant permissions to certain people to only view the state of a button or device but not allow them to make any modifications. I&#39;m using a role-attribute-based approach, which Django supports. This enables you to create groups, assign individuals to multiple groups, and set permissions for each group. Additionally, you can create custom permissions for specific individuals.</p> <p>Another crucial point is scalability. This system, combining Django and Node-RED, allows for simple expansion. For instance, if we have 300 devices on a single Node-RED instance, we can divide them into groups, each group managed by its own Node-RED instance while still communicating with Django.
