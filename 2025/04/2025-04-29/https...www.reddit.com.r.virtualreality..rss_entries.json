So this problem has already been solved but I hope this will save someone some time in the future.</p> <p>Problem: VR streaming (at least on the quest) changes your default audio sources in Windows order to get the game sound to your headset. This is useful especially because it also changes the audio sources in Discord so you do not have to change the audio if you want to be in a call on your headset. The issue is that the default audio sources are not automatically switched back after disconnecting the VR headset, from my experience it seems to work around 50% of the time and only for the microphone. which means changing the audio sources back manually each time.</p> <p>I was looking for a solution that could run in the background and automatically switch audio sources after I disconnect my headset.

I find they always feel unstable and slide down slightly, as well they give me a bit of a headache when putting pressure on the front of my head. Yet whenever a headset is announced, I hear a lot of people hoping that it\u2019s going to have a halo headband. </p> <p>For me I can only wear a halo style headset for around 2 hours unless I do extra comfort mods and add top straps. With a goggle style headset I can wear it for long sessions without fatigue since I feel the face gasket takes off some of the pressure from my head, and also adds stability.</p> <p>What about you all?
