A colleague and I got into a debate about this. He argues that Reddit posts ranking high in Google have naturally undergone SEO optimization. He believes that only the text of the post, which matches Google&#39;s requirements, plays a role, and that the comments on the post are not indexed by Google. </p> <p>I, on the other hand, argue that SEO optimization here is minimal. The post&#39;s title matches the key search query, but not only the post text is indexed \u2014 the comments are too. Google sees how the comment section grows and pushes the post higher in the search results thanks to behavioral factors. Plus, the comments themselves are also indexed, and the relevance to the search query is more often determined by the responses in the comments than by the post text itself. </p> <p>In other words, for a Reddit post to rank on Google&#39;s top, ",
