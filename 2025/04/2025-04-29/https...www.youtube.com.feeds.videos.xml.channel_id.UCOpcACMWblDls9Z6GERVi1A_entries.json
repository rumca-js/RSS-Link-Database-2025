        "description": "It's the Honest Trailer for Captain America: New World Order! I mean\u2014 Brave New World! Finally see Sam Wilson take on the mantle of Captain America, assuming you skipped the Disney Plus series where he did exactly that! Finally see Harrison Ford play a fictional president...who is also a Hulk! Is it good? Depends on what you're comparing it to. Somewhere between The Eternals and a flat room temp Diet Coke on the enjoyment scale. And that's the current-phase MCU promise.\n\nVoice Narration: Jon Bailey the EPIC VOICE GUY (@epicvoiceguy on all socials)\nTitle Design: Robert Holtby \nWritten by: Spencer Gilbert and Lon Harris\nProduced by: Spencer Gilbert \nEdited by: Kevin Williamsen \nPost-Production Manager: Emin Bassavand \nManager, Video Operations: Tiffany Tse \nPost-Production Specialist: Rebecca Castaneda \nVP Content: Max Dionne\n\n#honesttrailers #entertainment #parody #marvel #captainamerica",
