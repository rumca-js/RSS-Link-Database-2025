Johnson was my favorite character to begin with, but soon Wolf became my favorite (which was inevitable). I&#39;m curious on what people thought about the romance. I didn&#39;t like it because I found it hypocritical that Hump was constantly referencing how weak and feminine she was, when he had those same traits just months (?) earlier. I just though it was ridiculous. Hump did become stronger throughout and his morals were always strong to begin with, but how did he then just easily submit to her in such a way? Anyway, I loved Johnson&#39;s morals especially since he was so willing to die for them. Plus, I loved the contrast between Hump and Wolf, especially that line where Hump states that he is braver than Wolf since he has to overcome the fear that betrays his body, whereas Wolf does not face fear and so no bravery is needed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

I had heard the name of the book when the movie came out but never got around to watching it. A few days earlier, I saw the book in a store and decided to give it a shot, as I do love reading children&#39;s fantasy novels once in a while and really enjoy them.</p> <p>Needless to say, I really liked the book a lot. When Grandpa Joe gave his little money to Charlie to buy the chocolate and the moment they shared afterward, it left me misty-eyed, as I missed my late grandfather. Another highlight of the book for me was how immersive it is. I could totally see the scenes playing out in front of my eyes as I was reading it, and I love books that make it effortless to do so. I was also happy to see the undisciplined kids suffer the consequences of their actions. Great lesson for all the ",

He pushes these hobbits to go on these adventures, promising to help out, but constantly shows up too late. Gandalf did that in the Hobbit.

But that had changed five thousand years ago when they encountered a race that was much more powerful, and in order to prevent their destruction they fled to the safety of a black hole, leaving only traces of their civilization.</p> <p>And now a millennia has passed, and man has discovered their legacy, in the form of an asteroid that has autonavigating space craft. It was there that a very Robinette Broadhead had won the lotto and had returned a millionaire stricken by his conscience. Then he financed, eventually leading, an expedition that unlocked the secrets of Heechee technology.</p> <p>And now he is forced yet again to make another perilous voyage into space, where the Heechee wait, with, this time, the fate of humanity being at stake.</p> ",
