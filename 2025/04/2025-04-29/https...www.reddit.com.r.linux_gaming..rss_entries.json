I constantly run into issues with my game crashing and freezing my entire computer to the point where I have to force a restart by pressing the physical restart button on my machine. I tried tinkering with mods, allocating more and less ram, playing with or without shaders, barely anyhting seems to make a difference and Im sick of it. I checked the logs of Minecraft but they do not have any helpful info on what causes the crashes.</p> <p>Basically what happens is; I load up the game just fine. I load my world just fine. I get to run around for maybe 2-5 seconds ingame, sometimes more, reaching my set FPS cap of 70 no problem and then, within less than a second, the game freezes and with that my PC. The times it freezes at seem to be completely random, there isnt anything happening ingame that would cause extra stress. Memory and GPU usage, while high (both around 70%), are fine.",

I chose this Fedora-based system due to the recommendation of a Spanish-speaking YouTuber who specializes in tech (Tutos PC), and I decided to try it out since it&#39;s a distro made specifically for gaming and multimedia content creation. I can honestly say Nobara Linux has been a warm welcome into the Linux world.</p> <p>I&#39;m a Spanish speaker, and I must say that finding Linux content in my language is a bit difficult, most guides and tutorials are in English. Because of this, my understanding of English has really been put to the test, and it&#39;s actually helped me improve my skills in the language. I have to give a big thanks to GE and the Nobara community for being so understanding and helping me even when I wasn&#39;t expressing myself clearly.</p> <p>That sai",
