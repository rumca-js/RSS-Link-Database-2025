And I know Sanderson is a lotttt better than a lot of the other Big Name fantasy authors in that regard (from what I\u2019ve been told). it was truly only a few lines so I\u2019m not blacklisting him from my future reading, I\u2019d just like to prioritize women!</p> <p>I want to keep reading fantasy so I\u2019ve been on my own quest to find the literary queens of fantasy.

I started off easy in order to dip my toes in the water and basically just read a book on my TBR pile, using the &quot;Recycle a Bingo Square&quot; square as a quasi-free space (I am using the &quot;Award Winner&quot; square from 2017). Some may say, &quot;Hey wait a minute, isn&#39;t that against the spirit of the challenge?&quot; Most certainly. But a square is a square!</p> <p>In short, I don&#39;t think Project Hail Mary was a <em>bad</em> book per say, but it wasn&#39;t one I particularly enjoyed, either. The overall plot was somewhat interesting, and I don&#39;t even think it was poorly executed, but to me, it lacked a certain amount of depth I was hoping for. I tend to like books that focus a lot on characters and their flaws, and I think that&#39;s one area where this book is severely lacking. There is a nominal amount of chara",
