However, of course each of these game servers would spin up in a docker container in the swarm with a different exposed port. Mc1 on 25566, Mc2 on 25567 for example. The issue that comes in though is that I only want to expose 1 port, 25565 so that users wouldn\u2019t have to type mc1.abc.com:25566 to access the server. </p> <p>Is this sort of proxying possible with Traefik?

Since then, I looked at the comments most were about being written by AI, being a pipe dream and spamming with no real stuff to say. Sorry about all that. </p> <p>I completely understand the doubts and I truly believe that with enough dedication, persistance and a great community, everything is possible.</p> <p>So, I\u2019ve worked a lot to produce a first version that is good enough to be released but still is missing some features.
