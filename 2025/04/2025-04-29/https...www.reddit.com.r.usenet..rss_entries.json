Do I focus on adding more providers to support my current indexer or do I need more indexers to start getting healthy downloads?</p> <p>I am so green to this it\u2019s not even funny, so sorry (and thank you) in advance. I have one indexer (geek) and one provider (frugal). I followed frugals instructions of adding two of their servers and one bonus server. I can\u2019t get anything healthy enough to download. </p> <p>I guess I\u2019m trying to understand what a normal \u201cstack\u201d is. Like 3 indexers 5 providers? Or some other mixture of the two. What is the usual bottleneck?
