Everything seem fine running docker compose up but if I modify my.yml file to build from it and then run docker compose up --build it is giving me a weird behavior related to the context. It does not find files that are there. If I manually build from docker every image everything work but inside the compose it doesn&#39;t . I&#39;m running in docker in windows 11 and from what I read it seems to me that the problem is about path translation from windows to Linux paths. Is that even possible? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SolidSheepherder7155\"> /u/SolidSheepherder7155 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1kav3ah/docker_compose_bug/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1kav3ah/docker_compose_bug/\">[comments]</a></span>",
