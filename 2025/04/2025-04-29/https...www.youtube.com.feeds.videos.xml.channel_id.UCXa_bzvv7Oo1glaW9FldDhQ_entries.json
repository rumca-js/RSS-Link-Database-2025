        "description": "There\u2019s a lot to love about The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered, from the surprisingly comprehensive changes and improvements that it makes to the 2006 original to how faithfully it still manages to recreate the original classic\u2019s biggest strengths even with all the modernization changes it makes. \n\nBut for all of its strengths, Oblivion Remastered still leaves a lot to be desired in the optimization department. On top of glitches related to the visuals, audio, AI, user interface, and more, the game is also unfortunately blemished by significant and consistent performance issues that can make even moment to moment gameplay quite frustrating, especially on a large number of PC builds. \n\nHere, we discuss all of that and more.",
