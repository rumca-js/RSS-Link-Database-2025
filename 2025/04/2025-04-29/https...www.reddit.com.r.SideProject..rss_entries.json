But after years of building things, I\u2019ve come to a realization that most of the big companies (not talking about MAANG) aren\u2019t really solving hard engineering problems anymore. They&#39;ve mastered distribution and while that\u2019s impressive, it\u2019s just not exciting for me anymore. Solving the same set of problems over and over...... it&#39;s not just fun anymore.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve decided to take a 6-month break. I want to build something open source, something that gets me excited to write code again. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough financially to take this leap, and now I want to chase the kind of deep tech problems that still feel unsolved. There are tools out there, sure, but many are either half-baked or haven\u2019t kept pace with how quickly tech is evolving.</p> <p>I want to build something meaningful that engineers genuinely love using.

I&#39;m working on trying to recreate the vibes of AOL or The Palace where people could just casually chat about whatever they wanted in chatrooms and had avatars. Nowadays there&#39;s really no app I can find to get on and just chat without needing to invest time signing up or having a feed/curated content. No need to keep scrolling if your friends are busy! Some feedback would be great! Links below for the app/play store.</p> <p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app",

(At least 13 years of development on it!) </p> <p>She wanted help turning this into an actual application that she can use to predict the outcome of various race tracks that she loves to watch. She then wanted to make it something other users could purchase the predictions and see results on!! I believe it\u2019s fairly cheap at $1.50 a track for all the races. Obviously it is AI predictions and not a truth machine, so sometimes she wins and sometimes she loses! But still a really cool project!</p> <p>The AI is constantly collecting new data for her, and she\u2019ll be doing re trainings of it in GCP vertex when she has enough rows. </p> <p>Check it out, would love feed back on the UI! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Big_Nasty_Foot\"> /u/Big_Nasty_Foot </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://optibethorsepic",
