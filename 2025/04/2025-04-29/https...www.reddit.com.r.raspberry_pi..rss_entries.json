So I&#39;ve been considering a PI running a Jellyfin server that would only function as an IPTV tuner.</p> <p>I&#39;ve researched this subreddit and understand newer PIs don&#39;t have h264 hardware support, so they&#39;re not ideal for an actual media server.

I also paste the links to the main git of the project by HarbourMasters. There you will find more info. </p> <p>Also there is a link to mods page where you can find a few. One I recommend is MM-Reloded, which basically are hd textures for the game. </p> <p>The game should be playable in most raspberry pi models, with the difference that only RPi 5 will be able to run it fluently with most of the graphics in medium to high level.</p> <p>So hope you enjoy it.</p> <p>Link to the Github page:</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/icCVXBLyXH",
