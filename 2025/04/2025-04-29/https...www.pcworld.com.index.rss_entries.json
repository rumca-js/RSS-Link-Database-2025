I really enjoy telling you about this one, as someone who needed a new graphics card at the tail end of the pandemic. Reports indicate that mining for Bitcoins (i.e., trying to turn electricity and math into money) is no longer profitable. Cry me a freakin\u2019 river.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a complicated story, but the basic equation is that it now costs more in electricity to \u201cmine\u201d a single Bitcoin than that Bitcoin is currently worth\u2014by a significant margin. Due to <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2220832/bitcoin-and-crypto-explained-what-beginners-need-to-know.html\">the nature of the Bitcoin protocol</a>, which started the better part of a decade ago, it was inevitable that we\u2019d reach this point eventually.
