A core theme of his book is that information takes many forms but it always does one thing - it connects. The problem with AI is that it has the potential to replace real genuine discourse between people. He argues that one of the reasons democracy has prevailed in our time is the ability of citizens to be informed and have an open discussion about what&#39;s going on in the world.</p> <p>But take a public forum like twitter or Reddit for example. It&#39;s becoming more and more possible that the majority of posts you see are AI generated and do not come from real, genuine humans.
