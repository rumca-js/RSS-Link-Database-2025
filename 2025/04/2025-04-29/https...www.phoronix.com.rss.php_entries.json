        "description": "It's almost majestic: HDR display support working on the Linux desktop. If you asked me at the start of the calendar year if I'd expect to see modern Linux distributions shipping with working HDR display support in H1'2025, I would have been doubtful. But after a lot of miraculous work that landed across numerous upstream repositories over the past two months or so, everything has come together just in time for the likes of Ubuntu 25.04 and Fedora Workstation 42. There still are apps not supporting HDR and the like, but the core infrastructure is in place and working. The past two weeks I've begun testing out the Linux HDR desktop experience with the ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG27UCDM 27-inch 4K display. Between the ASUS PG27UCDM's QD-OLED display and HDR support enabled under Linux, it delivers a very beautiful Linux desktop experience.",
