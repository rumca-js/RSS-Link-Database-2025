However, since its now breaking, its time to get an actual bag to carry my board games!</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something zippable so I can protect my board games from the rain (and in the UK, i expect that quite a bit). I&#39;m not interested in carrying around 5+ games or so, more around 2 or 3 medium sized ones. </p> <p>My largest game is Gaia project, so the bag would have to be able to contain that. I&#39;m thinking of a Duffle bag, ideally with a shoulder strap.</p> <p>Any recommendations for a good bag? I&#39;ve heard good things about the Allplay bag, but I&#39;ve also heard that its not rigid unless full of games, and I don&#39;t plan on filling up that particular bag and carrying it everywhere.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pilgrimofthesnark\"> /u/pilgrimofthesnark </a>",

I have never played it myself but it does seem like a legendary game I should acquire next to expand my collection. So the question arises, will Brass work for 2p without sacrificing much of its magic? And if so, which version is better suited for this: Birmingham or Lancashire? I\u2019ll be honest I am sort of gravitating to Lancashire, but I know each has its fortes and, in the end, my number 1 priority is that it works well for 2p.</p> <p>Additionally, if you know similar games that could stand up to Brass, but more suited for 2p your recommendations are welcome. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",

Not just minor nitpicks, but the stuff that genuinely hurts the experience for you. Here\u2019s my personal list:</p> <ol> <li><p>Hate-drafting When players pick something not because they need it, but just to deny it to someone else. I find it frustrating, especially when it feels like spite rather than strategy.</p></li> <li><p>Zero player interaction Games where you feel like you\u2019re playing solo next to someone, not really engaging with them. I prefer at least indirect interaction.</p></li> <li><p>Cheap components Low-quality bits can really hurt the experience of an otherwise great game. Example: The paper money in Power Grid feels flimsy and fiddly compared to cardboard tokens or metal coins.</p></li> <li><p>Excessive miniatures I know many love them, but I find big plastic minis unnecessary, often bloating the price and making the game feel less elegant ",

I&#39;m trying to remember the name of a game I played in the early 2000s and can&#39;t find on google. </p> <p>The game was comprised of spinning palm trees in two lines up a board. The trees moved up and down and spun round. The aim of the game was to hook your monkey onto the first tree, then using a lever (?) raise the next tree and hook your monkey onto it, moving down the line of trees. You raced your opponent to get all your moneys to the finish. It definitely required batteries but not sure what type. </p> <p>Any ideas what it could be called??</p> <p>I have a 4-year old in my life who I think would find it really fun! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chillijam\"> /u/chillijam </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1kadcie/what_is_this_early_2000s_monkey_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments",
