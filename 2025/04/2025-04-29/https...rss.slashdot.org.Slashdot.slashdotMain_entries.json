        "description": "LG will permanently shut down its Android smartphone update servers on June 30, 2025, ending all software, app, and security updates for its devices. If you're still using an smartphone, you'll want to install any remaining updates before that date, as no future updates will be available afterward. 9to5Google reports: When LG called it quits for Android smartphones, the company also committed to a few more updates. That included an Android 12 update for select devices, the last major update the company would put out, as well as security updates for at least three years after each device had been released. That three-year cutoff has long since passed for all LG devices, but any devices still floating around out there will soon no longer be able to pull updates. LG's notice can be read here.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=LG+Will+Shut+Down+Update+Servers+For+Its+Android+Smartphones+In+June%3A+https%3A%",

Kathy Hochul says a $254 billion state budget deal has been reached, including a \"bell-to-bell\" school cellphone ban. [...] The distraction-free policy would take effect next school year, making New York the largest state in the country with a \"bell-to-bell\" cellphone ban. Hochul says the plan will help protect children from addictive technology and improve their mental health. The New York State United Teachers union also came out in support of the ban, saying \"we are at a crisis point.\"\n \nThe governor previously outlined the proposal back in January, saying it would ban the use of smartphones and other internet-enabled devices on school grounds during the school day. That includes classroom time, lunch and study hall periods. \"A bell-to-bell ban, morning until the day is over, is not going to hurt your kids. It's going to help them emerge with stronger mental health and resiliency,\" she told CBS News New York at the ti",

The Open Invention Network's (OIN) origins are rooted in a turbulent era for open source. In the mid-2000s, Linux faced existential threats from copyright and patent litigation. Besides, the infamous SCO lawsuit and Microsoft's claims that Linux infringed on hundreds of its patents cast a shadow over the ecosystem. Business leaders became worried. While SCO's attacks petered out, patent trolls -- formally known as Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs) -- were increasing their attacks. So, open-source friendly industry giants, including IBM, Novell, Philips, Red Hat, and Sony, formed the Open Invention Network (OIN) to create a bulwark against patent threats targeting Linux and open-source technologies. Founded in 2005, the Open Invention Network (OIN) has evolved into a global community comprising over 4,000 participants, ranging from startups to multinational corpor",

Researchers analyzed 576,000 code samples from 16 popular large language models and found 19.7% of package dependencies -- 440,445 in total -- were \"hallucinated.\" \n\nThese non-existent dependencies exacerbate dependency confusion attacks, where malicious packages with identical names to legitimate ones can infiltrate software. Open source models hallucinated at nearly 22%, compared to 5% for commercial models. \"Once the attacker publishes a package under the hallucinated name, containing some malicious code, they rely on the model suggesting that name to unsuspecting users,\" said lead researcher Joseph Spracklen. Alarmingly, 43% of hallucinations repeated across multiple queries, making them predictable targets.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=AI-Genera",

        "description": "Carbon removal technologies, potentially a $250 billion market, are failing to gain traction as buyers remain scarce. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects a need for 10 billion metric tons of carbon removals annually by 2050, yet only 175 million tons have been sold to date -- less than 2% of requirements. \n\nMicrosoft dominates the market, accounting for 35% of all purchases and 76% of engineered removal solutions specifically. The market suffers from significant barriers: unproven technologies, vast price disparities ($80 per ton for forest projects versus $1,000 for direct air capture), and lack of standardization. Industry experts at a recent London gathering concluded that without more buyers willing to accept early adoption risks, the market cannot meaningfully grow.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=It+Could+Be+a+%24250+Billion+Market%2C+But+Almost+No+One+Is+Interested%3A+https%3",

        "description": "Bitcoin mining has crossed a critical economic threshold, with costs now exceeding market value for most operators. According to data cited by CoinShares, large public mining companies spend over $82,000 to produce a single Bitcoin -- nearly double last quarter's figure -- while smaller operations face even steeper costs of approximately $137,000 per coin. \n\nWith Bitcoin currently trading around $94,703, the math no longer works for most miners. The economics become particularly challenging in high-electricity-cost regions like Germany, where mining a single coin requires approximately $200,000. Industry analysts suggest larger mining operations are adapting by optimizing energy consumption and positioning their computational infrastructure for alternative uses. These companies can potentially lease their mining setups for other computational tasks during unprofitable mining periods, then resume mining when market conditions improve. \n\nFor individual miners, however, the era of profit",

From a report: Google's report said that the number of zero-day exploits -- referring to security flaws that were unknown to the software makers at the time hackers abused them -- had dropped from 98 exploits in 2023 to 75 exploits in 2024. \n\nBut the report noted that of the proportion of zero-days that Google could attribute -- meaning identifying the hackers who were responsible for exploiting them -- at least 23 zero-day exploits were linked to government-backed hackers.

From a report: Michael Scheuer, a Florida resident, was sentenced last week in federal court and ordered to pay nearly $690,000 in restitution, with most of that going to Disney. He pled guilty in January to one count of computer fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. \n\n\"Scheuer remains remorseful and apologetic to his former co-workers. We are grateful that the judge heard all of our arguments and mitigation when fashioning a sentence that was half of what the government was seeking,\" said David Haas, Scheuer's lawyer, in a statement to CNN. \n\nScheuer worked as a menu production manager for Disney and was fired last June for misconduct, according to the original complaint.

From a report: CHS told CNBC that the outage involving Oracle Health, the company's electronic health record (EHR) system, affected \"several\" hospitals, leading them to activate \"downtime procedures.\" Trade publication Becker's Hospital Review reported that 45 hospitals were hit. \n\nThe outage began on April 23, after engineers conducting maintenance work mistakenly deleted critical storage connected to a key database, a CHS spokesperson said in a statement. The outage was resolved on Monday, and was not related to a cyberattack or other security incident. CHS is based in Tennessee and includes 72 hospitals in 14 states, according to the medical system's website.<p><div class=\"share_submission\" style=\"position:relative;\">\n<a class=\"slashpop\" href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Oracle+Engineers+C",

Officials from the Milwaukee Police Department say swapping the photos with the software firm Biometrica will lead to quicker arrests and solving of crimes. But that benefit is unpersuasive for those who say the trade is startling, due to the concerns of the surveillance of city residents and possible federal agency access. \"We recognize the very delicate balance between advancement in technology and ensuring we as a department do not violate the rights of all of those in this diverse community,\" Milwaukee Police Chief of Staff Heather Hough said during an April 17 meeting.\n \nFor the first time, Milwaukee police officials detailed their plans to use the facial recognition technology during a meeting of the city's Fire and Police Commission, the oversight body for those departments.

Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero. The large-scale conversion led to a 50% spike in XMR's price with the token reaching an intraday high of $339, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n \nAt the time of writing, XMR has settled slightly but remains up 25% in the past 24 hours, trading at $289.
