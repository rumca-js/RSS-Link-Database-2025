I&#39;d assumed that this was the inner sensor, and just put some tape on it to try trick it, which for the most part worked. However more recently it&#39;s been doing this again and i can&#39;t understand why. Now it&#39;ll do it randomly, even if I&#39;m looking straight ahead and instead of it being a black screen like before like it&#39;s turned off, now the screen is on, but nothings on it. like i can press buttons and hear all the noises, but theres nothing there. This most recent time, the headset only turned back on when my head was tilted so far back it was practically looking backwards!

So now I can only rely on VR.</p> <p>Back in the 3DTV age, I used to enjoy playing all the big titles like Tomb Raider series and many other great games using 3dVision by nvidia. Then they discontinued it. Fortunately I just learned that, after so many years, fans are still supporting this and made Geo11 to replace it to help DirectX 11 games to run on stereoscopic displays.</p> <p>I wonder, is there any ways to run flat games with Geo 11 in VR, mostly Quest 3, using something like virtual desktop or any other apps that support SBS/interlace or anything?</p> <p>Lots of games don&#39;t have UEVR support, so many we can still bring a third dimension to some flat screen games.</p> <p>(From <a href=\"https://helixmod.blogspot.com/\">https://helixmod.blogspot.com/</a>, it seems that they do have a VRto3D open source project. So basically they use UEVR to bring UE games into VR, then convert to 3D ",
