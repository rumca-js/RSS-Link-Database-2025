My perfect little media library with its (mostly) automatically loaded metadata. I have live channels in my life again after like 20 years. Jellyfin pipes the channel guide info from ersatz so cleanly. I made all my own crispy tv channel logos for everything from Anime 24/7 channels to my horror movie channel and all of my favorite youtube videos. The best part of all? No fcking ads in sight. Neither service is perfect but for a free service, it is incredible. I also secretly love the occasional &quot;tinkering&quot; involved when something goes wrong too. Makes me feel like it&#39;s the early 2000s again. Having to solve problems on my own and actually being able to pull it off. Getting back into this has been rad. </p> <p>(This is the equivalent of a &quot;dobby has a sock&quot; post, with Netflix being my abusive previous owner. I am now a free elf.)</p> </div><!-- SC_O",
