Don&#39;t get me wrong - I&#39;m certainly willing and able to recognize that at the time of release they were great or even perhaps groundbreaking, and so can appreciate their historical importance. If I&#39;m lucky, sometimes I can even catch a small glimpse of what it must have been like for someone at the time to experience something wholly new and amazing. But the reality is that usually I&#39;ve already experienced the virtues of &quot;classics&quot; in works that are both (from my perspective) better and more tailored to my modern sensibilities. I expected some degree of this going in to reading Ursula K. Le Guin&#39;s iconic work of fantasy <em>A Wizard of Earthsea</em>. And as expected, I didn&#39;t LOVE it.

The prose was magical, the world dreamlike, and it was all soaked in heavy emotions.</p> <p>But \u201cRiddle Master of Hed\u201d\u2026 I\u2019m really struggling with. The prose just isn\u2019t nearly as gorgeous, and the story is really confusing. (Despite their dreamlike quality, the two books I read previously had pretty simple narratives\u2014I was never lost, and they gripped me from page one.) A lot of characters have really strong emotions but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever really properly clarified why, random important facts are kind of confusingly added\u2014like the stars on his head\u2014and the importance/magic of riddles is kind of confusing\u2026</p> <p>I\u2019m wondering if this book (and the rest of the trilogy) gets easier to follow eventually?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kooky_County9569\"> /u/Kooky_County9569 </a> <br/> <span><",

I&#39;ve seen it recommended a ton on <a href=\"/r/horrorlit\">r/horrorlit</a>, and since we have the epistolary bingo square (This is HM btw), I thought I would review it here. While it was incredibly well written (and narrated on audiobook), I can&#39;t say I really enjoyed it.</p> <p>The story is an epistolary in three layers and time periods. The first layer is in the modern day of a young journalism professor who discovered a hide bound diary of her many times great grandfather. The second layer is the diary following a priest who receives a confession of a vampire in 1912 on the Montana frontier. The third layer, and perhaps the most interesting, is the story of the vampire telling how he became the way he is, and the one man war he fought against the invading white settlers and trappers.</",
