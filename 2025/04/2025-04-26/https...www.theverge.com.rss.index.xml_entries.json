The longest of them - titled \"Gestation Complete\" - spends two whole minutes on the gestation and birth of an alien creature. Another, \"Crate,\" gives hints that Earth could be facing more than just a xenomorph, the franchise's shiny, acid-spitting ancient aliens. Both teasers were released today, following a goofy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWcoTNnLX-k\">nature documentary-themed Earth Day teaser</a> earlier this week. </p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">\"Gestation Complete\" is worth sitting through if you were a fan of the look of the 1979 <em>Alien</em>",
