As a disclosure, I&#39;ve never read the books (not too keen of spice, and would probably skim through it lol), though i can&#39;t help but notice that people hate it because it deemed to either too inappropriate for younger audience. Is it me, or does the majority of people against this book?</p> <p>Similar to the Twilight series, I remember folks would clown those who read the series. As if, reading these types of books rotted your brains or something. Something about reading fantasies on relationship between paranormal, faes, monster individuals, etc. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s giving misogynistic. You don&#39;t see this with Harry Potter, Hunger Games, PJO because it&#39;s targeted to all audiences regardless of the genders. Idk, what are your thoughts? The books aren&#39;t my cup of tea, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to bath others on what ",

I&#39;ve also noticed there is effort on the publishers part to make the spine thicknesses relatively similar\u2014so shorter books have more &quot;air&quot; in them or even thicker pages.

I&#39;m thinking about it after a post I made on <a href=\"/r/BrandonSanderson\">/r/BrandonSanderson</a> about the file size of <em>Wind and Truth</em> and was utterly lambasted for it (<a href=\"https://redd.it/1k7vhdz\">here&#39;s the thread</a> if you&#39;re curious). This question mainly applies to Sanderson&#39;s books, though I&#39;m sure there are other authors releasing large and unoptimized ebooks.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using an eReader since 2011, and my library is pretty large, over 1200 books at this point. And books are generally tiny. Literally half the books in my library are 1 MB in size or less. Probably 90% of them are under 10 MB, including many technical PDFs and image heavy books. But I&#39;m noticing a trend in recent years of ebooks getting larger in size. And Sanderson (or I suppose Tor?) are the biggest culprit. His ebooks have gotten utterly bloated over the years. Look at his magnum opus, Stormlight Archiv",

I loved her unboxing videos she would do of subscription boxes like Owlcrate, Fairyloot, etc. Anyways, I&#39;ve been trying to find their videos again but I can&#39;t find them anywhere. Her name was Mel or Melanie...something I think? and they were popular around 2019. She looked white with blonde hair but mentioned she was half white and half Korean or Filipina, don&#39;t remember exactly. Does anyone know who I&#39;m talking about? If someone could help me find their channel (if she&#39;s still around), I would greatly appreciate it!
