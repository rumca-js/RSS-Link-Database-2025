Can he a natural 5 star, or 10/10 or could also just be a a nostalgia hit for you. Even if it&#39;s more than one. I&#39;m trying to compile another watchlist but I want other people&#39;s favs. I&#39;m throwing most of the list as well because I want to broaden my cinematic spectrum. I&#39;m shying away from foreign films though personally just because I really have to be in the mood to read subtitles for long periods of time. Other then that, it&#39;s an open field. Drop a favorite or all the favorites, no matter how fantastic or atrocious the reviews, critic responses and box office were.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SonYakub\"> /u/SonYakub </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k85uce/i_want_to_know_your_favorite_moviemovies_your/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.redd",

Its like its constantly pushing the bar of disbelief into uncanny levels of weird. Having Bruce Willis come out of nowhere wearing a bunny costume. Having two of the four main Seinfeld cast members play the role of the parents. The cartoonishly over the top stereotypes of practically all the world&#39;s cultures. The ending where North and his parents are about to be shot dead before he wakes up and realizes it was all a dream. </p> <p>It&#39;s been consistently ranked as the worst movie of all time but its definitely memorably bad. It kinda felt like something you would watch on Adult Swim at 3 AM while you were half awake .</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Physical_S",
