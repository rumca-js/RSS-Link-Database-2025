All I can remember is that we had I think 5 face down cards and I think it was a shedding game where you were trying to get rid of all the cards in your hand and on the table. I think it was a ladder climbing game where you had to go one higher than the last card played, but some cards would reset the number to zero, one would let you play a lower number, etc. I can&#39;t remember all the cars effects and I&#39;m sure this is a long shot but I&#39;ve seen other posts where people with super obscure and often incorrect descriptions got help so I&#39;m shooting my shot.

Each of the games goes by a different name, not sequels. No playing order, but I remember most people said that the 2nd (red box) one was the best and that it&#39;s best to play them in the order they came ou. Number of players: 1, 2 Card type game, without a playing field The 3 games all had distinct colours for the boxes: 1st one was green, 2nd was red and 3rd was purple. Rectangular boxes</p> <p>It&#39;d be tons of help if someone could figure this out.

I&#39;m just asking for your opinions on which version to purchase.</p> <p>My brother and I enjoy most of the old-school Avalon Hill war games. I see that Gibson published a &quot;modern&quot; version in 2023, with a dual-sided board and two sets of instructions, one being the original A.H. version. I really like that idea, as it worked very well with The Merchants of Venus.</p> <p>But the O.G. version I can get for about $60 cheaper. Is the &#39;modern&#39; Gibson version going to be worth the extra cost? That&#39;s what I&#39;m leaning towards, but I wanted to get some opinions first.

However, just as I\u2019m about to make the purchase, I found out there\u2019s a version of <em>Dune</em> set in the <em>Twilight Imperium</em> universe. </p> <p>I\u2019d like to ask: which version is better? For context, I have no particular attachment to the <em>Dune</em> theme \u2014 I\u2019ve never read the books or watched the movies. My interest in the game is mainly because of the diplomacy and politics elements, and of course, strategy, which are what I enjoy most when playing TI4. I&#39;m looking for something that can give me a similar feeling when I play.</p> <p>I know that <em>Twilight Imperium: Rex</em> is older (2012) compared to <em>Dune</em>",
