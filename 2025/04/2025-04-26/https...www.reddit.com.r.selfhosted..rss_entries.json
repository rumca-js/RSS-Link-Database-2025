I\u2019ve learned enough about cybersecurity recently to feel <em>very</em> determined to cut out third parties as much as possible when it comes to my data storage and access to my location/devices, but it seems like every time I come across one concept I get bombarded with a million other unknown concepts and terms that may or may not apply to what I can actually do. I want to order more storage to start and any other hardware I keep reading about, but I\u2019m not sure what exactly that is right now.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also been sick for a while so it&#39;s also been a long time since I learned or did anything as complicated as this and I\u2019m feeling pretty overwhelmed. I did some programming and comp sci courses years and years ago that I\u2019ve no memory of, I can remember my way around a computer and pick up new things quickly once I can visualize the concept",
