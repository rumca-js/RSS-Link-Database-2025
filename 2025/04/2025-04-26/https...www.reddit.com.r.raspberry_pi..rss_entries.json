After much procrastination \ud83e\udd23, I\u2019m incredibly proud to say that I have finished developing the Dune Weaver Pro. For those of you who haven\u2019t heard of it before, Dune Weaver is a kinetic sand table that creates mesmerizing patterns using a marble that moves on a sand bed.</p> <p>I spent the last couple of months working on this and you can build one right now with me if you want to. For now, the model is available for a fee on my Patreon page (<a href=\"https://patreon.com/duneweaver\">https://patreon.com/duneweave",
