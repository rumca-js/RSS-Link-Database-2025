Can you do this without having to log in with a Google account?</p> <p>* If I forgo using the phone on a mobile network but instead consider it a &#39;small computer with WiFi connectivity&#39;, is that possible or worthwhile?</p> <p>* I would like to use eSIMs for mobile data when traveling. Is this feasible (FP4 supports eSIMs)</p> <p>* Dire warnings exist about installing your own OS. Is there really a risk of terminally bricking the device, and/or in the event of issues is it possible to revert the FP4 to its &#39;stock&#39; install?</p> <p>Thanks for any help or advice!</p> </d",
