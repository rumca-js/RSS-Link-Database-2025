I read some stuff about the Nouveau drivers but before I waste another 20 hours: do they got vulkan implemented in the meantime?

On windows, I had it set up so that it would feed the Xbox audio back into my wired PC headphones and this was pretty easy to achieve, simply go into audio devices and tick the box that said \u201clisten\u201d (in my case it was line in) and I was wondering how you can achieve this on Linux. I\u2019ve done some google-fu, tried enabling loopback in alsamixer, still no sound from the Xbox. </p> <p>I\u2019m on Nobara which came installed with Pulse Audio and I can see the device I want to listen in on but for the life of me I can\u2019t figure out how to do it. If anyone\u2019s got any insight it\u2019d be greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JackOfHearts2238\"> /u/JackOfHearts2238 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1k84w4s/how_to_listen_to_a_device/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www",
