Linguists found that the melody of spoken language in English functions as its own, distinct language. And there was also depressing news! Like the Trump administration slashing NASA's budget, which could scrap the James Webb Space Telescope right at the beginning of its operational life (they're also pushing to scrap the completed Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope before its launch).",
