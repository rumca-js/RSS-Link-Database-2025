        "description": "A great many of us have - in one way or another - been traumatised somewhere in our past. Not only have we suffered greatly, we are likely not to have been able properly to process and digest what we have gone through. A key feature of a good life is a capacity to look our trauma in the eye; and ensure that the future can be a whole lot more hopeful than the past.\n\nEnjoying our Youtube videos?
