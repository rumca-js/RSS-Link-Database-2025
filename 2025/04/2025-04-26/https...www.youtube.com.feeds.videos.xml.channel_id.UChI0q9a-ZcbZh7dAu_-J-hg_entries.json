        "description": "\"Cluely\" (a brand new \"cheat on everything\" AI application)... is a dark harbinger of how low people will sink under the promise of social advantage. \n\nWhile some AI programs will serve as helpful tools, the idea that we should all be \"cheating\" as often as possible with undetectable products is a twisted downward spiral that can only end with a degradation in social skills. \n\nAfter being disciplined by his university, the founder seems bent on a quest to get as many people as possible to replace their own cognition and social interactions with chatGPT slop.\n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https://linktr.ee/upperechelonsecurity\n\n\n\nODYSEE INVITE: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@UpperEchelonGamer",
