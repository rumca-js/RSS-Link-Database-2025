I want to implement a honeypot but since the company is soooo small is it even beneficial? Or will it be alle to detect? Do I need to lower the security settings on the honeypot accounts? Does anyone know a good starter guide? Is Zabbix good for monitoring the honeypots or other software better? Thanks in advice.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Existing_Bit_6641\"> /u/Existing_Bit_6641 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1k8bcrl/starting_with_honeypots_and_monitoring/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1k8bcrl/starting_with_honeypots_and_monitoring/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Besides doing admin work experience, we also do daily 45ish minute sessions on given topics.</p> <p>I want to do a cybersecurity module that just covers the very basics (don&#39;t stick random usbs into company laptops, don&#39;t click phishing links, etc).</p> <p>I&#39;m not a cybersecurity professional myself, but I am a third year IT student and am about to complete my first two cybersecurity units (mostly on risk management, policies, standards, etc. All theoretical stuff so far).</p> <p>What do you think I should cover in the module I want to make? Bonus request for activities we can do to teach.</p> <p>Please and thankyou.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GreenTang\"> /u/GreenTang </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1k84eg7/cybersecurity_mod",
