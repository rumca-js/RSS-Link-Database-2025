He really loved our chat and said it was mind opening to think about more and that it made him intrinsically motivated for all kinds of things in life and professional life, so I\u2019d love to kind of continue on that and give him something thought provoking to read. He doesn\u2019t read much so ideally it is engaging and not too long, but we are pursuing a sociotechnical masters so it can be somewhat intellectual. I hope this is enough to go on but please let me know if you have any questions.</p> <p>I\u2019m also not an avid reader, so I\u2019m really not sure what to give or how to find the right book. So I could really use your help!! Thanks ahead :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/metertyu\"> /",

I&#39;ve seen my fair share of zombie media, but 28 Days Later feels unique. I love the moments of hope, peace, and love crammed in between the horror. I love how the movie oscillates between the feeling of a dream and the feeling of a nightmare. I also love that what little humor exists within the movie does not undermine the genuine heartbreak or moments of connection the characters experience. This movie is not a power fantasy like The Walking Dead, but a vision of hell on Earth and trying to maintain hope. So, what books do you guys recommend? </p> <p>P.S.
