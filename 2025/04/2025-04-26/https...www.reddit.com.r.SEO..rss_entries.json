I used visualping and a no code automation tool to track my competitors and scrape their websites and Instagram pages. While I am paying for tools but it really helped me find the exact hashtags that my competitors are using. I have implemented this system for a fashion brand. It&#39;s interesting and helps get a lay of the land. Ofcourse this doesn&#39;t substitute tools like Ahrefs but i guess it&#39;s cool when you get a report of what your competitors are doing. </p> <p>Just wanted to say that this is possible and is anyone doing something similar to this? </p> <p>I just implemented the system so it&#39;s like in it&#39;s early stages but I aim to grow this for at least 50 competitors in the luxury fashion space. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/eshusrni\"> /u/eshusrni </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1k8k",
