I&#39;m pretty sure if our brains had a ridiculous amount of capacity, we&#39;d fill it with rules too. It&#39;s the easiest path. But our brains have a limited capacity so we&#39;ve been forced to adapt. No one has figured out what that is exactly. It&#39;s the trillion dollar question. But I don&#39;t believe we have to figure out that algorithm.</p> <p>What motivated us to adapt? Outside forces that threatened our survival. AI currently does not have this programming. It has no drive to survive. If someone trained a model on a system with limited capacity that its death was the worst possible thing ever, AGI might develop, assuming it has that capability. </p> <p>Seems like an unethical way to create sentience but look at Mother Nature.

It\u2019s not the same to know that the video or podcast is thoughtlessly generated compared to listening to a real human reasoning through problems and explanations to provide an entertaining experience.
