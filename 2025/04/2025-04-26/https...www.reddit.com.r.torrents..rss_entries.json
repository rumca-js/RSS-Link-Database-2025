The speed might not be the best, maybe averaging around 2-7 Mbps (but I&#39;m really satisfied with this). Recently, I moved to another city and bought a new PC. However, in my new place I just can&#39;t seem to torrent. The download speed is so slow (around 100 kbps / maybe even lower). After trying for about 1 week, last night I boot up my old laptop....and...I can torrent? the same file, same source, and with the same VPN and internet??</p> <p>I&#39;m just so confused. Most people said maybe it&#39;s my ISP / VPN problem, but how come it works on my old laptop? The only thing that I can think of is that, on my new PC, for some reason Steam mentioned that it&#39;s not compatible with Astrill or something (no problem on my old laptop). So I found out online that the fix is to uninstall the LSP on my VPN. I did it, and there&#39;s no problem whatso",
