I originally planned to get the 2007FP, but it has become extremely rare and complicated to find. I\u2019d like to know if the 1908FPT is worth it for retro gaming, considering I mainly want to use it for PC emulation (consoles from NES to the original Xbox, and PCs from the 90s and 2000s), and maybe to watch anime from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s. Beyond that, I really want to recapture the authenticity of old games. For example, when I emulate PlayStation games on today\u2019s screens-whether it\u2019s my 4K PC monitor or my Tab S6 Premium tablet-games like Final Fantasy 8 or Resident Evil 3 have very low-resolution 2D backgrounds that look bad on modern displays. Do you think I could get nice, authentic-looking backgrounds with the 1908FPT?</p> <p>I\u2019d like to connect the monitor via a DisplayPort to DVI-D cable.

Not the fighting and musou part, but the one where you have a map that you have to conquer, piece by piece. It&#39;s a classic space/scifi 4x setup found in games like Stellaris (space is shaped like a graph with nodes - planetary systems - and edges - wormholes or whatever). You move your units, capture nodes, find resources, defend nodes... It&#39;s also in games like , where the map is the same but with adjacent rectangular regions - the idea being the same here: move your units to a region to capture and/or defend it. There are a few on PC, but I was looking for 8-16bit console games. </p> <p>Does that ring a bell?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Notnasiul\"> /u/Notnasiul </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1k8ac3h/looking_for_games_like_dinasty_warriors_advance/\">[",
