After a few months of low traction, I pretty much abandoned it.</p> <p>Fast forward to about 3 months ago, I decided to come back and add some new features: Feynman AI, Smart Note Taker, also enhance the exercise solving ability. I also started doing some basic marketing \u2014 mainly TikTok videos, Reddit posts, and some ad campaigns on Tiktok. </p> <p>Since then, it has made about $200 which is pretty low for me. What should I do next? I would love for your feedback. </p> <p>The app is called TutorAI: Note, Math, FeynmanAI.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/davidtranjs\"> /u/davidtranjs </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1k84e55/i_made_a_study_tool_1_year_ago_abandoned_it/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1k84e55/i_made_a_study_t",

But once in a while with 4 (or 5 if slow on the course) we will play a round and all keep score like normal, but add some intra-round games for money based on points. </p> <p>So any one or more players can get point(s) during a hole based on what we are playing. Point value is defined at the beginning of the round. </p> <p>Well, so round is finished then you have 5 guys with varying amounts of points at whatever value was decided. And then its the hour long napkin math to figure out who owes who what. I pay this guy this much, that guy that much, but they pay 2 other guys their share etc. And there is always confusion, wasted time, and prob get it wrong half the time. </p> <p>So last night I stayed up and made this: <a href=\"https://pointspayout.com/\">https://pointspayout.com/</a></p> <p>Not with any intent to make money but just because it solved a stupid problem we all deal ",
