Here\u2019s my list of possible things for them to choose from (i will give a quick summary of the selected Titles and each of the kids then has 30 mins to check out their selected title):</p> <ul> <li>Dash Dash World</li> <li>Richies Plank Exp.</li> <li>Clone Drone Hyperdome</li> <li>Beat Saber</li> <li>Megaton Rainfall</li> <li>Moss</li> <li>Thumper</li> <li>The AR invaders game on Q3, forgot the name</li> <li>Tilt Brush</li> </ul> <p>Any Suggestions of how to make the list more child-friendly or other awesome games I missed?
