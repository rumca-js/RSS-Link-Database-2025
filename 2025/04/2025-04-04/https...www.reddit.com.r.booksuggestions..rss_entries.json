I have been noticing I really love books that have a theme of a girl or a woman being all alone in the world or being the last person surviving a disaster or apocalypse. Or alternatively, not alone in the world but a woman/girl who feels very alien to the rest of the world and maybe doesn\u2019t understand how to contextualize herself. Bonus points if there\u2019s an element of queerness or genderfucking. Examples of the vibe I like: I Who Have Never Known Men, Wittgenstein\u2019s Mistress, Parable of the Sower, Housekeeping by Marilyn Robinson, the general mood of some Alice Munro short stories. </p> <p>Would appreciate some suggestions that match kind of energy!

In particular I&#39;m looking for books that have information on understanding generations younger than Millennials. I think I have some pre-conceived notions of everyone younger than me because of how they&#39;re portrayed by society. I&#39;m aware of how they had to grow up with advanced technology already in place in our world, through a global pandemic, through everlasting fears of a dying climate, vicious politics, etc. I have an interest in reading psych books and case studies, so the more hard facts I can discover on young people&#39;s resilience and mental health, the better. I want to develop my own ideas on who they are and what good they can bring to this world.</p> <p>Recently read and enjoyed: &quot;The Anxious Generation&quot; by Jonathan Haidt </p> <p>&quot;Weathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society&quot; by Dr. ",

Low on romance. If romance, must be closed door 2. No child loss/harm to children 3. A book involving friendship or found family with multiple characters so everyone who reads it can find something or someone they identify/resonate with 4. Fairly fast paced read/under 400 pages. Most in attendance are moms of young children without a lot of time to read 5. Nice to have: summer vibes/camp vibes</p> <p>The closest thing I can think of is The Five Star Weekend by Elin Hilderbrand but about half of the people attending have read that already. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/saribee\"> /u/saribee </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jr82jj/book_club_book_friends",

Maybe it makes them feel less human or alienated, maybe they aren\u2019t ready for the responsibility, etc.</p> <p>In other words, I\u2019m asking for a book with a main character whose conflict is not about whether they can do something, but whether they\u2019re willing to do it, and the repercussions of their actions. The best analog I can think of is Rand Al\u2019Thor from Wheel of Time. In non-book media, something like Superman fits.
