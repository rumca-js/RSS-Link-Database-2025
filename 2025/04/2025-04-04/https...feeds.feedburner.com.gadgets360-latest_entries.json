        "description": "A recent study conducted in Israel\u2019s Hula Valley reveals how bats manage to avoid collisions while exiting caves in large groups. Despite the expected interference from their echolocation calls, which could lead to crashes, bats have adapted by making behavioural changes. They fan out in flight, switching to higher-frequency calls that are shorter and weaker, helping them navigate without interference from surrounding echoes. This study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offers new insights into bats' ability to navigate effectively in crowded environments.",

The footage, taken on October 12, 2022, shows a swirling motion in the solar wind, a phenomenon never observed before. Scientists identified the formation as a pseudostreamer caused by a solar flare near the Sun\u2019s north pole. The plasma structure lasted three hours, displaying Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations driven by magnetic disturbances. The video also revealed bright streaks, later confirmed as distant stars. With solar activity intensifying, researchers expect more extreme solar winds in the coming years.",
