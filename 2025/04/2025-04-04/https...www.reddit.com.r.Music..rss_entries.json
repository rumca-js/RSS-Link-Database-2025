It feels like I\u2019m trapped in it. Every gig I\u2019m doubting every single note I play, I rarely get into a flow state, and every time someone compliments me after a gig I feel like it\u2019s fake and they don\u2019t mean it. (I absolutely hate that I do this, I constantly try to make an effort to just accept the compliments but I always know I\u2019m lying when I say thanks. Which is such a selfish thing to not accept someone\u2019s thanks/praise, I should be grateful!) I feel like I\u2019m getting worse at my instrument, musicianship and my mental health is rapidly declining. Another big thing\u2026. I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a good gig,they\u2019re never good enough for me, I always feel like I\u2019ve fucked it up somehow. Anyways im desperately seeking advice to try to make my way out of this. I know there\u2019s a million posts like this and y\u2019all are probably tired of seeing",

While it sucks to know there\u2019s new music being released and I\u2019m voluntarily holding off, it has paid off.</p> <p>I think listening to singles taints those songs. Just like when you discover a particular song by a band then fall in love with their music. That song always sounds like \u201cthat song\u201d as opposed to a good song on an album. Not that it\u2019s not special, but it feels like a separate thing. I feel like even knowing what songs/music videos have been released changes my perception of them.</p> <p>Maybe the way I perceive new music isn\u2019t relatable, but I think others might benefit from this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bymboy12\"> /u/Bymboy12 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1jro1qq/does_anyone_else_not_listen_to_single_until_an/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

I still have a hard time accepting we will never hear new music from him again. I recently reread his books and it opened up the wound yet again, but I have nothing but gratitude that he lived and left us behind with the music he did. His unique haunting vocals and his raw spirit will always live on.

His songs still make me feel peaceful when I hear it. Every album of his has no song that doesn&#39;t sound dated. It sounds like it could be released.</p> <p>I like that 21st century artists like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Alicia Keys, Lana Del Rey, etc are making albums that are about quality not just quantity.

Dave \u201cDoc\u201d Robinson had the perfect voice for that song. It has some soul in it. </p> <p>No offense to Toploader I think they did a good job just don\u2019t like that weird 2000\u2019s sound singers were doing like drawing out sounds thinking they were Christina Aguilera.

About 6 months later the musicians that worked on the game released an official album containing arranged versions the same music and it&#39;s extremely well made. The most well known musician of the group is probably Taro Bando who worked on many Nintendo titles like the original Mario Kart, Super Smash Brothers and the Zelda series. </p> <p>There&#39;s not a lot of information about the album, there&#39;s a <a href=\"https://www.discogs.com/release/4255190-Ryuichi-Katsumata-Taro-Bando-F-Zero-X-Guitar-Arrange-Edition\">page on discogs</a>, and there&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.n64brasil.com.br/2017/01/taro-bando-e-trilha-sonora-de-f-zero-x.html\">an article here</a> in Portuguese but it doesn&#39;t say much. Physical copies were officially sold but they&#39;re extremely rare and these days go for about $1000. Anyway, i thought I&#39;d share it because I couldn&#39;t see any recent threads abou",
