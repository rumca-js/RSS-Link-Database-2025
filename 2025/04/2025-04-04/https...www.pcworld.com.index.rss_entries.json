There\u2019s still time to catch up, and you can do it for free.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike some streaming services, Apple TV+ offers a variety of free trials, including one option that spans a full three months. Students can also grab free Apple TV+ access, and there\u2019s even a mobile carrier that offers Apple TV+ as a freebie, provided you\u2019re signed up for the right service plan.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whether you want to see what the fuss is about with <em>Severance</em>, or you\u2019re itching to check out a new show like <em>The Studio</em>, the buzzy behind-the-scenes-of-Hollywood series with Seth Rogan, you can stream entire seasons of Apple TV+ shows without paying a dime.

Even if you\u2019re not the type to parse through all of the little details that separated Windows 98 from Windows 95, say, you certainly had a favorite Windows OS that you grew up with, cherished, and then fumed when Microsoft replaced it with something different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, you had versions of Windows that you probably detested. Maybe you even (gulp) tried Linux? (Nah.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But <em>ranking</em> each version of Windows? As in, picking a winner? That\u2019s where the fun lies. I\u2019ve ranked every major consumer version of Windows, from worst to best. As Microsoft celebrates its 50th anniversary, see if you agree with what I\u2019ve picked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"windows-2-0-1987\">Windows 2.0 (1987)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I grew up wit",

Fifty years is a <em>long</em> time for anyone, let alone a company which has driven itself to move at the pace of the computer, than the Internet, and now AI. That\u2019s decades of decisions, of launches (and lawsuits!) and apps both good and bad. Most absolutely changed how you live and work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But which ones? Here are 25 key moments in the long, storied history of Microsoft! For each, you\u2019ll find a bit of background, a quirky fact or two, and what it has all meant for Microsoft and for you.
