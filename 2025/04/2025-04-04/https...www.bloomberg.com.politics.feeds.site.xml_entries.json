South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been released from detention following a court's decision to annul his arrest warrant related to charges of insurrection stemming from his brief declaration of martial law in December. As he awaits a ruling from the Constitutional Court on his impeachment, which could either restore him to power or lead to his removal, the political landscape in South Korea remains deeply divided, reflecting ongoing tensions between conservative and liberal factions.
