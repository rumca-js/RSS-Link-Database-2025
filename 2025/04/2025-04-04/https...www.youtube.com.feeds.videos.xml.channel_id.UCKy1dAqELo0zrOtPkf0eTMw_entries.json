Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars will be no exceptions. These upcoming movies are inspired by both the original 1984 crossover Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars and 2015\u2019s Secret Wars. \n\nBut that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Now that we know the main cast of Avengers: Doomsday, we\u2019re getting a clearer picture of which Marvel Comics storylines are inspiring this epic MCU adventure.

It\u2019s focused, filling out its 12-hour runtime nicely without ever dragging or relying on unnecessary padding. Beyond those basics, however, is a certain heart and artistry that elevates the whole package, inviting you to peer into the deep American South through its folklore, nature, and culture. It might not be the most profound exploration of family life, but it\u2019s delivered in ways that feel authentic. From its striking art style to the evocative tunes that bring big story moments together, Hazel\u2019s journey is a captivating one no matter where you\u2019re from.",
