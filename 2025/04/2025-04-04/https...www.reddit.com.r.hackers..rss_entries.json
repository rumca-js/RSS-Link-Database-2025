        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Sooooo I was being a bad boy and trying to circumvent my hotspot throttling. Using a combination of direct USB tethering, VPN, and PDAnet+. All this so i could download some games on my PS4 via PC wifi sharing. And it was working great. Though when I unplugged for a min to do something, plugged back in and couldn&#39;t set up the PC wifi network. Thought maybe Pdanet+ did something weird. So I uninstalled and tried just straight USB tethering and VPN, which was working before. But wifi network wasn&#39;t activating. And every time I tried to click the settings for mobile hot spot, my setting froze. After some digging in my PC, it appears that my whole Wifi driver is completely MISSING. can ever activate, connect to normal wifi as it&#39;s just gone. Currently doing a system restore to try and fix </p> <p>Has anyone else had any similar issues??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zenmasterdredd\"> /u/",
