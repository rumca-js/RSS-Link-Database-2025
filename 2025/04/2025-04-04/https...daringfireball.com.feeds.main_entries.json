Stored in your Wallet, you can\nmake secure and contactless payments with Apple Pay from your\niPhone or Apple Watch. It\u2019s also a way to receive daily cash back\nfor those who use Apple Card. Previously a Discover card, your\nApple Cash card is now Visa.</p>\n\n<p>Spotted by user <a href=\"https://x.com/Kanjo/status/1517427755553804288\">@Kanjo on Twitter</a>, it\u2019s easy to notice the\ncard has a visible Visa logo in the bottom right corner. Before\nthis change, there was no Discover logo on the card. While not\neveryone will like the addition of the logo, it\u2019s going to be hard\nto forget it\u2019s a Visa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Apple Card is a credit card, with Goldman Sachs as the bank and Mastercard as the network.

The Altair 8800, created by a small electronics\ncompany called MITS, was a groundbreaking personal\ncomputer kit that promised to bring computing power to\nhobbyists. When Paul and I saw that cover, we knew two\nthings: the PC revolution was imminent, and we wanted\nto get in on the ground floor.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, personal computers were practically non-\nexistent. Paul and I knew that creating software that\nlet people program the Altair could revolutionize the\nway people interacted with these machines. So, we\nreached out to Ed Roberts, the founder of MITS, and\ntold him we had a version of the programming language\nBASIC for the chip that the Altair 8800 ran on.</p>\n\n<p>There was just one problem: We didn\u2019t.<br/>\nIt was time to get to work.</p>\n</",

When Apple\nintroduced a winning new flat-with-rounded-corners Air design in\n2022, it had to keep selling older models in order to get down\nunder a thousand dollars. Three years later, Apple is finally able\nto sell a brand-new Air\u2009\u2014\u2009with a generous 16GB of unified memory\u2009\u2014\u2009at that important price.</p>\n\n<p>So: No more quibbles about stepping back a generation or two to an\nolder model with a lower price.
