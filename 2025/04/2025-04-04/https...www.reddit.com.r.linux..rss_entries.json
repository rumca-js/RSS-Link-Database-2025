While I\u2019ve mostly kept my setup pretty conservative, I occasionally get the urge to try something new.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, I decided to experiment with the latest version of KDE. I started with KDE Neon, and while I really liked the look and feel, it turned out to be quite buggy. The screen would break in various ways, there was a lot of tearing while watching YouTube videos, Discover had weird blue lines, and there were many other visual issues. So, I decided to go back to Debian.</p> <p>This time, for a bit of a change, I went with Debian Testing and installed the KDE Plasma version of Trixie. I was aiming for that \u201clatest and greatest\u201d experience on Linux, something I\u2019ve generally avoided, because every time I\u2019ve tried a rolling-release distro, it ended in disaster after an update.

One is to create a &quot;unified&quot; dotfiles repo, which contains the same structure as your home directory (a <code>.config</code> dir, and some individual files like <code>.bashrc</code> and so on). Then after checking out your dotfiles repo, you just run <code>stow .</code> and all your config files are in place.</p> <p>The other way is to create a directory in your dotfiles repo for each individual config you might want to use (GNU stow calls these &quot;packages&quot;) and then pass the names of each piece of software to stow, like <code>stow bash nvim lazygit</code>.</p> <p>Some examples might be in order.

I have also used VMs for ubuntu and have some experience with that.</p> <p>However, I would still call myself a beginner, since I have A LOT to learn still.</p> <p>I am considering in getting a dual boot to get a more authentic and native linux feel, to learn more and to also be able to do some exploits that a VM might not be able to where you need to access hardware etc.</p> <p>I think that I want this dual boot environment to be more aimed towards cybersecurity and pentesting work, but I wouldn&#39;t mind if it can be used as a daily driver for programming/other software engineering projects etc. as well.</p> <p>I will of course use my windows environment for my real personal use, gaming etc.<b",
