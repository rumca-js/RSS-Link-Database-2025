I\u00b4m currently looking for some kind of GaaS (Game as a Service) for kids, something quite simple, not fancy, like Flappy Bird but online, and somehow, be able to place a few banners inside the game itself. The context is for a project inside a supermarket in Chile, where kids will experience really cool decorations and games, but we wanted to extend it a bit more to the digital side. </p> <p>Please let me know if there are any services that you might know, thank you very much in advance!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AKRASTIK\"> /u/AKRASTIK </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1jreaze/simple_game_as_a_service_for_kids/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1jreaze/simple_game_as_a_service_for_kids/\">[comments]</a></span>",
