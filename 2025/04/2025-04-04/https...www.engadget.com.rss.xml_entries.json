Alongside larger SL and SR buttons made of metal, the controllers can be disconnected by pressing a more pronounced release button on the back. The big upgrade, though, is using either Joy-Con like a mouse. (And even use them <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https://tech.yahoo.com/articles/dont-worry-nintendo-says-totally-135000063.html\">on your pants</a>, if you want to.)</p>\n<p>The Switch 2 also uses DLSS, so it\u2019s easier for developers to port games across to the hybrid console. In a very Nintendo way, it didn\u2019t actually talk up the hardware specifics, so NVIDIA had to fill in the gaps.&nbsp;</p>\n<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2-hands-on-i-think-nintendos-new-console-is-worth-the-450-130819785.html\"><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg",
