SATA III is about 0.75 GB/s. So it shouldn&#39;t support more than 2 drives. But most expansions cards I&#39;m seeing are 4 or 6, or even 8 ports.</p> <p>So these ports max out at 2GB/s when used together, but ports individually support full SATA III speed if others are not used? I don&#39;t have LVM-RAID in place right now, set up is rather simple, so multiple disks won&#39;t be used at once. But I will eventually move to RAID, in that case will the bandwidth be saturated if using more than 2 drives, making RAID useless?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/andherBilla\"> /u/andherBilla </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jrkgjx/how_many_sata_iii_ports_pcie_3x2_can/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",

I\u2019ve looked into Homepage, Heimdall, Fenrus, and a couple others, but I\u2019m not really finding a great fit. Does anyone have any suggestions on a good dashboard?</p> <p>This is how I\u2019m going to have my friends and family access the services that I\u2019m hosting for them like Nextcloud and Jellyfin instead of them needing to bookmark the page or remember multiple URLs. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hunterb21\"> /u/hunterb21 </a> <b",

I am having trouble deciding between the two of them, i like the way navidrome looks better but it seems to be more out of date and also doesnt pick up library changes like new songs quickly. ampache seems really feature rich but requires a seperate db and also today its asking me to set the db up again almost like it lost its config, it does pick up library changes much more quickly. Am I missing anything here, better alternatives? I am trying to replace youtube music and I mainly use a shuffle all songs approach or use a last added playlist to listen to whats relevant to me at this moment. I have resigned to manually downloading each track past the initial import and probably will just deal with lidarr operating on albums not songs even though I do not want 30K songs vs the 1400 songs I actually want.

I am aware that it&#39;s not the largest storage ever nor the best NAS in the world, but I figured it could handle my most demanding needs being just transcoding.</p> <p>I plan on using it as a storage device backup for my STLs, a photo bank but primarily as a media server. One too many subscriptions and they have crossed the line for me that was being slightly more convenient than the high seas.</p> <p>My goal is my own little Netflix (yes i am aware 4TB isn&#39;t alot, but I am happy to cull my choices and expand later). The problem i&#39;m having is deciding on how. As much as i enjoy Open Source and the idea of Jellyfin, I am much more concerned with ease of use. Ideally I want to just download a movie, upload to my server and have it take care of organizing, downloading",
