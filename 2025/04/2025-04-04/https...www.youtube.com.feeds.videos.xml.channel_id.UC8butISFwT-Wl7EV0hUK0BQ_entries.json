        "description": "On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Jason Lengstorf. He learned to code out of necessity building websites for local emo bands. \n\nHe dropped out of college but eventually worked as an engineer at IBM and has gone on to roles at many other companies doing everything from software architecture to management. He runs CodeTV, a Bravo-style reality TV channel for developers.\n\nWe talk about:\n- Jason's winding path into development from building websites for bands\n- Teaching yourself programming by chasing your curiosity\n- How in-person events gives you tacit knowledge that makes you a better engineer\n- How having a broad range of skills ultimately helps you build better projects\n\nSupport for this podcast comes from a grant from Wix Studio. Wix Studio provides developers tools to rapidly build websites with everything out-of-the-box, then extend, replace, and break boundaries with code.
