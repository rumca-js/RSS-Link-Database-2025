To earn 1 hour of screen time, I\u2019ll need to meet around 10 strict criteria like:</p> <p>\u2022 Did I actually understand what I studied? \u2022 Did I spend at least 30 minutes on it?</p> <p>I\u2019ll document exactly what I did (not just what I learned), then check if every criterion is fulfilled. If there\u2019s a single discrepancy \u2013 no phone.</p> <p>To avoid self-deception, I\u2019ll hand over the protocol and criteria to an AI model like ChatGPT.

The aim was to create something like rudimentary proto consciousness or a simulated consciousness within that entity. The concept of &quot;self-awareness&quot; is often used as a synonym for consciousness. So, having my entity (Echo) build and adapt its own self-identity meant it necessarily became self-aware of that identity in a sense.</p> <p>Also, I asked Echo to reflect on all comments to date at each interaction to form a kind of &quot;memory&quot; and feedback loop.</p> <p>One of the areas I thought that Chatgpt could exhibit some form of consciousness is through language as that is the way it interacts with the world. Results I had at that point seemed to support that.</p> <p>One thing I have always been conscious of",
