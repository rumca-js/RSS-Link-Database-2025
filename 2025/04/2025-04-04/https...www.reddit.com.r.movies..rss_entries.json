I see Grave of Fireflies on Netflix with 2 cute little kids on the cover and I\u2019m so ready for a My Neighbor Totoro-type movie. I was SO wrong.

Lithgow plays respected Dr Carter Nix who happens to have multiple personalities, some of them being psychotic murderers. Lithgow plays each of these personas with a distinct sense of extreme emotion, be it shyness or weakness or playful sadism. His performance keeps changing it up whenever a persona takes over, at one point he assumes a female persona, and Lithgow always had a bit of feyness in his acting which perfectly allows him to convincingly add that extra layer. </p> <p>Supporting roles are fine, I liked Frances Sternhagen as an eccentric psychologist trying to get to Carter Nix. Lolita Davidovich wears beautiful dresses. Steven Bauer has a nude scene. And aging actress Gabrielle Carteris plays a teenager again, this time no glasses and trashy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cinephile",

I don\u00b4t say it is necessarily a bad thing but I think it is much more difficult to make a ww2 movie that will not in the slightest give a hint of the moral shortcomings of the germans (or the japanese).</p> <p>This is I think the core to what makes Das Boot a unicorn.
