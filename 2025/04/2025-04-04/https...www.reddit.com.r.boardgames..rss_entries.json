It was a Dungeons and Dragons themed map conquest game (think like Risk or Axis and Allies or Avalon Hill Civilizations) where it had this large fantasy map with territories that had names like &quot;Duchy of So-And-So&quot; and &quot;County of Whatnot&quot; and so on. You built soldiers that (I think) were represented by little cardboard chits that were things like orcs and fighters and rangers and such, and you moved the little chits around the map and conquered territory. The game had different scenarios you could set up, so players would start in charge of some faction and then have to conquer the other factions, but there was (I believe) a lot of different scenarios that had different starting positions and different factions and stuff.

It is a princess themed game (not Disney) that has multiple different boards/sheets and each one has a hole in it. You spin the spinner and try to be the one to land on the space that has the hole because that means you lift take that sheet/board and start the next one. I believe the last sheet/board is a castle and I specifically remember there being a purple one with unicorns. I know this is a vague description but I have no idea how to find it on Google and believe me i\u2019ve tried. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/1989emsversion\"> /u/1989emsversion </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jr50xc/what_is_this_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bo",

I was charged at the time I bought it. Now when i try to release the hold it says:</p> <p>&quot;Release Orders Issue - The $75 pricing total has not been met for release. Please add more items for release and try again.&quot;</p> <p>I can not see the the option to just pay for just the shipping, it just asks me to close window. What am I missing? There is no way I have to spend more just to release this hold, right?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/livebythem\"> /u/livebythem </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jqzg9y/gamenerdz_releasing_a_hold_do_i_have_to_spent_75/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jqzg9y/gamenerdz_releasing_a_hold_do_i_have_to_spent_75/\">[comments]</a></span>",
