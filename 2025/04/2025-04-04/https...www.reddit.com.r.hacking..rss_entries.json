To avoid paying out bounties, they can just link all future XSS vulnerabilities to the previous report indefinitely because there is no accountability.</p> <p>The same program claimed to accept subdomain takeovers. <a href=\"http://target.com/\">target.com</a> is in scope. They reject a takeover on <a href=\"http://xyz.target.com/\">xyz.target.com</a> due to scope, because it does not explicitly include any wildcards.</p> <p>I have reported other issues too, but there is always an excuse.
