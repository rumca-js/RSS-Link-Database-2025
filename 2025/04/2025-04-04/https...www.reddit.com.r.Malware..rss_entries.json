I want to see what is on the website / what is the malicious part about this website. Its http so no ssl, maybe they ask me to put in details or something but i am very interested to find out what the truth is. I have a vm running kali fresh install and its updated fully. I&#39;m using nat connection however i am running the vm on my main host as this is my only choice for device. What other suggestions do you have to ensure maximum safety while diving down this rabbit hole? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hopsypopsy_\"> /u/Hopsypopsy_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1jr3fp8/deliberately_opening_malware/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1jr3fp8/deliberately_opening_malware/\">[comments]</a></span>",
