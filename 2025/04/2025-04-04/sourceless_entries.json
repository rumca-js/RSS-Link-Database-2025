We\u2019re still focusing on upstreaming M1/M2 support but other people have been trying to bring up m1n1 on M4 and it looks like a few things changed:\n\nWhen configuring a macho boot object we now get dropped into an environment where Apple\u2019s SPTM is running in GL2 and we are supposed to talk to it from EL2 with MMU already enabled to setup pagetables. This neither works for Linux nor for running XNU under our hypervisor to reverse engineer the new hardware.\n\nWhen configuring a raw boot object we\u2019re dropped into EL2 with GL2 and most (all?) Apple specific extensions disabled. This is totally fine for Linux but we can\u2019t run XNU under our hypervisor that we use to reverse engineer the hardware in this state. This also seems to be broken for >=15.2 right now because it probably isn\u2019t very well tested \ud83d\ude15",

These inland waters \"breathe\" oxygen, just like we do. But a new study led by Utrecht University researchers shows that we've been suffocating them during the last century, an era also known as the Anthropocene. The research, published today in Science Advances, reveals that the way oxygen is produced and used in inland waters has dramatically changed since 1900. The culprit? Human activities.",
