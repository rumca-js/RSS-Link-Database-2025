A simple USB stick with two micro SD card slots and an integrated hardware trng (for example using the noise from a zener diode). During writing for each bit written a random bit is generated and that random bit is written to one card and the xor of the random bit and the actual data-bit is written to the other card, creating a one-time-pad on the fly. During reading it simply reads from both cards and xor&#39;s the bits from both cards, restoring the data. Should be pretty easy and cheap to implement and uncrackable without having access to both sd cards, no password that could be extorted, both cards indistinguishable from random noise. Another useful format would be a full-size SD card with two micro-SD cards and such an rng for use in standard cameras for professional journalists for example.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MarinatedPickachu\"> /u/Mar",
