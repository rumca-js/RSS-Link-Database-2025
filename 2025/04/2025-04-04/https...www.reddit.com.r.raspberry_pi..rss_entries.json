The Pi runs a little pure data patch that plays audio/midi. My problem is more of an electric nature; this is kind of an embedded project and the pi is supposed to be connected to a 12V PSU (meanwell; should be good); through a 12V to 5V converter. Except that when I do that I have an awful noise/ground loop style issue coming from the speakers. the PSU also powers an amp and a midi to transistors interface for solenoids. What solves the issue is powering the PI independently with a USB adapter to wall wart (which is not ideal). I bought a cheap 12V/5V converter from Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.fr/ICQUANZX-Converter-Transformer-Voltage-Regulator/dp/B07RGB2HB6?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;crid=1VELP0CU30JZL&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.z9Z-P8766rzw7OEgigPz8GtlMKdPm8ZakDlCrz-skKO-GVDVkj3sKqdyG3FjRZCg6zUSP",
