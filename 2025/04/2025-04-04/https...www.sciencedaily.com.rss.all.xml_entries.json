The method, called 'Perturb-multiome,' uses CRISPR to knock out the function of individual transcription factors across many blood cells at once. The researchers then perform single-cell analyses on each cell to measure the effects of the editing, including identifying which genes have been turned on or off and which genes are accessible (based on epigenetic markers).",

By analysing the DNA of museum specimens more than 100 years old and comparing it to modern samples, the team discovered that despite a population decline of 99 per cent, this has not been entirely mirrored by genetics. The bird has lost 9 per cent of its genetic diversity.",
