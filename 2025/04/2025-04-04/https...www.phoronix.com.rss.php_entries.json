Prior to blowing out the Microsoft Windows 11 Pro installation that shipped on the ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 and loaded with the latest AMD drivers and Windows 11 updates, I ran some graphics benchmarks for seeing how they stack up against the open-source AMD graphics drivers found on the brand new Ubuntu 25.04 release.",
