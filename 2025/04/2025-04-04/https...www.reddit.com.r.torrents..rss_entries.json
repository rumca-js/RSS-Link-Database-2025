I&#39;m using deluge version 2.1.1 so I downloaded ItConfig 2.0.0 and copied it into the deluge plugins folder I then restarted Deluge and checked ItConfig in the plugins menu and it showed up at the bottom. </p> <p>However, every time I check the left box of &quot;enable_incoming_utp&quot; in ItConfig I then cannot uncheck the right checkmark to turn it off. I&#39;ve tried restarting deluge several times, and cycling through all the presets but every time I restart Deluge ItConfig is reset back to the default profile and I&#39;m unable to change this setting. I have even checked the &quot;apply settings on startup&quot; box and nothing.</p> <p>I have also repeated everything after deleting ItConfig 2.0.0 from deluge and replacing it with ItConfig 0.3.1 and still nothing. I have no idea why I can&#39;t change any settings within the plugin",
