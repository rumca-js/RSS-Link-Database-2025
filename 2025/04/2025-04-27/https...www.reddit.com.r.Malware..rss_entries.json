However when scrolling windows defender, another trojan alert named \u201ckepalv!\u201d appeared, then dissapeared almost immediately after. I searched it up online and found literally ZERO info on it so if anyone knows anything i\u2019m curious.</p> <p>Also i clean reinstalled windows (USB) and ran a malwarebytes scan to make sure it was gone - just asking the community if i\u2019m all clear.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/andrewsuffok\"> /u/andrewsuffok </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1k8rqik/unheard_of_trojan_horse/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1k8rqik/unheard_of_trojan_horse/\">[comments]</a></span>",
