In the end I decided to buy it as 90% of the time I play the patient gamer and wait for sale so decided to go for it for once.</p> <p>So I wanted to talk about specific things in the game that have just had me hooked and super glad I bought it and didn\u2019t wait for sale.</p> <p>The story within the first hour had me hooked. It\u2019s just so unique and gripping. Normally stories take a while to engross me but I very quickly found myself looking forward to the next cutscene or story progression.
