The rules provide that u either choose the basegame missions (little hero icons) or the expansion missions (little Darth Vader icons).

It was very green and I believe a deckbuilder and likely co op. </p> <p>I&#39;m not sure if it was a kickstart or normal release unfortunately but would love if anyone had any guesses or knew what it was.
