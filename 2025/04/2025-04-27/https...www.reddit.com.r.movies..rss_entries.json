However it is then edited (reversed) to make it so the character looks up from looking down originally. </p> <p>Personally i find it very obvious but have never understood the reasoning. Is it intentional to give a surreal/irregular feel? Or is it because they didn\u2019t have the shot they needed so just sort of butchered an already existing shot to fit the narrative? </p> <p>Their eye movement and blink just its really unnatural but i\u2019v not seen any evidence or articles mentioning this besides a couple of Reddit posts asking the same thing. </p> <p>What prompted me to post this question was i noticed it on Nicholas Hoult\u2019s character in The Menu. If that helps the explanation of scene. </p> <p>I have included the shot in question, watch how his eyes flick.

Written by Andrew Kevin Walker, same guy who wrote Se7en, and you can definitely tell it\u2019s the same guy. This film, is so dark and disturbing, but at the same time, so rewatchable. I love slowly watching Nicolas Cage solve the mystery of the snuff film. All the performances are great as well, James Gandolfini is so good in this film, he was such a great actor and made even small roles memorable. I love dark thrillers and this is one of my favorites!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/These_Feed_2616\"> /u/These_Feed_2616 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k8too9/8mm_is_a_great_thriller/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k8too9/8mm_is_a_great_thriller/\">[comments]</a></span>",
