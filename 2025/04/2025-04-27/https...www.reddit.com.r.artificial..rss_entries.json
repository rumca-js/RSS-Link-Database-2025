What are this community thoughts? Seems like we&#39;re at an important crossroads. Goeffrey Hinton &amp; other AI leaders are worried that AI could soon act against the well-being of humans in sophisticated ways. How do regular people like us ensure that careful decisions about AI are being made when the players are mainly in it for money? Really recommend watching the video. I asked 2 AI apps for their analysis &amp; they echoed Hinton&#39;s warnings. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/grnam\"> /u/grnam </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.",
