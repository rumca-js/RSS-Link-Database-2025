I&#39;m trying to encourage him to get more into reading.</p> <p>I&#39;m pretty eclectic when it comes to books, but he&#39;s a bit harder to hook. Some of my favorite books are <em>Rebecca</em>, <em>The Collector</em>, and <em>The Alchemist</em>.<br/> His favorites are <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>.</p> <p>We recently read <em>1984</em> together, and I realized suspense or dystopian themes might work well for us, especially to spark good discussions afterward.

Right off the bat, the first thing I noticed was that Paulo Coelho seems like the kind of author who&#39;s perfect for beginners like me. He knows how to hook you in. Sure, there are some boring and slow parts, but he still manages to keep the connection and hold your attention.</p> <p>And so, just to give you an idea of the story \u2014 the book follows Veronika\u2019s failed suicide attempt, which lands her in an asylum full of \u201ccrazies\u201d (well, it <em>is</em> an asylum after all). I won\u2019t spoil anything, but surprisingly, it doesn\u2019t feel dark or heavy at all.

He really loved our chat and said it was mind opening to think about more and that it made him intrinsically motivated for all kinds of things in life and professional life, so I\u2019d love to kind of continue on that and give him something thought provoking to read. He doesn\u2019t read much so ideally it is engaging and not too long, but we are pursuing a sociotechnical masters so it can be somewhat intellectual. I hope this is enough to go on but please let me know if you have any questions.</p> <p>I\u2019m also not an avid reader, so I\u2019m really not sure what to give or how to find the right book.

Me being the hopeless romantic treat them how I would want to be treated and shower then with love and care, only for them to betray me in the end. This kinda is sucking the soul out of me, this is a pattern I&#39;ve seen in my life now and it&#39;s making me feel like I&#39;m a placeholder for men, an item for them to use and throw... Every men who has come to my life has only used me, and I have also realised that even I have a major flaw that i instantly get attached to them but i don&#39;t think I can take it anymore, I want book suggestion that could help me heal from all this trauma, master the art of detachment and learn to protect my inner soul...

Need some recommendations ASAP before this reading fixation fades away for another year or so. If it&#39;s worth anything I like books that are very grim and hard boiled. Ever read &quot;Low Town&quot; by Daniel Polansky? Stuff like that. Nothing romance heavy if possible. If you can&#39;t think of any good urban fantasy books, the cyberpunk genre is cool too.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Just finished the book &quot;Where the Grass is Green and the girls are pretty&quot; by Lauren Weisberger. Pretty sure this is the second book I have read by the author after reading the devil wears Prada when the movie originally came out (around 2006). </p> <p>I am looking for my next read. I am not sure if I want to try another book by Lauren Weisberger. Would anyone recommend any of her other books/ revisiting the devil wears Prada and the additional books in that series that I see now exist? Any other books that would be a similar vibe by Lauren Weisberger or other authors? </p> <p>This book got me out of a book slump, so I am hoping to find another similar book to dive into before I end up in the in-between books place for too long.
