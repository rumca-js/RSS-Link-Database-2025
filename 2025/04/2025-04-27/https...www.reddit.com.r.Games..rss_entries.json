It&#39;s a bit like Street Fighter with turn based strategy elements. I think it has a lot of potential as an accessible entry into fighting games, and it&#39;s a fun competitive game in its own right. I started developing it in 2020 after a repetitive stress injury kept me from playing fighting games at the same level I used to.</p> <p>Originally the game went into early access in 2022 with placeholder art, but the community reception from the fighting game community was so positive, I started working with an artist to add hand-drawn character sprites, which are almost finished now. We&#39;re on track to make it out of early access by the end of this year,",
