When running VR (virtual desktop), DLSS changes from DLSS4 (3.10.x?) to older version (3.7), looks ugly and performs worse than native resolution. It also changes some nvidia driver settings sometimes, like switches vsync off, removes FPS cap, etc.<br/> Can this be a driver issue (currently 576.02)? Is someone else having this? I havent found it in google, but i may be searching wrong.
