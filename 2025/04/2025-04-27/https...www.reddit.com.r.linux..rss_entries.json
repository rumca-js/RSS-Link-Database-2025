I have chosen linux mint to do the job and there is something so satisfying about using the preinstalled windows to do it. Either way, windows gets more deranged by the release and linux mint cinnamon eddition is keeping me sane as my once nice operating system declines rapidly. Anybody else have a favorite distro that serves this same role in keeping you sane? I know this is hardly relevant to what this sub reddit is about but man am I happy to have an OS that is everything windows could never be.
