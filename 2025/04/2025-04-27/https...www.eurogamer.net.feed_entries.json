Described by creative director <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard\">Todd Howard</a> as keeping the bones - the core logic - of the original 2006 game intact, it's fallen on developer Virtuos to use Unreal Engine 5 to re-work the visual layer. It's a much needed move, and the remaster gives us the works, deploying the full suite of UE5 features as a graphics renderer. Cyrodiil's lighting is transformed via its Lumen technology, allowing for an approximated form of ray traced global illumination and reflections, with dynamic shadows. Character models, materials, and effects are also reworked from scratch ",
