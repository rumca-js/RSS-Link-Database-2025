They had flaws, sure, but there was passion in them. You could feel the love for the world, the characters, and the story. Recently, though, I went browsing for something new (because let us be honest, everything on the NYT bestsellers list right now is romantasy), and I came across The Blood of Hercules.</p> <p>I have not read it yet, only the description and the reviews, but wow... are publishers just cash-grabbing at this point? A lot of the reviews say the writing is weak, the worldbuilding is paper-thin, the characters are shallow, and the plot feels recycled.

Last weekend was basically the first warm day we&#39;ve had in New England so we decided to go try it out for ourselves.</p> <p>There&#39;s a course right around where we live so we gave it a shot. There were SO many people playing on the course and one gentleman even said &quot;this is a hard course for your first time!&quot;</p> <p>It was so much fun - more than I expected it to be. I&#39;m not very athletic, but I adore hiking and being in the woods, so this was the best of both worlds for me - I would 100% do it again &lt;3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ir8k8\"> /u/ir8k8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1k8ut8i/2025_not_a_book_square_i_touched_grass_and_played/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/com",
