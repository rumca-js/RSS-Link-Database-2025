We reached 1k+ users. </p> <p>But we stopped growing and working on it as we feel we failed on monetisation model (selling points) as we need huge community in order for them to start using more and buying points. Also we created it in for our country (Serbia) but it&#39;s not ideal match as general public is not so open for new software tools in this parenting/eco space.</p> <p>So now we are unsure what to do, and we have a couple of options: - to sell to someone who will know how to grow it - partner with someone who will know how to grow it - pivot it to be money payments instead of points - change Geo market to more eco-friendly countries</p> <p>You can check it: <a href=\"http://www.razmeni.rs\">www.razmeni.rs</a></p> <p>What are your toughts?<",

Hace unos meses estoy construyendo en Django una plataforma para freelancers cuyo principal objetivo es crear presupuestos profesionales. La idea es tener varias plantillas para distintos rubros con los campos que necesitar\u00edan llenar para enviar un presupuesto en su trabajo.</p> <p>Tambi\u00e9n incorpor\u00e9 un peque\u00f1o CRM para mantener un listado de leads o de clientes, un espacio para subir nuestros productos y servicios con su precio, y el historial de presupuestos enviados a los cuales puede actualizarse el estado (Borrador, Enviado, Aceptado o Rechazado). </p> <p>Me gustar\u00eda que alguien pueda probar la plataforma y me de feedback, m\u00e1s que nada en cuanto a los dise\u00f1os de los presupuestos y sobre los campos que necesitar\u00eda cada rubro para poder irla mejorando. </p> <p>Si alguien tiene el tiempo se puede registrar en <a href=\"http://www.mipresupuesto.online\">www.mipresupuesto.online</a> y activar la prueba gratis",
