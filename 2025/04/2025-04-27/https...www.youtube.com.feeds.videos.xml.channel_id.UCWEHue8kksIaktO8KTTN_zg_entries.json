        "description": "Watching videos create a ton of data. Let's track, analyze, and own it.\n\nIn this course, we're going to integrate YouTube Video embeds into a Next.js application. Then, we're going to track and monitor every possible event from YouTube videos with FastAPI and time-series Postgres.\n\nThis type of data is called \"time series\" because it's data that occurs over time. Time series data is typically a *ton* of data since so much can happen in only a few seconds. \n\nFor example...\n\n- video loaded (cued)\n- video played \n- video paused\n- video played\n- Video progress (after N seconds)\n- video progress (after N Seconds)\n- video paused\n- video played\n\nThat's 8 events that could occur in 5 seconds. \n\nWhat about 250 users? 10,000? 100,000? \n\nAs you can see,  this amount of data can balloon very quickly for a single user -- especially if they are jump around videos often.\n\nModern video platforms and websites do this for good reason: what resonates with our users? How can we help them find more of it?",
