It\u2019s such a personal thing, and sometimes you learn about new music through these conversations too.</p> <p>For me, my favorite album is Frances the Mute by The Mars Volta. I love it because it\u2019s such a wild, chaotic, emotional journey from start to finish. The way it blends progressive rock, Latin influences, ambient sections, and pure noise is unlike anything else I\u2019ve ever heard. Every song feels like it\u2019s telling a fragmented story, and even though it\u2019s complex and challenging, it\u2019s so rewarding once you sink into it. It captures this feeling of mystery, sadness, and intensity that just hits me like no other album. No matter how many times I listen, I keep finding new little details hidden in the music. It\u2019s a masterpiece in my eyes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kingof_boxing\"> /u/Kingof_bo",

I finally sat down to watch all of interstellar for the first yesterday and holy. Never in my life has any level of music or composer resulted in the feelings I experienced from this soundtrack. Not a single word and I\u2019m in tears and feel and feel a level of almost spiritual emotion and experience. This is a clear example of how music is the universal language. It\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s frequency transcends me into conscious level of overwhelming joy and love. I am so thankful I got to live in the same lifetime as someone this great. It\u2019s hard to put into words the emotions i experience through most of his composers. Interested to hear the opinion on him from people with musical knowledge.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Agreeable-Copy-3444\"> /u/Agreeable-Copy-3444 ",

I would love to get some ideas from you guys on features you&#39;d be interested in seeing! I&#39;m going to start out with the basics for social media (home feed, profile, search etc) and eventually add in features like music and user recommendations and adding songs to your music streaming service and to show people music you&#39;ve been listening to in your profile and feed.</p> <p>In terms of cool music-related features, I have a few ideas but would love you guys to offer features you&#39;d love to see to both validate ideas I already have, or offer cool ideas I haven&#39;t thought of yet!

I like Plex because it\u2019s cool to make and customize your own music server with the best sound quality, but it\u2019s also distracting to listen to music on the same ecosystem as social media\u2026 which is why I\u2019m considering to go back to my good old iPod classic.</p> <p>Today I made a deep dive on the iPod (revival) community and, to my surprise, it\u2019s now bigger than ever. People are modding their iPods with SD cards, better batteries and even Bluetooth, so it\u2019s exciting to me to dust off my old player and give it a new life.</p> <p>Did you know any of this? Do you still use your iPod? Do you have a CD player or enjoy to listen to cassettes?
