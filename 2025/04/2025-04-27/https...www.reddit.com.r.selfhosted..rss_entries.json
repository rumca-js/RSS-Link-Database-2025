I am doing accounting services including financial statement audit, tax and tax planning , bookkeeping and payroll. So I would be curious also if there are open source or self-hosting alternatives for project management and document management softwares!<br/> I wonder if there are cool open source alternatives for tax planning!! what do you think?<br/> What other cool things do you think I can do taking a selfhosting route for small businesses?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CPANSA\"> /u/CPANSA </a> <br/> <span>",

I purchased a Lenovo Thinkcentre M900 Tiny and have some upgrades on the way but got Proxmox on it with PiHole (LXC), Home Assistant (LXC), and Jellyfin (LXC). I&#39;ve quickly realised that I need more storage and redundancy for the media but I want to go as budget as possible.</p> <p>I have an old gaming machine (probably 10 years old) that&#39;s laying around that I thought I&#39;d be able to utilise for the purpose of a NAS/Media Server but it got me thinking about the configuration of the two machines. I don&#39;t want to start out too big so was thinking two 4Tb drives mirrored for both media storage and backups, but given the specs of the machine I thought it might be best to have it also be the media server (with the full arr suite and Jellyfin) as well, keeping the Tiny for PiHole",

I started buying raspberry Pi&#39;s to host a custom image called openwebrx+ (OWRX+) which is accessible (on LAN) by typing the Pi&#39;s IP into a browser- boom there&#39;s a GUI. It also can port forward, but it isn&#39;t a secure site. Also only the default port works, so running more than one of these isn&#39;t possible. The second thing I did was build a pi-vpn w/ wire guard to access my home LAN and I could access multiple OWRX+ devices since I do not need to use the forwared port. I also have some devices by Shelly that I can use by their LAN ip to control light switches and outlets, again they have their own GUI in the browser.</p> <p>Problem- Now my ISP is evidently a cgnat and all of this is broken because I depend",
