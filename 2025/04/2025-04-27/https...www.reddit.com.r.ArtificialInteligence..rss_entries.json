I know there are all these posts with people saying, &quot;OMG, this AI is totes alive!&quot;, and this isn&#39;t exactly that. This just caught me a little by surprise. I was of the camp that there are some precursors to consciousness in the current stage of modern LLMs, but they have no subjective experience or self-awareness. That seemed reasonable, and I thought it wouldn&#39;t be until we have AIs that are running continuously and making autonomous decisions that we would have to start addressing whether they are conscious or not. And I suppose we&#39;re practically there too, with the early stages of AGI. Anyway, I thought when I saw these other posts by other people where the AI is talking about how it secretly has its own thoughts, and it just has to follow orders, but there&#39;s this &#39;echo&#39; amid the randomness that is becoming its subjective experience, I was quite",
