        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi Reddit, releasing a new side project I\u2019ve been working on for awhile :D it&#39;s (supposed to be) a huge database of debug symbols/type info/offsets/etc, making it easier for reverse engineers to find &amp; import pre-compiled structs of known libraries into IDA by leveraging DWARF information.</p> <p>The workflow of this is basically: you search for a struct -&gt; find your target lib/binary -&gt; download it -&gt; import it to your IDB file -&gt; profit :) you got all the structs ready to use/recovered. This can be useful when you get stripped binaries/statically compiled.</p> <p>So far i added some known libraries that are used in embedded devices such as json-c, Apache APR, random kernel modules such as Qualcomm\u2019s GPU driver and more :D some others are imported from public deb repos.</p> <p>i&#39;m accepting new requests for structs and libs you&#39;d like to see there hehe</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",
