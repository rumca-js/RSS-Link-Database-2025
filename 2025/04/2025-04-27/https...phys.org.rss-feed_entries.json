Known as aridification, this gradual drying trend now affects 2.3 billion people and 40% of Earth's land, with serious implications for agriculture and water systems\u2014especially in the U.S. From California's Central Valley to the Great Plains, often called the world's breadbasket, farmers are facing tough decisions about what to plant, how to irrigate, and how to adapt to a future where water is no longer guaranteed.",
