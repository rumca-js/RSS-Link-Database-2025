Some context: I have a month-old WordPress site, which almost immediately after going live started picking up some relevant search traffic. The volume of search impressions went up steadily for a week or so until one day I had a brilliant idea to supplement my original content with some aggregated articles. So I republished six posts from LinkedIn (with permission from their authors and with canonical URLs set to the original LinkedIn posts). Within a week impressions went down to zero and so did the search traffic.</p> <p>My only previous experience with republishing was for a Medium-hosted publication, so I had no idea that I was ruining my traffic. Well now I do, but even after a week ago I removed the republished articles and submitted an updated sitemap to Google, the search traffic didn&#39;t return. My question is whether it will come back",
