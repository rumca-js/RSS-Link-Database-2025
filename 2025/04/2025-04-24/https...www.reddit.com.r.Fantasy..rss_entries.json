I also love the slow burn romance between Percy and Annabeth. I wish there were more books just following them. (I have read the follow-up Heroes of Olympus series but found the final book disappointing as it didn\u2019t include their POV) . </p> <p>Can anyone recommend me any book series like Percy Jackson where the protagonist basically discovers their powers and becomes insanely powerful by the end?

I forgot about it because honestly, all of this romantasy made me hate it and stay away from it. But Cassandra, being who she is, brought me back. The issue now is that I&#39;m looking for a next read and it all looks like TikTok romantasy full of tropes and bad plot. So, help me find a good fantasy, political intrigue, expansive world, different character with good character growth, and with the romance topping everything up.
