A lot of frameworks like SOC2, ISO27001 etc are more process driven and therefore shouldn&#39;t have to require a large amount of tech downtime, but I&#39;ve been quoted 20 hours per week to ensure our tech is compliant, and the tools that I&#39;ve tested don&#39;t seem to provide insights on what needs to be changed (very high level).</p> <p>Is this actually a pain?
