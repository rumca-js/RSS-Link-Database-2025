I&#39;ve been downloading a game all day using qBittorrent with NordVPN (NordLynx) bind, and for most of the day, my download speed hovered between 200 KB/s to 2 MiB/s. However, now that it&#39;s nighttime, the speed has jumped to over 10 MiB/s and it&#39;s downloading much faster.</p> <p>This got me wondering \u2014 does staying connected to a torrent for a longer time improve your download speed, perhaps because you become a higher-ranked peer? Or am I completely off, and it&#39;s simply because fewer people are using the internet in my area late at night?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any insight!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/yourdeath01\"> /u/yourdeath01 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1k6k196/does_torrent_download_speed_improve_over_time_or/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1k6k196/does_torrent_download_",
