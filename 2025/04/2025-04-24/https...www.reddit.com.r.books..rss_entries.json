But one day Figg finds out that a new cholesterol-lowering drug causes heart attacks, and if the company that produces them is found guilty by the verdict, it will have to pay a hefty sum. Therefore, he decides to take up this case, taking with him his partner Finley and newcomer David.</p> <p>The author here makes fun of bad lawyers, which are Finley and Figg. And even though I haven&#39;t read the author&#39;s other works, it already seems to me that of the thrillers, this is his funniest (despite one rather serious subplot). It&#39;s especially funny that the people main characters work together constantly dump them.</p> <p>I also like the fact that a pharmaceutical company is being exposed in a bad light, who ha",

I think it&#39;s such a good representation of both the main character growing up, but also speaks volumes about how clearer things are in retrospect and how powerless it makes us feel to fall into that endless &#39;what if&#39; loop.
