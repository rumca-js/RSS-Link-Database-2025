        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Yes, the original version of Oblivion did not have any scruff in sight. No beards in the character creator and not a single mustache can be found in the enormous province of Cyrodiil. Adding beards to a handful of NPCs throughout the world doesn't change Oblivion's core experience. In fact, even with the facial hair and improved graphics, half of the characters I met during my adventure still looked unsettling. To some, this may be off-putting--especially when juxtaposed with the remaster's otherwise astounding visuals--but for me, Oblivion isn't Oblivion without some truly uncomfortable character models. It's all part of that \"charm\" that game director Todd Howard mentioned in the reveal stream.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The folks at Virtuous seem to understand that trademark Oblivion \"charm,\" too, because the remaster keeps the best of the Bethesda jank intact while gently reworking some of Oblivion's more dated mechanics. Purists will certainly find things to nitpick, and first-",

So it certainly seems as though The Sims 4 could theoretically be the only game you ever need. But where's the fun in that?</p><p dir=\"ltr\">One of the downsides of The Sims 4 being more than a decade old is that it's built on a foundation that isn't exactly modern--the Sims 4 launched before the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One did.
