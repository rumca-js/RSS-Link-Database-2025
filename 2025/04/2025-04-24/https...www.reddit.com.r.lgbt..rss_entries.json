        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A handful of key LGB groups (they clearly aren\u2019t actually concerned about the T) have abruptly pulled their support for Colorado HB1312, which provides several critical protections for trans youth and are seeking unspecified amendments due to fear of \u201cblowback\u201d from conservatives. The implication is that they seem to believe throwing their trans siblings under the bus will save them from conservative bigotry. If anyone has any connections to any of these groups, please encourage them to stop trying to sabotage this bill and actually stand with trans people. </p> <p>To quote Franklin: \u201cWe must, indeed, all hang together or, most assuredly, we shall all hang separately.\u201d Much of the rhetoric being used against trans people now has historically been used against gay and lesbian people, and once the fascists are done with us they\u2019ll be going for you next. No amount of respectability politics will stop them. We\u2019ve got to stand together.</p> <p>Edit for cla",
