However, those upgrades aren't free (depending on if you're a Switch Online member or not), and they're not all the same price. The Japanese edition upgrades of Kirby and the Forgotten Land and Super Mario Party Jamboree will cost $20, instead of the Zelda games' $10. And speaking of the Switch 2, did you get one? Preorders for U.S. customers went live at midnight last night, and it wasn't exactly smooth sailing for many. Let us know in the comments how you were able to snag one if you did. And finally, if you still have money to burn, you can preorder a life-size Eevee and its evolved forms.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #NintendoSwitch2",

Taking place in the lead-up to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Andor follows a cast of characters - both Rebel and Imperial - as they fight for control of the Galaxy.\n\nThe first three episodes of Andor Season 2 were filled with action, drama, heartbreak, and some of the funniest scenes of the show so far. Talking exclusively with IGN at Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, the Andor cast and creator Tony Gilroy spoke about the biggest spoilers from Episodes 1-3. This interview features Gilroy, Diego Luna (Cassian Andor), Adria Arjona (Bix Caleen), Denise Gough (Dedra Meero), Kyle Soller (Syril Karn), Genevieve O\u2019Reilly, (Mon Mothma), and Alan Tudyk (K-2SO).\n\n#IGN #StarWars #Andor",

It\u2019s easy to see the potential in everything from the grim and creepy setting, to the 2D soulslike mechanics, to the metroidvania exploration \u2013 but the actual execution of each is only skin deep, trying to juggle too many things at once and falling short for all of them. The intricate RPG systems and character classes do a lot of the heavy lifting for the otherwise subpar action, but even that can\u2019t disguise the dull and repetitive combat, with weak boss fights that serve as flaccid finales to each level. There are plenty of good ideas in the dark fantasy world of Faelduum, but none of them come together in the way I\u2019d hoped.\n\n#Gaming #MandragoraWhispersOfTheWitchTree #Games",
