This post isn\u2019t about announcing a product. It\u2019s about sharing a framework I believe solves one of the most fundamental problems in working with LLMs today:</p> <p>We rely on prompts to instruct LLMs, but we don\u2019t yet have a reliable way to architect internal behavior through those prompts alone.</p> <p>LCM attempts to address this by rethinking what a prompt is \u2014 not just a request, but a semantic module capable of instantiating logic, recursive structure, and state behavior inside the LLM. Think of it like building a modular system using language alone, where each prompt can trigger, call, or even regenerate other prompt structures.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>What LCM Tries to Solve:</p> <pre><c",

I&#39;m wondering what would consistute by the dictionary definition artificial intelligence. I saw the world shoving a square peg onto a round hole. So I asked myself what a round peg would look like. Lo and behold I aim to Mimic nature and something happens, something profoundly different. Lightweight, fast, cheaper than dirt, and capable of experiencing things in a more biologically inspired way. I&#39;m looking to link with legit research facilities preferably in university settings. For today and now though I only want to aks what you all think artificial intelligence really looks like. What do you see the path to better ai being? </p> <p>My path sees changing fundamentally how we approach even the concept of intelligence. We don&#39;t experience things in zeros and ones. We experience things over time. My goal was to emulate that as closely as I could i",
