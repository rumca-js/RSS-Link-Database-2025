        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I have been working as a Digital Marketer for a year now, but I don\u2019t have any experience in freelancing. Recently, I got a client through a friend who referred me for SEO services. The client is a resort in Chennai, India, and customers can book dates directly through their website.</p> <p>I have a meeting with the client today, and I&#39;m unsure how much I should charge for my services. Do any of you have freelancing experience? What do you think would be a fair rate? I would appreciate your advice. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_Innocent_devil\"> /u/_Innocent_devil </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1k6ifih/how_much_i_should_charge/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1k6ifih/how_much_i_should_charge/\">[comments]</a></span>",
