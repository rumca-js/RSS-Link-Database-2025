I assume that is flux or something from where someone tried to solder this battery in. Hoping to hit that with isopropyl and that it will fix it. Anything else I should try? I suppose I could try to take the battery out, fully clean the whole area, solder a new one in, etc. but that would be my first time doing that.

I have a huge request for help in finding a console or other solution to play retro games, especially from a Famicon type console. My dad is retired and can&#39;t handle the extra time. I know it will do him a lot of good to occupy his head and hands by playing those old games we played together almost 30 years ago. I&#39;ve seen and tested these HDMI emulators from China, but the quality of the controllers and how such a system works is, unfortunately, awful.
