        "description": "La Quimera is a uniquely styled sci-fi FPS. The Latin America setting is something we haven\u2019t seen much of, and the mixing of high-rises and jungle landscapes provides a unique playground to fight in. This new FPS comes courtesy of Reburn studios; a new team from Metro series developers 4A Games. \n\nThere\u2019s already been a day-long closed beta, so footage is out there for a couple of the missions. The graphics are AAA standard here, and the framerate seems stable. Players can pre-order La Quimera on Steam for only $29.99. There\u2019s no word yet if it\u2019ll come out on other consoles.",

        "description": "Among the many role-playing franchises in gaming, The Elder Scrolls commands a strong following. It's easy to forget, especially with how long Bethesda takes between releases (don't ask how long ago The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced). However, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered - hotly rumored and now finally released - showcases why.\n\nAmid the visual overhaul, with every asset remade from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 and various quality-of-life improvements (including for combat and levelling) is a timeless adventure. The exploration across Cyrodiil - it all holds up as well today as it did 19 years ago.\n\nSome aspects show their age, between the simplistic combat and dungeon design. Nevertheless, Virtuos and Bethesda have retained the essence of Oblivion and offered an incredible gateway for fans and newcomers to experience the classic.",
