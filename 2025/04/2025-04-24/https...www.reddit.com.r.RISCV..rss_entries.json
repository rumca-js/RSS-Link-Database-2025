Therefore, I intend to use a relatively small and low-power processor, and so far I&#39;ve been working with the Vicuna core. However, since it lacks an FPU (Floating Point Unit) and its vector extension is only partially implemented\u2014only supporting integer operations\u2014this significantly limits performance and makes inference quite slow.</p> <p>Do you have any suggestions for a RISC-V processor, or a microcontroller/SoC, that would be more suitable for this type of application using and FPGA? I&#39;m using an FPGA for this project due to a specific data acquisition system requirement, so the processor needs to be instantiated on the FPGA as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VSC_1922_\"> /u/VSC_1922_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",
