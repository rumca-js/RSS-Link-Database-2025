I recently came across this book while searching for one that was trending on TikTok. I didn&#39;t find the TikTok one but I found this one instead and honestly, I&#39;m not even mad about it. I&#39;m actually grateful! This book (The laws of hidden Abundance by J Collins )is all about personal finance, budgeting, selfhelp, mindset, and selfgrowth with a bit of manifestation thrown in although it says it&#39;s not about manifestation. It&#39;s supposed to be about practical stuff, which it is but I got both the practical advice and the mindset shifts. Since reading it, I&#39;ve started noticing things I wouldn&#39;t normally think twice about when making money decisions or whatever. My mindset&#39;s changed for the better, and I&#39;m starting to see some good changes in my life. I&#39;m looking for more books like this that offer practical advice a",

I&#39;ve seen several suggestions, but I&#39;m not looking for one which focuses primarily on how honorable he was (that&#39;s the word which regularly comes up in reference to Lee). I don&#39;t need to vilify him, either, but I&#39;d like something that explores his life while still raising questions about his beliefs and his choice to fight for Virginia and, ultimately, slavery. Is there anything for this age range which considers those questions?

Incest is a reality, a sad and horrible reality and literature is there to explore darkness. This is the first time i find myself shocked by a moralistic attitude. Usually I&#39;m the one that&#39;s moralistic! I write feminist fiction, so yeah, I think this is something that women deal with. I have an abusive past as well. I thought literature wasn&#39;t a place to judge like that. I&#39;m saddened and shocked. It makes me question about today&#39;s society: all the misogyny, all the homophobia, racism, transphobia, and this, a person asking for info about a real and serious topic, is gross and deleted.
