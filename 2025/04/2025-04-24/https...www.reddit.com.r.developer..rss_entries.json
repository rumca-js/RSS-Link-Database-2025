Not a single bad piece of feedback was given to me, yet they decided to give me only a 30% increment\u2014when I clearly deserved at least 60% and a SDE-2 title.</p> <p>What\u2019s worse? I\u2019m outperforming every SDE-2 in the company, and yet they still refuse to recognize that. Recently hired SDE-1s are getting paid more than me. It\u2019s insulting.</p> <p>This just proves one thing\u2014loyalty to a company means nothing when they refuse to value you. I\u2019ve put in the work, delivered consistently, and exceeded expectations, and still, this is how they treat me?</p> <p>I\u2019m now actively looking for better opportunities outside. I have 3 years of solid experience and I\u2019m done being underappreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Brilliant_Drawing_69\"",
