        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve had to boot to Windows to play both Stalker 2 and now Oblivion Remastered. Both games run at least 50% better on Windows side with my current rig which makes me infuriated. Has anyone else noticed a huge difference with this shitty UE5 games on Linux? Have you been able to do anything about this?</p> <p>I&#39;m on Fedora 42 and I&#39;ve installed Nvidia drivers with the default guide for it. I&#39;m using the open source drivers if I remember correctly. Are there proprietary Nvidia drivers for Fedora and are they measurably better when running UE5 games? All other single player games run almost better on my Linux install but UE5 is the opposite. </p> <p>I&#39;m getting so desperate that I&#39;m thinking of just building a new beefier PC so I don&#39;t have to use Windows so much. I upgraded to the Nvidia GPU from an AMD GPU about two weeks before I got my first OneDrive pop up and decided to switch to Linux (**** me). </p> <p>Specs:</p> <p>OS",
