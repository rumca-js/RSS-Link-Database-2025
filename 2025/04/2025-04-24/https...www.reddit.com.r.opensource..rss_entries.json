        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was digging around for a better way to run tests using AI in CI and I stumbled across this new open source project called <a href=\"https://github.com/autifyhq/aethr\"><strong>Aethr</strong></a>. Never heard of it before, but it\u2019s super clean and does what I\u2019ve been wanting from a test runner.</p> <p>It has its own CLI and setup that feels way more lightweight than what I\u2019ve dealt with before. Some cool stuff I noticed:</p> <ul> <li>Test are set up entirely through natural language</li> <li>Zero-config startup (just point it at your tests and go)</li> <li>Nice built-in parallelization without any extra config hell</li> <li>Designed to plug straight into CI/CD (works great with GitHub Actions so far)</li> <li>Can do some unique tests that without AI are either impossible or not worth the effort</li> <li>Heavily reduces maintenance and implementation costs</li> </ul> <p>There are of course, limitations</p> <ul> <li>Some non-deterministic behavior</li> <",
