        "description": "<p>From the European Commission\u2019s announcement today, \u201cCommission closes investigation into Apple\u2019s user choice obligations and issues preliminary findings on rules for alternative apps under the Digital Markets Act\u201d:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Under the DMA, Apple is required to allow for the distribution of\napps on its iOS operating system by means other than through the\nApple App Store. In practical terms, this means that Apple should\nallow third party app stores on iOS and apps to be downloaded to\nthe iPhone directly from the web.</p>\n\n<p>The Commission takes the preliminary view that Apple failed to\ncomply with this obligation in view of the conditions it imposes\non app (and app store) developers. Developers wanting to use\nalternative app distribution channels on iOS are disincentivised\nfrom doing so as this requires them to opt for business terms\nwhich include a new fee (Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee). Apple also\nintroduced overly strict eligibility requirements, hampering\ndevelopers\u2019",
