The naive approach might lead to some spaghetti though. Let's refactor part of the Ladybird browser's HTML parser in LibWeb using a pattern matched style in Swift 6 to demonstrate the types of transformations that are possible with pattern matching and choice types.\n---\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nAndrew Kaster\n\nAndrew Kaster is a long time open source contributor and maintainer for the SerenityOS and Ladybird Browser projects. He works full time for the Ladybird Browser Initiative.\n---\n\n\nCppCon is the annual, week-long face-to-face gathering for the entire C++ community. The conference is organized by the C++ community for the community. You will enjoy inspirational talks and a friendly atmosphere desig",
