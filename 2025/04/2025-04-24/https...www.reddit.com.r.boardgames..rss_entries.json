Do the Atmosfear I-V DVDs use a base game or are they stand-alone games with their separate board game and DVD?

The best example was Wingspan with Pok\u00e9mon that someone put an amazing amount of time and effort into. This got me thinking about reskinning some of my favourite games. The &#39;easiest&#39; and most fitting appeared to be Quest for El Dorado into &#39;Journey to the Pokemon league.&#39; </p> <p>Now, this is obviously very niche, but I&#39;m excited about it. I already have the artwork for the board, a list of Pok\u00e9mon and Items that can replace the regular cards and a bunch of rule reskins and minor changes. </p> <p>My question, does anyone besides myself find this interesting and would this be the place to share my progress? </p> <p>Ps. I&#39;m happy to share all my work for others to enjoy or collaborate with me at some point.
