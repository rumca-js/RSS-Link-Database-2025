My goal is to increase long term reliability. From what I have read the ssd will draw almost the maximum power the raspberry pi can supply though a usb port and people were recommending getting a sata to usb adapter with its own power supply. The ugreen sata to usb adapter seems to be a good option.</p> <p>I was just wondering if anyone has used a similar setup or has any recommendations. I\u2019m worried that since the adapter says it can be used without the power supply for ssd\u2019s it might confuse the adapter and keep drawing power from the pi through the usb. I\u2019m also starting to wonder if I\u2019m creating more potential problems than I am solving if the goal is long term reliability.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NuggetKid\"> /u/NuggetKid </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently got my hands on a raspberry pi 5 and two model 4Bs and am hoping to set them up in a small Kubernetes cluster on my home network. My main aim with this cluster is going to be to deploy a few light services for side-projects as well as Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter, Unbound and PiHole.</p> <p>I&#39;m a bit unsure at the moment about how I&#39;d like to bootstrap kube on them however, k3s seems like a very nice option given its ARM optimization and smaller footprint, and it seems quite easy to get the cluster up and running if the happy path is to be believed. However, I&#39;m concerned that it might be TOO easy, and I might miss out on crucial experiences setting up the cluster if I decide to go this way.</p> <p>Has anyone tried here k3s? What has your experience been?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/buffdeep\"> /u/buffdeep </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have an old acrylic top/bottom plates style case with a tiny 25mm fan that appears to be dying. I really like the passive cooling of the Flirc aluminum passively cooled case, but no NVME support internally anyways. I have a few 2280 NVME M.2 drives lying about and would like to get away from the sdcard and use one. </p> <p>Having trouble finding a solution other than the $50 Argon One M.2 case. Kinda don&#39;t like it&#39;s looks or the fact it has another fan to fail. </p> <p>Can anyone recommend a passively cooled case solution, that actually performs well like the Flirc but also has built in NVME support? Id even settle for the Flirc + a separate bottom mounted NVME expansion housing if the stack doesn&#39;t look like garbage. </p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/basement-thug\"> /u/basement-thug </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1k6gdsz/need_a_",
