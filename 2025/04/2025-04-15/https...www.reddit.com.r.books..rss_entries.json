Almost without fail, a book I am reading has some connection to the previous book I finished. The books can be completely different genres and seemingly unrelated, but there seems to be a continuous train of connections between the books. It can be a character&#39;s name, a location, an occupation, a tradition or belief, a physical or mental illness... Anything!!! For example, I read Frozen River earlier this year and there was a deaf mute in it. The next book I read also did. How often does a deaf mute turn up in a book, and for me to have it happen twice in a row?! The last book I read was The Thread Collectors (a book dealing with slavery during the Civil War) and it mentioned how the Gullahs painted walls blue to keep out evil. I&#39;m now reading a ghost story and that same blue wall/Gullah connection is in this one too. It&#39;s uncanny! ",

Plot plot plot. Is the dog gonna make it home? Will the villain fall into the lava? That kind of thing.</p> <p>But then, as I grew up (and maybe watch too many movies), you start noticing other stuff \u2014 like how a shot is framed, how long a scene holds, how an actor delivers a line. Suddenly the plot doesn\u2019t even matter that much anymore \u2014 you&#39;re just vibing with the craft. I could watch two people argue about soup for 90 minutes and call it art.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m new to reading books and I think I\u2019m still in my \u201cis the dog gonna make it home?\u201d phase. I mostly care about the plot. But I keep wondering: is there a next level to this?
