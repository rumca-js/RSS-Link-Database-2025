These subclasses offer a fresh way to play every single main class in BG3, each of them with new abilities, spells, dialogue, and animations. This gives you a chance to completely change up combat and gameplay itself, even if you've been playing the game since its launch in 2023.</p><p>However, the subclasses in BG3 aren't available right from the start of the game. You need to unlock them by progressing one or more main classes to a certain level, depending on which subclass(es) you'd like to play.
