A new journal article examines how the study of seals in particular can benefit human health, and synthesizes various research on the topic. Several aspects in the life history of seals that could provide significant insight into their reproductive physiology -- as well as that of humans -- include female seals' ability to undergo lengthy fasting and lose about 30% of their body weight while nursing a pup. Seals also have an exceptional ability to hold their breath for up to two hours in some species for long dives. Additionally, seals have the ability to 'pause' pregnancy, through a process known as embryonic diapause, so they can give birth during benign environmental conditions. In seeking ways to improve human health, we should be looking to the extraordina",
