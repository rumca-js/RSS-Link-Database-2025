Although it still has a few awkward writing moments (such as mistakenly referring to a trans character as &quot;non-binary&quot; and using her trans status as a plot point), it isn&#39;t trying as hard as it used to, and its commentary can be downright subtle. Russel T. Davies, a gay man, is the show&#39;s producer, and responsible for some of Doctor Who&#39;s best writing.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the anti-woke crowd are brigading Rotten Tomatoes and leaving terrible reviews, unfairly skewing the ratings.</p> <p>Here is a news article on the subject:</p> <p><a href=\"https://collider.com/doctor-who-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-audience-score-review-bombing/",

I was texting my friend and were were discussing gay history. We were like getting all mad that gay/trans history hasn&#39;t been taught in school and shit because it&#39;s 100x more exciting than straight shit in our opinion. After this conversation, I had an &#39;a-ha&#39; moment. I think that one of the reasons that all this transphobia is going on is because we haven&#39;t been taught a proper history of people who aren&#39;t cishet people. We&#39;ve all heard the phrase in our history class that if history isn&#39;t taught it is doomed to repeat itself. How is it any different in this case? The amount of people who have recognized that the US is in the steps to creating a genocide of &#39;different&#39; people (including LGBTQIA+ people). Anyone else have this thought? Please comment some observations y&#39;all have seen!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",

My wife and I always thought that that was strange. He does this every time we see him there. He kind of hovers around the women and you can tell they&#39;re uninterested. Since then we decided to put the brakes on going there because we&#39;ve become uncomfortable with him in general and don&#39;t want to be around him/associate with him, especially in that environment.
