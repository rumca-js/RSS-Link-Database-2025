I&#39;ve learned quick though... 2nd player seems to always lose. I&#39;ve tried reviewing what the computer does against me when I go first. I can usually win against the hardest computer when I go first, but when it does, I never win.</p> <p>It&#39;s a solved game too which means that if both players play the most optimal move, 1st player wins. Therefore, I kind of dislike the game now.</p> <p>The strategy I see is 1st player always goes 3rd pit then usually 6th pit. This forces player 2 to move their 2nd then 1st or just the 1st. From then on player 1 can continue momentum with continued landing stones in their mancala, while 2nd player has to constantly play defense.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Geilerjunge\"> /u/Geilerjunge </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.redd",

I\u2019ve only played 3 games and I definitely see the potential for good strategies to emerge. So far I really like it, but the one problem with it is if an alien dies then they\u2019re out of the game. </p> <p>This happened in the third game where an alien killed another alien on turn 9. It wasn\u2019t even because they thought the killed alien was human. They thought a different player was in the sector. </p> <p>This presented the problem that now someone had to sit and watch for the next 20 mins while the rest of the players tracked down a single human and they did not seem (justifiably) like they were having fun. </p> <p>Does anyone have a home rule to keep players of dead aliens still in the game? Maybe they randomly choose a side and can add one turn obstructions or something to the spaceship?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jambrown13977931\"> /u/jambrown",
