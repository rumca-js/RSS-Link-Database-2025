And I love Balatro as it is, not intentionally bricking a game with an anti-cheat is enough for me.</p> <p>I don&#39;t need to explain what Balatro is, but I will explain what it&#39;s composed of. Balatro is made using Love engine, SDL, luasteam and other stuff that doesn&#39;t currently matter. </p> <p>Love engine, SDL and luasteam all are available for Linux. Love engine games are also very simple to decompile... actually you don&#39;t even need to, just do <code>cat $(which love) Balatro.exe &gt; Balatro</code> and you have a native working Balatro build. Balatro using SDL also means you can just give it <code>SDL_VIDEODRIVER=wayland</code> and it&#39;ll natively work on Wayland. But what&#39;s about luasteam? Well...
