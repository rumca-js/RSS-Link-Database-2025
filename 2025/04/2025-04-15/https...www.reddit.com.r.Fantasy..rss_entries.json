I really enjoyed the folklore aspect, and I do adore folk/fairytale reimaginings in general, but I also liked the seriousness and almost moodiness of the setting and writing as well. Also currently reading Spinning Silver by Naomi Novik and really enjoying that one so far! I like the multiple POVs that feel totally separate to start but come together in really satisfying ways in both books, too.</p> <p>I\u2019ve loved moody, almost sad but not necessarily \u201cgrimdark,\u201d wintertime fantasy probably ever since I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe as a kid (and it\u2019s also one of my favourite movies of all time!).</p> <p>So yeah, would love some recommendations for moody, wintertime fantasy with some sort of folklore/fairytale aspect!</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#",
