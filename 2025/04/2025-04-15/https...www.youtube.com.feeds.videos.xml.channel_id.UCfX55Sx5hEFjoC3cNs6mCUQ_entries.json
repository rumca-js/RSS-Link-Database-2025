        "description": "Bazel's transitions are a very powerful concept that allows a rule and all its dependencies to be built with modified options such as compiler flags, build types or toolchain versions. While very useful, transitions are often regarded as complicated to use as they can only be directly attached to custom rules, not existing ones.\n\nwith_cfg is a new Starlark library that greatly reduces the amount of boilerplate required to create new rules out of old ones with an additional transition applied. Ever wanted a cc_asan_test that always runs a test with sanitizers or a java_21_library to use new language features in select parts of the codebase? After a quick introduction to transitions, this talk covers a number of such examples that all easily fit on a slide.\n\nSpeaker: Fabian Meumertzheim",

        "description": "Validation actions are a Bazel feature designed to double-check build inputs and outputs for correctness, e.g., by applying static analysis. Bazel goes to great lengths to minimize overhead for validation actions and keeping them off the critical build path by letting validations run until the very end of a build, including in parallel with tests (i.e., after the \"\"normal\"\" build has finished). In this talk we go deeply into Bazel's building blocks to review how we pulled that off over the last 5 years: from output groups, to aspects, to Bazel's build event protocol. To illustrate their benefits, we'll show details on how validation actions help run Android Lint when building Google's Android apps. We'll also discuss some best practices and ideas for further improvement of validation actions.\n\nSpeakers: Kevin Bierhoff, Alex Humesky",

        "description": "It can sometimes be helpful to see a visual representation of a Bazel build graph. The query command supports this by letting you pipe output to Graphviz. However larger graphs quickly become a tangled mess of edges that are impossible to follow.\n\nSkyscope is a new tool that aims to solve this problem. Instead of trying to render a large build graph in its entirety, only a few nodes are displayed at a time. You can click on various parts of the graph to display currently hidden nodes or hide visible ones. You can also search for nodes to display (e.g. by label or filename). This allows you to \"\"focus in\"\" on a particular area of interest, while keeping the complexity manageable.\n\nThe graphs are imported from Skyframe \u2014 Bazel's evaluation and incrementality model \u2014 so Skyscope should also be useful to people who want to understand more about how this part of Bazel works.\n\nSpeaker: Ben Radford",

        "description": "Bazel is a powerful system for automating the building and testing of software. It's specifically designed to manage large codebases. However, it must be combined with the monorepo pattern to unlock Bazel's full potential. However, managing a monorepo with Git can be quite complex. Both submodules and subtrees have many limitations. The Mega from the Web3 Infrastructure Foundation offers an open source solution. Inspired by the Google Piper paper, Mega uses a distributed database to store massive amounts of code. It also achieves compatibility with the Git protocol. When used in conjunction with Bazel, Mega can truly unlock the full potential of these tools, providing a more efficient and scalable solution for managing large code bases.\n\nSpeaker: Quanyi Ma",

        "description": "Bazel relies on multiple layers of caching to make incremental builds fast, yet correct. The most important layer is the remote cache, which allows sharing build action results across machines. Getting a high cache hit ratio can be challenging in mixed environments, where developers, build machines, and target devices use different hardware \u2013 so-called \"\"cross-platform builds\"\". Bazel's ability to switch flags through configuration transitions, while powerful and flexible, also makes caching harder. In this talk, we'll survey ongoing efforts to make Bazel's use of the remote cache more efficient. In particular, we'll cover the following common use cases:\n\n- Sharing build results between Linux build machines and Mac developer machines\n- Sharing platform-independent build artifacts, such as Java libraries, between different target platforms.\n- Preventing unnecessary rebuilds from configuration transitions.\n\nSpeakers: Greg Estren, Ara Nguyen, Tiago Quelhas, Fabian Meumertzheim",

One solution for this is to use the SLSA framework, to generate provenance for each build artifact, tying the artifact with the identity of the user building it and the (automated!) workflow used in the build process. This also enables testing that the builds are reproducible, increasing confidence that no backdoors/malware have been embedded during the build process. We will talk about a solution that would automatically add SLSA provenance to any project that builds using Bazel and GitHub Actions.\n\nSpeakers: Mihai Maruseac, Noah Elzner",

Next, we realized the bottleneck was Bazel\u2019s analysis phase. We started using Firecracker micro-VMs for our CI runs, which have a snapshotting mechanism that lets you serialize and save a running microVM. The snapshot can be later used to restore the microVM for subsequent CI runs. This lets us reuse the warm Bazel process and analysis cache from the earlier build, which can save several minutes for subsequent builds. We\u2019ve reduced the median duration of our CI runs by nearly 8x, with most runs completing in just a few seconds. Now we\u2019re continuing to improve our CI workflows by supporting remote snapshot sharing across machines. We\u2019re able to store our snapshots remotely by using userfaultfd and network block devices to capture disk and memory reads/writes. This lets us maintain these performance benefits across mac",

        "description": "Two years ago the RabbitMQ team at VMware was facing a challenge. Our CI pipeline could not keep up the rate of commits, and after we consolidated about 30 of our repositories into a monorepo, things only got worse. A single commit would take 2-3 hours to flow through the primary test suites, not including delays from flakes. We considered many options, but most of them felt like reinventing the wheel. Bazel seemed like a good solution, but a risky investment. Erlang and Elixir didn\u2019t appear to be supported languages at the time, and the usability reputation for bazel was mixed. Nevertheless, 2-3 hours waiting for a commit leaves some time to experiment. This lead to the creation of `rules_erlang`, and with combination of Bazel and BuildBuddy, the time to green for a given commit dropped dramatically, something typically around 15 minutes. We would like to share some of the highs and lows of this journey with the Bazel community.\n\nSpeaker: Rin Kuryloski",

        "description": "In recent years, Python\u2019s popularity has soared, making it a go-to language for various software projects. Simultaneously, the Bazel build tool has gained traction as a powerful and scalable build system for large-scale projects.\n\nThis lighting talk touches on the present and future states of Python integration with Bazel, exploring the challenges developers face and the solutions that lie ahead. We\u2019ll discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods for incorporating Python into Bazel workflows, and identify areas for improvement.\n\nCentral to our discussion will be Aspect Build\u2019s rules_py, an alternative approach to Python integration with Bazel. We will showcase how Aspect\u2019s rules_py differs from rules_python, highlighting the benefits it offers to developers.\n\nSpeaker: Matt Mackay",

        "description": "NeoX is a multiple-platform game engine developed by Netease. In 2022, we successfully moved to bazel to build NeoX for three target platforms: Windows, iOS, and Android\u2014all with IDE integration(Visual Studio, Xcode, and Android Studio) and remote execution. To support remote execution on the Windows and iOS platform, we also developed and open-sourced a remote worker that supports Windows and macOS host platforms. We will share how we gradually moved from a cmake-based solution to bazel, and how we set up remote execution for the Windows and the iOS platform. We will also share the tools we used to integrate bazel with IDEs. At last, we will talk about what new features we expect from bazel in the future to better support cross-platform projects like the game engines.\n\nSpeaker: Kai Zhang",
