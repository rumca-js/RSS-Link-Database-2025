I am an experienced iOS developer, but this time I wanted to implement something different (and utilize a LLM for that). But, without talking too much, let&#39;s get to it:</p> <p>I feel like this project totally bombed and I overestimated the need for such a tool. It had no traction whatsoever and apart from a few upvotes on ProductHunt, likes on LinkedIn (where I shared a video of myself going over the app&#39;s functionality), it basically got nowhere, or, to put it differently, it performed worse than my last iOS app, which I thought wasn&#39;t anything special. That leads me here to ask what do you think about it and maybe gain some insight as to how I could make it better. I am very much open to constructive criticism and would love to learn more.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",

One of my latest efforts is a step-by-step registration guide for Pin-Up, tailored specifically for users in Azerbaijan. The goal was to break down the process into clear, easy-to-follow instructions, especially for those who may be new to the platform or unsure how to claim the welcome bonuses.</p> <p>The guide walks users through different ways to sign up whether by phone, email, or social media \u2014 and includes tips on setting up a secure account. I also included insights on the user interface and the typical user experience to help people get started quickly. For those interested in the bonus system, I\u2019ve also outlined how new users can access offers like a 100% match and free spins.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the link to the guide: <a href=\"https://kazino-bet.com/pinup-qeydiyyat/\">https://kazino-bet.com/pinup-qeydiyyat/</a",
