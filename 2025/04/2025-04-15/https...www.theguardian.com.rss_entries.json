They are the artists at Mano Animation Studios, whose co-founder Usman Riaz is the director, animator and co-composer behind Pakistan\u2019s first hand-drawn animated feature.</p><p>The titular glassworker is Vincent Oliver, voiced by Teresa Gallagher as a child and Sacha Dhawan as an adult. With his father, Tomas (Art Malik), he works at the finest glass workshop in Waterfront town. But as war breaks out over the sovereignty of the Great Ravine, their treasured storefront comes under threat. Amid it all a budding romance sparks between Vincent and Alliz Amano (Anjli Mohindra), a talented violinist who turns out to be the daughter of the colonel who has turned their quaint town into a warfront.</p> <a href=\"https://www.thegu",
