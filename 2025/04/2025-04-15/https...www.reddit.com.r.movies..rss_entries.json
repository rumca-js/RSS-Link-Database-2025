Yeah, it\u2019s raunchy and has Russell Brandt in it, but it\u2019s a pretty solid story for this type of movie, it has some pretty good acting throughout, and it\u2019s got an absolutely beautiful setting (being in Hawaii) that I can\u2019t get enough of. What does everyone else think about it? It came out like 17 years ago (holy shit, I\u2019m old), so does it stand the test of time?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MythicalSplash\"> /u/MythicalSplash </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k057z8/forgetting_sarah_marshall_is_actually_a_great/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k057z8/forgetting_sarah_marshall_is_actually_a_great/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The way he stages and blocks his actors in order to pull off this technical feat is nothing short of brilliant. The movie is incredibly tense, set in a single night in a busy restaurant, and the camerawork massively contributes to this overwhelming sense of dread that lingers over every scene. Stephen Graham and Vinette Robinson are absolutely magnetic as the head chef and sous chef, Robinson especially absolutely kills it during this one scene where she delivers the most realistic frustrated monologue I think I&#39;ve ever watched (I think she flubs a couple lines but it added to the sense of realism, I often stumble over my words when angry, too). I&#39;ve seen a few films that try this same gimmick - Birdman is fantastic, Victoria is awesome, 1917 is masterful. But while those movies are technical marvels in their own rights ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This movie is so slept on. Sandler is raw in a way that\u2019s almost uncomfortable, like you\u2019re watching a real person spiral and heal in real time. It\u2019s not showy grief, but it\u2019s a sorta it\u2019s muffled grief, which hits wayyyy harder IMO. The way he talks about his wife and kids, or more often doesn\u2019t, is quietly devastating. Cheadle as well is phenomenal in this. He is always a perfect grounding force. In that scene in the courtroom where Sandler finally lets it out, feels like a cracked dam during a hurricane. Easily one of Sandler\u2019s most emotionally truthful roles, it feels like he\u2019s in the same headspace as like Uncut Gems but inverted. If that one is manic desperation then Reign Over Me is him suffering from a severe stillness in sorrow.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tennesseewhiskey-\"> /u/Tennesseewhiskey- </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jzl6c4/reign_over_me/",
