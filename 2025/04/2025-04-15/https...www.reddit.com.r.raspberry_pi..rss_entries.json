The main issue is that Pi cameras rely on a flexible ribbon cable, which isn\u2019t ideal for a moving gimbal. I know there are HDMI converters available, but they take up too much space and HDMI cables aren\u2019t flexible enough. The ideal solution would be something like the Walksnail coax cable, but unfortunately, I haven\u2019t found anything similar for the Pi. If anyone knows of such a cable or has an innovative solution, I\u2019d greatly appreciate the help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Which_Bug_8234\"> /u/Which_Bug_8234 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1k04aip/flexible_cable_for_pi_camera_on_gimbal/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1k04aip/flexible_cable_for_pi_camera_on_gimbal/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I have a touch screen that used the hdmi port and an usb port for power and touch signal. Now, all 3 devices usb sets the usb port, but the issues is in how the path is setted: the cameras have the ports, for example 0-2, but when I call them one of them is replaced by the screen, giving an error while the screen reboots as the other camera port causino again the error. Do you guys have any idea how to solve this issue? To explain it more directly if I call the camera on port 2, the screen responds instead, rebooting itself on the port 0 to per camera 2 connects.

I have it connected to a 5volt amp via a 3.5mm connection. Everything sounded great when i had the pi and amp powered separately, but I&#39;d really like to have a single cable cable. So i soldered to the gpio pins 2 (positive), and 6 (negative). Now I&#39;m suddenly getting a bunch of noise in the speaker which I&#39;m fairly certain is coming from the pi.</p> <p>Do i need to add something into the wires providing the power? Or and i just doing something stupid that will never work?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Soft_Explanation_717\"> /u/Soft_Explanation_717 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jzeodw/respeaker_sound_issue/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jzeodw/respeaker_sound_issue/\">[comments]</a>",
