(it also has a little spice in it, which I always love) so I am looking for books who are kind of like this. Meaning, I am looking for books who combine the dark sides of the world, and still encourage romance in a healthy way. (again, I don\u2019t mind if it has spice in it, actually really like books with it) OH! If one of your suggestions are something that includes maybe a fantasy world in it or something that is not really that realistic, I am totally open to suggestions! OK, that\u2019s it !

It has a mixture of everything like logic puzzles, word searches, doodle prompts, coloring pages, doodling pages, mazes, sudoku etc. You name it and it has it. I have never seen a book like this... It&#39;s also not that costly and comes in a good size. The fonts are big so it&#39;s perfect for me. The best part is its also very humorous, it has all funny cats visuals all over the book and sometimes there are humorous jokes in between that really are funny and make you wanna flip over and want to explore more of the book!!.</p> <p>You all should check it out! I think the author/designer of the book has really put her mind and creative skills in the book!! There are also some activities that my kids can do, some I can do along with my husband so that way it just makes it more perfect!!

Ove\u2019s journey through grief and eventual acceptance really resonated with me. I\u2019ve been struggling with some personal losses recently, and reading this book helped me process some of those emotions I didn\u2019t even know I was holding onto. Now, I\u2019m craving more stories that explore grief, healing, and how people rebuild themselves after loss. Not necessarily in a sad way, but more in the sense of finding hope in the midst of pain.

I also enjoyed reading The Body Keeps the Score, although it is a bit textbook-y for me. </p> <p>I tried People We Meet on Vacation, but I found the dialogue/thought processing to be cringey and unrelatable. </p> <p>Overall, I\u2019m a huge learner- I love watching documentaries, studying geography facts, etc- so any dramatized true stories or non-fiction books may be right up my alley.

If you haven\u2019t heard it, it\u2019s basically about the insecurity, jealousy, and uncertainty that comes when you realize that you\u2019ll always come second to their past lover/s and I thought a book like that would be really interesting. I also think the song \u201cback burner\u201d by the same artist would also make for a good book comparison.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hefty_Acanthisitta77\"> /u/Hefty_Acanthisitta77 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jzit6t/a_book_comparing_you_to_your_partners_ex_a_book/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jzit6t/a_book_comparing_you_to_your_partners_ex_a_book/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I love Hunter S.Thompson and Cormack McCarthy (recently read Blood Meridian) and Chuck Palahniuk. I want sex and violence and scathing social commentary. I want death and suffering and the tragedy of endless human misery. I want blood and piss and the beauty and horror of existence. I want fiction with a deep and profound philosophical underpinning like Dostoyevsky and Ayn Rand (finally got around to reading Atlas Shrugged a month or so ago). My favourite book is Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Please give me some authors or books to check out.

Because I&#39;ve been working on my own dystopian book for 2-3 years, I thought I&#39;d look into other dystopian books in order to try to &quot;learn&quot; the genre a bit more. I&#39;m not very much into the Hunger Games just for the author&#39;s style, but someone recommended &quot;How High We Go In The Dark.&quot; Wow. It&#39;s by far one of the most disturbing things I&#39;ve encountered so far. What are some of your favorite books in this genre?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Big_Ad7221\"> /u/Big_Ad7221 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jzerfa/dystopian_recommendations/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jzerfa/dystopian_recommendations/\"",

I&#39;m leaving my hometown where everyone I grew up with knows that I&#39;m that way i am. they&#39;re never offended by my actions but I don&#39;t want to be alone in college. I&#39;ve been trying to read some books on social norms like how to win friends and Influence People which was recommended by a psychiatrist but nonfiction isn&#39;t really something I&#39;m good at reading. I was hoping that maybe there&#39;d be something Illustrated because I tend to enjoy books more with illustrations in them I. don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a term for nonfiction books at illustration I just like them thank you in advance and if this doesn&#39;t exist if you have any Goodreads or at least fun or not hard to understand I&#39;d appreciate it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",
