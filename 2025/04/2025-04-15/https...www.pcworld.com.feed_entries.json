Desktop PCs were basically founded upon this principle, allowing PC makers and consumers alike to slide out hard drives and optical drives, or unscrew and replace SSDs in M.2 slots in today\u2019s PCs.

It\u2019s just about impossible to beat for the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s one fly in this ointment, though. The laptop is refurbished and it\u2019s being sold by a third-party seller on eBay. They\u2019re including a two-year Allstate warranty, which is nice, but such warranties can sometimes be a bit of a hassle to actually use when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That foible aside, I really can\u2019t overstate how good of a deal this is if you\u2019re looking for a super-cheap laptop that can handle Windows 11 smoothly.

Today, Nvidia unveiled not one, not two, but <em>three</em> new GeForce RTX 5060-series GPUs, starting at $299.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That $299 offering, the vanilla 8GB GeForce RTX 5060, won\u2019t hit the streets until sometime in May. But the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti arrives tomorrow, April 16, with your choice of memory configurations: 8GB for $379 or 16GB for $429.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the RTX 5060 Ti has graphical prowess to play at 1440p in many titles, these GPUs will probably be better suited for 1080p gaming given their tiny 128-bit bus and mere 8GB of GDDR7 memory in all but the tippity-top offering. Check out the specs below.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"uploadedSrc\":false,\"figureClassNa",

It has enough memory to support Windows 11 without stuttering or choking, which is surprising for the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, it offers a solid",
