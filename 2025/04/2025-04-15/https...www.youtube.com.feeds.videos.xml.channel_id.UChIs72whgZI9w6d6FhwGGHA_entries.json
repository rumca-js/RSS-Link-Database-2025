        "description": "Sponsor: Montech HyperFlow 360 Cooler on Amazon https://geni.us/dWBIbF6\nNVIDIA today announced the price (MSRP), specs, and release date of its RTX 5060 Ti and RTX 5060 GPUs. These include the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB and RTX 5060 Ti 8GB models, both of which have a release date of April 16, and the RTX 5060 with its release date in May. Pricing is tricky since it's all nebulous with the ongoing tariffs situation changing daily and the usual GPU supply screwery in the background, so part of this video is dedicated to talking about those challenges in the review process. Reviews for the RTX 5060 Ti will likely coincide with its release date.\n\nGrab the new PAPER LAUNCH shirt in 100% cotton here! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/paper-launch-cotton\nGrab the new PAPER LAUNCH shirt in Tri-Blend here! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/paper-launch-triblend\n\nLike our content?
