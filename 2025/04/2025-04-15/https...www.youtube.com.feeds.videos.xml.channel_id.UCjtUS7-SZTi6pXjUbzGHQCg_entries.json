It not only promises higher efficiency, but solves a critical problem with the status quo\u2026yes, a critical problem that plagues even my beloved heat pumps. The thing is, we need an alternative to refrigerants. Caloric cooling is one alternative, and one U.S. research team claims that magnetocalorics in particular are already on their way to replacing our current coolants with systems that are much more attractive. But how do you control the temperature with a solid material rather than a refrigerant gas? What makes magnetocalorics stand out? And is this cooling tech solid enough to redefine what it means to be a \u201cfridge magnet\u201d? \n\nWatch Why the Biggest Battery Company is Betting Against Lithium https://yout",
