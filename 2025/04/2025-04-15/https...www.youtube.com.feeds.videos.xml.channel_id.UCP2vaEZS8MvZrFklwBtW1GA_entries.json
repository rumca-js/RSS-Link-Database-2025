I\u2019m wearing an @ironclad_gloves 3/4 palm coated glove to grip my grinder and keep it steady. My left hand has a high cut-resistant glove that protects it from sharp objects. I highly recommend both gloves for work like this. Many thanks to Ironclad for partnering with me and making great products that protect people \ud83d\udd25#ppe #tilework #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
