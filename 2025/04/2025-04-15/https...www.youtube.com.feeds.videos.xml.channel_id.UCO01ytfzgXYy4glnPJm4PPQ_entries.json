        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, some of us have been arguing for years that ADHD is a fake disease. We\u2019ve been shouted down and defamed as science deniers. But now the so-called experts who sold this fraud to the public are coming out and admitting that we were right all along. We\u2019ll discuss. Also, the president of El Salvador visits the White House, Cory Booker embarrasses himself on camera again, and the media celebrates the \u201chistoric\u201d space flight of an all-female crew. The only problem is that it wasn\u2019t historic at all.\n\nEp.1576\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=167se17RNHw\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo7g6G4wIqQ\n\nhttps://x.com/CollinRugg/status/1911815047225217280 \n\nhttps://x.com/siegfriedmuell/status/1911811117460148347?s=46\n\nhttps://x.com/senbooker/status/1911407368065200325?s=46\n\nhttps://x.com/PopBase/status/1911811994061005266\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/DIbVpktpwZm/\n\nhttps://x.com/BreitbartNews/status/1911800610669601102\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hm108LC",
