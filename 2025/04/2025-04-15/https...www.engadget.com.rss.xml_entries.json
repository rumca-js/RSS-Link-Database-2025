All editions ship with both games, but the highlight is something called the <em>Will it Run Edition</em>. This one comes with all kinds of extra goodies, including a game box that actually runs the original <em>Doom</em>. You read that right. Box play <em>Doom</em>. All you have to do is connect a USB controller, as the box also has a port.</p>\n<p>It costs $666, which is a nod to the devilish source material, and is being kept to a limited run of 666 copies. It comes with the aforementioned screen-enabled game box that runs <em>Doom</em>, but that\u2019s just the beginning. The combo pack ships with the soundtrack on cassette, a certificate of authenticity and a trading card park with five cards.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-con",
