I will explain:</p> <p>This is my setup: I run a bunch of services on a mini pc, a Rpi &amp; some in WSL on my main PC. Every device has tailscale installed and tailscale is using a pihole instance for DNS. I used pihole to setup local DNS, just to access everything easier without using IPs. Obviously, I still have the issue of getting warnings when it comes to services using https. NOTHING is exposed online, I use tailscale/pihole for everything. Mostly because I can&#39;t port forward given that I don&#39;t have access to the router.</p> <p>So I want to use SSL certs on my internal services, my questions/concerns are:</p> <ol> <li><p>I have a domain name but does it need to match the local DNS I have already assigned? e.g. my domain is &quot;example.com&quot;, so I would get a letsencrypt cert for *.example.com, if then my internal services are on *.pi.local internally how does that",

I like the look and feel of it a lot more, but I wanted to know the best way to do a reverse proxy and use a vpn on the same computer at the same time. I&#39;ve heard tailscale would be able to achieve this but I was also told that the user would need to use the tailscale app and that would be pretty difficult for my user-base. I want this to be usable by octogenarians, so preferably hosted at my own domain. Is there a way to set this up from my single computer, or do I need to always run an old laptop or get a raspberry pi? </p> <p>Any advice would be appreciated, thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMonsterMensch\"> /u/TheMonsterMensch </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1k0076u/beginner_self_hoster/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/c",

Now this isn&#39;t my first rodeo of hosting things on the Internet, so I knew that there&#39;d be random people and bots trying to access my stuff with some low-effort scans. But so far it&#39;s mostly a ton of random IP addresses from Cloudflare&#39;s IPv6 range (2400:cb00::) trying to access &quot;setup-config.php&quot; at various Wordpress-related paths every few minutes.</p> <p>Now, I neither run a Wordpress server nor do I have this domain set up with Cloudflare in any capacity. What is this traffic, and is it safe to just reject anything from Cloudflare&#39;s prefix, or will I break something?

I currently have my Synology NAS (SHR) backing up to another NAS on-site (SHR) with Hyperbackup but would like an offsite solution. Most of the data is &#39;archival&#39; so if my house burned down or my whole rack was stolen, I could deal with being without my data for a reasonable amount of time (even a week would be fine). Ideally I would like to have one encrypted hyperbackup of my NAS that gets sent offsite and syned on a regular basis (every couple days) but as I mentioned accessing that backup is not important to me. I would like to have a solution where the backup can be automated with Synology and not a manual process.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spurcap29\"> /u/spurcap29 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jzvmpf/best_option_for_offsite_backup/\">[link]</a></span> &#3",
