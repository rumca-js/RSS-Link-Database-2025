I&#39;m looking for a reliable solution to back up multiple smaller hard drives onto one large one. Basically I have about 12 WD 2TB hard drives loaded with various files. Videos, music, photos, etc. The device I use to read off the 2TB drives is limited to that size, no larger. Some of these drives have been in use for 12 years. I keep them on a shelf in a case.

I&#39;m starting to worry about not having any of these backed up. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking at getting one or two larger 12TB drives to back up all the smaller drives.

The Seagate is 5400 rpm and wd is 5640 rpm, so on the lower end. My question is, will it be loud enough to hear on my PC? My case fans are running around 900-1000 rpm and CPU fan is running 600-700 rpm, so it&#39;s pretty quiet. </p> <p>I&#39;ve looked up videos testing sounds but it seems a lot louder than it would be in real life. The videos are also testing the drive directly, but if my HDD is in my case, it could muffle the sound. Also Would it be noticeably louder if I got a 7200 rpm drive instead? Is the extra speed worth the price despite being hotter and louder?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VYDEOS\"> /u/VYDEOS </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1jzn0u1/how_loud_is_a_35_inch_hard_drive/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comment",
