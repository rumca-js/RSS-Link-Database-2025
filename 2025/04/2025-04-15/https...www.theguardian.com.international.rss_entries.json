        "description": "<p>The challenging 870-mile trail cuts diagonally across Romania and takes in mountain meadows, fairytale forests and medieval monasteries</p><p>It was about seven minutes into my cycle ride that the first signs of addiction became apparent. My ebike\u2019s \u201cpower assist\u201d button felt more like a morphine clicker as we climbed the misty hills of Bucovina in northern Romania. Sergiu, my group\u2019s guide, knew what I was up to. \u201cBe honest with yourself \u2013 only use \u2018turbo\u2019 if you have to!\u201d he shouted. My thumb cowered under the handlebar.</p><p>On previous adventures I\u2019ve resisted assistance, maintaining that battery power is the preserve of the unserious. Nowadays, though, my pins aren\u2019t as powerful, and on these vertiginous hills the extra oomph was near essential. But as with all drugs, moderation is key. After all, one wouldn\u2019t want to run out of juice on hills that are home to wolves, bears and lynx.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/apr/15/a-muddy-ride-into-romanias-dreamy",
