I haven&#39;t done a lot of research on the use of LLVM&#39;s for reverse engineering and this seemed really interesting to me to delve into.</p> <p>I searched for similar tools/frameworks/plugins but did not find many, so I thought I ask here if you guys have any recommendations on the matter. Even books/online courses that could give any insight related to using LLVMs for revegineering malware samples would be great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nameless_Wanderer01\"> /u/Nameless_Wanderer01 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1jzxhqb/llvm_and_ai_pluginstools_for_malware_ana",
