Then she goes in for the kill with all the breezy confidence of a kid playing a video game on easy.</p><p>It\u2019s a rare moment of playfulness in the second-season opener of The Last of Us, a show that generally takes its storytelling deadly seriously. While the wildly lucrative Minecraft movie strip-mines its IP for laughs, this celebrated HBO series, adapted from the PlayStation titles of the same name, is as focused on taut character drama as the thrills and spills of the zombie genre.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/14/dont-you-besmirch-super-mario-bros-how-video-game-adaptations-became-prestige-",

Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey\u2019s hit mushroom zombie drama is back for a second season. It starts with a flashback scene, signalling major trouble ahead, but, in the present, Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey) have been settled in a thriving community in Wyoming for the past five years. Joel\u2019s most pressing problem now is that he feels emotionally estranged from 19-year-old Ellie (Ramsey) \u2013 who hasn\u2019t told anyone about her immunity to the virus. Catherine O\u2019Hara and Kaitlyn Dever are top additions to the cast, and though the opener begins slowly, it inevitably has an action-packed payoff involving Clickers \u2013 with the threat of new types of monsters to come. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radi",

That dissonance persists, and is even more jarring as we approach the 100th day of Donald Trump\u2019s second term.
