        "description": "In 2000, the original X-Men movie redefined superhero films, proving comic book adaptations could be more than just campy action flicks. Then, with the success of the first two X-Men films, and the introduction of Christopher Nolan's Batman, the world started to take notice of superhero movies and comic book adaptations.  But then came X-Men: The Last Stand\u2026 and it almost destroyed the entire franchise.\n\n\ud83d\udcac What do you think\u2014did The Last Stand deserve all the hate?
