Even doing a factory reset on my headset and testing with another PC resulted in the same issue: wired link is broken even though the meta desktop software can see the headset plugged in and USB test is good. So I spent some time getting Virtual Desktop working over a wired USB connection. I hope this helps other people extend the life out of their headsets once the manufacturer kills support or breaks features:</p> <p>Here&#39;s my V0.6 writeup to get reverse tether (gnirehtet = tethering in reverse). Dated 4/10/25:</p> <p>This is to use Virtual Desktop paid app over wired USB connection instead of only on wireless. This is a workaround for the Meta Link functionality breaking on Meta products. This should work on all Meta products that can connect to Virtual Desktop wirelessly. May work on Valve Index, HTC products, Windows Mixed Reality, and Pico products. More tes",

I was sort-of aware that Meta&#39;s software stack on PC sucked but I didn&#39;t really know to what extent it sucked until trying it out myself. </p> <p>For some context, I mostly play sim games like sim racing or flight simming. First off, I was annoyed that ASW is forced on unless you press a key or used the Oculus debug tool; not really a huge deal, but it is questionable to me why this kind of feature couldn&#39;t just be in the Quest Link application. ASW was causing some ugly distortions and warping in certain games.

There are some periods where i find a game i really like but then i get bored of all games and have to stop (recently i played 60h of kcd2 and didn&#39;t finish it, at one point i simply lost all interest). So right now I&#39;m in that period where i get bored of every single game.</p> <p>So my question is: is VR so good that you don&#39;t get as bored as with normal games? Cause I don&#39;t wanna risk buying the headset and leaving it on the shelf after a month...

I was hoping this time around to play PCVR wirelessly with a quest 3 (via Steamlink), and have been looking into it online but just wanted to see if y&#39;all think it will work. Currently my computer is a Lenovo Legion 5 pro laptop; i7-13700HX, RTX 4070, 32.0 GB RAM. I was planning on getting the Puppis s1 to facilitate wireless, and was curious how well I could expect to run games (mainly planning on Blade &amp; Sorcery and H3VR). I also was curious how well the Puppis would work since I plan to be using it at college while on a college wifi, and I&#39;ve heard that lots of users/devices on a single wifi can mess with it (and if so any alternatives). Any input would be appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AwesomeAce16O4\"> /u/AwesomeAce16O4 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jyo73t/que",
