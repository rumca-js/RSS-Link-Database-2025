Their search pages have the RSS buttons, I copy the links from them, but so far only one link out of like all 10 I tried actually worked. I tried in Calibre with it&#39;s news reader and in RSSOwl.</p> <p><a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/tags/136512/feed.atom\">https://archiveofourown.org/tags/136512/feed.atom</a> for example, or <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/atom/l/?&amp;cid1=2080&amp;r=10&amp;s=2\">https://www.fanfiction.net/atom/l/?&amp;cid1=2080&amp;r=10&amp;s=2</a> . First one game me 525, the second 403 errors. But I can obviously visit the websites, and they have the RSS, so I just don&#39;t understand what could be the reason. Please can someone help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bubbla_\"> /u/bubbla_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1jyqofj/new_to_rss_but_k",
