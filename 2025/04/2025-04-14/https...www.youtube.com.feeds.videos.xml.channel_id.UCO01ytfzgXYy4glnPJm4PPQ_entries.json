        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Netflix recently released a miniseries called \u201cAdolescence,\u201d which is supposed to expose the problem of toxic masculinity and male rage. The show is fictional and completely far-fetched, but the British government and media are treating it like a documentary. We\u2019ll discuss. Also, sports commentator Stephen A. Smith says that he's considering running for president, and a CNN correspondent shares a hearty laugh with Taylor Lorenz as they fawn over accused murderer Luigi Mangione.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:26 Opening\n02:12 - 26:08 Matt Walsh Breaks Down The Deceptive Propaganda In \u2018Adolescence\u2019 Netflix Show\n27:13 - 37:17 Stephen A.
