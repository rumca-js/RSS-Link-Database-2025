        "description": "Drake & Josh have had a very complicated roller coaster relationship over the years. At one point they were best friends, even called themselves brothers. Then they became distant as tension grew between them. At one point they had an explosive public falling out that lead to Josh claiming that he and Drake were never friends at all. For years the fans have wondered exactly what went wrong? Why their relationship soured? And recently they came together and discussed everything on a 2 hour podcast that connected all the missing pieces that we were left in the dark about for decades. \n\n\u2714\ufe0f Social Medias \u2714\ufe0f\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/patrickcctv\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@patrickcctv?lang=en\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/patrickcctv\n\n0:00 The Perfect Pair\n3:33 The Monster on Set\n9:21 Josh's Childhood\n11:35 Drake & Josh Show  \n17:15 Life After Nick\n24:00 The Wedding\n28:19 Mixed Signals\n30:03 Reboot\n32:22 Drakes Crimes\n44:02 Never Friends\n45:46 Downward Spiral\n48:15 Drake ",
