I tried using ACSaveTool and even playing the blank save for about 30 minutes to see if it would save that, but it still gets overwritten. I\u2019ve tried using Dodi and ElAmigos repacks and have the same issue. At this point I feel like there\u2019s something I\u2019m obviously doing wrong, so any help is greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Reasonable-Spite8396\"> /u/Reasonable-Spite8396 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1jyqrjs/ac3_remastered_save_transfer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1jyqrjs/ac3_remastered_save_transfer/\">[comments]</a></span>",
