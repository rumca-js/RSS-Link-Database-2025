Yes, you can play it on PS4 or Xbox One with varying levels of effectiveness, but it scales up to challenge even the most powerful PC hardware of the era, up to and including the mighty RTX 5090 - which makes its debut on <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced\">Switch 2</a> absolutely fascinating. We've known it was coming for some time and it was great to see it feature (albeit somewhat briefly) in Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct, but now we've been hands-on. It's early days for the port, the version we played is already seven weeks ",
