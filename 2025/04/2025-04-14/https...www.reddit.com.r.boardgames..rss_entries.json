Bargain Bait: A high-end table for $419 with a $20,000 goal was absurdly low for furniture and shipping. It hooked backers with impossible promises. 2.

I personally love the game, being a cycling fan, but most people that I play with don&#39;t enjoy it much, because there is always the feeling that, no mather how you play it, chances are that your riders will finish within the peloton and mostly what matters is your riders&#39; position in the startline and the draw you get in the last turn before the finish line. Everything in between is mostly card management, with no big influence in result. If you&#39;re experienced, you might have the sensibility on where to attack, but even then the draw of 4 may trick you when you need that big number to finish. I even tried to do some grand tour (the ones available online, not in the actual expansion), but could get a group to do more than 2 races. Then, there would be the complain that a breakaway for victory didn&#39;t pay off much in terms of time gained to the rest of the peloton. </p> <p>I&#39;",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi. I just recently purchased a lot of board games and miniatures. Among the lot was the Dark Souls original board game set along with the character set expansion, as well as the Tomb of Giants expansion. The main set was missing a few miniatures, so i purchased a miniatures lot to replace them. Included with the miniatures lot is a Black Dragon Kalameet. I would like to use it in my game, but it doesn&#39;t include any of the cards. I&#39;ve tried to find a resource online to get scans or downloads, but all I&#39;ve been able to find is the rulebook. Does anyone know where I might could get them?
