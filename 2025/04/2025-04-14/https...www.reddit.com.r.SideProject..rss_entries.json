A few months ago, I noticed something weird \u2013 all these local businesses I interacted with never had any reviews online. Like, I&#39;d have an awesome experience somewhere, but when I checked their Google reviews? Crickets.</p> <p>Turns out, most people (including me!) just don&#39;t leave reviews unless someone asks. But when businesses ask directly, it feels... awkward? Like that server who hands you a receipt with &quot;PLEASE REVIEW US&quot; in huge letters.</p> <p>So I thought \u2013 what if there was a way to ask that wasn&#39;t so in-your-face? Something that would:</p> <ol> <li>Only bother happy customers</li> <li>Make it stupid simple to leave a review</li> <li>Not annoy people who had a bad experience</li> </ol> <p>After way too much overthinking, Happyloop was born. It&#39;s just a tiny widget that pops up after someone uses a site, asks for quick feedback, and only begs for public reviews if they&#39;re actually happy.</p> <p>",

Instead of just solving problems solo, the AI acts like a real interviewer: it asks you questions, listens as you explain your solution, and then gives you a score based on FAANG interview rubrics.</p> <p>It&#39;s designed to help with the real interview experience \u2014 not just getting the right answer, but how you communicate, problem-solve under pressure, and explain your thinking.</p> <p>Would love if anyone gave it a shot \u2014 we\u2019re just trying to learn how people actually use it and what we could improve. Feedback, bug reports, ideas \u2014 all welcome!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Introduction9485\"> /u/Ill_Introduction9485 </a> <br/> <span><a hr",

It&#39;s pretty simple since this was my first time deploying a website.</p> <p>Essentially you upload a zip file containing a project that is being managed by git and the website will direct you to another page that displays the entire git commit history. Then you can directly edit the meta data for every commit including the author, time, and message. Once done with editing, you press on the send request button to receive a zip file containing a copy of your project with the incorporated git commit changes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Logical_Ad4811\"> /u/Logical_Ad4811 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1jylylo/my_first_side_project_allows_you_to_edit_git/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments",
