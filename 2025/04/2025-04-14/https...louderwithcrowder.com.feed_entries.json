Keep in mind that when she isn't making Instagram videos, Rep. AOC has a side hustle in Congress. She is also on tour with Bernie Sanders, performing at rallies in cities that voted overwhelmingly for Kamala Harris, yet that billionaire-funded NGOs can only organize a fraction of to show up and call it a flex. In AOC and the NGOs' defense, however, they know that if they lie, they can count on most in the media to swear by it.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">AO",

This past weekend provided us with a perfect contrast of the two styles. In the red corner, we had Donald Trump showing up at a UFC event. In the blue corner, Bernie Sanders wandered on stage during the middle of Coachella. On a related note, <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/cnn-trump-cares-more-poll\" target=\"_blank\">Trump is over bigly with the American people</a> while Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/schumer-taxes-government\" target=\"_blank\">never been less popular or more culturally irrelevant</a>.</p><p>Let's start with Trump. It's a familiar scene. He walks out. The crowd erupts in \"USA\" chants. He shakes hands with people. America is made great again. Bros proclaim \"we are so f*cking back\" on Twitter.</p><",
