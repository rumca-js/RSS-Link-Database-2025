The issue with this is we don&#39;t have any governance, visibility or protection on those virtual environments, as they lack EDR, SWG, SIEM agent, etc. I have some ideas regarding virtual machines running on virtual box or users with WSL, but with devs running local docker instances I&#39;m not so sure about what&#39;s the right way to handle it. Security-wise, the easy thing would be not to allow them to run docker locally and just force to use dev environment, but it&#39;s obvious that the business would not agree on that, it would slow down delivery times and make devs day-to-day job more difficult in comparison to current situation.<br/> I want to know how are you taking care of this risk on your orgs, and if you found that holly sweet spot which security and business can be comfortable with. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",

The second method doesn\u2019t properly validate the username.

Like what use cases one technology can&#39;t do without the other.</p> <p>My understanding is that with a VPN you become part of the network and can use your machine/client as if you were inside that network. With SSH, the main concept is a single &quot;host to host&quot; connection, but the confusion is that you can use that host connection to also have interaction with the network that host is on and its resources.</p> <p>Albeit, everything will be limited to that host, you can still send resources from your computer to the host and then to other hosts on that private network, this seem like applying the concept of remote private network connection. Sure it&#39;s quite impractical than having your own machine being part of the network, though it doesn&#39;t seem to me that SSH can&#39;t be used to achieve the same thing.</p> <p>Oh also, SSH ha",

That episode hooked me. At the time, I was working in a completely different industry but decided to pivot into tech. It ended up taking me almost two years to land my first entry-level IT role with zero experience, but I stuck with it because I was genuinely interested.</p> <p>Part of that interest probably came from my dad, he&#39;s been in IT my whole life. Funny enough, when I was younger, I wanted nothing to do with what my parents did, so I went a completely different route. Just classic youthful rebellion. Honestly, I regret not following his lead a lot sooner.</p> <p>Something I\u2019ve noticed lately: this subreddit has over 1.2 million members, which is insane.
