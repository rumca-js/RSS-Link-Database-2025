I feel very alone sometimes because I feel like I reside in the gray areas and have never met/heard of someone who feels and operates the way I do. Not sure if there are others like me but ever since I was a kid, I liked wearing women\u2019s clothing. Skirts/dresses, different types of tops, leggings (comfy!) etc. I always thought all the patterns, colors, cuts, and materials of women\u2019s clothing was so cool\u2026 not to mention getting to leave the house without pants on (hello cute dresses). </p> <p>The problem is, I don\u2019t want to wear that clothing to present as a woman, or try to look like a woman. I\u2019m a cis-gendered straight male, I just want to be able to explore my self expression.
