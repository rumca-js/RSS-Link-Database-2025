And even if i got some sleep,i saw certain clips from the movie in my dreams and woke up really scared. This has to be the best ghost, scary movie ever because i hate the &quot;scary&quot; movies like annabell or it. Its always the same stuff. A haunted house and a family moves in. But grave encounters was totally something else. I suggest it for everyone. Even the back story about the hospital is creepy and peoples experiences with the building. And i heavilyyy! Suggest to watch it in the dark at night. After seeing the movie im never gonna step a foot into any abandoned hospitals ever!!

The way it blends sci-fi with emotion, time, and language is seriously underrated. Denis Villeneuve really doesn\u2019t miss.</p> <p>Amy Adams deserved way more awards recognition for this\u2014her performance was incredible. Also, the soundtrack??
