One thing I like about the books is how there are several different and unique characters and in different books there is a different cast, which alternates and changes which character is important in each book. </p> <p>About the characters in the books, the Cowardly Lion is the least important of the original cast in the series, he has importance in very few books and barely appears (and then he always appears alongside his partner the Hungry Tiger), and Dorothy is not only an innocent girl but she is very curious and is not afraid of almost anything, in fact she is having a lot of fun in her various adventures, like for example in &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot; she se",
