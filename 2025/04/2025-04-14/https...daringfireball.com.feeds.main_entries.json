        "description": "<p>Coffee has always been about bringing people together. For us, it started with a simple question over a late-night cup of decaf: why do coffee lovers who skip the caffeine have to skip the craft too?</p>\n\n<p>At Dek\u00e1f, we believe those who drink coffee purely for its flavor are the true connoisseurs. While other roasters treat decaf as a side project, we\u2019ve made it our entire mission. We\u2019re dedicated to creating exceptional decaffeinated coffee that stands toe-to-toe with the world\u2019s finest caffeinated beans.</p>\n\n<p>9 single origins. 6 signature blends. You won\u2019t believe it\u2019s decaf. That\u2019s the point.</p>\n\n<p>30% off with code: DF</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Dek\u00e1f Coffee Roasters\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/04/dekaf_coffee_roasters\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
