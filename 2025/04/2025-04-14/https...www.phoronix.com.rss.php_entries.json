The testing showed the AMD RDNA 3.5 graphics on the open-source Linux driver up to around 96% the performance of Radeon Software on Windows. The most frequent question that came up from that most recent round of benchmarking was wondering how the Intel Xe2 graphics on Core Ultra Series 2 \"Lunar Lake\" now compares between Windows 11 and Linux given that both drivers have been maturing the past several months. Here's the story of the Xe2 graphics between Windows 11 and Ubuntu 25.04 while using a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 13 Aura Edition laptop.",
