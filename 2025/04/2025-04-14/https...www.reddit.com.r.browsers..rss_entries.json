Here\u2019s why:</p> <h1>1. Built-in VPN for Privacy</h1> <p>Opera has a free, built-in VPN that gives you an extra layer of privacy without the need to install additional extensions. Whether you\u2019re browsing on public Wi-Fi or just want to keep your online activity secure, this feature alone makes it stand out from other browsers.</p> <h1>2. Battery Saving Mode</h1> <p>If you\u2019re on a laptop or tablet, you know how draining browsing can be. Opera\u2019s battery-saving mode reduces the power consumption of your browser, allowing you to browse longer without charging. This is a game-changer for anyone who\u2019s on the go or using their device for long hours.</p> <h1>3.
