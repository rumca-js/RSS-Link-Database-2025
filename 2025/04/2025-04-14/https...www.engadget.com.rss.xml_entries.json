And copious hours sitting at a desk have not done favors for my already wonky neck and shoulders. If you also feel some discomfort from typing and mousing the day away, you might want to invest in an ergonomic keyboard. The first time I tried a fully split, thumb cluster board, I knew I had found the answer to my particular problem. But it was tricky to figure out how to type on it. Other unibody boards with angled keys, such as Alice style keyboards, might make things more comfortable for you without requiring much relearning.<br>I tried out more than 15 models of ergonomic boards and found a few that stood out. While there\u2019s no single \u201cbest\u201d option for everyone (since bodies are inherently different), this guide explores the options so you can find the best ergonomic keyboard for you.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-best-ergonomic-keyboa",
