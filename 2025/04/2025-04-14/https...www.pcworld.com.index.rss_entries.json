That\u2019s a hefty $450 discount for a laptop we recently gave a positive review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running on an Intel Core Ultra 7 256V processor and 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, this sleek and sturdy Intel Lunar Lake laptop is AI-ready and supports all the Copilot+ AI features that are coming and part of Windows 11.

You can snag the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SK-hynix-Windowsbased-Androidbased-Smartphones/dp/B0C4KNB2YK/\">1TB model for $65 on Amazon</a> (was $90), which is a lovely 28% off for the device and close to the best price we\u2019ve ever seen for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, you might be taken aback because the SK Hynix Beetle X31 doesn\u2019t look like your typical portable SSD. It\u2019s a small, golden drive with a gleaming, premium sheen. Is it unusual? Yes. Is it a head turner and a conversation starter? Also yes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant appearance aside, this is a super speedy portable SSD.

For lighter workloads like web surfing and emailing, it gets the job done just fine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s really only one problem: my laptop is too old for a Windows 11 update. On October 14th, 2025, Windows 10 will reach the end of its support period, which means no new features or security updates. The former is not a big problem.
