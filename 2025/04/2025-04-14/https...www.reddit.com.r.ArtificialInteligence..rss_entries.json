If I ask Claude to write a 20,000-word paper, it actually <em>does it</em>. Like, seriously, it&#39;ll get within 500 words of the target, no problem. You can even ask it to break things into sections and it keeps everything super consistent.</p> <p>ChatGPT? Totally different story. Ask it for anything over 2,000 or 3,000 words and it just gives you part of it, starts summarizing, or goes off track. Even if you tell it to keep going in chunks, it starts to repeat itself or loses the structure fast.</p> <p>Why is that? Are the models just built differently? Is it a token limit thing or something about how they manage memory and coherence? Curious if anyone else has noticed this or knows what&#39;s going on behind the scenes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/drewsy4444\"> /u/drewsy44",
