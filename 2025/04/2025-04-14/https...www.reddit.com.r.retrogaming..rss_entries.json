It was a small system (I believe it was handheld) that played a fantasy game which was very Conan-esque, but it came with small cards - like trading cards - that you had to insert or scan into the machine. I hate to make this analogy, but think Yu-Gi-Oh if they used a steamdeck..</p> <p>Like I said, I never really figured out how to play it, and I have no idea whatever happened to it.. but the more I try to find out more about it, the more I begin to wonder if I&#39;m just imagining it.

I\u2019ve been following some awesome ones like DevilutionX for Diablo, FreeCiv for Civilization, Daggerfall Unity for Elder Scrolls, IWD2EE for Icewind Dale II, OpenTESArena for The Elder Scrolls: Arena, Arx Libertatis for Arx Fatalis, and OpenXcom for X-COM. </p> <p>These projects make old games playable on new hardware and often add cool enhancements too. I really enjoy keeping up with these efforts, so I\u2019d love to discover more!

Passthrough is fine, but I&#39;d be lying if I said I didn&#39;t want to upscale, so want to fix the issue. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the wii, the old as hell cables, the GBS-C itself or the clock. Before I installed the external clock I was getting image for just 10sec or so if I replugged in the HDMI cable for the TV regardless of output(where I want to use it), but perfect image on a PC monitor in my office with all outputs. Haven&#39;t relocated everything to my office again to test it post clock install yet, plan to do so, but I feel like the screen isn&#39;t the issue. </p> <p>Any h",

I tried the original Fallout and didnt like it, but would love to try something like the original Diablo.

I&#39;d love to go with the high end 4k, but there&#39;s just no way for me to justify spending that much. That said, the 5x isn&#39;t cheap, but it seems to still offer the upscaling features. </p> <p>The 2x doesn&#39;t seem to, and seems more like a pass through converter. </p> <p>Beyond enjoying laserdisc, I would be hooking up my PS1 &amp; PS2, Dreamcast, and would like to do the same with my NES and potentially a Saturn and AES (which would fulfill one of my life goals from when I was 10...)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HertzWhenEyeP\"> /u/HertzWhenEyeP </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jymhlf/retrotink_advi",
