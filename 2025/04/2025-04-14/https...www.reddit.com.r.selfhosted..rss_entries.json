A friend asked me if I had read a book that came out 6 months ago, and I had no idea it even existed. That&#39;s when I learned about readarr&#39;s metadata source drama, and then found rreading-glasss. It has been working well for the last week or so, until last night when I went to refresh the metadata for one author who has over 100 books, and it deleted all but 6 for some reason. I figured there was something wrong with cache, so I tried again today, and it deleted two more.</p> <p>I need something to let me know what e-books I&#39;m missing, and when new books are released, so I can go find them. There has to be a metadata source that isn&#39;t hot garbage, and something to use it that actually works... right?</p> <p>Please tell me there&#39;s a solution I haven&#39;t found yet.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ruckertopia\"> /u/ruckertopia </a> <b",

All of that is pretty mainstream and well documented.</p> <p>Then I started thinking about my old GBA and GC games. That&#39;s when I ran into romm, which not only allows you to save ISOs but also game saves. I got quite nostalgic opening up my 2007 save from Pokemon emerald. So I ended up buying an old Wii to do the same for my GC games.</p> <p>Now I ended up wondering about self hosting my own game server with emulators. I had played a bit with dolphin in the past and, looking around, I discovered games on whales. That allowed me to spinup a dolphin headless on my small beelink mini-pc (poor little guy was struggling) and connect to it using moonlight.</p> <p>Do you guys have a similar setup ?

(Just keeping an eye on some cats indoors, so nothing really serious.). My question is, how to implement this? I have already set up a VLAN and have a Proxmox server. Should I flash another OS on the phones? Or what kind of app should I download? I wanna be able to look at the footage real-time and maybe store like a day&#39;s worth of footage. If it is possible I would like to have 2 way audio. One more thing, is leaving the phones at home plugged is dangerous? They are quite old, so maybe plug them into a powerbank and take out the battery?

Wanting to make a server for e books on my home PC to be accessed primarily through my Android phone. Currently using jellyfin but I hear that&#39;s pretty shite for e books? I&#39;d desperately love FOSS, but im willing to go (free) proprietary if needed for my features, such as </p> <p>-Must remember last left. -Must be able to access it online (I already have remote access set up for jellyfin so I&#39;m assuming il just be able to use that) -Must have clear and/or lots of set up documentation. I&#39;m autistic AF and get confused easily XD. </p> <p>-the ability to add notes, annotations and such would be helpful, but not required. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/phoooooo0\"> /u/phoooooo0 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",

I have another 20TB disk on the way because damn radarr/sonarr make it easy to add media. Anyways, I\u2019ve realized that part of the reason I do it is out of passion, and now I\u2019m sort of at the end of the finish line for my immediate aspirations. I find myself tinkering and often breaking stuff just out of boredom. I think I need another project.. so what else should I host, or get into? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/-ManWhat\"> /u/-ManWhat </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jylup4\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:",
