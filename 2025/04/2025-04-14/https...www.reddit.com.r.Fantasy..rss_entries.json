I found myself excited to read a book by an author from my own country, who has even decided to write in English. The cover looked cool, the blurb was okay, it only had 55 reviews on Goodreads and I was happy to support a local author and choose a book I&#39;m fairly certain nobody else will choose for this challenge.</p> <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p> <p>Going into this review, I would like to inform the reader that I will discuss some major spoilers, and that this review will be quite negative.

Ryan Cahill gives you a lot of that comfort fantasy with a lot of typical tropes, caricatures, races, and factions, but then deviates just enough to keep me interested and the plot fresh. I feel like the key differentiating factor is that there&#39;s a lot of factions that still have slightly obscured/conflicting motivations.

However\u2026 I\u2019ve not read any Abercrombie books. I own the first law trilogy and the age of madness trilogy but having been occupied with stormlight, I haven\u2019t gotten around to them. For those of you who have read or who have knowledge about the devils\u2026 would this book be okay for me to start with? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Duke_7287\"> /u/Duke_7287 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jymnnm/the_devils_a_good_starting_place/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jymnnm/the_devils_a_good_starting_place/\">[comments]</a></span>",
