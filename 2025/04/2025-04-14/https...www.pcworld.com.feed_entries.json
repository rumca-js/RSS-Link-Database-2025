A mini PC! Mini PCs are way more cost-effective than both laptops and full-blown desktop rigs, especially when you can snag one on sale\u2014like this Acemagic AD15 that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ACEMAGIC-i5-12450H-Computer-Type-C-Display/dp/B0DPZN8MPD/\">only $230.30 on Amazon</a> (was $329), a solid 30% discount with promo code <code>BWKAXHBR</code> at checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of this dirt-cheap mini PC is that it does NOT have dirt-cheap components. Sure, the Intel Core i5-12450H processor launched in 2022, but it still performs well enough for basic work, everyday browsing, and video streaming. It also has 16GB of DDR4 RAM\u2014the minimum we\u2019d recommend for Windows 11\u2014and a 512GB SSD, both of which are user-upgradea",

And for good reason! While it\u2019s far from perfect, Chrome offers a simple, reliable, and seamless way to access the web for both work and play, right out of the box, with lots of power and functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t offer a lot in the way of personalization. When you install Chrome, it comes ready to use with minimal fuss, but the overall experience is standardized. Some might even call it sterile. What if you want to tweak it? Make it look different? Make it <em>your own</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your options are pretty limited, unfortunately, but there are some things you can do. Here are some easy but effective ways to customi",

He posted that <a href=\"https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383\">he\u2019d \u201cfully given into the vibes\u201d when programming with AI assistance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tweet of course kicked off a flame war, because that\u2019s how X works, especially under the current management. But for me, the tweet hit home\u2014because it perfectly describes how <em>I</em> use AI to code.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-list",
