Is there maybe people here who have worked/do work in a bookstore that can help? I know it depends on a lot of things but what could the wage roughly be? I&#39;m thinking of moving out at some point soon (with another person) and I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;ll earn enough to live off of? Also - what&#39;s it like? Very broad question, I know. Obviously a lot of people who are going to be difficult, but just the job in general. I dont know. I like to know a lot about a job before going in to it - obviously - so what&#39;s a usual day like? I usually tend to find book shops quite peaceful, but I guess it&#39;s probably different actually working there.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/meehii\"> /u/meehii </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jzdpiv/anyone_here_work_in_a_bookstore_im_considerin",

I know Archer\u2019s Voice has smut, but that was a few years ago when I first started getting back into reading.</p> <p>What I loved about Love and Gelato was how fluffy and clean it was. The main focus wasn\u2019t the romance, and I really appreciated that.</p> <p>I\u2019m currently 17, but I don\u2019t really like books that are exactly for my age group. Personally, I prefer young adult books that feel more like they\u2019re written for 14 to 16-year-olds. I want a book with really good writing, but it also has to be easy to read because I have ADHD.
