Sometimes, when I try to access certain routes, I get a <strong>301 redirect</strong>, and other times, my CSS files return a <strong>304 Not Modified</strong> status.</p> <p>Additionally, I&#39;ve noticed that when I type a URL directly into the browser (without visiting the page beforehand), Django sometimes handles the request differently than expected and makes the request. Also this varies between browsers. I&#39;m a beginner so all of this doesn&#39;t quite make sense.</p> <p>Has anyone else experienced this? Could this be related to Django, browser settings, or something else I might be overlooking?

I am using Vue as my frontend and Django/DRF for the backend/api. </p> <p>My issue is establishing authentication with django-cas-ng. I have a working Django cas project (made by someone else) that i access from my project, but when I try to redirect to the frontend after credentials I get \u201cforbidden redirect\u201d error. </p> <p>I reckon this is happening because of port differences but I did config CAS_REDIRECT_URL. </p> <p>What am I missing ?
