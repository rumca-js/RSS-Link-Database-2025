Currently I&#39;m an SE for a SaaS but want to go into devops. Random docker projects are cool but Im in need of any advice or a full project that resembles an actual environment that a devops engineer would build/maintain. Basically, I just need something that I can understand not only for building it but knowing for a fact that it translates to an actual job. </p> <p>I could go down the path of Chatgpt but I can&#39;t fully trust the accuracy. Actual real world advice from people that hold the position is more important to me to ensure I&#39;m going down the right path.
