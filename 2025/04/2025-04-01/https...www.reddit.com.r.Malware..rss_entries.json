It is about GanDiao.sys, an ancient kernel driver based malware (it only works in WinXP as it is unsigned). </p> <p>This driver was used by various malware families and it allowed any userland application to kill other protected processes.</p> <p>Included in this paper there is also a custom userland app source code to use GanDiao and test its capabilities (just use a sacrifical Windows XP VM as stated in the doc).</p> <p>English version: <a href=\"http://lucadamico.dev/papers/malware_analysis/GanDiao.pdf\">http://lucadamico.dev/papers/malware_analysis/GanDiao.pdf</a></p> <p>Italian version: <a href=\"https://www.lucadamico.dev/papers/malware_analysis/GanDiao_ITA.pdf\">https://www.lucadamico.dev/papers/malware_analysis/GanDiao_ITA.pdf</a></p> <p>I hope you will find this paper interesting. I had a fun time reverse engineering this sample :) </p> <p>Oh, and if you&#39;re wondering... yes, I prefer oldscho",

I can&#39;t find any information online about it. It was a 1&quot; grey bar with the letters DX on a red circle backdrop. </p> <p>Does anyone know what this is? I&#39;m paranoid because I read tech news too much. My firm&#39;s IT department doesn&#39;t know what it is. My Windows Defender and ThreatLocker say there are no issues, but again, I&#39;m paranoid.</p> <p>Any information would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Agitated_Honeydew206\"> /u/Agitated_Honeydew206 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1jp0th1/unknown_popup_task_bar_with_red_circle_and_dx_logo/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1jp0th1/unknown_popup_task_bar_with_red_circle_and_dx_logo/\">[comments]</a></s",
