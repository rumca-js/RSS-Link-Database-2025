There he reviews indie books and science fiction/fantasy that has served as one of my guides to purchases for the past few years. He was also the author of Fuzzy Knights, which was a cartoon about plushies playing Dungeons and Dragons. So, like Ben \u201cYahtzee\u201d Croshow, when I heard he had written a book, I decided to check it out with all haste. I\u2019m glad I did.</p> <p>The premise for LOST SOULS is that Maurice \u201cMoss\u201d Foote is a star pilot turned smuggler that has recently lost his ship to a crime lord. He used to be a big famous intergalactic hero supported by a megacorporation but lost his mojo wh",

One of the squares for the new Bingo challenge card is about engaging with fantasy, sci-fi, or horror in a form other than books. One of those options is tabletop RPGs! I&#39;m a big fan of the form and I love running games for people, so I feel like this would be a great way to fulfil the square for folks. Particularly because I LOVE introducing newcomers to the hobby, and because I love introducing people who have only ever played <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> to other types of games in the hobby.</p> <p>Specifically, I am thinking of running Mothership, a sci-fi horror game in a similar vein to the Alien films, though better than the official Alien RPG in my opinion. It&#39;s a pretty simple game that allows you to roll up characters quite fast and jump straight into play, and it&#39;s very well designed for one-shots\u2014that is, a single session of 2-4 hours of play.</p> <p>If any of you are interested in this",

It&#39;s fairly basic, but it&#39;s easy to use, and it gets the job done.

Ryan Cahill and Philip Chase for example, appear to not be listed on the Kobo store. I&#39;m sure there are many more. One of the reasons I want to switch is the predatority exclusivity contracts that they give indie authors, so I can&#39;t say I&#39;m surprised, but it does seem like it&#39;s really hard to make the switch if you want to read indie books, unless I&#39;m missing something? I can&#39;t buy them on Amazon and strip DRM to move devices anymore either.

And every year I promptly forget about it until a week before it&#39;s due. It was the same this year, except this year I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I&#39;d fulfilled all of the prompts except two: space opera and published in the 90s. So I quickly read a space opera and subbed in &#39;book from the 2000s&#39; from last year&#39;s card. Some rapid fire reviews: </p> <p>(1) First in a Series: A Crown for Cold Silver by Alex Marshall</p> <p>I liked it. Also BUG DRUGS</p> <p>(2) Alliterative Title: Brightly Burning by Mercedes Lackey </p> <p>I liked it </p> <p>(3) Under the Surface: Homeland by RA Salvatore</p> <p>Took a bit to get into but now I&#39;m obsessed (but that may have more to do with my obsession with BG3 than the Drizzt books themselves) </p> <p>(4) Criminals: The Gutter Prayer by Gareth Hanrahan </p> <p>I liked it </p> <p>(5) Dreams: Paladin&#39;s Strength by T",
