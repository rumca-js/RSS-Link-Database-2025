I\u2019m looking for a singleplayer story game with a lot of action, similar to the game Blood &amp; Truth on the PSVR as I thoroughly enjoyed it when I played it a few years back. I don\u2019t want ANY puzzle games, anything with any puzzle in it frustrates the hell out of me and my brain just can\u2019t comprehend even the simplest of puzzles and I get frustrated and bored tryna figure them out and ultimately look up a tutorial and no Half Life Alyx, I played that game for an hour and a half and then refunded it as it had too many puzzles in it (I\u2019m aware of how good and amazing it is, i don\u2019t want anyone telling me I made a bad decision refunding it, it looks and plays great and has an incredible story, all of which I am aware of I just CANNOT stand puzzles and it ruined it for me) so",

So please keep it respectful. </p> <p>I personally think Hitman Vr on psvr2 wins due to the sheer content and gameplay length that is provided. Then again Batman Arkham Shadow is built from ground up for Vr and it shows. Almost no jank and I really enjoyed the combat in Arkham shadow, amazing exercise. The stealth was meh, cause the levels were not big enough. But the story and overall presentation was amazing, for a stand alone title. It is definitely a system seller for quest 3. </p> <p>On the other hand, Hitman WOA on psvr2 is on another level. I am 12 hours into it and I am not even halfway through the game.

If the Valve Deckard launches with eye tracking and foveated rendering built into its pipeline, I assume it will set a new standard for the VR industry, pushing developers to implement these technologies in future titles.</p> <p>That brings me to my questions:</p> <ol> <li>Assuming the Deckard releases in 2025, when do you think foveated rendering will become a standard feature in most, if not all, newly released VR games?</li> <li>Will Nvidia devel",

I beat Arkham Shadow when it came out, and I am currently playing Hitman WOA on psvr2 (12 hours into it). This is just for fun and a fresh perspective from someone who played both games. So please keep it respectful. </p> <p>I personally think Hitman Vr on psvr2 wins due to the sheer content and gameplay length that is provided. Then again Batman Arkham Shadow is built from ground up for Vr and it shows. Almost no jank and I really enjoyed the combat in Arkham shadow, amazing exercise. The stealth was meh, cause the levels were not big enough. But the story and overall presentation was amazing, for a stand alone title. It is definitely a system seller for quest 3. </p> <p>On the other hand, Hitman WOA on psvr2 is on another level. I am 12 hours into it and I am not even halfway through the game. It\u2019s insane the amount of content this game has to offer. This is the kind of game that show",

Would just ethernet into the router (this one will not have internet) be fine?
