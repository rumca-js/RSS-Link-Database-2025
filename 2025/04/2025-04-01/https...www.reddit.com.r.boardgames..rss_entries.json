A few locals come but there are also many internationals, mostly from the Middle East and across Africa. I was wondering if anyone has any recommendations for games to play for small groups? I tried teaching a few folks gin rummy last week with mixed results. We have a chess board, but I don&#39;t know how to play chess, and that&#39;s only for 2 players anyway. We also have Dominos, but that has gotten old pretty quick. I&#39;m thinking about bringing Uno this week. Does anyone have suggestions of other games that might be popular more internationally, or quite easy to pickup with limited English? Thanks for any suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Illustrious-Idea-742\"> /u/Illustrious-Idea-742 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jp9aqw/g",

So i was surprised to see someone letting go of a standee ver, but I was not exactly expecting it. After some extensive research, I am still on the fence on whether I should get it. I know SBG sells the standee ver for $150 USD as well, but including shipping it goes over to $210, so not a good alternative.</p> <p>On the other hand, I have recently came across Fateforge: Chronicles of Kaan and was more intrigued by the game than to Oathsworn, primarily because I have only ever seen the All-In version of Oathsworn being sold here, which costs way too much to consider.
