Fram2 is the first human spaceflight to explore the Earth&#39;s polar regions, which are not visible to the astronauts aboard the International Space Station. The crew will observe the Earth&#39;s poles through a panoramic cupola attachment from an altitude of 430 km (267 miles). SpaceX&#39;s Crew Dragon capsule can fly from the North to the South Pole in around 46 minutes and Fram2 is a three-to-five day mission, so it&#39;s expected to provide scientists with a healthy amount of footage capturing the polar regions. In fact, SpaceX has already released the mission&#39;s first views of the Earth&#39;s poles from space.&nbsp;</p>\n<div id=\"b280b922896b499ea7c9a88f1647a658\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"",
