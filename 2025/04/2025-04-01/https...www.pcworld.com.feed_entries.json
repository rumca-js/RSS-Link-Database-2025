For me, it was a time to reflect. My own career began about 30 years ago, about the same time that Gordon moved over from newspapering into technology journalism.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that he\u2019s gone, it\u2019s made me realize something our society st",

Well, almost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve been paying attention, you know that the Windows world is badly fragmented. Not only are users split between Windows 10 and Windows 11, but Windows 11 users aren\u2019t even all on the same version. Now, over the past year, AI has added another wrinkle with Microsoft mainly developing its Copilot+ PC features for Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X platform while neglecting AMD\u2019s Ryzen AI 300 and Intel\u2019s Core Ultra 200 series processors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, that\u2019s changing.
