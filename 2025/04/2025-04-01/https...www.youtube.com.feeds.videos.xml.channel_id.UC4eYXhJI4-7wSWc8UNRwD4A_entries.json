He didn\u2019t ask for much during soundcheck, just a preview of beats from The Band of Brothas and a shot of espresso. He was about to do something that had never been done at Tiny Desk before \u2014 freestyle an entire set \u201coff the dome.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been over nine years since Droppa dropped his debut mixtape, which featured heavy hitters like Migos, Big Sean, Nick Jonas and more. \u201cEvery time I see people,\u201d the rapper shares during his set, \u201cthe first thing they say is \u2018Droppa where you been? When you gonna give us more?\u2019 \u201d Well, the answer is now. Those who aren\u2019t hip may recognize the emcee as his alter-ego, Kevin Hart, who\u2019s become a household name in comedy and acting. But this unscripted set proves that Chocolate Droppa\u2019s rap game is equally entertaining. There\u2019s really no need to compare him to any other performer you\u2019ve seen, because as Droppa puts it himself, he\u2019s \u201cnot them.\u201d\n\nSET ",
