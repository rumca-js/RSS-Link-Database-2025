I\u2019ve been looking at both the C64 Mini and Atari 400 Mini. I\u2019m pretty divided on them and yes I know they each have their own issues, like the keyboards are just for aesthetic, the C64 Joystick isn\u2019t the best, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve really heard. I have an offer from someone for either one for a good price but I\u2019m not sure what one I should get.
