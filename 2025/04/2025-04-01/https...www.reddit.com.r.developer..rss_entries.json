It should be able to incorporate data (first from uploading of csv/excel files, later via api interface) in the database and show the different statusses of stock of product. Potentially I\u2019d want to capture some user input too. It should have azure authentication to comply with company policy. </p> <p>I had some programming courses at university and usually don\u2019t find it too difficult to build something, especially with some AI help, but my experience is rather limited.</p> <p>I gave it a try with next.js and supabase, and already got something to demo rather quickly. I also tried the same with .NET (blazor) and supabase, but encountered more difficulties. </p> <p>Any idea what would be the best tools to start such a project? Is there a reason why .NET is more difficult for AI? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fake_Hyena\"> /u/Fake_Hyen",

The idea is to collaborate with people who can dedicate a few hours a day without expecting anything in return (at least initially). If it takes off, we can think about monetization and maybe even generate some passive income down the line.</p> <p>I\u2019m open to ideas! I\u2019ve been brainstorming some, but I\u2019d love to hear from you if you have something in mind. If we align on an approach, we can start building.</p> <p>My current tech stack is mostly TypeScript and Next.js. If this sounds like something you\u2019d be interested in, DM ",
