I&#39;ve just started getting around with selfhosting, and I did expose some of the services via port 443. However, I&#39;m getting weird requests in the NGINX logs, most likely bots/attackers. As of now, I&#39;m selfhosting on my PC, which has Bitdefender as the default antivirus. It has blocked many threats, however I&#39;m planning to move the containers to my Synology NAS, and I don&#39;t trust its firewall/antivirus. Recently, I&#39;ve stumbled upon fail2ban, however, I don&#39;t know how to set it up. I&#39;ve searched here and there, but everyone recommends setting it up in Linux as a standalone app. Has anyone achieved this in Windows and Docker? Nginx, even though has <code>network_mode = host</code>, only outputs the ip 127.0.0.1.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/happySTEFnr1\"> /u/happySTEFnr1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",
