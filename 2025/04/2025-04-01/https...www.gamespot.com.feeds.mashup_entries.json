Case in point: One week after releasing limited-time drops featuring <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/magic-the-gatherings-2025-lineup-features-final-fantasy-spider-man-and-spongebob/2900-5889/\">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>, Wizards of the Coast has announced a surprise Secret Lair drop centered around Deadpool, the Merc With A Mouth from Marvel Comics.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The limited-run five-card drop features four reprinted MTG cards with new Deadpool-themed art and flavor text, in which the popular Marvel hero speaks directly to the player in his trademark fourth-wall-breaking style. The fifth card in the drop is a mechanically unique creature card for Deadpool himself--the first mechanically-unique Secret Lair card since Lara Croft, Tomb Raider in 2024.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3",

At the moment, fighters are in the midst of another renaissance era.</p><p>As such, it might be intimidating to pick out a fighting game to play.

The images are supposedly taken from the Star Wars strategy game developed by Bit Reactor. The studio was founded by <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-xcom-civilization-devs-have-formed-a-new-studio/1100-6499799/\">former XCOM developers</a> and partnered with Respawn Entertainment on the project. </p><p>Found by <a href=\"https://mp1st.com/news/respawn-bit-reactors-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-leaked\">MP1st</a>, these images were spotted in a Bit Reactor artist's portfolio. They're dated back to 2023, so it's possible that they aren't up to date. However, it does provide us a glimpse of what the project might look like. According to MP1st, the game's codename is \"Bruno\" and the screenshots suggest that it's an isometric tactics game.</p><p>Som",
