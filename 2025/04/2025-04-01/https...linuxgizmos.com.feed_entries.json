        "description": "Efinix has introduced the Titanium Ti180J484D1 FPGA, which includes 2 Gb of embedded LPDDR4x memory. By integrating memory directly within the FPGA package, the number of pins required for external memory interfaces is reduced, simplifying PCB design and lowering system complexity. Built on TSMC&#8217;s 16 nm process, the Ti180J484D1 FPGA features a high-density, low-power Quantum [&#8230;]",
