He's currently filming Christopher Nolan's adaptation of Homer's The Odyssey, and will then go right to production on the next Spider-Man film, which now has an official title and release date. Spider-Man: Brand New Day will arrive in theatres July 31, 2026, just a couple of weeks after Nolan's The Odyssey hits screens. As you can probably guess by the title, the new movie will take some inspiration from the Brand New Day story arc in Spider-Man comics. In other kind of related news, Venom in Marvel Rivals has a emote: twerking. The emote is free for April Fool's Day, and will likely stick around past Season 1. And finally, we have an approximate runtime for tomorrow's Nintendo Switch 2 Direct. The Direct will be Nintendo's longest so far, running about an hour.\n\n#IGN #Marvel #MCU",

John Wick was a turning point in 2010s action movies. Not only did the choreography and camera work in a John Wick fight scene change the way that Hollywood action movies were shot, but the $25M independently produced film also showed everyone it was still possible to generate original franchises in the midst of this IP-era of Hollywood.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re going to talk about all the John Wick movies, but we\u2019re mostly going to focus on John Wick 1 and how directors Chad Stahelski and David Leitch used their stuntman background to create a directorial debut to create an instant action classic thanks to scenes like the house break-in John Wick fight and that night club shoot out John Wick fight. We\u2019re going to break down all those John Wick fight scenes and explain how Chad Stahelski and David Leitch managed to get the most produc",
