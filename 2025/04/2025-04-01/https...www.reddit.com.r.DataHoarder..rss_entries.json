I am trying to archive some rare finding on a lost website through wayback machine, and i found a little browser game on the site. it loads in a website named .asp and loads using Ruffle, so I am assuming some sort of flash/swf file? Is there any way to download this, so it doesnt get lost to time at the WBM? I dont care if it runs on my PC or not, I wont be playing it, I just want to archive the game in some way, offline. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cokefox\"> /u/cokefox </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1jp2fab/how_to_download_an_asp_browser_game_waybackmachine/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1jp2fab/how_to_download_an_asp_browser_game_waybackmachine/\">[comments]</a></span>",

For ease of scheduling, I want each of these to have the same start time by waking the computer, to run one after another and then shut down.
