If Mr. Netflix (he wears a top hat) came to my house and said, \u201cJason, I\u2019ve got a great deal for you. I\u2019m going to pay you $120 a year, and all you have to do is watch ads while you watch Netflix,\u201d what would I do? When I started thinking about it, I thought it might be an interesting intellectual question. What <em>would</em> I accept in exchange for having Mean Mr. Netflix beam ads into every show I watch?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Jason Snell\u2019s Unsuccessful Journey Into Netflix\u2019s Ad Tier\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/01/snellflix\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
