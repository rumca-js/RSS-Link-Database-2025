        "description": "After recently watching a completely ridiculous news story form, disseminate, and morph into something even more absurd over  the past few days, today is a closer look at how the CIA did not in fact find the Ark of the Covenant, how the Ark was never (and will never) be at Mar-A-Lago... and how news stories can spread from even a single twitter thread, which is based on decades old public documents, as far back as the Cold War. \n\nWhile Astral Projection, Remote Viewing, and other out of body intelligence gathering may possibly have merit, the recent media cycle about the Ark of the Covenant being discovered by the CIA in the 1980's, appears to be a completely absurd prospect.\n\nIt makes for a fun story, but its also the perfect topic to discuss on April Fools.\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nCOMPLE",
