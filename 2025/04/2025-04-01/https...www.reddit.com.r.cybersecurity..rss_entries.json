We\u2019re seeing a fair amount of false positives that are frustrating our developers, but at the same time, I\u2019m also concerned about potential gaps\u2014especially around newer threats and zero-days.</p> <p>For those of you who have been working with WAFs for a while: \u2022 How do you balance minimizing false positives without weakening security? \u2022 Have you found certain types of traffic or rules that tend to trigger unnecessary blocks? \u2022 When it comes to zero-day threats, do you rely mostly on built-in signatures, custom rules, or something else to stay ahead? \u2022 Any specific WAF vendors you\u2019ve found to be better (or worse) at handling false positives and catching zero-days? </p> <p>Appreciate any insights from folks who\u2019ve been down this road before!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",

I can\u2019t seem to land a cyber job the company is great but they tend to undermined my EA administration duties and I was on the corporate security team but it was literal disaster and the manager was horrible. I was supposed to move to an almost guaranteed entry position but then the contract got screwed up and didn\u2019t have enough funding to open another role. However I feel stuck and burned being in the role for almost 2 years so really a year and a half. I\u2019m not sure what to do and my manager although a great guy and has helped me a ton wants to keep me around and I\u2019m don\u2019t know what to do. Please help me maybe the military is it a good fit ",
