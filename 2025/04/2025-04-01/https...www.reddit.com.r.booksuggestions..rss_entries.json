I took a break from reading as school started again and I couldn\u2019t find much time to read but I\u2019ve got an audible account now so I\u2019m looking for any books that are: Preferably single person POV. Not too big a fan of the skipping around multiple people, although if it\u2019s written well I don\u2019t mind. About the same fast pacing. The pace of red rising was half of what kept me from putting it down. Rather dark and bloody. The ending of golden son made me immediately pick of morning star, and the obsidians are easily my favorite color despite their gruesomeness. A decent narrator.

I\u2019ve recently finished up a couple books by Carl John Lee (Psychic Teenage Bloodbath I &amp; II) and The Prettiest Girl in the Grave by Kristopher Triana. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s about time that I read something else though; I find myself getting impatient with horror novels and just flipping through them to the end. </p> <p>Does anyone have any recommendations? I know that I like contemporary literature, I don\u2019t mind romance as long as it\u2019s not the main focus of the plot, and I like surrealism. I think the last thing I read that was a far cry from my usual genres was The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and I actually thoroughly enjoyed that one. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/amethyst_fungi\"> /u/amethyst_fungi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jousy0/palate_cleansers/\">[li",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Ok, I literally inhaled A Divine Farce by Michael S. A. Graziano today and would love recommendations of books that are in the same vein, i.e. hell?/heaven?, surrealism, existentialism, the human condition, gritty grimy horror etc. Loved the writing, and I love the open endedness of it, that much was left to interpretation but it was also rewarding in pace and reveals. Definitely a page turner.</p> <p>Other books that are similar that I&#39;ve read and loved: Tender is the Flesh by Agustina Bazterrica and A Short Stay in Hell by Steven L. Peck.</p> <p>I&#39;m about to read I Who Have Never Known Men by Jacqueline Harpman, I&#39;m almost positive I&#39;m going to love it after reading reviews, but that means I&#39;ll finish it quick and I want something to fill the void after and going forward as I&#39;m loving this genre atm.

I just read The Wide, Wide Sea (nonfiction) and I read a book long ago about the island where people with leprosy lived. Are there any mystery writers who set stories in Hawaii? I like historical fiction too.
