That way they can neatly sidestep all external comparisons and inner doubts and concentrate on their own jobs. It is a team game, after all, and it never pays to waste time fretting about things over which you have limited control.</p><p>Every now and again, though, the \u201cgame within a game\u201d duel narrative is unavoidable. Even if Leinster\u2019s pack give a well-stuffed armchair ride to their young fly-half Sam Prendergast on Saturday his Harlequins opposite number, Marcus Smith, will still be expected to make some sort of impact. If not, his chances of being among the chosen few to tour with the British &amp; Irish Lions this summer will recede and Prendergast\u2019s will be suitably enhanced.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/01/the-breakdown-rugby-union-champions-cup-lions-marcus-",
