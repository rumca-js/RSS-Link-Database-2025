        "description": "China's glaciers have shrunk by 26 percent over six decades, with nearly 7,000 small glaciers disappearing. Data from the Chinese Academy of Sciences reveals that glacier area dropped from 59,000 sq km in the 1960s to 46,000 sq km by 2020. Scientists warn that continued ice loss could worsen water shortages. Authorities are trying to slow the process using artificial snow systems, but climate change remains a major driver of glacier retreat.",

The discovery provides insight into why the universe contains more matter than antimatter. Scientists found that the chance of this decay difference occurring randomly is less than one in three million. While the findings do not fully explain the imbalance, experts believe they add a crucial piece to the puzzle of one of physics' biggest mysteries.",

The white dwarf star, which pulls material from its red giant companion, last erupted in 1946. Astronomers have detected patterns similar to previous eruptions, leading to predictions of a possible outburst within the next two years. If it erupts, the nova could reach a magnitude of +2, making it briefly visible to the naked eye. Scientists are also monitoring its long-term fate, as exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit could result in a Type Ia supernova.",
