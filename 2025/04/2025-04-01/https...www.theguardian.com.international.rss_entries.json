It is adapted from a novella by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Claude_Grumberg\">author and screenwriter Jean-Claude Grumberg</a> (who collaborated with Truffaut on The Last Metro), whose own father was murdered in the Nazi death camps.</p><p>The late Jean-Louis Trintignant has his final credit as the narrator, introducing us to scenes that could, at first glance, be from the Brothers Grimm.

Since then, I\u2019ve heard about the bats so often that they\u2019ve been showing up in my dreams. And that makes sense, because prior to this weekend, even in a bandbox like Yankee Stadium, even for a franchise that\u2019s featured the likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gheirig and Mickey Mantle, such home run power could only have been cooked up in the sweetest slumbers of their fanbase.
