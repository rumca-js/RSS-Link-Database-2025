I attempted to use Wireshark to figure out what port it is on, but haven&#39;t yet figured it out.</p> <p>The printer doesn&#39;t show up in the netework printers dialog.</p> <p>I COULD run virtual box to talk to it, but my hope is to add this printer to my work flow where when I code an MCU using STM32CubeIDE I then trigger a process to print a label. I am all ready to get the process triggered, but sadly I can&#39;t figure the printing part out.</p> <p>Does anyone know where to start on this, and if it is even possible at all?</p> <p>Thanks everyone!<",

One major part of linux is that it has better performance &amp; faster than window, which is very useful for low end/ mid systems. But on a high end pc, where performance isn&#39;t an issue, is there any point of using linux? since it has less compatability? Sure, we can use something like wine for exes, but what&#39;s he point if there isn&#39;t any other advantages, might as well just run exes with window.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Little-Writing-6597\"> /u/Little-Writing-6597 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1jonfh3/is_there_any_point_of_using_linux_on_a_high_end/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1jonfh3/is_there_any_point_of_using_linux_on_a_high_end/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Like many Linux users, I was already a proficient computer user when I started using Linux, and that was because I really like using computers. Installing Linux is &quot;hard&quot; for most people because 90% of users are hopelessly incompetent. Linux users will say &quot;Ubuntu/Mint is just as easy as installing Windows&quot; which is true, but the vast majority of users have not installed any operating system in the past 15 years and most of those people have never installed an operating system once. Installing windows simply is not a normal part of the user experience anymore, and so those 90% of users never interact with the bios and don&#39;t even know it exists. Shit, some particularly oblivious people likely don&#39;t even know that their os is called &quot;Windows&quot; you might think that&#39;s impossible given it&#39;s all over the screen but a lot of people don&#39;t act",
