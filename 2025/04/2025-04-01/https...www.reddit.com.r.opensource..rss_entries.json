The idea is to build an app that researches how recalling dreams consistently can improve psychological well-being. I have no coding skills, so I\u2019m here to find collaborators who\u2019d like to join me in this experiment! ### What\u2019s Imago About? It\u2019s a mobile app where users: - Log dreams (text or voice). - Add context (e.g., \u201cstressful day\u201d) and tags (e.g., #nightmare). - Get semantic analysis (emotions, themes, intensity) with graphs and psychoanalytic prompts. - Share their latest dream anonymously with nearby Imago users via proximity detection. - Receive personalized tips to boost recall, plus exportable reports. The goal? Collect anonymized data to see if dream recall boosts mental health. It\u2019s privacy-first, with local storage and an MIT License. Check the full vision here: https://github.co",
