My project is powered by a 24V source, and I&#39;d like the shield to handle power delivery to the Pi directly.</p> <p>Most of the power circuitry isn&#39;t an issue\u2014I&#39;m using a DC-DC converter to drop the 24V down to 5.1V, capable of delivering up to 5A. I&#39;ve included proper decoupling, overvoltage protection, and a polyfuse, so that part&#39;s covered.</p> <p>Where I&#39;m really stuck is routing the 5V traces to the Pi. Specifically, the trace to the 5V pins near the 40-pin header is giving me a headache. The clearance area around the nearby mounting hole eats up so much space that I can barely fit a trace through.</p> <p>With 1oz copper and allowing for a 15K temperature rise, I calculate needing a trace width of over 3mm (125 mil) to safely handle 5A. But I just can&#39;t find the space for that ",
