Not sure if it was the same for C extension as well.</p> <p>Today, I wanted to test the C extension recently and only found this single .S test for RVC: <a href=\"https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests/blob/master/isa/rv64uc/rvc.S\">https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests/blob/master/isa/rv64uc/rvc.S</a></p> <p>This seems very very little coverage.
