        "description": "The cost of raw arabica beans, the core component of most coffee, has spiked in recent years due to four consecutive seasons of adverse weather. Climate change has added further strain, threatening the delicate temperature balance required by the Coffea arabica plant. This growing pressure has inspired physicists at the University of Pennsylvania to ask: Can we make great coffee with fewer beans?",
