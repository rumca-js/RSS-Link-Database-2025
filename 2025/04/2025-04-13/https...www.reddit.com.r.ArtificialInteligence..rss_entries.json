One of the things I&#39;ve learnt so far is that generative models are running into the bottleneck of not having enough data to train on to make significant improvements, and by their very nature cannot create things that are very different or new. That got me thinking, are there types of training data, I guess pictures primarily, that are &quot;optimal&quot; to train generative ai? From what I understand, it takes a lot of pictures/data to train these models, but if there is a specific type of input that&#39;s very &quot;potent&quot;, or if ai could literally ask for what exact type of input it needs to move forward the quickest (I know it&#39;s ultimately just like a weighted algorithm or something, but you get what I mean), will that become a job in the future?</p> <p>(Also please correct any obvious misunderstanding",

But after reading here, I realized that Claude now has new limits for any prompt.</p> <p>In this project, I don&#39;t have many lines. It&#39;s just 3 files with less than 400 lines in total. I&#39;m trying to get Claude to fix small things, but when it starts writing, it stops because of the limits. It didn\u2019t even write 20 lines before stopping.</p> <p>Also, when I tried to re-engineer the prompt to make it simpler, it forgot my main language and switched to another one. For context: my main language is Spanish, but I\u2019ve asked a few questions in German because I\u2019m learning that language.</p> <p>So, I\u2019d like to know how you\u2019re working with Claude. Is it really messy these days? Are people frustrated with this? Am I writing bad prompts? I just started using this AI this month, and it has helped me a lot with code, but I can\u2019t w",

Chickens clucking in the background, soap made from goat\u2019s milk, fresh vegetables grown in raised beds, and handwoven hemp crafts sold at farmer\u2019s markets. It looks wholesome. Peaceful. Independent. But it\u2019s a fantasy that is quietly running out of time.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t about mocking the dream. It is about calling the clock on its sustainability. Because the truth is: off-grid living, as it currently exists, is not built to withstand the direction the world is headed. And neither is the ultra-traditional isolation of the Amish.</p> <p>Technology is evolving at a breakneck pace. In 10 years, not 30, the very systems that allow people to exist on the edges will be digitized, automated, and locked behind AI-driven infrastructure. And when that happens, the margins vanish.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: people off-grid now might be making it work. Selling eggs and soap locally. Quietly growing ",
