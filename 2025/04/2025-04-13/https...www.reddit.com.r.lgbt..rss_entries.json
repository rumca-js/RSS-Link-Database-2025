I finally felt like I got it. But when I&#39;m with guys, and I tell them I&#39;m bi, they automatically ask first for a threesome or if I want an open relationship with girls. It makes me feel bad cause it&#39;s like they want me for a fantasy. But when I talk with girls, specifically recently masc girls, they are so off-putted when I say I&#39;m bi and say that bi girls are cheaters. And that theg won&#39;t be able to please me or live up to my expectations because I&#39;ve been with men. Femme girls also say the same and kinda shame me for not picking a side. Will I be single forever because neither community respects my sexuality without any fetishizing? I dont wanna lie at our first meet and just not tell them my sexuality.

I asked if this man was dating her before she came out because that would change the situation but he said no, they just started dating and she just happens to be trans. I immediately told them no, it\u2019s not gay. He countered that they\u2019d have gay sex cause she has a penis. </p> <p>News flash! How you have sex doesn\u2019t determine your sexuality. Plenty of straight couples like anal and plenty of gay couple don\u2019t. Gender identity is already a made up social construct that has a huge spectrum. My coworker gets some points for genuinely asking but loses them in his insistence that he\u2019s right. </p> ",
