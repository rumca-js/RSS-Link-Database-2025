Still hard at work on Age of the Deep. My ocean exploration swimsuit looter rpg.</p> <p>Sure there&#39;s stats on the gear, but it wouldn&#39;t be an ocean game if it wasn&#39;t about the drip. Concept art is looking really good. RPG mechanics are starting to take shape.</p> <p>In a post-flood world, the majority of humans evolved to survive the ocean depths. These became the Melenai, a race of merfolk that became the new world power. Assume the role of Mori, a powerful water mage, or Hadryon, a warrior skilled with his trident, and bring misery to a group of pirates antagonizing a chain of islands. </p> <p>Explore shipwrecks and dark underwater caves to uncover the mystery behind the pirate attacks, and loot new swimsuits to rock your abs. It&#39;s Tummy Tuesday every day in the A",
