Where you save the last chapter for a day because you don&#39;t want it over yet? Where you think you don&#39;t ever want to read another book because nothing will compare? </p> <p>I&#39;ve long been a huge fan of Arthurian legend since I read The Once And Future King decades ago. However, out of everything I&#39;ve tried, nothing has scratched that itch - until now. I read The Winter King, the first in the series, maybe a year ago. It was good, but dense, but I decided to give Enemy Of God, the second volume, another chance after reading a Mary Stuart title and being frustrated with it. I flew through that one, ordered Excalibur (the third volume) halfway through because I knew I couldn&#39;t wait",

The audiobook narration was pretty good and gripping but the plot moved at a slow pace and was somewhat predictable. The characters did not have as much depth to them as I had hoped. That being said, the setting of the island and the description of the house was well written in my opinion. I was surprised that Elliott didn\u2019t kill everyone on the island, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that either. The epilogue reinforced the unreliable narrator narrative and I loved that. It made me question, is it possible that the entire story was a figment of Elliott\u2019s imagination? In the epilogue he says he\u2019s nothing but a liar, and that makes me question if the whole thing was in fact imagined by Elliott, an inmate who suffers from some sort of delirium.
