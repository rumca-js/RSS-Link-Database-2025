We've already talked about <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-nvidia-dlss-4-tested-ray-reconstruction-upgrades-deliver-radical-enhancements\">how the new ray reconstruction produces some outstanding results</a>, but what about upscaling, or super resolution? Outlets like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELEu8CtEVMQ\">Hardware Unboxed</a> have already put out excellent analysis of the new DLSS, so we went for a slightly different approach. Based on our years of testing games and isolating specific DLSS issues within these titles, we decided to go back and re-test DLSS pain points, swapping out the old convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the brand-new transformer alte",
