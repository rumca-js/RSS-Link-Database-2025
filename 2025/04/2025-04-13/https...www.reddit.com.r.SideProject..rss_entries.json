Every time I wanted to order food, I\u2019d end up opening Uber Eats, then DoorDash, maybe Google the restaurant, sometimes even call them \u2014 just trying to figure out who delivers and what\u2019s cheapest.</p> <p>It\u2019s just... way more work than it should be.</p> <p>So I\u2019m building something called <strong>Deliva</strong>. It\u2019s a simple tool that shows:</p> <ul> <li>Which restaurants deliver near you</li> <li>What platforms they use (Uber Eats, DoorDash, or in-house)</li> <li>How much delivery actually costs</li> <li>And whether it\u2019s cheaper to just call the restaurant</li> </ul> <p>Right now, it\u2019s just a landing page and a mailing list. I\u2019m keeping it super lean and just trying to see if people would actually use something like this.</p> <p>If that sounds like something you\u2019d want, I\u2019d love for you to check it out:<br/> \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://foodeliva.beehiiv.com/\">https://foodeliva.beehiiv.com</a></p> <p>Any feed",

We had 1-2 meetings and I quoted him a price. Even after the price was on a very low side, they complained about it and wanted me to lower it down. I lowered it by 18% on the first go, and then asked him to pay 50% advance. He told me that he can only do 25% advance and we agreed.</p> <p>I started building his project and 10-12 days into building I had already completed 90% of the project.

I worked all that time for the project and spent time in it, but he only gave me 25% of the amount and left.</p> <p>The thing is he had to show it to possible leads, and he got a video recording of the app",
