Most notably, the project is now open source! You can check out the repository at <a href=\"https://github.com/hfellerhoff/serial\">https://github.com/hfellerhoff/serial</a>.</p> <p>Serial&#39;s goal is to limit the draw of YouTube&#39;s recommendation system while still letting you stay up to date on the channels that matter most to you (essentially, actually enjoying watching videos!). There are a few key features that I think help accomplish that:</p> <ul> <li>Powerful customization features (separate for both light and dark mode)</li> <li>Filtering out shorts from real videos</li> <li>Using a minimal, streamlined video player (you can still swap to the normal player if you&#39;d like)</li> </ul> <p>For a full list of what Serial offers, you can check out the project at <",

And the GitHub issues seem to not be addressed. Is the project dead? Does anyone know? </p> <p>I&#39;d also appreciate any alternatives you can suggest.
