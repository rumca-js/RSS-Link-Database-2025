I forgot if it is PS1 game or not, but it is an action game with urban setting, and a few characters to choose (3 or 4 - I can&#39;t remember it clearly). The main feature that I can still recall back is that when attacking enemy facing an environmental destroyable (like bench, chair, table, flower pot etc), it will trigger an instant-kill effect.. and one of the characters I can remember is a girl holding a broom? and one of the boss fight - the opening scene is the boss jumping down from the rooftop of a building?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Worldly-Laugh-1236\"> /u/Worldly-Laugh-1236 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jy7tzi/in_desperate_need_to_find_a_ps1_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retroga",
