The format given is as follows:</p> <ul> <li>bits 31-12: imm[31:12]</li> <li>bits 11-7: rd</li> <li>bits 6-0: opcode</li> </ul> <p>Furthermore, the pseudocode for the <code>lui</code> instruction is <code>rd = imm &lt;&lt; 12</code>.</p> <p>According to my assembler, the instruction <code>lui x31, 1</code> is encoded as <code>00000000000000000001 11111 0110111</code>. In other words, the encoded immediate is just <code>1</code>, and <em>not</em> imm[31:12], which in this case would be zero, since all bits of the literal immediate are zero except for the least significant bit.</p> <p>Maybe I&#39;m off base, but my reading of the spec says that only the 20 most significant bits of the immediate (bit 31:12) are encoded in the instruction, and the rest are ignored; but in reality, it&#39;s the 20 <em>least</em> significant bits of the immediate that are encoded. So the spec should say imm[19-0].</p> <p",
