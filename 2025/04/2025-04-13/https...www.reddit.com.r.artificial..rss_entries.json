Deepseek has been training minecraft AI to learn how to build tools and fulfill objectives in the games. It&#39;s not very good at it, but that is what will lead to an AI that can do anything. </p> <p>One of the most impressive AI&#39;s was the AI bots that could solve dungeons in runescape. The runescape dungeons were designed to be unbottable, but people managed to build one. Runescape has rules against using bots to play the game, because if the tedium of the free version could be circumvented it less people would sign up for the premium version.</p> <p>Part of how they got you to pay was making progress easier.

The conversation focused more on the ethics surrounding AI than the technology itself \u2014 and Altman came across as a somewhat awkward figure, seemingly determined to push forward with AGI regardless of concerns about risk or the need for robust governance.</p> <p>He embodies the same kind of youthful naivety we\u2019ve seen in past tech leaders \u2014 brimming with confidence, ready to reshape the world based on his own vision of right and wrong. But who decides his vision is the correct one? He didn\u2019t seem particularly interested in what a small group of \u201celite\u201d voices think \u2014 instead, he insists his AI will \u201cask the world\u201d what it wants.</p> <p>Altman\u2019s vision paints a future where AI becomes an omnipresent force for good, guiding humanity to greatness. But that\u2019s rarely how technology plays out in society. Think of social media \u2014 originally sold as a tool for connection, no",
