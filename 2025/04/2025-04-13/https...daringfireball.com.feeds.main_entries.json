But he\u2019s been a stridently vocal critic of Trump <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/donald-trump-withdraws-bill-maher-432675/\">since long before Trump even ran for president</a>. Maher was the first person on television <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/will-donald-trump-leave-office-peacefully-bill-maher-president-loses-2020-election-landslide-1466447\">to correctly predict that Trump, if he lost the 2020 election, would attempt to remain in office</a>. Maher and Trump, however, are mutual friends with Kid Rock, and Rock arranged for Trump to invite Maher to the White House for a private dinner. UFC chief and Meta board member Dana White was also there. A decade ago even imagining this guest list for a White House dinner would have been a warning that you ought to lay off the drugs. Today, this is normal.</p>\n\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/wa",
