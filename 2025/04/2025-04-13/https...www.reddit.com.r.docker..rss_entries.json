I&#39;d like to provide Keycloak with dynamic secrets to access the db at runtime. Hashicorp&#39;s documentation has some articles describing how to achieve this with Kubernetes, but not Docker without Kubernetes directly</p> <p>From what I&#39;ve seen, envconsul, Vault agent, consul-template are some tools I&#39;ve seen get recommended.</p> <p>Is there a best practice / most secure way or tool most people agree on how to make this work? If any of you have experience with this, I&#39;d really appreciate if you comment your method</p> <p>Thanks for reading </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/furniture20\"> /u/furniture20 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1jyfqq0/get_dynamic_secrets_from_has",
