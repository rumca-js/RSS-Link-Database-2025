They&#39;re pretty much all he plays (aside from the occasional Marvel Rivals and Overwatch, though I think he&#39;s over both of those). Anyway, he really wants CoD 6 for his birthday, but I&#39;m not crazy about the idea of him getting addicted to yet another shooter. So I decided I would get it for him, but first he must master as least two slower paced games. I&#39;m looking for achievements that aren&#39;t easy to get that denote mastery of a game. Things like beat civilization 5 on at least King difficulty. I have him on my steam family account and have a wide variety of games, and offered to also buy games so long as he commits to them. Looking for more mental games: RPGs, 4x games, puzzle games, adventure games, etc. I just want him to show me he can commit to a game that requires some focus and thought before I get him another brain dead shooter.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",
