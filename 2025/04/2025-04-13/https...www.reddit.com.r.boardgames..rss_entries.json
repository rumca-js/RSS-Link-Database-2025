In an ideal world it has depth despite its size. I\u2019m not sure if something like this exists but I thought I would at least put a feeler out there and if nothing else get some recommendations for when I get back. </p> <p>To summarize the question: if you were going to be stranded with only one small game for a month and a half, what would you choose? </p> <p>Some of our favorites include Spirit island, Mysterium, and The Grizzled.

One player has an ally with 3 health. How is the damage resolved? The rules as written: &quot;If you have the Target on your turn, after attacking allies, your damage points deal their <strong>full damage</strong> to every other player at the end of your turn&quot;.</p> <p>From a game design perspective, it would make since if I dealt 6 to the player without an ally; and 3 to the ally and 3 to the ally&#39;s owner. But if that were the case, I would expect the rules to say &quot;remaining damage&quot; instead of &quot;full damage&quot;. So does full damage mean that the ally dies AND both players take 6 damage?

Its main feature is a lot of game modes to choose from: 1 vs 1, team battle, 1 vs all, solo play vs boss (if you have Frontier version) and many others. I am not sure whether all of them are balanced, but they provide high replayability. Btw boss mode works really well: many various bosses, and most of them are pretty fun. Also AI is very simple to maintain.</p> <p>There are 4 significantly different factions: some prefer to discard enemy cards, others prefer to thin your deck, or simply smash faces. And a big combo potential: with well upgraded deck you can cycle in one turn through a lot of cards and deal dozens of damage.</p> <p>Also there are many many expansions, which introduce unique starting decks for players, events, heroes... A lot of nice extra additions.</p> <p>As for flaws, art is really bland: samey boring looking ships, almost no action or interestin",
