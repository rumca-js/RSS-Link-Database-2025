I have been loving how easy it is to create VMs in Proxmox and also how fast the VMs are. I ran into one snag which happened when I tried running a LLM in a VM. I just couldn&#39;t get it work. I ended up wiping Proxmox and installed Ubuntu and then I was able to run the LLM. But, now I don&#39;t have an easy way to spin up VMs. So, my question is should I stick with Ubuntu and install KVM in Ubuntu or should I go with Proxmox and install the LLM in the native Proxmox install instead of running it in VM?

I tested this setup on DD-WRT for several days, but I couldn\u2019t get it to work as I hoped. It seems that neither DD-WRT, OpenWRT, nor Asuswrt-Merlin has a built-in way to properly prioritize multiple WireGuard VPN tunnels.</p> <p><strong>What I want is very simple in theory:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Use VPN #1 as long as it\u2019s online</li> <li>If VPN #1 goes offline, failover to VPN #2</li> <li>When VPN #1 comes back online, <strong>automatically</strong> switch back to VPN #1 again (fallback)</li> </ul> <p>The backup VPN #2 could be a OpenVPN solution, it dont matter as long a the VPN #1 is wireguard.</p> <p>Do you guys have any advice?

The idea is to have Traefik, my reverse proxy, drop connections if the client doesn&#39;t present a recognized cert. Then it somehow passes user info from the cert to an SSO solution like Authelia, which maps certs to users.</p> <p>Is it possible to combine MTLS with SSO such that the certificate itself is the proof of identity? So that users don&#39;t have to log in explicitly? Is this a good idea?</p> <p>I currently don&#39;t have a single sign on solution. I&#39;ve been struggling to set up Authelia.
