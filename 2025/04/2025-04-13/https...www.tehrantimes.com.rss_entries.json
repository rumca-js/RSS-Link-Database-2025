When Russia annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014, Germany\u2019s response was muted. Berlin held inconclusive talks with the Kremlin, imposed a handful of sanctions, and then quietly returned to business as usual with Moscow. After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a\u00a0Zeitenwende, or \u201cturning point.\u201d He promised to increase defense spending, send more aid to Ukraine, and rapidly reduce Germany\u2019s energy dependence on Russia. In the end, the\u00a0Zeitenwende\u00a0was a turning point in name only. Hamstrung by coalition infighting, Scholz failed to overhaul Germany\u2019s defenses.",
