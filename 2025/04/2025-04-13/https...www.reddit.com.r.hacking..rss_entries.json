PRISM acts as a 1st line of defense in depth to assure that any input to your program has passed the 1st security check.</p> <p>PRISM has been trained on ~100k examples of malicious vs benign llm input datasets, synthetically generated. The idea is to distill the inputs that LLMs consider malicious, and have it lightweight and fast before consuming too much resources. It has performed exceptionally well on local testing, and has been tested to make sure it does not overfit the training data. the README explains everything you need in order to get started using this.</p> <p>I really hope you find this useful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",
