I got Fedora 41 working for a few days but then randomly one morning it decided to get stuck on the boot screen after working for a few days and after a few reboots it got past that but crashed as soon as I logged in. Then I did a fresh install of Fedora 41 and upgraded to Fedora 42 that way, right away a black screen after upgrading. The Fedora 42 ISO won&#39;t even reach the installer anymore even though it is scheduled for stable release this Tuesday. Neither Ubuntu nor Pop!_OS will get past the &quot;Try or install&quot; screen. Same for Mint, Cinnam",
