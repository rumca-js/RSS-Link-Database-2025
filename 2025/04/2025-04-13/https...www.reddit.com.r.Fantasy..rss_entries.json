But in LotR the story doesnt revolve around magic and magic is hardly used throughout the books. And thats the reason it fits so perfectly in there.

I adore Abraham\u2019s Long Price Quartet and think it\u2019s a more innovative work in some ways, but on an emotional level I think the Dagger and the Coin series will stay with me more. It certainly deserves more recognition than it gets!</p> <p>The plot feels pretty standard epic fantasy at first \u2013 there was an age of dragons, the dragons have disappeared, and magic seems to have vanished from the world, but now an ancient evil threatens to engulf the world in imperial expansion and perhaps even eternal war. Sounds tropey on the surface, but the execution is creative without feeling deliberately subversive. As the title of the series suggests, there are battles and action, but one of our POV characters is a banker, so we also see a creative insight into the financing of war. </p> <p>Abraham excels ",
