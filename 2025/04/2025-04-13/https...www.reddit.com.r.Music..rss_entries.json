I&#39;ve often asked myself the same thing and have resorted to making an excel sheet to rate my favourite albums. I&#39;m currently in the process of developing an app that would serve this purpose.</p> <p>Here are a few ideas for the app:</p> <p>- Users rate their fav albums based on 7 metrics (lyrics, how it sounds, production, etc) and the algorithm gives them an aggregate 1-100 score.</p> <p>- The app also shows the average user&#39;s scores for each album, like IMDB.</p> <p>While I have many more ideas for how this app is to develop. What are your opinions on this?</p> <p>Would you use it? How often would you use it? What features are a MUST for you to download it and make use of it?</p> <p>Any feedback is greatly appreciated :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

Do you guys believe this to be the case? </p> <p>I myself listen to metal, with symphonic and goth being my preferred type. I find metal to be the only genre of music that I can listen to without getting bored. Music by Disembodied Tyrant, Seven Spire and Lena Scissorhand offers such a unique combination of sound that no others can match. The combination of symphonic element with growling feels oddly soothing and relaxing to me. </p> <p>Metal have been said to be an outlet of stress, by screaming about violence and aggression, it helps to release the pent up anger through an expression of art. Metal also often covers topic regarding oppression and other social issues. Many songs have deep meaning behind it, making its listeners more sympathetic to other.
