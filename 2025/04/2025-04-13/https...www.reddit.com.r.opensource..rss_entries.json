The model outputs SQL queries in response to natural language questions like:</p> <ul> <li>\u201cWhat was the net_profit of INFY on 2021-03-31?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cWhat\u2019s the 30-day moving average of TCS close price on 2023-02-01?\u201d</li> <li>\u201cShow me YoY growth of EPS for RELIANCE.\u201d</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s 100% offline \u2014 no APIs, no cloud calls \u2014 and ships with a DuckDB file preloaded with the dataset. You can paste the model\u2019s SQL output into DuckDB and get results instantly. You can even add your own data without changing the schema.</p> <p>Built this as a proof of concept for how useful small LLMs can be if you ground them in actual structured datasets.</p> <p>It\u2019s live on Hugging Face",
