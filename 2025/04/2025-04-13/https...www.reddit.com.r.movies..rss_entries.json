Obviously i know its almost impossible to recreate that in a film but Zac Snyder\u2019s Man of Steel comes very close so i was wondering if you guys had any other examples.

Dialogues are fantastic and acting is phenomenal. </p> <p>One of my favourite scenes: Carl (Steve Buscemi) calls Jerry (William Macy), says there\u2019s a problem. Jerry asks, \u201cHow\u2019s Jean?\u201d Carl pauses and goes, \u201cWho\u2019s Jean?\u201d Killed me. He didn\u2019t even know the name of the woman he kidnapped.</p> <p>All the \u2018yeaaaah\u2019\u2019s always stuck. The accents also did play a huge part in making the movie so loveable. They should do a serious sequel with Scotty (the son) and how he grows up all messed up. </p> <p>I love Steve Buscemi and William Macy together. (They\u2019ve done a few more movies together but I haven\u2019t watched any of them)</p> <p>I\u2019d love to watch more classics like this. Please recommend.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",

I finally got around to watching it, and ended up loving it. Highly recommended to anyone looking for an intelligent, mature historical drama with fantastic performances</p> <p>The summary is as follows: In 1983 East Berlin, dedicated Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler begins spying on a famous playwright and his actress-lover Christa-Maria. Wiesler becomes unexpectedly sympathetic to the couple, and faces conflicting loyalties when his superior takes a liking to Christa-Maria.</p> <p>While the above makes the movie sound like a spy thriller, it really is more of a character study with social commentary.

Absolute shame it&#39;s not playing in more theaters, as I saw plenty of trailers for it. Carey Mulligan is great but she&#39;s always great, and I wasn&#39;t aware of Tom Basden before but he was also great and they both actually performed the music in the movie. Tim Key is another actor I was unaware of who was also perfect. (Yes I&#39;m terrible at reviewing movies but wanted to give this one a shoutout). If you have a chance to see it and you&#39;re not in the mood for any of the bombastic commercial stuff out right now, and would prefer something a little more charming and heartfelt, I highly recommend this one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/reecord2\"> /u/reecord2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comme",
