I don&#39;t remember what application I used before, I think it was called UTorrent, but now it seems the popular one is this qbittorent, but it doesn&#39;t seem to work for me. I really liked the idea of it having a built in search function, but when I try to download, either through the search or copying a link, it just gets stuck at &quot;downloading metadata.&quot; I was kinda thinking to give up, but just now I decided to try using the built in function on brave browser, and it not only was it super fast, but everything seems to be working. I&#39;m far from tech savy, so I&#39;m just wondering if in missing something, or why doesn&#39;t everyone do this? Can I just uninstall the torrent app and just keep running through brave? Will I have any kinds of problems if so? Like I said, I&#39;m pretty clueless with this ki",
