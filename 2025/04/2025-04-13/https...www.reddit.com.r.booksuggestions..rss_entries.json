But it reminded me of another classic I was assigned in college. It was based in the same time period in China. Similarly the main character started very poor, slowly bought land and took a wife who worked alongside him. The difference was when he brought home a second wife, his father and others laughed at him because she was an older prostitute. Likewise the book ended with his heirs selling off the land. Does anyone know the name of this book? Since I&#39;m now at a very different time in my life, I would like to read it again. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SentenceOne842\"> /u/SentenceOne842 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jyjurr/the_good_earth/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jyjurr/the_good_earth/\">[comments]</",

I read at least 3 books per week. It was my favorite hobby. Until my mom and grandpa started telling me to read useful books, or books from which I could learn. I stopped reading for fun and started to \u201clearn\u201d on my free time. But it was so tiring, I started to hate to read. I am 24 now. And Since then I haven\u2019t been able to enjoy reading and barely read any books, I want to start again. </p> <p>Please recommend me books! I used to love shadow hunters, Percy Jackson, Jurassic park, Harry Potter, hunger games, fablehaven, the zombie survival guide. </p> <p>I loved fantastical stories, and I do like when they have some romance. Other things i like are dinosaurs, zombies, and I adore paranormal stories (ghost, demons, not psychological thrillers).

Some examples - Pirates of the Caribbean, The Mummy, maybe Pearl Harbor. All movie examples but you get the idea. Pearl Harbor doesn&#39;t seem quite in the same vein I guess but what I like is that yea there was romance but then there was the war too which kept things more interesting and exciting. So historical fiction is totally fair game as long as it&#39;s not only about the romance with nothing else going on.</p> <p>I&#39;m fine with a little spice if the story is good but personally I don&#39;t love smut so nothing super heavy on it or the kind where the character&#39;s internal thou",
