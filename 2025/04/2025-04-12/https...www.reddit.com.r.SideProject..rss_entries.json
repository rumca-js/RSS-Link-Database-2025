The vision was to create a platform similar to Google Drive \u2014 but smarter. We wanted users to be able to upload their files and documents, organize them into&quot;buckets&quot; and folders, and then ask questions to instantly find the information they needed.</p> <p>We launched in January of this year and have been trying to grow it organically. So far, we\u2019ve run small ad campaigns on platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and Reddit. These efforts have brought in about <strong>150 sign-ups</strong>, although not all of them actively use the app \u2014 some sign up without uploading files or asking questions.</p> <p>Recently, we also introduced a <strong>guest mode</strong>, allowing people to use the app without creating an account. That change brought in an additional <strong>60 users</",
