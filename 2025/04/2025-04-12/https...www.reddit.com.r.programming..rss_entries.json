Uncommitted changes appear just like <code>git status</code>, and y<strong>ou can run Git actions like committing, rebasing, resolving conflicts, and managing branches \u2014 all from the UI.</strong></p> <p>When paired with <a href=\"https://cli.github.com/\">GitHub CLI</a>, it also shows PR status, CI results, and comment counts inline.</p> <p>It\u2019s inspired by Meta\u2019s Smartlog (from the Sapling source control system), but adapted for Git.</p> <p>Would love feedback if you try it out.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/da",
