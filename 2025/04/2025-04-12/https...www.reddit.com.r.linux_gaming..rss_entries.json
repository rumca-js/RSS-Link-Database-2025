I have been search a lot about that and for proton the GitHub explains itself, for native Linux games (source) there is a valve documentation (example: CS2) but for commands that are not related to proton itself or valve games I just cant find the explanation.

With live service games you don&#39;t have to because you are under developers&#39; control, which breaks the core idea of Linux itself (which is also the reason why Android and ChromeOS have their own category). And with live service games came out microtransactions, repetitiveness and other bad things in game design. Therefore the easiest way to play competitive games is to switch back to self-hosting. Plus with self-hosting it is easier to ban 2 or 3 players among 20 or 30 players (of course the more players on one server the harder to ban cheaters).</p> <p>If you think that we should solve this problem the modern way then why are there people who switch from digital to physical media, from smart to &quot;dumb&quot; phones?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheTrueOrangeGuy\"> /u/TheTrueOrange",
