If you&#39;re unfamiliar with this opera, it is based on the same Norse myth that inspired LOTR and the music inspired the music in Star Wars. Anyways on to the review!</p> <p>I thought it would be fun to count this for bingo not a book because it is definitely something I wouldn&#39;t usually do. It was my first opera and I really enjoyed it and the music was incredible. You could definitely see the influence it had on the music in Star Wars. Also the story was about an all powerful ring that corrupts those who use it. I found the story simple, but entertaining enough. I think the &quot;villains&quot; were definitely more dynamic than the &quot;good&quot; guys. I found the Norse gods to be very boring. Which is someth",

This was an attempt to create an atlas spanning the entire history of J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s fantasy legendarium, including detailed maps of the lands explored in <em>The Hobbit</em>, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em>The Silmarillion</em>. The revised edition drew on <em>Unfinished Tales</em> and the twelve-volume <strong>History of Middle-earth</strong> series to flesh out the map collection. The <em>Atlas</em> had a lot of fans, with Christopher Tolkien writing warmly about its accuracy and Tolkien artist Alan Lee talking about how it was used as a reference for the making of Peter Jackson&#39;s <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong> movie trilogy.</p> <p>Mrs. Fonstad herself paid tribute to earlier pioneers of Middle-earth cartography, including Pauline Baynes&#39; <em>A Map of Middle-earth</em> ",

I&#39;ve always been a &#39;card&#39; enthusiast/collector and enjoyed their added presence in fantasy media, whether that&#39;s playing cards (think 52 card poker decks), trading cards games like Magic The Gathering, video games (Lost Kingdoms 1 and 2, Gwent, or more recently Balatro), or even Tarot-style divination decks. </p> <p>Seeing original card games or decks in fantasy books has always just added a little extra <strong>oomph</strong> to my reading enjoyment. Off the top of my head I can recall &#39;The Deck of Dragons&#39; in <em>Malazan</em>, &#39;Nine Kings&#39; from the <em>Lightbringer</em> series, and recently &#39;Towers&#39; from <em>The Blacktongue Thief</em> (which I hear the author is adapting into a real set of playable cards which I&#39;m very excited for!)</p> <p>What other types of cards/decks can you all recall from fantasy books?

I&#39;m looking for stories that begin with &quot;Once Upon a Time.&quot; They don&#39;t have to be for children (in fact bonus points if they&#39;re not) but I&#39;m fine with their being YA or what have you so long as they&#39;re good. No Brother&#39;s Grimm or the like please, and though I would prefer novels short stories are also appreciated along with, yes, fairy tales if one is so inclined.

But, I would like to see small operations instead of big wars. A group of bandits trying to steal, assassins trying to kill, or a group of special forces kidnapping, killing, destroying supply lines, and harming the enemy. I&#39;ve read Steelheart, and I liked how the author wrote the missions the team does. They&#39;re a small group, weaker than their enemies, so they do their best, using every skill they&#39;ve, and plan well for their plans, and even had backup plans if the main plan failed or needed to be changed\u2014which happens a lot\u2014and trying to survive.

Unfortunately, two recommendations I got along these lines (Hamilton&#39;s <em>Pandora&#39;s Star</em> and Tchaikovsky&#39;s <em>Shards of Earth</em>) really did not work for me due to not connecting with the characters and writing styles, so I am hoping for some other stuff.</p> <p>I&#39;ve got Alastair Reynolds&#39; <em>Revelation Space</em> trilogy lined up to get to soon, but what else works for this?

I am listening to the Wheel of Time for the first time in my life as a soon to be 33 year old. I am currently in book 6 and I do love these books. However, I have a hard time keeping track on a lot of minor characters, since I do not listen to the books everyday. I have a lot of stuff going on in my life with studies, my own writing, hobbies, friends and so on, so I find myself often forgetting minor characters and places mentioned previously in the books. </p> <p>I wonder if there are resources online for this. I love the interactive maps to keep track of the story beats, but I wonder if there are similar sites for minor characters? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xoldsteel\"> /u/xoldsteel </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jx4v7y/keeping_track_of_wheel",

But before I jump into more of a &quot;heavy&quot; read I&#39;m looking for something a little lighter.
