I came here as the only other community regarding digital independence had fewer members and after reading the introductive post, I thought that this would be the place to be asking around. Recently I have gotten into the EU alternatives for some services like mailing, internet search engines, vpn providers and others. I truly understand that the best thing I could be doing is just giving up my Gmail account and any other information related or connected to it, alongside the Microsoft part with 365 and outlook. At a point I wish to move over Linux and go raw with the &quot;MAN&quot; approach and maybe get into programming but, before I do that, I would like to know how you guys have started your journeys. In these current times I think giving up some comfort and actually caring about the honest open-source communities is going to be better for me and the others. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",
