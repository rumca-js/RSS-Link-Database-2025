Her father was a famous hockey player ( and maybe now a sports commentator/ podcaster with another person). She wants to enter the hockey field for a job and has an interview at a sports news place (I think it&#39;s sports news) but interviewer/ boss is sexist and doesn&#39;t pay her any serious attention even despite knowing all the stats. He happens to mention the MMC (her rival) and in her annoyance, mention that he&#39;s her bf (spoiler he&#39;s not).

As you can see the plot is balls to the walls but I&#39;m more interested in the world building of the novel. Telecomunications are falling and strage UFO phenomena lurks in the sky.

I primarily listen when driving or at the gym, so audiobooks please! </p> <p>I like mysteries, especially esoteric, alien, fantasy, magical, or weird ones. The idea of Lovecraftian is amazing to me, but I never really clicked with his writing itself, sadly. I already listened to about half of the Dresden Files series, good books! But I need a break from them as they&#39;re getting a bit same-y back to back.</p> <p>my favorite series are The Expanse, by James S.A. Corey and the Dune books. I just really like things that will make me think about the setting and the mysteries in it after i stop listening/reading. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LordSephiran\"> /u/LordSephiran </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jxf8gi/audiobook_recommendations_for_a_scififantasy/\">[link]</a></span",

I love fantasy books with magic and some romance (tho I\u2019m embarrassed by it). I\u2019d like recommendations that are similar in vibes. Cutesy fantasy romance and may some suspense thrown in there. </p> <p>For a bit of background, I\u2019m 23 yrs old but I\u2019ve not moved into overly adult or spicy books. Not saying necessarily that there can\u2019t be spice but keeping it more at a jalepeno spice at most and not a Carolina reaper. The last book I really enjoyed was the ballad of songbirds and snakes. Most of my favorite books are YA (hunger games, Harry Potter, maze runner, Percy Jackson, etc.) but because I\u2019m older I\u2019d like to transition into the adult books. </p> <p>Thanks in advance!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Artemis_Stars\"> /u/Artemis_Stars </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1jx73dq/books_similar_vibes_",

But when I looked for it where I live (the U.S.), I had no luck finding anything by the author. But now I have a friend who is heading your way for a visit &amp; I thought I\u2019d set her on finding it for me. Problem is, I don\u2019t remember any details (except maybe it was a woman author &amp; maybe it was a first novel?) if that rings any bells, or even if you have a fav Australian author that might not be well known outside of down under, I\u2019d love to know.
