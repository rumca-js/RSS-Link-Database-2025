Several years ago, Bandersnatch, a special spin-off episode of the anthology series, which tells dark, cautionary tales about the use of technology, turned heads for putting interactivity directly in a TV show. You were able to, by using simple either-or choices, choose which path the story took, to a degree. What was clever about it was how the function mirrored form, as the episode itself followed the creation of a game offering a similar kind of choice - or an illusion of choice, as the case turned out to be. There were many meta layers to it. And now an episode in the brand new series of Black Mirror, released on Netflix this week, is trying to do a similar thing.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-netflix-black-mirror-series-has-another-bandersnatch-like-gaming-crossover-moment-but-y",
