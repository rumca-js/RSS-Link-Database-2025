The study further highlights that the carbon abundance in the planet is estimated to be\u00a0-1.5 dex, while the effective temperature could be around 1,000 K. The author of the paper further revealed that the low metallicity of the T dwarf planet could be due to the non-detection of atomic potassium.",

The slab, a remnant of the Farallon plate, has been identified through seismic imaging and simulations as the cause of this geological activity. Researchers say this underground movement extends beyond the Midwest, reshaping our understanding of cratonic stability in North America.",
