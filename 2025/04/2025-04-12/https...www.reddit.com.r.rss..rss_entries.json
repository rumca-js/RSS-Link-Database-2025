Personally I want sites to know that I am coming to them via their RSS feeds, and I want articles I share around the web to keep those URL arguments that show that the article originated from their RSS feed. It&#39;s a great way to let these sites know how much activity truly comes from RSS.</p> <p>So if you haven&#39;t already, please whitelist any RSS/feed related parameters. It won&#39;t compromise your privacy; it will only show that your click/share originated from an RSS feed.</p> <p>For example:</p> <pre><code>@@$removeparam=/^utm_source=rss$/ @@$removeparam=/^utm_medium=rss$/ @@$removeparam=/^utm_campaign=rss$/ @@$removeparam=/^utm_source=feed$/ </code></pre> <p>Feel free to add any others or let me know if the format or syntax is off. These seem to be working for me but YMMV.</p> <p>Edit:",

Really I\u2019d kind of like something more like a personalized daily news paper. Ideally this is what I\u2019d like to see (in this order):</p> <p>Brief world news summary, updated daily</p> <p>Top 3-5 local news articles</p> <p>New releases or tour announcements for selected bands (this one is probably a stretch)</p> <p>Assorted popular science, popular history, and recipes</p> <p>I was also wondering if I could control the volume of certain things I see. For example, if I subscribe to King Arthur Baking and Science News, I\u2019ll run through like 10 science articles before I hit a recipe. If there\u2019s a way to compensate for that, that would be a huge help.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure if this is something RSS is even able to do, so please let me know if I just need to manage my exp",
