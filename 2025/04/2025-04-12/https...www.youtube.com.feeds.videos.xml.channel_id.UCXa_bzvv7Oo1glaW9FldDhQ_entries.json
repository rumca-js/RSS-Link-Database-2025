        "description": "It has been far too long since we got a new Uncharted, with Naughty Dog\u2019s beloved action adventure series last having seen a new entry nearly a decade ago, in 2017, with The Lost Legacy. Few other Uncharted-esque titles have graced PlayStation in the time since then, but thankfully for those who have a longing for that style of thrilling, bombastic, globe-trotting, treasure hunting experience, there\u2019s something to focus your attention on. \n\nMachineGames and Xbox\u2019s Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launches soon for PS5, and though there are many obvious ways it differs from the Uncharted experience, it also strikes a lot of the same cords. Fans of Naughty Dog\u2019s dormant franchise owe it to themselves to check it out.",

        "description": "There are plenty of games out there that take their sweet time to get going and show you just what they\u2019re really made of before cementing themselves as unabashed masterpieces. \n\nBut while there\u2019s no hard and fast rule that demands that, it is undeniable that there\u2019s something special about games that show their hand right away, putting all (or most) of their biggest strengths on full display right off the bat, whether that\u2019s through storytelling that instantly grabs attention or with gameplay mechanics and systems that waste no time in getting their hooks into you. \n\nHere, we\u2019re going to discuss a few titles that do just that and make an incredibly strong first impression.",
