        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi there, so i am starting my own project and i needed to design the db i am going with dual db, sql and no sql probably postgres and mongodb as final choice. So i managed to make a structureed schema for my basic stuff like user handling login signup person data role management etc. in sql and now when it came time for no sql i suddenly had problem, no sql is suppos to deal with large data although consistent it is still large amount. By large i am referring to data being around 2-3 pages with approx 13-15 lines per page on a4 (like really edge case) in its original language then it needs to have translation and not to mention other explaining things that it needs to have like links and video tags or sub infos. Now how do i deal with this if i add everything in single document that will definitely exceed size 15 mb and plus it will cause really unnecessary load by carrying everything every time when you really dont need it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",
