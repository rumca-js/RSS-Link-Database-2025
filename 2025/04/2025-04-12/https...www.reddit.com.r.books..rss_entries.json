The way he paints such complex portraits of his characters, all while weaving together themes of love, society, and individual purpose, is unmatched.</p> <p>One thing that really stood out to me was how the novel, especially Levin\u2019s story, tackles the question of life&#39;s meaning. Levin spends so much of the book wrestling with doubt, questioning his place in the world, and trying to make sense of life\u2019s purpose. It felt like a deep dive into nihilism - feeling that nothing really matters. But by the end of the novel, Levin\u2019s realization really hit me: life itself may seem meaningless, but it&#39;s our actions, especially the good we do, that give it meaning. It&#39;s not about grand achievements or escaping society\u2019s pressures; it\u2019s about living authentically, loving those around us, and finding purpose in the small but meaningful actions we take each day",
