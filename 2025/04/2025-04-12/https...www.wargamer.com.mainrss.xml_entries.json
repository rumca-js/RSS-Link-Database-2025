He\u2019s carried the idea with him for over 25 years, and in the last five he\u2019s invested over a million dollars of his own money to open an American factory that will produce plastic miniatures to the same high standard as the globally popular Warhammer range. Yet if Trump\u2019s current tariff regime had been in place when Block began the process, he says he \u201csimply would not have started the project\u201d.</p>\n \t",
