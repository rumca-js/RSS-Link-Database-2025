Got a question regarding vehicular protection, particularly for the Fate of the Furious fans. </p> <p>Referring to the scene where Cipher hacks the cars and runs them off of buildings: is that likely to ever happen IRL? For those who haven&#39;t seen it: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kToFKqsCVLQ\">The Fate of the Furious | Raining Cars Scene in 4K HDR</a></p> <p>When I saw this scene, I knew instantly that I wanted to go into vehicular cyber protection. Always wanted to become a mechanic, but that isn&#39;t feasible due to a few disadvantages including cars being more computer than car these days. With Teslas being self-driving now, and many vehicles offering in-unit Wi-Fi, I can see possibilities of this on the horizon. If I start studying for this (i.e., both auto and cyber fields) now (graduate in 4 years) would the demand be likely to increase for these kinds of specialists? Do these specialists exist at all?</p> <p>TIA!</p> </di",
