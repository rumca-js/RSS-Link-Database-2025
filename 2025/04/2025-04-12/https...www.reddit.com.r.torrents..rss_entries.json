I attempted to upload the 1.1G file to GDrie, but GDrive said it would take 50 - 60 minutes to upload, and the number was increasing. </p> <p>Since the original download only took 7 minutes, I decided to see if it would be faster to download the torrent data a second time, instead of copying to GDrive from my local ",
