        "description": "Yuzu has been trending in the United States for a few years now. Michelin-starred chefs, craft breweries, and foodies across the country pay a premium for the hard-to-find fruit. All the while, in Japan, yuzu has been a staple for centuries. The country is one of the top producers and consumers of yuzu, growing about 27,000 tons a year. But strict importation regulations keep yuzu from Japanese producers, like Senkoji Farms, out of the United States, leaving fans to depend on the few stateside producers, like Flavors by Bhumi. But growing yuzu in the US, especially on the East Coast, comes with its challenges. We visited both farms to see how yuzu in Japan compares to yuzu in the US and to understand why it's so expensive here.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#yuzu #japan #businessinsider \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessins",
