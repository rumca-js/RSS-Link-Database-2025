This was basically the first performance where an actor gained a lot of weight for the role which inspired many other actors to do the same thing to this day. His performance is raw, unfiltered, angry, and completely believable as Jake LaMotta. This performance is right up there with Brando in The Godfather and Daniel Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood. This film is just a perfect character study of a violent guy slowly destroying his own life professionally and personally. The black and white was perfect for this film as well, it almost made the boxing scenes feel more vicious in a weird way. The scene in jail where he\u2019s punching the wall and crying and screaming is some of the finest acting you could ever see.

When I first watched it back in 05 I hated Ratchel, she was whiney and annoying and her high pitched screaming irritated me. Now, after about 10 years I have 2 daughters and I 100% empathize with her. I can\u2019t imagine trying to keep my kids alive in an apocalyptic environment when they won\u2019t even listen to me long enough to make sure their school iPads are charged.

In Sonic 2, Knuckles the Echidna is introduced right after we see Dr. Robotnik and his time spent on the mushroom planet. This approach is highly effective because it builds tension for the audience, making them aware of the looming threat to the protagonist(s).</p> <p>A similar technique is used in other films, such as Avengers: Infinity War. The movie opens with Thanos, a powerful and menacing figure determined to eliminate half of the universe\u2019s population. At this point, viewers don\u2019t yet understand his full intentions, which naturally sparks curiosity. Questions like &quot;Who is he?&quot; &quot;What does he want?&quot; and &quot;Why is he d",
