But if AI ever gets smart enough, they may legally have to because shareholders replace your job. Now theoretically that means the same stuff is getting done but now theirs an extra person who can go do something else. The problem is because of how our economy works they no longer have a source of income and no one private entity has a reason to provide one. We may need UBI as everyone WILL lose their jobs under the current economy. The only other option is relying on the kindness of people which is not a good idea.

Currently, I&#39;m delving into optimization algorithms like Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA), as well as reinforcement learning methods such as DQN, Q-learning, and A3C.</p> <p>I was wondering if it&#39;s feasible to combine one of these optimization algorithms (SA or GA) with a reinforcement learning approach (like DQN, Q-learning, or A3C) to create a hybrid model for UAV navigation.

By separating planning and execution between different model roles, it effectively creates a self-steering system that can tackle complex reasoning tasks.</p> <p>Key technical contributions: * <strong>Planner-Follower architecture</strong>: A larger model generates executable programs while smaller models follow these instructions * <strong>Recursive decomposition</strong>: Complex problems are broken down into manageable sub-tasks * <strong>Monte Carlo inference</strong>: Multiple solution paths are explored in parallel to improve reliability * <strong>Self-verification</strong>: The system can validate its own outputs using the programs it generates * <strong>Zero-shot adaptation</strong>: No fine-tuning is required for the models to operate in this framework</p> <p>In experiments, DisCIPL achieved impressive results: * Smaller",
