There was no login and It has a console on the web UI. If you search the console commands from Tasmota, it is kind of insane the amount of access it allows. Access points with passwords is just one of many. Longitude/Latitude. Smart home server username and password. Amongst just full access to everything the plug is running and any GPIO modules and voltages.
