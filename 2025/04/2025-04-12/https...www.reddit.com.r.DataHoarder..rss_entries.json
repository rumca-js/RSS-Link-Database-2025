Also, when I update my library with Soundly I have to do it twice and it takes a long time.</p> <p>So, I thought of getting one of these three: Samsung T5, SanDisk Extreme, WD_Black SN850P. I excluded HDD as they&#39;re noisy, cumbersome, and more prone to failing as I need an intense, daily use, moving them often from place to place.</p> <p>By confronting them, I think the samsung it&#39;s too slow (although it&#39;s got a nice case), the sandisk is a middle way, and the WD the fastest one, but I need a case.

I\u2019ve averaged a little over 1TB d/l each day for the past two weeks (my 140TB array doesn\u2019t seem so big after all). My ISP has a 1.2TB monthly cap, but thankfully it doesn\u2019t apply since I\u2019m in the Northeast region.</p> <p>Still, I think that may raise some red flags somewhere\u2026. I\u2019ve paused d/l\u2019s for now.</p> <p>Just wondering what others experience has been\u2026</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SickPup404\"> /u/SickPup404 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1jx4v8u/how_much_is_too_much/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1jx4v8u/how_m",
