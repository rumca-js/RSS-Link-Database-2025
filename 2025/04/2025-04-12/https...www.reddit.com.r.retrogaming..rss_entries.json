I\u2019m looking for some kind of NES/Famicom game storage solution. Most of everything I\u2019m finding is some kind of display shelf type deal. I don\u2019t have the luxury of dedicated gaming space so that won\u2019t really work for me. I\u2019m seeing these vintage travel cases on EBay that had padded pockets for the carts and/or system which is kind of what I\u2019m looking for. Is there anything that\u2019s new out there like that that protects/organizes but also is still portable to where it can go from one room to another pretty easily? My fallback is just plastic tubs under the bed but I figured there has to be a more streamlined solution out there somewhere.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/docsuess84\"> /u/docsuess84 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jxukk3/cartridge_storage/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <s",

During this time when I\u2019ve wanted to play old games I\u2019ve either relied on emulation or more recently Switch online.

It was about 20-30 minutes long, looked like Xbox 360 era graphics, and featured a boatload of Nintendo characters. Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Wario, Starfox, Ash, Pikachu, Metroid, Yoshi, Metal Gear Solid Snake, Donkey Kong, Princess Peach, etc. there was no dialogue, just music and sound effects. It involved various characters trying to disarm/run from bombs, characters being turned into statues, and lots of villains wielding doofy ray guns. Can anybody shed some light onto what we were watching? No gameplay, just solid cutscenes. Was it a Mexico knockoff?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GoFlingYourself\"> /u/GoFlingYourself </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1jxfeae/long_mexico_video/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://ww",
