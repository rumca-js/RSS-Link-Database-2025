My group came up with the idea of building a machine that measures the roundness of a cylindrical part by rotating it in front of a ranging sensor. I want to use a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor to rotate the part and a VL53L0X ranging sensor to measure the distance. The entire frame will be 3D printed. I know that the machine won\u2019t be nearly as accurate as other methods of measuring roundness, but I don\u2019t think this will be an issue because the main focus is on the code for our machine. Are there better sensors available? I work at a company that builds real CMMs, and I know that tactile measurement would be much more accurate, but our budget is 50\u20ac, and even the cheapest tactile measuring probes cost around 300\u20ac.

I&#39;m confident that it&#39;s installed properly, and the thermal pad did compress a little. The heat sink gets warm to the touch. It&#39;s not particularly hot but I wouldn&#39;t expect it to be given the low dissipation. </p> <p>Had anyone else looked at temps for this device with and without a heatsink?
