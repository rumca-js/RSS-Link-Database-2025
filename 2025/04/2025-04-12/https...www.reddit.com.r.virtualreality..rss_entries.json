        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was really, really excited by VR back in 2016. I bought a Rift CV1 pretty early on and was 100% convinced PCVR was the future of entertainment. I upgraded the Rift to an Index, and enjoyed that, but over the years realized I wasn&#39;t putting much time into it. The glare and LCD screens kinda killed it for me, and Valve seemed to more or less abandon it after Alyx, so I sold it a couple of years ago. But then the Quest 3 came out, and it seemed like a good way to still be &quot;in&quot; with VR without having a huge investment. Plus the promise of wireless PCVR seemed pretty cool, and Meta was one of the last companies really investing in VR in a big way.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I have not enjoyed the Quest 3 too much. PCVR with it feels like a perpetual hack with reliance on a 3rd party app maintained by one guy for it to even work. Wireless has also been a total nightmare for me -- I bought several dedicated routers with no luck, spent hours trying",

Quest Pro is what everyone has recommended and lauded for a long time for this. But I cannot buy that headset from meta anymore. That&#39;s done and over.</p> <p>I already have a quest 3 and overall happy with it but I haven&#39;t found anything to actually enable face tracking and such and so I&#39;m kinda SOL.</p> <p>I&#39;m... really not sure how to even go about doing this if I&#39;m honest? I&#39;m in Canada and idk I&#39;m on edge like really bad about buying used because I did just get scammed a few months ago. So I&#39;m wary I&#39;m too guilliable.</p> <p>EDIT: I just found a reseller, not official meta/amazon, for a quest pro for $1600 CAD. Do I do it?</p> <p>EDIT 2: Or bestbuy marketplace? I found one apparently that is &quot;excellent&quot; refurbished for $950 CAD... do I just do it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
