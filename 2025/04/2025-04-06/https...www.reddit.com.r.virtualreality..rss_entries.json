Is there supposed to be a noticeable visual difference between 200/100 and 50mbps? </p> <p>I found Auto to be the worst, when no disconnects happen the quality fluctuates between crisp and pixelated. Capping the bandwidth was the solution and I&#39;m just want to gauge peoples experience.</p> <p>In terms of Render Resolution is it best left to &quot;Auto&quot;. So when in VR games via steam it can adjust to presets I set in game? e.g. 1.2x resolution scale. </p> <p>Thanks for any input/help.
