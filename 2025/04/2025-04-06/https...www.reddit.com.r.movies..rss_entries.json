I think fire was involved (im not 100% sure tho)</p> <p>- The toys were going to atack the main characters.</p> <p>- It was either an action, or a horror.</p> <p>- May have been a series as it may have ended on a cliff-hanger (for the next episode) or there was an ad break idk.</p> <p>I would really want to rewatch this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aggravating_Sky9814\"> /u/Aggravating_Sky9814 </",

And I didn&#39;t.</p> <p>But I did see something <em>surprisingly</em> funny and decently-made. Make no mistake: this is a stupid, silly movie, a takeoff on low-budget 1950s alien invader films. In this one, alien foreheads from a dying planet come to conquer Earth by fastening themselves to human foreheads and taking control. No, REALLY.</p> <p>One of the main features of the film is incredibly stilted, overblown, illogical, and clunky dialog. But any idiot can write lousy dialog, and even if you have a good actor delivering it, it still sounds bad, like when Alec Guinness tried to mouth the crap George Lucas wrote in Star Wars.</p> <p>I remember the first time I saw Pulp Fiction. At first, I was thinking, &quot;wow, this dialog is amazing! It&#39;s just like real people ",

Scott movies &amp; show and I must say, George C. Scott really is a great actor. He has such a commanding presence when he is on screen, but he also manages to give such a vulnerable side to what character he plays. To me his best roles are Dr. Strangelove &amp; Patton. Dr. Strangelove, for the sheer fact that he (&amp; Also Slim Pickens) managed to outplay Peter Sellers and Patton, which is just a great performance and I consider it the best role he has ever played. He also deliver great performances in Anatomy Of A Muder, The Hustler, The Bible, The Hospital, Hardcore, The Changeling, A Christmas Carol.</p> <p>I will say though, while George C. Scott is a great actor, some of the films he is in are probably not so great, which is why I think his film career stalled after the 70s, with films like The Last Run, Rage, The Day Of The Dolphin, Bank",

There are so many amazing actors who disappear in roles, thanks to not only their own talent, but also the number of people behind them who assist with various aspects necessary to create the character\u2026it\u2019s one of my favorite things about movies - how many people come together to create art that is totally unique even when the \u201cmaterials used\u201d to create it are the same. </p> <p>What other movie combos should I watch that will break my brain that the same actor plays a role in each? (Excluding Gary Oldman, Walton Goggins, Brad Douriff, and the like, because they\u2019ve already \u2018fooled\u2019 me \ud83e\udd23)</p> <p>PS I don\u2019t care about spoilers,",
