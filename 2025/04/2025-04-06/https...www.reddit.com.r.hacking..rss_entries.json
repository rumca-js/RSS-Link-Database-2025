Her partner told her that he has been &quot;watching and recording her through her phone&quot; and says &quot;he knows all that she does&quot;. I would have considered it just empty words, but he called her out multiple times now for saying certain things he didn&#39;t approve of during phone calls and also for searching divorce-related things on her phone. So, it seems he might be serious about the monitoring. He works in cybersecurity and knows how to code.</p> <p>Any idea HOW he might be doing this? My sister has gotten a new phone secretly-- but she kept the old one, to maybe use as proof. What can she look for? Is there anything that can be done?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sonderiru\"> /u/sonderiru </a> <br/> <span><a href=",
