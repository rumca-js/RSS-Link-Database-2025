Like the title said, I have a 4TB Seagate Backup Plus portable HDD that I&#39;ve been using as a backup dump for all of my personal files for a few years now, and only recently have I started to pay more attention to my HDD&#39;s usage and trying to prolong its lifespan a bit before investing in a new drive in maybe a year or two.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen some posts in this sub regarding keeping external HDD&#39;s plugged in at all times, but mine is not a &quot;heavy duty&quot; requires external power source type of HDD like the ones in the other posts, so I&#39;m not exactly sure if the same answers apply. Should I only plug my portable HDD into my laptop when I need to use it and unplug right after use, or is it safe for me to keep it plugged in? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/venjah\"> /u/venjah </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/",
