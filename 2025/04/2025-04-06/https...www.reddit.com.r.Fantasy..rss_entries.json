From D&amp;D worlds like Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms. Warhammer Old World.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A few months ago, my TikTok was getting absolutely spammed with videos praising Brandon Sanderson and his books. Everywhere I looked, people were recommending his work like it was the holy grail of fantasy literature. Since I\u2019m into fantasy, world building, and clever magic systems, I figured yeah, this sounds like something I\u2019d enjoy.</p> <p>I started with The Emperor\u2019s Soul just to get a taste of his writing. And honestly.. it was fine. Not bad, but not amazing either. Looking back, that should\u2019ve been my first warning sign, especially since I kept seeing people call it one of his best.</p> <p>From there, I figured the most consistent way to dive into his universe would be by reading his works in release order, to avoid potential dips in quality. So next up was Elantris. I\u2019d read online that it\u2019s his first published book and not to expect much, so I went in with lowered expectations. And again, it was just\u2026 okay. Same vibe as The Emperor\u2019s Soul. No",
