Known as the Brixton Bard, he wrote fiercely but with understanding, energy and humour in a series of adult novels, starting with Brixton Rock (1999), before switching to young adult (YA) fiction.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/06/alex-wheatle-obituary\">Continue reading...<",
