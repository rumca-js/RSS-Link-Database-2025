        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey,</p> <p>I commonly see an advice for putting all external facing devices (e.g. home servers) to their own VLAN (DMZ) which would be isolated from the rest of your home network. I might be missing something but I don&#39;t really see its purpose in homelabs considering you probably want the devices on your home/&quot;main&quot; VLAN (phones, laptops etc.) to be able to locally communicate with these external facing devices (e.g. to access your selfhosted apps) while at home. The communication also doesn&#39;t have to be one way (home VLAN -&gt; DMZ) but in some cases you might want the DMZ to be able to access your home VLAN as well (e.g. local notifications). That would however mean that you would have to give the home VLAN and the DMZ network access to each other which would defeat the purpose of the DMZ, wouldn&#39;t it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Red_Con_\"> /u/Red_Con_ </a> <br/> <spa",

Since I&#39;m using proxmox, I can edit via some CTs, such as the qbittorrent shell and the fileserver shell (the samba one). I can also edit via cockpit GUI, but for example, I can&#39;t edit via Windows, or via ubuntu, and on Windows, the error appears; &quot;You need permission from FILESERVER/nobody to make changes to the folder, I really don&#39;t know what to do anymore.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried using chmod and chown on ALL LXC&#39;s (qbittorrent and fileserver), but it says &quot;Operation not permitted&quot;.</p> <p>What do you think I should do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/brazilianreninja\"> /u/brazilianreninja </a> <br/>",

After pulling all my hair out, I found this workaround that allows my guest clients connect to the internet through my Adguard Home server.</p> <p>There is a setting in Deco app called Port Forwarding in Advance menu. I used this to forward port 53 to my Adguard server IP as DNS service. Then in the DNS Server setting, I declared Adguard server IP as primary DNS and my Deco IP (which is 192.168.68.1) as secondary DNS then volla my guest network now can access internet through Adguard!</p> <p>P/s: for simplicity you can just declared the Deco IP as primary DNS for both main and guest network if you don&#39;t care about usage history since Adguard will report all usages from a single user (the Deco IP itself).</p> <p>Caution: If your Deco is not behind any other router/firewall (your Deco is doing PPPo",
