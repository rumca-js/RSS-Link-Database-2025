I&#39;ve signed up for multiple NZB and other Usenet related services over the years, so it&#39;s very possible that this is a service I signed up for once and didn&#39;t realize I was subscribing to. I want to end the subscription but I can&#39;t figure out which service it is for. Does anyone know what service could be charging me? I tried calling the phone # but it is always busy.
