        "description": "I'm back from AdeptiCon, and I'm hobbying... but not with any particular purpose, it seems. I've been just kinda painting random models and I don't seem to have a plan. I'll talk about why this happens to me sometimes, and how I try to get out of it. And of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game!
