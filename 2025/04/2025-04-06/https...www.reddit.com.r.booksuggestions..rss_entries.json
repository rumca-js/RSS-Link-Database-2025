She meets someone and he learns to take time in getting to know her, but isn\u2019t overbearing or pressuring her. They start off as friends or meet through mutual friends? Throughout the course of them knowing each other he shows that he\u2019s a reliable person and does things for her without her having to ask. Not all the time but things that would make her think about them afterwards. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this but if anyone has recommendations on something like this please let me know! Would prefer a long book but not overboard slow that it\u2019s repetitive, drags on or loses the plot. Some eventual spice would be good but not a dealbreaker. However, it doesn\u2019t have to be strictly romance genre. It could be sci fi, fantasy, historical, etc. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/babysloth",

Prefer if it\u2019s an easy read - I\u2019m just getting him into reading so something thats easy to get into is preferred. </p> <p>We have read the red rising series and he really enjoyed it (especially the first three books) and he quite enjoyed sunrise of the reaping.

The push-and-pull? I am <em>here</em> for it.</p> <p>That being said, there were definitely some parts that bothered me. The hero was literally about to kill the heroine, and all the murder talk? Yeah, that didn\u2019t sit well with me. I know it\u2019s a mafia romance, but still... it&#39;s a bit much. I\u2019m fine with darker themes, but I can\u2019t handle a heavy focus on murder. If the book has a darker edge but doesn\u2019t go too far into the <em>really</em> dark stuff (like rape, that\u2019s a hard pass for me), I\u2019m good. I can skim past some murder if it\u2019s ",
