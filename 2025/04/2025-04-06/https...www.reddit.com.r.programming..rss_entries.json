My name is Lucas and I am 17 years old, I am an aspiring indie hacker and I&#39;ve set myself a challenge for this year to launch as many projects as I can before I turn 18 in August. </p> <p>For March, I built <a href=\"http://Devfol.io\"><strong>Devfol.io</strong></a> \u2014 a portfolio builder for developers. You can import your projects from GitHub and Dribbble, pick a theme, and go live with one click to get a portfolio you can drop straight into your CV.</p> <p>This project was built over the course of 4 weeks with the mindset of shipping fast. It was a bit of a challenge but also extremely fun. This is my first using Supabase and Auth.js, so there was definitely a learning curve at the start. I built it fully with TypeScript and Next.js!</p> <p>I&#39;ve put a lot of work into this and hope at least one person can find it useful! I&#39;d love to hear any and all critical feedback :)</p> <p><a href=\"https://devfol.io\">https://devfol.io</a></p> </d",
