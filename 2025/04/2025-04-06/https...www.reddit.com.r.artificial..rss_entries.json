With Anthropic&#39;s research, it has become increasingly evident that this is not the case and that LLMs have real-world understanding. However, with the breadth of knowledge of LLMs, we have yet to experience the &#39;Lee Sedol moment&#39; in which an LLM performs something so creative and smart that it stuns and even outperforms the smartest human. But there is a very good reason why this hasn&#39;t happened yet and why this is soon to change.</p> <p>Models have previously focussed on pre-training using unsupervised learning. This means that the model is rewarded for predicting the next word, i.e., to copy a text as well as possible. This leads to smart, understanding models but not to creativity. The reward signal is too densely populated on the output (every token needs to be correct), hence, the model has no flexibility in how to creat",
