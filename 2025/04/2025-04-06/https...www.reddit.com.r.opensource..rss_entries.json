It&#39;s easy to set up with docker. here, along side other detailed matrices, you can see the track <strong><em>colored with your RAW HR data</em></strong> instead of HR zones. The Matrices are much more detailed, you can zoom on them and view the trend for extended period of time. You can pull previous data to the backend database as well.</p> <p>Here is the project and details : <a href=\"https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/public-fitbit-projects\">https://github.com/arpanghosh8453/public-fitbit-projects</a></p> <p>Feel free to share your thoughts or suggestions.
