So, while Americans have suffered for far too long under leftists' open-border policies, that is no longer the status quo, and the left can\u2019t handle that. And to call that a slap in the face to law-abiding Americans would be an understatement. </p><p>Vance called out Democrats for their deranged priorities, as these people care more that \u201cthe person who murdered [Jocelyn Nungaray] is getting shipped back home where they belong\u201d rather than the fact that an innocent, young American died as a result of leftists' social experiments.</p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">VP Vance calls out C",
