As for the console itself, I hear there are a lot of variations and potential quality issues to look out for. I know very little about the SNES world other than I really like Link to the Past and have been impressed with the graphics I&#39;ve seen online with other SNES games, so I would like to explore what it has to offer. For a flashcart, I&#39;ll probably go with an FXPak Pro or X6 Everdrive unless someone has a better suggestion (please, no Mister proselytizers, they&#39;ve already come by my door with pamphlets). Another option is I could pay the inflated eBay prices for an Analogue Super NT. They&#39;re quite a bit more $, though, so it would only make sense to go that way if there&#39;s a lot of obstacles to dodge in getting original hardware. Thanks for a",

No sound either.</p> <p>I found out through Google that I might need to convert the RF signal to PAL. I came across some threads on Reddit with Amazon links to converters, but the threads are so old that the links are dead.</p> <p>Do such converters still exist at a reasonable price, and what exactly should I be looking for?

I&#39;ve even found the original speakers and have been lucky to find a Sega Genesis Model 1 and a Dreamcast that I had as a kid. I\u2019m so pumped to fire them up!</p> <p>From what I\u2019ve found, the RGB MULTI INPUT on the TV accepts RGB SCART, so I\u2019ve been looking into cables. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve found from RetroGamingCables that seem like solid options:</p> <p>Genesis Model 1 (Stereo RGB SCART): <a href=\"https://www.retrogamingcables.co.uk/sega/mega-drive-1/sega-mega-drive-1-sega-genesis-1-stereo-rgb-av-scart-cable-tv-lead-pro-build\">https://www.retrogamingcables.co.uk/sega/mega-drive-1/sega-mega-drive-1-sega-genesis-1-stereo-rgb-av-scart-cable-tv-lead-pro-build</a></p> <p>Dreamcast (480p RGB SCART powered by RetroTINK): <a href=\"https://www.retrogamingcables.co.uk/sega/SEGA-DREAMCAST-RGB-SCART-CABLES/SEGA-DREAMCAST-480P-RGB",
