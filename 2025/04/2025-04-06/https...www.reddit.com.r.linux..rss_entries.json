After months of looking up how to read ReFS from Linux, I figured out a solution that doesn&#39;t seem to exist anywhere else on the internet: Passing the entire drive (not partition) to a Virtual Machine running Windows.

I started with Mint, then PopOS, and have landed on cachyOS. I&#39;ve used it for about 2 weeks now. Overall, I&#39;m liking Linux and will be sticking with it for at least this month. Here are my main gripes/criticisms about Linux:</p> <ol> <li><p>Drive auto mounting, this should be as simple as a right-click, auto mount on boot checkbox. I didn&#39;t see this in Dolphin nor Nemo but I could be blind. A new user should not have to deal with modifying Fstab.</p></li> <li><p>Keyboard shortcuts and bugs. I&#39;ve found a lot of inconsistencies when it comes to shortcuts. When I was running Cinnamon, I couldn&#39;t create custom shortcuts using Ctrl + shift + any number. I switched to KDE plasma and while I love the alt+space search in concept, it doesn&#39;t trigger half of the time. I&#39;m sure I could investigate it further a",
