Not monetized. Just trying to make economic policy feel a little more real.</p> <p>Curious to know what you think and what you would want added into this!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xenon7-7\"> /u/xenon7-7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http://thecostindex.com\">[link]</a",
