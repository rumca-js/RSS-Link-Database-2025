You can&#39;t move them, but you can manipulate their decisions. By changing the board tiles. This is Zero Orders Tactics.<br/> <em>(also there are 110+ types of pawns + 50 spells, but you got the point)</em></p> <p><strong>Zero Orders Tactics</strong> is an <strong>experimental turn-based puzzle strategy</strong> where you are a <strong>GOD,</strong> not a silly general. Instead of making commands, you are making mountains, lakes, and other divine stuff BECAUSE YOU CAN!</p> <p><strong>Forget about commanding troops - now, you&#39;re shaping the battlefield itself.</strong></p> <p>Nothing is random, everything is predictable, and the battlefield is changing.
