I\u2019ve recently earned the eJPT certification, and my ultimate goal is to get OSCP certified. To prepare for OSCP, which certification should I pursue next? Some people say PNPT is a waste of time, while others claim that CPTS is sufficient. I\u2019m open to all suggestions and would really appreciate your advice.</p> <p>Secondly, When I look at the PNPT certification, I see that the Active Directory labs require at least 16GB of RAM. However, I only have a Mac M1 with 8GB of RAM. I\u2019m not sure how to properly learn Active Directory in this case, as setting up a lab environment seems difficult with my current hardware.

I have reservations on using my personal mobile phone (which has banking apps etc) to test an APK file. I raised to the management to request to purchase mobile phones for testing purposes and the management rejected, saying that we are to trust our agency; otherwise why work with them. As such, the company has rejected our request to purchase separate devices (owned by the company) for testing purchases.
