        "description": "You can never have too many mech games, even if it comes from WarGaming, better known for World of Tanks. Steel Hunters is available now in Steam Early Access for PC while remaining free-to-play, but this is more of a short stop-over than protracted development.\n\nAs such, the overall vision is clear - that of a PvEvP extraction shooter with a mech, having unique abilities and customizable kits. The Hunter in question carry some heft but feel slow, which ties into the sheer destructibility of the environments. However, the overall formula feels surface-level at best, or at least not particularly in-depth, especially given the setting and potential.\n\nThat's not accounting for the progression with its myriad of currencies and convoluted ways to upgrade the mech. Steel Hunters isn't necessarily dead on arrival, and it does have some potential if WarGaming can embrace the chaos. Despite encompassing so many trends, it's seemingly treading water for now.",
