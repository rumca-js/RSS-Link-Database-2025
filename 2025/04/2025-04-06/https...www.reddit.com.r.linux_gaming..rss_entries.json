I&#39;ve followed the <a href=\"https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/\">Nvidia guide on Hyprland</a> and checked everything is running with <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Hardware_video_acceleration\">the Arch wiki guide on video acceleration</a>.</p> <p>From what I can tell, everything seems to be running just fine - streaming 1080p in YT does not significantly increase CPU load, so that checks out.</p> <p>Vesktop, however, is a different story. It keeps all CPU cores at around 30% constantly (with Vesktop closed, I&#39;m idling at ~2%). That&#39;s more than my baseline CPU load with FF, Discord and a bunch of other stuff open on Windows!</p> <pre><",
