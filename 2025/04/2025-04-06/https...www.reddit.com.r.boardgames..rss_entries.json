Our tiny team (me, my wife, and one more awesome human) is working on three games right now. All of them are original, and we\u2019ve been testing the prototypes in youth centers, IT hubs, and cozy anti-cafes.</p> <p>The mechanics are done, and one of the games already has a full design. The others are in progress. We want to launch on Kickstarter soon \u2014 but we can only start with one game. Why Kickstarter? Because we don\u2019t really have a huge budget for now, but want to bring something interesting to the board game society. </p> <p>So I\u2019m asking: which of these three games would catch your eye?

There are some people online saying it\u2019s based on Neom but those could just be people assuming given the name. Hoping you folks might be able to answer or at least have clues.
