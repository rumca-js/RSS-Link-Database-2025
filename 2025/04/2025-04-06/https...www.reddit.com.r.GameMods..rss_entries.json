No more searching for individual mods, everything you need is bundled together. Similar to steam.</p> <p>Improved UI: The user interface has received a major overhaul. It\u2019s now more intuitive and user-friendly.</p> <p>Ability to Retry Failed Mods: If a mod fails to download, the program tries to download it again, this solves some issues that steamcmd has randomly.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your feedback on these updates! Feel free to test it out and let me know if you run into any issues or have suggestions for future improvements.</p> <p>You can grab the latest version on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/alpergur13/SteamModDownloader\">https://github.com/alpergur13/SteamModDownloader</a></p> <",
