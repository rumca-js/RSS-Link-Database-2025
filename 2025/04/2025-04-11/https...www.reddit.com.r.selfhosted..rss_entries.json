My main goal is to achieve the best possible streaming experience with minimal latency by routing traffic directly between the data centers using port forwarding.</p> <p>To confirm my setup, I used <code>iperf</code> between locations, and the performance between the servers is excellent, with speeds up to 200+ Mbps in my tests. For example, connections between Sydney and London, as well as Johannesburg to London, are showing low latency, which is great. However, I\u2019m now facing some challenges related to routing, authentication, and access control that I\u2019d like to address.</p> <p><strong>1.
