They created a new dataset (DataDoP) of professional camera movements to train the system.</p> <p>Main technical components: * <strong>Auto-regressive camera trajectory generation</strong> that predicts next camera pose based on previous poses * <strong>DataDoP dataset</strong> containing professional camera trajectories from high-quality footage * <strong>Hybrid architecture</strong> that considers both geometric scene information and cinematographic principles * <strong>Two-stage training</strong> approach with represe",

Or thinking about combinations of already thought thoughts to check them? </p> <p>Edit about usefulness of such a long thinking: I think for an &quot;existing answer&quot; questions, this might often not be worth it, because the model is either capable of answering the question in seconds or not at all. But consider predicting or forecasting tasks. This is where additional thinking might lead to a better accuracy. </p> <p>Thanks for your ideas! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",
