I am not a fan or that high level development so I took it a bit lower to go into the fiber algorithm how it works,....etc. I was around react-native for some time now and obviously it had the same issue in React which is rerender children components even tho they never changed and to avoid that you have to fill your code with memo,...etc.</p> <p>I came across an idea which mix something like JSX, vue, svelte, Solid.JS into the same thing while using the same API as react</p> <p>Consider this example</p> <p>```jsx</p> <p>function ParentComponent() { </p> <p>const [state, setState] = useState({ numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4] }); </p> <p>useEffect(() =&gt; {}, [state]); </p> <p>return &lt;div style={{ color: &quot;#ff0&quot;, display: &quot;flex&quot; }}&gt;</p> <p>&lt;p&gt;Parent Component&lt;/p&gt;</p> <p>&lt;button onClick={",
