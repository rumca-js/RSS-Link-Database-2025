One could argue it was the electric garage door opener. The first such openers with a radio-based remote controls came to market way back in 1931, predating the first TV remote by 20 years. Comfort and convenience were the motivation behind all three technological advances. In the case of the garage door, people were looking for a way to get out of their cars and into their homes while avoiding the weather. Given that history, it\u2019s a wonder that it took so long to bring IoT technology to the biggest door in the house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the good news is that it\u2019s here now.

Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help safeguard your data and keep intrusive trackers at bay. Plus, they allow you to get around region blocks on streaming services and avoid ISP throttling. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense might not be an option. That\u2019s where a free VPN can come in handy, providing you with much needed security for no cost at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I advise that you opt for a premium VPN, such as those in our roundup of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-apps-reviews-buying-advice.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopen",
