I\u2019ve really been enjoying it and it\u2019s put me in the mood to read more urban fantasy books from that time period. I\u2019m probably showing my age here, but it really just gives me a lot of nostalgia for my high school and college days. </p> <p>For reference, I\u2019ll add a list of some of the urban fantasy books/series I\u2019ve already read. A lot of these aren\u2019t from the mid or late 2000s, but I just thought I\u2019d include them to help sort of give an idea of my personal tastes. I don\u2019t want anything super cheesy or anything the just revolves entirely around smut. I would like it if there is at least a romance subplot, but that isn\u2019t a requirement. I\u2019m also fine with YA books so long as they aren\u2019t too juvenile. </p> <h2></h2> <p>Examples of urban fantasy I like:</p> <p>Harry Potter series by JK Rowling</p> <p>Sunshine by Robin McKinley</",

Which may not sound like much but I\u2019ve read over two hundred of them since I started writing in the genre myself. It\u2019s a small genre compared to fantasy and science-fiction but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a lot of people who enjoy writing prose stories of caped crusaders.</p> <p>I think this may actually qualify as the first \u201ccozy\u201d superhero novel that I\u2019ve ever read as well even though there is a decent plot. The stakes are real with a bunch of people being kidnapped around a city but it is restricted to the fairly small community of Bailey City as well as more interested in establishing the lives of the characters versus their ability to punch bad guys. It\u2019s one of the novels that I would say is read",

So that being said, it&#39;s an interesting character study and look into a weird culture.

A while back I asked for a recommendation for a new book and a lot of people mentioned the Dungeon Crawler Carl series, among many others. Well, I just finished book 7, and can safely say that I love the series and I&#39;m waiting for the next one to come out. So thank you to everyone for throwing it out there. Now comes the part where I don&#39;t know what to read and feel empty inside because I haven&#39;t immediately jumped into a new book or series. I always go back and forth between whether I want to read another fantasy series or something set in let&#39;s say the real world as a &quot;palette cleanser&quot; as I saw someone mention the other day. Because of this, I often end up reading urban fantasy so I can get the best of both worlds. For some reason I have in my head that I want to read something where gods are the main characters or have a prevalent role in the story. This could be ancient gods, Greek gods, or even new or old ",

Sorry that&#39;s another thread about fantasy species but I think it can be a fun discussion. </p> <p>What are, let&#39;s say, your favourite fantasy races that are pretty commonly used throughout fantasy but aren&#39;t part of the <em>core</em> ones [think Dwarves, Elves, Hobbits/Halflings, Humans, Orcs, Goblins] ? You know, the kobolds and catfolks and gnomes of this world that are not used as much as the other ones but still seen often. If Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, Humans, Orcs and Goblins are the first string of generic fantasy races, then what would be the second string ?

Library apps aren&#39;t feasible because of annoying wait lists, but it&#39;s a good supplement if I have to buy other books. Honestly I&#39;d love a way to just buy literally all Anne rice books digitally for less cost than individual purchase online. Not looking for pirate options, im cell phone only these days. Im also looking for bulk digital book purchase options from other authors, so please suggest everyone! Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/maerad\"> /u/maerad </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jwfh66/cheapest_way_to_purchase_bulk_series/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jwfh66/cheapest_way_to_purchase_bulk_series/\">[comments]</a></span>",

For background I\u2019ve really enjoyed: The Witcher series The whole hunger games series including songbird of ballad and snakes and sunrise on the reaping The entire COTAR Series The entire Iron flames series I really enjoyed the sword itself and have read a few books of the the warhammer series, I really enjoy it but I can\u2019t seem to find any books that are the first in a series on sale for warhammer and do not have the patience for the 245918 books in the Horus heracy. Thanks for any suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",
