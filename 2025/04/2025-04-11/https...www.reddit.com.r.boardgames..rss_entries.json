        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Wow, I really enjoyed the gameplay. It has the great bluffing and guessing of Netrunner, but scaled down to a 3x3 grid. If you like well-designed LCGs, you should track down some of the *free* demo decks they have been giving out. Granted, it was $10 (US) for shipping, so it cost about what a starter deck used to cost. The art is great. Not totally sold on the theme, but the gameplay is very enjoyable for two mirror decks. I&#39;m really excited to see if/when the Kickstarter for it launches later this year. Brought back all the netrunner feels. The idea that everyone is both a runner and corp at the same time didn&#39;t seem great, but it felt good playing it. Navaro and his team might have another hit on their hands.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JoshisJoshingyou\"> /u/JoshisJoshingyou </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jx2b31/hubworld_aidalon_first_impress",

Also, there are some comments I can&#39;t see for some reason, but I get the general mood...</p> <p>So, in November 2023 I pledge for a game. The core game pledge was \u20ac39 giving the game plus an expansion. The deluxe pledge was \u20ac45 which came with upgraded components plus 2 mini expansions. Deluxe plus playmat was \u20ac60. I liked the look of the game and pledged at the \u20ac60 level, which I was happy to pay. </p> <p>Well, the campaign delivered today, and I find that <em>everyone</em> has been upgraded to the deluxe plus playmat.

I&#39;ve been working on my first board game project, ExoTerra,and was planning to launch the game this summer. The Kickstarter page was getting some nice attention and I was so excited but now this tariff situation is certainly impacting the math for making the project work.</p> <p>How would you as a backer from the US feel about an additional &#39;tariff&#39; fee being charged, post-campaign, along with the shipping cost for the game?<br/> It seems like a way to not impact everyone globally, and also avoid having to raise the price of the game for what might be a temporary impact. </p> <p>I&#39;m trying to reduce the cost of the game as much as possible, to reduce this impact, but outside of this, i&#39;m not really sure how to tackle this challenge...and I certainly don&#39;t want to ostracize anyone. </p> <p>I appreciate any thoughts yall might have on this ap",

I&#39;d assume Europe is the second largest market (is it?). </p> <p>Well, to my question, why are board games way more popular in the US than the rest of the world? Sure, US taxes are lower than most EU countries, but the cost of living is way higher. Unions being, to my understanding, comparatively weaker in the US than many European countries as well disposable income across the population is pretty good in Europe. </p> <p>Sweden for example we have universal health care, job security, don&#39;t pay tuition fees for uni etc, even though our taxes are high.
