I doubt that the download is compromised or that its injected with malware, other than that why is this the case?

If I have a GTA 5 disk and like in really old times where you could erase and copy disks can you do that now or is there some digital fingerprint that each copy has that stops games from functioning like that?</p> <p>Basically I&#39;m asking how people copy games or replicate them. And if not then what stops them from copying and what&#39;s the alternative?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maysees\"> /u/Maysees </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1jwk9pt/why_cant_you_copy_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1jwk9pt/why_cant_you_copy_games/\">[com",
