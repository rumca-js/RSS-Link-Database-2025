Thousands of photos, memories, sure, but also random screenshots, receipts, duplicates, and who-knows-what. Every time I run out of storage, I\u2019m stuck tapping \u201cdelete\u201d confirm over and over, losing my mind. Sound familiar?</p> <p>This annoyance pushed me to build something. I\u2019m an engineer by trade, and I guess I\u2019m wired to fix stuff that bugs me. So, I made an MVP called Photo Flow at the moment on app store. The idea? Make cleaning your gallery feel as smooth as scrolling TikTok. You swipe through pics, ditch the junk fast, and keep the good stuff without breaking your flow. It\u2019s barebones, but it\u2019s already saving my sanity. I even added a quick way to share keepers with friends because, well, why not?</p> <p>I\u2019m curious what tiny annoyance drives you nuts enough to build something? Or, if you\u2019re drowning in photos too, what\u2019s the worst part of it? I\u2019m all ears for feedback. </p> </div><!",
