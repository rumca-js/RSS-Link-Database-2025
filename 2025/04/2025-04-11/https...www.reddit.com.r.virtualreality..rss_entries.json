I\u2019m posting here in case anyone has experienced something similar or has a fix.</p> <h1>\ud83e\udde8 The problem:</h1> <ul> <li>The headset <strong>freezes during the play area setup</strong>, right after detecting the floor.</li> <li>It starts scanning, then suddenly <strong>loses tracking</strong>, <strong>regains it</strong>, and immediately after that the <strong>software freezes</strong>.</li> <li>Interestingly, <strong>head tracking still works</strong>. For example: <ul> <li>The UI/menu stays fixed in space.</li> <li>I can move my head and look around, but the interface doesn&#39;t follow \u2014 it feels &quot;detached&quot;.</li> <li>The system becomes unresponsive, and I have to force a restart.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h1>\ud83d\udd27 What I\u2019ve tried:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Factory reset</strong> (both through the system and through <strong>USB Update Mode</strong>)",
