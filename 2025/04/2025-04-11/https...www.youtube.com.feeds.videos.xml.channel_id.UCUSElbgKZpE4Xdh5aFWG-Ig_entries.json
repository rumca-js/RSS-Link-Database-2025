        "description": "We invite you to a journey to Porto - the second largest city in Portugal. Located along the Douro river estuary in Northern Portugal, Porto is a very beutiful city and one of the oldest European centres. It is a very beutiful city.\n\nDon't forget that this is 360 video: you can change the angle of view.\n\nAlso here is the answer for a frequently asked question about true resolution of an 6K 360\u00b0 video. Unlike standard videos, in a 360\u00b0 video you can see only a part of original image (approximately 60-70 degrees out of 360). As result, the real resolution of the part you can see isn't bigger than 1K.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video please like, share, comment, favorite, subscribe: https://goo.gl/NZMdaz \n\nWe regularly publish new 360 videos of the most beautiful places on our planet!\n\n360\u00b0 photos and videos, stories of our shootings, articles and FAQ you can find on our website: http://AirPano.com\n\n#AirPanoCities #virtualtravel #Porto #Portugal #360video #VR #aerial #bestcity",
