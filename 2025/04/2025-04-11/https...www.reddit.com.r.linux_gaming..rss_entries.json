A little backstory, I&#39;ve been running Linux/Debian flavors for almost 15 years, I&#39;ve been through Ubuntu, debian, mint, Lubuntu and many more, but for the last 5 years I&#39;ve decided to keep using mint with a dual boot to windows so I can play valorant with some friends. My question is, is it worth the trouble of learning/configuring a &quot;new&quot; distro? I mean, everything works on my current build of mint, I don&#39;t find any big issues with it. I&#39;m sorry for any mistakes on the formatting, I&#39;m on mobile I&#39;ve got a Ryzen 7 8700f/RX580/16GB RAM</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hesaya\"> /u/Hesaya </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jwg0f6/is_it_worth_to_hop_to_bazzitesteamos/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jwg0f6/is_it_worth_to_hop_to_bazzitesteamos/\">[comments]",
