Given the potential impact on this community, I wanted to share what I found.</p> <h1>\ud83d\udea9 Overview of the Attack:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Social Engineering via LinkedIn:</strong> Attackers convincingly pose as recruiters, engaging developers via direct messages.</li> <li><strong>Malicious GitHub Repositories:</strong> Targets are directed to seemingly legitimate GitHub repositories, such as <code>sol-decoder2024/decoder-alpha</code>, specifically the file located at <code>config/ps.config.js</code>, containing malicious obfuscated JavaScript. The malware activates through a simple <code>npm install</code>.</li> <li><strong>Technical Details:</strong> The scripts gather OS and user info, establish communication with a remote Command-and-Control (C2) server, download payloads, and execute further malicious act",
