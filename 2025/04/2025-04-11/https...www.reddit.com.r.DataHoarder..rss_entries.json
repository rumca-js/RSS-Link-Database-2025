(also, unfortunately, the seagate EXOs in my area are not available)</p> <p>the reason why im asking is because most of the advice on the net says that i should get a barracuda cuz its usually far cheaper and a non-NAS or non-enterprise user like me wouldn&#39;t need an ironwolf pro&#39;s benefits anyway, but in my case theres only a 16 USD price difference between the barracuda and ironwolf pro of the same capacity, i would like to ask what other reasons i should or shouldn&#39;t get the ironwolf pro that other people haven&#39;t mentioned</p> <p>unfortuna",

Now I&#39;m not so sure. I will have cold storage of most if not all of the media but not of the cloud storage or PC backups. Other than the pictures almost all other data can be replaced albeit with a bit of time and effort. Is it better to use more smaller drives of say 8tb verses fewer 18tb drives?
