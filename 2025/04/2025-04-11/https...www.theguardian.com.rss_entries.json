The manager, who is preparing for Sunday\u2019s Premier League game at Wolves, said he had a \u201cfair idea\u201d of the identity of the individual and was working to deal with the situation.</p><p>The subject came up as Postecoglou was questioned about Wilson Odobert\u2019s fitness and at about the same time \u2013 on an unrelated topic \u2013 that Spurs announced the hire of the former Arsenal chief executive Vinai Venkatesham. He will join in the summer and take the same title that he held at Arsenal, which would appear to be bad news for Tottenham\u2019s chief football officer, Scott Munn.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/11/ange-postecoglou-vows-to-identify-and-deal-with-mole-inside-tottenham-squad\">Con",

I\u2019ve skipped ready-made pistachio cream in favour of a homemade blend, which is free from artificial colours and flavours, and if you can\u2019t find kataifi pastry (it\u2019s normally available fresh in international supermarkets), Shredded Wheat makes an excellent substitute.
