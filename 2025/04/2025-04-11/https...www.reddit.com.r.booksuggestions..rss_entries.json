I\u2019m looking for something along the lines of Eragon, the princess bride, the hobbit; middle earth type of vibes but with some spice nothing crazy. Growing up reading fairy tales with princesses, dragons, knights and faeries made me a huge fan of the fantasy genre. However now that I\u2019m older I struggle to find good fantasy that can give the same kind of adventure and authenticity. I always see acotar and fourth wing all over socials but it just doesn\u2019t pique my interest.

It can be any narrative, genre, or type of book.
