Its open-source nature has empowered developers across the globe to contribute, fork, improve, and innovate. Yet, despite its strengths, Linux has never reached the same level of desktop adoption or perceived stability as macOS or Windows. A critical factor in this shortfall is the fragmented nature of the Linux ecosystem. With hundreds of distributions and variations of software stacks, the Linux community has inadvertently undermined the possibility of a singular, standardized platform.</p> <p>This paper explores how the decentralization of development in Linux has hindered its potential and how the adoption of a unified Linux distribution with standardized frameworks could lead to a revolutionary shift in computing.
