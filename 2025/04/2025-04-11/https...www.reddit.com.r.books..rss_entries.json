My qualms with the story are more about the way the plot was delivered. June&#39;s narration was interspersed with past recollections as the story progressed (to justify what she is currently doing in the present), but it doesn&#39;t feel quite realistic. Her resentment towards Athena can ultimately be summed up by jealousy and Athena&#39;s editorializing / writing about June&#39;s traumatic experience. Wouldn&#39;t June--realistically--bring this up in the story earlier right after stealing the manuscript to **attempt** to justify to the reader that she is, in fact, righting a historical wrong? As much as I like R.F. Kuang, this feels disjointed; the plot ultimately is good but isn&#39;t delivered in a way that could have made it better.</p> <p>The prose, along with m",
