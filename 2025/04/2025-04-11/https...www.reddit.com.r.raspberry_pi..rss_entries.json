        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have been wanting to make a Magic Mirror to get myself exposed to some type of programming project. So I bought a Raspberry Pi 5 bundle that included a QWIIC Shim. I looked into sensors and decided to get the Human presence sensor to eventually allow the ability to turn on the screen based on people being in the room. Surprisingly I quickly got the Magic Mirror installed and figured out a configuration that I liked. The sensor has proven to be much more difficult. The shim does not fit because of the cooling heatsink so used the QWIIC cable that goes right to the header on the pi5. I have found out the address of the sensor is 0x5a via the CLI but I can\u2019t figure out what else to do. It seems all of the documentation on spark fun is for Ardunio.</p> <p>If it\u2019s not obvious, I\u2019ve never written code, used GitHub or Linux until I started this project. Please be patient, I\u2019m usually a mechanical guy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",
