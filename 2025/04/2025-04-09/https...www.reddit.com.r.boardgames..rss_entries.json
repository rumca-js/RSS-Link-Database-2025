Therefore here are a few things I have already ruled out:<br/> - Obviously nothing too complex or too text heavy to begin with<br/> - Peferably short playing time with some snappy rounds and fun interaction<br/> - The win condition should not rely too much on calculating points DURING the game. Things like Sushi Go or Sea, Salt and Paper where you have to think about the point value of any card constantly<br/> - Nothing that is too reliant on memorisation.
