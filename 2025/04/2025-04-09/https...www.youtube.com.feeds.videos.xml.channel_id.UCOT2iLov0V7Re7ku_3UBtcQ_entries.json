Dire wolves are probably not that closely related to gray wolves, though Colossal says that's not true, they haven't produced anything to back that up.\n2. Dire wolf-like animals will never be ecologically important to our current world because they ecosystems they existed inside of do not exist anymore. \n3. Collossal's goal isn't de-extinction, is creating new species to fill in niches left behind by extinct species, which is an idea worthy of debate! But it's not what you think of when you hear \"de-extinction.\"\n4. There's lots of really cool science here, which does include maybe kinda creating the frist large mammalian synthetic species.",
