You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don\u2019t want to act, or even talk alone; you don\u2019t want to \u201cgo out of your way to make trouble.\u201d Why not?\u2014Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.</p> <p>Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, \u201ceveryone\u201d is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re seeing things",

It was always exciting because I&#39;d find a new addition to a series I was reading that had been returned by another child, or I&#39;d just be able to pull out all the covers and look at them. We would have reading lists and we could fill out the books we read, and it was all just so wonderful. It was a cozy little corner to relax and escape into our own little world each week, and it was always met with reward to be reading a new book. I remember thinking when I got to 3rd grade and was reading bigger books, &quot;so we get to come to the LIBRARY every week for a whole hour?!&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wander-and-wonder\"> /u/",
