The main story points elude me at this point, but I remember being captivated by the worldbuilding. It featured a human that had an ability to fly Elvish flying ships. The world was separated into three vertical layers, with dwarves being at the bottom, humans in the middle, and elves living in floating islands on the top. </p> <p>The ship had retractable wings, controlled by the pilot. Only elves were generally supposed to be able to fly them, but the human protagonist had the ability to as well. I think he was a mercenary, or some other form of drifter. I also recall something about a storm the ship had to fly through, though I don&#39;t recall if it was weather or magical in nature, or both. </p> <p>Any help would be amazing.

There\u2019s lots to love (worldbuilding! magic systems! twisty plot!), but what the book truly excels for me in is the relationships between the characters. The heroes and supporting cast are fantastic on their own - complex, loveable and varied, but the real magic happens where they interact. I don\u2019t want to get spoilery, so I won\u2019t give detailed examples, but the way their hidden identities and secrets are handled is just <em>chef\u2019s kiss</em>. The romantic subplot makes my heart melt - I adore romance in fantasy, but I\u2019m very picky: once it overshadows the main plot and other relationships, I\u2019m out. It\u2019s not the case here - the authors balance it beautifully. The books are filled with friendships, alliances, rivalries and playfulness and I\u2019m enjoying it all immensely.

I like the MC having a romantic partner, just like the building of the charectar and has someone to connect with. I&#39;ve read romantasy and really like it, however I don&#39;t want it to be the main focus. I&#39;m reading the way of kings (stormlight archive) and it is the best thing I&#39;ve ever read...so something like that I guess? </p> <p>I do have the red rising series can&#39;t wait.

I also use the term &quot;tournament&quot; and &quot;game&quot; loosely.
