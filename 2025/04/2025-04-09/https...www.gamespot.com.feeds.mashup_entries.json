The 256GB onboard SSD is four times larger than the Switch OLED (64GB) and eight times the size of the original Switch and Switch Lite (32GB). That said, the Switch 2's performance upgrades will inevitably lead to bigger file sizes for <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/\">upcoming games</a>, which could compel you to expand your console's storage capacity.

Creative and ambitious amateur game developers look at games we love and see things they want to improve, stories they want to tell in that world, and files they want to dig through for missing pieces. Some all-timer games began life as total-conversion mods; Stanley Parable was a Half-Life conversion mod at first, and so was Counter-Strike. Dota was previously called Defense of the Ancients and began life as a (very, very popular) mod for Warcraft 3. DayZ, the multiplayer zombie-survival game, was a mod for Arma III, the complex soldier simulator. All of those games are massive hits in their own rights. Total-conversion mods can introduce an entirely new world to explore with its own story, bring fan-favorite s",
