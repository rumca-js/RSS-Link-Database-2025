        "description": "id Software\u2019s DOOM continues to be one of the most influential games of all time, playing a huge role in shaping the modern first person shooter. While the series has had its share of ups and downs, it's safe to say that DOOM is back and better than ever. \n\nRight from its surprisingly deep lore to the ultra violent gameplay, DOOM has always reveled in its over the top nature - and its suite of weapons is something that has been just as iconic as the games themselves. In anticipation of DOOM: The Dark Ages, we will be taking a look at 15 of the best weapons in the DOOM franchise, starting from the bottom and reaching all the way to the top.",
