Fastcopy and freefilesync seems pretty straight foward but if there is anything I should know about those programs before hand I would very much appreciate any tips.</p> <p>As for robocopy, this is a bit intimidating as it doesn&#39;t include a GUI.

I want to back it up to iDrive as well before I start filling it with files, so it backs up as I go.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the issue: when I add a new drive to scan, it requests I select a location for the image file to go while it runs the backup. One key thing to note is \u201censure that the selected local destination has free space greater than the source drive size.\u201d</p> <p>The only thing on the drop down-list is the drive itself, but if I select that, I get hit with the error \u201cThe temporary backup cannot be saved to the same drive. Select a different backup location.\u201d However, there are no additional backup locations to select because nothing else is 20TB!
