As\nsoon as it has no more space to fit another word/syllable, it\nwraps to the next line (if <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap-mode\">wrapping</a> is allowed). Then it\nstarts on the next line, fitting all the content it can\u2026 then\nwhen it runs out of room, it wraps\u2026 and starts working on the\nnext line.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s always thinking about only one line at a time. It wraps\nwhenever it needs, after it\u2019s fit the maximum amount of content\non the previous line. If hyphenation is turned on, it will\nhyphenate whatever word is last on the line, at whate",

        "description": "<p>This sounds like one of those puzzles job interviewers often ask, but there\u2019s a practical relevance at the moment: What\u2019s a ballpark estimate for how many iPhones Apple might have hustled to ship into the US <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/08/plane-of-iphones-from-india-and-china\">on those five freight planes</a> ahead of the new tariffs? <a href=\"https://x.com/rjonesy/status/1909770872778338793\">Ryan Jones tackled it in a post on X</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A whopping 12 days of sales. At most.</p>\n\n<p>Math: <br />\n\u2022 B747 Freighter carries 300,000 lbs <br />\n\u2022 boxed iPhone is 0.9 lbs <br />\n= 350K iPhones per plane</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I like Jones\u2019s ballpark math here. Let\u2019s not worry about volume, just weight. If we\u2019re wrong about the volume, it can only mean <em>fewer</em> new-in-box iPhones can fit per plane. There\u2019s no way to (safely) exceed <a href=\"https://www.cargolux.com/fleet-equipment/aircraft/747-8f-specifications/\">the weight limit of a plane</a",
