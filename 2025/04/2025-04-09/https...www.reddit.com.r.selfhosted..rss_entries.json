Now I installed Debian+Docker+CasaOS on it, but soon realized that running it 24/7 isn&#39;t an option (even in idle, its drawing more power than 3 other mini PCs combined), so I thought my other server could wake this up via WakeOnLan service, and push files for backup. Now I got way to many machines (many pi&#39;s, many mini pcs, few laptops), and the idea of each of them waking this behemoth up and pushing the data, doesn&#39;t seem feasible.</p> <p>This brings me whether there is an open source solution, where the server wakes up (by rtc or wakeonlan) and perform backup by pulling data from all these other machines. It can be done via rsync and ssh reverse tunneling, but too messy. Is there ",

In addition I have 2 older HP Micro servers - 1x ESX and 1x Unraid as a backup for the T20.</p> <p>I looked at Dell T630, it&#39;s a bit too large for the space I am intending it to run but otherwise it would actually tick all marks. Are there any similar slightly smaller alternatives from Dell, HP or Lenovo? I looked at T330 but the PSUs seem to be too weak to support a proper GPU and I ready about general compatibility issues.</p> <p>I have even ordered T630 at a very good price but it came DOA with internals shaken up during transport...
