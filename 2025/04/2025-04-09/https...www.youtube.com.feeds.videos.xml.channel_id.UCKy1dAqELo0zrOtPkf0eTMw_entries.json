The story that slowly emerges within this fascinating place is also a compelling one, and it had me hungrily hunting for clues and combinations for many hours after I reached the credits while also poetically tying into the mechanics that lead you to them. Getting a bad draw you did everything in your power to avoid can frustrate from time to time, but this sprawling estate has so much to uncover that the randomness never stalled my progress for too long. If The Witness, Portal, and Myst are already emblazoned on the Mount Rushmore of first-person puzzle games, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Blue Prince carved alongside them soon enough.",

It feels a little bit like a monkey paw wish granted to anyone hoping for Bloodborne 2 or a remaster of the original PS4 game, but on the bright side, it\u2019s something new and different, and FromSoftware studio head and Dark Souls, Bloodborne and Elden Ring creator Hidetaka Miyazaki is overseeing The Duskbloods.

        "description": "Commandos: Origins reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.\n\n\"Commandos: Origins strikes a great balance between the classic stealth tactics games and modern streamlined ideas, creating tons of potential for finding creative solutions to problems like \u201ctoo many living fascists.\u201d Pruning out elements like inventory management may not be to every older fan\u2019s tastes, but that\u2019s focused a spotlight on strict stealth \u2013 and it\u2019s here Origins shines. Sneaking through its massive maps, each of which are swarming with hundreds of enemies, takes hours and hours of patient planning and careful clicking. I regularly gleaned a ton of pleasure from executing a perfect coordinated strike and fading away into the background, with the remaining Nazis none the wiser. No plan survives contact with this many bugs, but quick-loading will get you past nearly any issue and this otherwise might be the sneakiest fun you can have going commando with your underwear on",
