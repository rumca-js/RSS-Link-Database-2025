First of all the term is very clear what it refers to, to feminine boys, practically it is just saying &quot;feminine boy&quot; but abbreviated, and it is not fetishist either (or it shouldn&#39;t be) the word was originally a mockery of feminine men, then over time it changed its meaning and was popularized by characters such as Astolfo de fate. I don&#39;t want to cover the sun with a finger and it&#39;s obvious that you have your little things, like the fact that nowadays it is very fetishized and in part the femboys have some blame for that, that&#39;s why I make this publication to inform a little and see the opinions of people:^</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/moon_knight5789\"> /u/moon_knight5789 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1jvir9m/what_do_you_think_abou",

So I\u2019ve been on a bit of a movie kick lately and realized a lot of the \u201cbig name\u201d LGBTQ+ movies (like Dallas buyers club or call me by your name) have cis/straight actors playing queer characters. Not trying to cancel anyone, just it kind of hits different when the people telling the story live it.</p> <p>So would appreciate any recommendations for movies with LGBT or trans stories that actually cast LGBT actors in the main roles. Bonus points if the movie doesn\u2019t end in tragedy. Doesn\u2019t have to be some Oscar-bait thing either - indie, international, campy, even cheesy rom-coms, i\u2019m here for all of it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Salty_Appointment114\"> /u/Salty_Appointment114 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1jv3stq/best_lgbttrans_movies_with_actual_lgbt_actors/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1jv3stq/best_l",

Personally I can imagine in such a hateful world we are currently in it must be scary to trust strangers fully and go under anesthesia for surgery. Patients get misgendered often (especially if haven\u2019t legally changed their name etc) and I worry so much about what these patients are feeling as they are being interviewed repeatedly about meds, health, surgeries, preferred name etc. </p> <p>Today I almost said to transgender female patient listen I\u2019m an ally you are safe with me. But then I didn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t sure if it was inappropriate to point it out once again when maybe she just wants to be a woman and not keep discussing it over and over again. I also don\u2019t want to sound like anyone I work with would ever have ill intentions because they don\u2019t. I hope I don\u2019t sound dumb I truly truly am an empath and care so much about my patients and want everyone to feel safe in this horrible world. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
