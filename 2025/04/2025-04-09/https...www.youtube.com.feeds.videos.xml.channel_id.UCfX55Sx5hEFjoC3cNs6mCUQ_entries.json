        "description": "In a recent interview, Guy Martin, Vice President of the Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD) and Director of Open Source and Standards at NVIDIA, provided insights into the current state and future direction of the Alliance for Open Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD). As OpenUSD approaches its two-year anniversary this April, significant progress has been made in transforming this technology from its media and entertainment roots into a foundational standard for 3D content across multiple industries.\n\nAOUSD is an organization focused on standardizing OpenUSD technology. As Martin explains, \"AOUSD is essentially the organization responsible for standardizing OpenUSD technology, which we believe is the 3D equivalent of HTML in 2D. We consider it a foundational technology.\"\nThe primary goal of AOUSD is to develop normative specifications that can eventually be submitted to international standards bodies like ISO, transforming OpenUSD from a de facto standard to an officially recognized one.",
