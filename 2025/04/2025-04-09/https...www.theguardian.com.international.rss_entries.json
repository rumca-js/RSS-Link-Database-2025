Holy Cow is the feature debut from director (and part-time farmer) Louise Courvoisier; it\u2019s a social-realist drama that is the opposite of grim and miserable in its warm and often funny telling of a coming-of-age story about a teenager from a struggling family of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comt%C3%A9_cheese\">comt\u00e9-makers</a> in the remote region of Jura. Courvoisier warms things up nicely with her idealism and optimism, and she gets brilliant performances from her non-professional cast, cows included. The opening scene features a calf sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a car staring out of the window.</p><p>Newcomer Cl\u00e9ment Faveau (a poultry farmer in real-life) plays 18-year-old Totone, first shown at a country fair so drunk that he jumps on a table and strips naked",
