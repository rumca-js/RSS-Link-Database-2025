So if there is a white object off to my right in a black area there is like light bleed from it. Everything is a little blurry.</p> <p>I only use a new microfiber cloth and nothing else ever. This issue is so bad in dark areas it&#39;s becoming hard to see clearly.</p> <p>2) when I first went from q2 to q3 the fov seemed larger. But recently it seems much smaller. I measured my eyes at 62 ipd but I can feel / sense / kind of see a line between my eyes and the black circles of the visor are increasingly visible.</p> <p>I now feel like I&#39;m wearing goggles. This was never a q2 issue for me. This issue varies significantly between apps.</p> <p>Can anyone help with these two annoying issues which are becoming steadily worse...thanks <strong>[]~}</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",

I didnt even need to buy any extra accessories for it besides a wall mount as it was comfortable out of the box even after a year or two of weekly use.</p> <p>Now though, I really am considering getting a Quest 3, but I hear so many complaints about it and they make me hesitate.

I have a PS5 as well and play games on it like No Mans Sky and hitman without VR so I definitely want the PS exclusives. My laptop\u2019s usb-c is data only so I wouldn\u2019t be able to connect my PS and I would still use my quest 2 for PCVR. If I got the quest it would be just an upgrade from what I already have instead of something new. The lenses do sound amazing and so does the resolution but I don\u2019t think my laptop will really be taking advantage of the new resolution because like I mentioned before it isn\u2019t that good. The only game I would really be missing if I bought the PSVR2 is the Batman game and anything else I want to play from quest can be played on my Quest 2. So are the lenses really worth it that much or should I just stick with my Quest 2 for",

However it seems that there is often fps stutters. </p> <p>My main router is in another room and the signal is unable to reach my room. I therefore bought a WiFi extender and connect that to my router via ethernet, with the other part of the extender connected to a wall socket in my room. The extender is connected to my PC wirelessly. Playing games on my phone or the PC seems fine with the current setup but not on the quest 3.</p> <p>How can I improve my setup to reduce fps stutters and at the same time not spending too much on further purchases? Will connecting my PC to my extender via ethernet be better? FYI it is not possible to connect a cable from my PC direct to the main router and hence I went for the extender option for everyday Internet use in my room.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rayacc002\"> /u/rayacc002 <",

Last month I realized that I&#39;ve never heard anybody complain about VR looking <em>substantially</em> blurry like how I&#39;ve experienced it, so I decided to look into it. Long story short, realized despite the screen being 3-5&quot; from your face, farsightedness is still an issue in VR. The prescription lenses I ordered as a result just arrived, and holy shit. The fidelity increase is insane. I actually see the aliasing from &quot;the screen door effect&quot; for the first time. Even so, text has never been this readable. It&#39;s like putting my headset on for the first time all over again.
