So, when I go to install AHI 4.18 it asks me which sound card do I have and well the ZZ9000 isn&#39;t listed there, and I don&#39;t know which one to choose other than Paula, which I did only select Paula and rebooted after completed. In AHI all I see for the devices is Paula. I re-ran the ZZ9000 installation again and had it install the audio driver (I guess) and rebooted but still not ZZ9000AX card.</p> <p>Any suggestions from the experienced would be appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SmoothRunnings\"> /u/SmoothRunnings </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1jv73bn/zz9000_with_zz9000ax/\">[link]</a></span>",

Now, I mainly got the amiga to play Lemmings, and there was a Lemmings disk included in the disks I got with it, but it seems to be overwritten with some demo disk. I learned online that amigaXfer can do the trick of writing a floppy, but I&#39;m unsure which usb to serial hardware will work. Does it need to be RS232 or can it also be TTL? Does it need any specific specs?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RemokM\"> /u/RemokM </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1jv28hv/need_help_with_amigaxfer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1jv28hv/need_help_with_amigaxfer/\">[comments]</a></span>",
