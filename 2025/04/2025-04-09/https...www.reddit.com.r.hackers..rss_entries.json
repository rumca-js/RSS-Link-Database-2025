I went to sign in, and it said no account associated with this email. </p> <p>So I went to my email and saw that my amazon account had been changed. But it had been changed to my full last name, some numbers, and mail.com. not Gmail. </p> <p>I finally was able to get my account back just a few minutes ago, and not only had this hacker bought a lawnmower, he used his own card and address set to default. </p> <p>I don&#39;t know what to make of this!!
