From start to finish, it had everything: a gripping story, intense emotion, incredible direction, and an atmosphere that pulls you in and doesn\u2019t let go. The final 30 to 40 minutes left me absolutely stunned and deeply bitter. The performances were phenomenal across the board, but Lee Woo-jin, in particular, stood out he\u2019s now cemented himself as one of the most compelling and chilling antagonists I\u2019ve ever seen in fiction.

Although it&#39;s very vulgar and bizarre and a lot of people seem to hate it for this reason, I&#39;ve always loved it, ever since I first watched it at age 13! I&#39;ve watched it about 20 times since, and I never get tired of it! Besides the excellent musical score written by Pete Townshend of The Who and with musical performances of some of the best rock and roll musicians of all time, like Eric Clapton, Tina Turner, and Elton John, I also really like the story, which was also written by Pete Townshend and I&#39;ve heard was based on his real life and a lot of the trauma he faced growing up. A big reason I really like it is that I&#39;ve also experienced lots of similar trauma, which I&#39;d rather not go into in detail, so I&#39;ve always been able to relate to the story quite well on a personal level.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dcter",

Chef is a nice feel-good film about a father and son bonding over summer vacation as they travel across the U.S operating a food truck but it has 1 of the most loaded casts that I&#39;ve ever seen with half the cast becoming Avengers and Jon Favreau becoming 1 of the big wigs at 1 of if not the most powerful media companies on Earth as well two of the biggest Hispanic actors in the U.S John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara.

It was emotionally overwhelming, the first time in years that I&#39;ve shed a tear or two. Easily one of the best experiences I had in a while. Then I check out IMDB just to see a baffling 5.7 rating.</p> <p>It&#39;s a really slow burn, very different from a usual Adam Sandler movie, Paul Dano is otherworldly, the visuals are not grandiose but excellent for this scale. I think it all fits together very well to bring home some powerful messages about loneliness, guilt, connection, what it&#39;s like to be a flawed human.</p> <p>The grainy looks and old-new tech gives it some realism that usually is missing from modern movies.</p> <p>I&#39;ll keep this spoiler free, if you got curious, please go in blind. I just wish we had more films like this, it hurts to see such low ratings, basically telling studios to keep going with shiny slop.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",

I&#39;m in my early thirties, and I&#39;ve grown up watching this movie, as well as it&#39;s first two sequels (I&#39;m admittedly not a fan of the <em>World</em> sequels). I&#39;ve seen it more than any other movie by far, and it never ceases to amaze me. When I was a kid in the 90&#39;s, entering the Jurassic Park section at Universal Studios in Florida was a magical experience as they perfectly re-captured the feeling of entering the park from the movie. The music still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. My favorite dinosaur? It&#39;s got to be the T-Rex. And I truly believe it&#39;s the greatest special effect that was ever in a movie, or ever will be. And I&#39;m not talking about the CGI one - despite being a ground breaking achievement, it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to the life sized animatronic Stan Winston Studios created for the movie.</p> <p>Unfortunately, over the years, I ",

It wasn\u2019t necessary what they were doing but how they acted it out and I was just stunned at the amount of detail in it. Like when at the beginning the secretary leaving had the note in her mouth, I just felt like it was so well planned out. I forgot her first name but the female lead, something gyllenhaal, was such a good actor and I feel like she represented her character\u2019s mental health struggles so well. Also this movie made me realise how bad my grammar and spelling is because it would take me awhile to realise how she spelt something wrong lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RevolutionSlow5947\"> /u/RevolutionSlow5947 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1juso9u/secretary_2002/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1",
