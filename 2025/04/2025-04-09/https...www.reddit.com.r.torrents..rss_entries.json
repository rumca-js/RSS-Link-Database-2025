I always use Handbrake to hardcode subs. Always works fine. </p> <p>The subs srt file is off by like 10 seconds. The first full line of the movie, you know you have blood on you, happens at like 2:06, but it&#39;s at 2:14 in the srt. I checked a couple of the sets for it. They were we bg too. </p> <p>Does anyone know if a good set for this movie?
