Price aside (since I usually get these kind of games when they&#39;re on sale for like a dollar or two) do these games tend to run better on Steam or would they run better if emulated on Linux? Or is it more of a case by case basis? If so are there any resources available that compare how the games run via Steam or an emulator? </p> <p>I&#39;m interested in building a library (not sure how large yet) of older games I played as a kid or games I never got a chance to play since my parents didn&#39;t have much money when I was little so I&#39;d only get maybe a game or two a year out of like the hundreds I wanted lol</p> <p>I plan on emulating on desktop linux (Arch) and also my Steam Deck likely both via EmuDeck and I do dual boot with Windows so might consider having a copy of the library there as well</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by ",

I had an idea to basically have my gaming PC exclusively run windows, and basically turn it on exclusively for gaming (or video rendering and other high GPU power activities) and remotely connect to it from a relatively low powered Linux machine.</p> <p>This in my mind would solve two things. I could still be able to enjoy Linux, the privacy it offers, and the functionality it can give outside gaming, but also still enjoy every gaming I want to play without having to deal with a dual boot and constantly rebooting from one OS to another. An unintended bonus is that it could save electricity in certain use cases.</p> <p>For anyone who&#39;s done this successfully, how is the input delay like, and what software did you use to accomplish the remote connection?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Y2K350\"> /u/Y2K350 </a> <br/>",

Hell Let Loose, Mordhau, and 7D2D all work out of the box. (had to put an instruction in HLL to use more cores and DX12, very easy 5 minute fix).</p> <p>However, on HLL and 7D2D, the Steam overlay doesnt work, and I dont see the FPS counter either. I noticed both of these games loaded something called Vulkan before starting up for the first time. I can play both games just fine.</p> <p>Mordhau works perfectly with full Steam overlay functionality.</p> <p>I have no idea what Vulkan is, or if its relevant, just that it&#39;s something the problem games have in common that Mordhau doesnt. </p> <p>I&#39;ve tried looking this up and read a bunch of posts made over the last ten years with seemingly no solution.</p> <p>Does anyone know any workarounds for this issue? I can still play these games, so it&#39;s not the end ",
