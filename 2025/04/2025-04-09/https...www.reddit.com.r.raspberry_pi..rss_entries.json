I tried the bare minimum with qemu-system-aarch64 -machine raspi3b -cpu cortex-a53 -m 1G -smp 4 -bios (even tried -kernel) path/to/u-boot.bin (even tried u-boot) with/without -drive file=/path/to/fs/fat.fs,format=raw,media=disk. So far, i would said failed, because qemu serial terminal stay black. In the fat.fs, i have start.elf, fixup.dat, bootcode.bin and config.txt. I also built u-boot qemu to be sure my cross compiler works and this one is booting. Any clues?

I am planning to use one SD card for minecraft server and the other for playing around with the raspberry pi. What else can I do with the pi?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hairy_Educator1918\"> /u/Hairy_Educator1918 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jv8dye/just_ordered_a_raspberry_pi_4_for_the_first_time/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jv8dye/just_ordered_a_raspberry_pi_4_for_the_first_time/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019ve have a VU+ box (Linux) and an iPad with an app called File Browser Go and I am suddenly unable to access my shared folders from these 2 device I get \u2018Failed to load contents access denied\u2019. If I plug the drive directly into VU + box it works fine. Also I am able to access the shared folder from my pc (wired) and windows laptop (wireles) its lust the first 2 devices I mentioned I\u2019m having issues with. The drive has been happily doing its thing for over a year and suddenly started acting up. How do I check the shares for issues and correct them? The drive is in the same USB port as always but would it make any difference if it was in a different port? do they have to be mapped during setup?
