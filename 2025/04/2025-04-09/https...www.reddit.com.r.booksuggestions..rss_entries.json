I&#39;m not looking for a feminist essay, but I just would love some realism and don&#39;t feel like the author fantasized on the character while writing his book.

The idea of exploring alternate versions of life choices really stuck with me. It made me reflect on how often we feel stuck or like we\u2019re not living up to our potential. But, the book also gave me a sense of hope that it\u2019s not too late to make a change.</p> <p>Are there other books that tackle themes like second chances or the \u201cwhat if\u201d moments in life?

Mostly looking for the survival aspect of it, certainly okay with fantasy, since any witchcraft or otherworldly horrors would fall under that umbrella. YA is okay, but would prefer adult fiction (even if the protags are teens!) Also prefer the main character(s) to be female, but not opposed to some dual pov with different characters.

I think my issue comes in when philosophers begin defining (or redefining) abstract concepts that don&#39;t have a &#39;physical&#39; being. Describing objects, emotions, people, I can understand, but when it comes to &#39;justice&#39; or &#39;evil&#39; they lose me. The only philosophy book I&#39;ve read is Meditations by Marcus Aurelius and I remember it taking me forever to get through. I tried Plato but got lost in the words.

Is there any other series that uses a similar kind of naming system? Because honestly, I adore it. It\u2019s super charming. And while I do love Warriors, it definitely has its flaws, especially when it comes to the writing. That said, I don\u2019t really read the books much anymore. I mostly just hang out in the fandom. I\u2019ve only read the first arc and I\u2019m currently on <em>Starlight</em> in <em>The New Prophecy</em>.</p> <p>The reason I\u2019m asking here is because I feel like I\u2019d get a wider range of options than if I asked in something like a TV show subreddit. I also tried asking on the OSP Discord, but the post got ignored, so I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll have better luck here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dragonwolf67\"> /u/Dragonwolf67 </a> <br/> <spa",

I&#39;m looking forward to reading the Black House but definitely not anytime soon.</p> <p>Right now, I just feel empty, and while I want to keep my reading momentum up, I&#39;m not sure if I want to start another book this week. Or maybe I do, but something far more manageable and easier to consume. I have a couple more Stephen King books but they&#39;re long as hell.

I&#39;d prefer Romance as a side plot if possible, and only sex if it&#39;s built off a strong romance.

Is there any other series that uses a similar kind of naming system? Because honestly, I adore it. It\u2019s super charming. And while I do love Warriors, it definitely has its flaws, especially when it comes to the writing. That said, I don\u2019t really read the books much anymore. I mostly just hang out in the fandom. I\u2019ve only read the first arc and I\u2019m currently on <em>Starlight</em> in <em>The New Prophecy</em>.</p> <p>The reason I\u2019m asking here is because I feel like I\u2019d get a wider range of options than if I asked in something like a TV show subreddit. I also tried asking on the OSP Discord, but the post got ignored, so I\u2019m hoping I\u2019ll have better luck here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dragonwolf67\"> /u/Dragonwolf67 </a> <br/> <spa",

I believe the place she&#39;s living in, the people live in rocks that have tunnels built inside them?? And the people are at war with another species (that has a thorn that comes out of their lower elbow). She found out she&#39;s half of both species, and she had ripped her thorns off to disguise herself as a full human. The leader of the humans is a powerful wizard who fights with the leader of the other species, and they raise descendants to carry on their &#39;legacy&#39; of defending themselves.

Before I begin a book club with our customers, I would like to do a test run with our employees. </p> <p>Most of my team is very sweet and a lot of them try, however, I do not see much motivation within them to do be good or even great at their job. A lot of people may think ok well it\u2019s just a coffee shop who takes it that seriously, but honestly, I need them to take their job seriously. Most are in their twenties and I cannot believe they\u2019ve made it this far with the work ethic they have. To conclude, my criteria for book recs is as follows: I need to feel motivation from within, need the book to be less than 200 pages, and a somewhat easy read, all while still being interesting and engaging. I plan on announcing the commencement of the book club in a week so I will take as many suggestions as possible. </p> <p>T",
