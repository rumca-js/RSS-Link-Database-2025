So-called \u201cassassination culture\" is rising in America. Why is this happening? Also, Republicans introduce a bill designed to make it easier for mothers to stay home and raise their children.

And more importantly: why?\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:25 Opening\n02:06 - 14:30 The Rise Of 'Assassination Culture' In America\n15:49 - 22:38 This Is Why John Oliver Is So Defensive Of Trans People On His Show\n22:39 - 32:12 Republican Bill Would Save Thousands For Parents Who Stay Home With Kids\n32:13 - 39:21 We Need To Abolish the Income Tax\n41:00 - 49:45 The Comments Section\n50:20 - 59:25 Everyone Who Is Trying To Resurrect Extinct Species Is Canceled\n\nEp.1572\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxo2xIBe_0Y\n\nhttps://w",
