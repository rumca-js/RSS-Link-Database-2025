        "description": "This is a complete course for understanding how to use the Eevee rendering engine in Blender. Eevee is an (almost) real-time rendering engine. So you can render animation sequences in minutes rather than days with Cycles. This video will take complete beginners through everything they need to know to get started with Eevee. You'll learn the theory of how Eevee works, how to fix common problems, and how to optimize an Eevee scene for rendering.\n\n===Links\ud83d\udd17===\n\nPoliigon Blender Addon: https://www.poliigon.com/blender?utm_campaign=eevee&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=bg\n\nBlended Reflection Bug: https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/135198#issuecomment-1507735\n\n=== Chapter Marks \u2702\ufe0f===\n0:00 Intro\n0:56 Modelling the room\n2:01 Fixing Eevee light bleed\n05:00 Why does Eevee have noise?\n06:10 Increasing samples to specific areas\n08:10 Adding reflections in Eevee\n09:06 Fixing reflection artifacts\n14:44 Intro to Reflection Probes\n17:39 Spherical Probes\n20:28 Light Bounces\n26:00 Optim",
