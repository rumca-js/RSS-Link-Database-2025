One thing I&#39;m running into is after a reboot the container does not start, exist code 127. I&#39;ve figured out this is because my shares aren&#39;t mounted at the time the container tries to start.</p> <p>I&#39;m using <code>/etc/fstab</code> to mount some SMB shares. I originally mounted them with something like this:</p> <pre><code>services: duplicati: image: duplicati/duplicati:latest container_name: duplicati volumes: - /var/lib/docker/volumes/duplicati:/data - /local/mount:/path/in/container - /other/local/mounts:/other/paths/in/container </code></pre> <p>Well that didn&#39;t work, so I made persistent docker volumes that mounted the shares and now mount them this way:</p> <pre><code>services: duplicati: image: duplicati/duplicati:latest container_name: duplicati volumes: - /var/lib/docker/volumes/duplicati:/data - FS1_",
