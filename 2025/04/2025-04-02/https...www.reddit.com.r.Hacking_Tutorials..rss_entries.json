So I stumbled across some v\u00eddeos regarding staged payload executing a Shellcode in memory. I converted the compiled .exe to shellcode using Donut (on Github) with many different parameters, and tried to execute it on a loader also in C but It never works... Is there another approach to this? What am I missing? I&#39;m a beginner. </p> <p>I would really appreaciate some other basic ways to bypass AVs knowing my program was written in C. In other words Just want to not have my program &quot;naked&quot;. </p> <p>Thank you all ;)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/majeloy\"> /u/majeloy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1jpwrl2/pe_to_shellcode/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"",
