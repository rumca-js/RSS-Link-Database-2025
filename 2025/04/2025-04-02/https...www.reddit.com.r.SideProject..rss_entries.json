It can download reels fast by eather copying the link to the reel and then pressing the button in the app or pressing share on instagram and selecting the app and press the button.</p> <p>To support the backend server for the app i decided to have just two banner ads and nothing else. One banner is at the bottom of the screen and one shows up while you download but dissapears right after its done.</p> <p>I would appreciate you taking a look and providing feedback and suggestions as well as rating it on the play store! I am planning to add youtube and tiktok downloading in the future.</p> <p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.",
