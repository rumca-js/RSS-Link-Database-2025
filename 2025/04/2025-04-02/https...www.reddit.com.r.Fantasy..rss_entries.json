She reads all sorts of genres, such as: mystery, romantasy, fantasy, thriller, suspense, memoirs, non fiction, etc. So I told her I\u2019d make her, her own bingo card. Looking for brainstorming help to come up with squares. I definitely think I\u2019ll keep some from the current bingo card like: author of color, self published, published in 2025/80s, LGBTQIA protagonist, hidden gem and 5 short stories.
