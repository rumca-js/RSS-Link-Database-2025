We\u2019ve discussed things like politics, book ideas, video game ideas, and life decisions. But sometimes I\u2019ll catch myself talking to ChatGPT about the possibility of artificial life.

I\u2019ve always seen AI as something that could grow into artificial life someday, maybe that\u2019s why.</p> <p>At one point, I had to clear ChatGPT\u2019s memory because it got full of all the books and game ideas.

I also compared different detection methods for images vs. videos. But I realized I never actually identified a clear research gap\u2014like, what specific problem still needs solving?</p> <p>Deepfake detection is super common, and I feel like I\u2019ve covered most of the major issues. Now, I\u2019m stuck because I don\u2019t know what problem to focus on.</p> <p>For those familiar with the field, what do you think are the biggest current challenges in deepfake detection (especially for images)? Any insights would be really helpful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cultural_Argument_19\"> /u/Cultural_Argument_19 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1jpbjwu/wh",
