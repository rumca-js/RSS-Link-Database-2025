I want to read another book series like the shadow hunters (not necessarily in writing but the universe and concept) but with a queer protagonist, preferably with a mlm romance but also absolutely open to a wlw. However, im open to recs with straight protags if theres prominent queer characters elsewhere, or if protag is bi/pan etc but romance is mlw or wlm.</p> <p>The second is a murder mystery set specifically or majority in one location, like a closes off mansion or a school or something.

When I was a kid Artemis Fowl was my absolute favorite book series (Percy Jackson following close behind ofc lol) as well as The Hobbit. I also enjoyed reading the Sherlock Holmes series, and I sort of liked the Kane Chronicles too. I am fascinated by all kinds of history, real and fiction, any time period. I\u2019m not super big on romance but it\u2019s a plus if there\u2019s good queer representation in some way.

Have been on a big mystery thriller/ horror kick recently and was looking for recommendation, particularly underrated or not as popular books you loved. I prefer books that are not necessarily gory but more suspenseful or psychologically thrilling. I recently read Strange Pictures by Uketsu, Diavola, and The Dangers of Smoking in Bed and loved them. I\u2019ve also read Bunny and Mexican Gothic and enjoyed them though not as much.
