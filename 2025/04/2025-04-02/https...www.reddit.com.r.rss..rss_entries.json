I want to create an RSS feed for that so people can follow what I do.<br/> The problem is the website host I use doesn&#39;t allow any kind of bot access, be it RSS or anything. I&#39;ve checked online for RSS generating sites, and none of them can access my site. </p> <p>I&#39;m alright with manually updating/adding to the RSS, but I&#39;m not sure if such an interface exists. Or would it be possible to generate an RSS feed from something such as a github repo, where I&#39;d manually add a copy/link when I upload to generate the updated RSS post? </p> <p>I&#39;d appreciate any advice in this matter.
