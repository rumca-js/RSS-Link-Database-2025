He noticed how toxic information with an expiration date\u2014like newspapers in his time and many more forms today\u2014can be, and he wanted to counter it with more timeless information. Hope you enjoy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Leather_Singer9889\"> /u/Leather_Singer9889 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://calofwisdom.com/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/1jq23zo/i_made_a_3d_website_for_tolstoys_last_book/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I wanted to see if I could instead build a tool to generate the same sort of music using my key presses to drive the melody -- Komposer was born. </p> <p>Even when you&#39;re not typing, you&#39;ll hear subtle drum beats and chord progressions as you think through your next sentence. When you type, each button press becomes a new note in the main melody. To keep the song fresh, each paragraph switches up the composition and evolves the song (you can press tab at any time to switch it up too.) If you find a style you love, use the lock song button to stay in that mode. </p> <p>I&#39;m super excited to hear how other writers enjoy the app and see what you&#39;ll create with it. Let me know if this feels like a tool you&#39;ll use and any other genres/features you&#39;d like to see! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre",
