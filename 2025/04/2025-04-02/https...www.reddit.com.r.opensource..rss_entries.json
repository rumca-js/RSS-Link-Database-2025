I&#39;ve been working on <strong>OxiCloud</strong> \u2013 a lightweight, Rust-based alternative to Nextcloud that I built initially to scratch my own itch, but now I&#39;m hoping might be useful to others.</p> <h1>Why I&#39;m sharing this with the OSS community</h1> <p>I believe in open-source software, but I also believe we need more efficient alternatives to some of the heavier tools out there. I love Nextcloud&#39;s features and community, but its resource requirements can be prohibitive for many users with modest hardware.</p> <p>Some key points about the project:</p> <ul> <li>100% open-source (MIT license)</li> <li>Built in Rust for memory safety and efficiency</li> <li>Currently ~12,000 lines of code</li> <li>Actively developed (though as a hobby project)</li> <li>Documented an",

A lot of open-source tools feel like they\u2019re built for power users, whereas commercial alternatives focus more on user experience and ease of use.</p> <p>With AI-assisted coding becoming more advanced, I wonder if this will change. Will open-source projects be able to ship new features faster and improve usability, closing the gap with paid services? Or will the advantage of funding and dedicated UX teams still keep proprietary software ahead?</p> <p>For those of you maintaining or contributing to open-source projects\u2014do you see AI helping you build more, or is it just another tool that won\u2019t change the fundamental challenges of open-source development?

You can chunk it by tokens, chunk it by number of scripts you want, or even by number of texts (although i do not encourage this, its just an option that i built anyway).</p> <p>The reason I did this was because it allows LLMs to process texts longer than their context window by breaking them into manageable pieces. And I also built a tool on top of that called docdog(<a href=\"https://github.com/duriantaco/docdog\">https://github.com/duriantaco/docdog</a>) using this pykomodo. Feel free to use it and contribute if you want.</p> <p>The github as well as the readthedocs links are below.
