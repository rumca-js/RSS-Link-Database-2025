        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, I testified in California yesterday in support of a bill that would keep men out of women\u2019s locker rooms and sports teams. We\u2019ll talk about that. Also, some female members of Congress banded together to demand that they be allowed to vote from home, in defiance of the Constitution. And a prominent race hustler declares that every law written before 1965 should be abolished because they were all written by white men. Plus, Cory Booker filibusters for over 24 hours. It was the longest filibuster in history. What was he filibustering? Why was he doing this? That is still not clear.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:29 Opening\n01:54 - 27:51 Why I Went To Speak In Front Of The California Assembly Yesterday\n29:02 - 38:27 Two Representatives Want At-Home Voting In Congress For New Moms\n38:28 - 42:50 Race Hustler Says Laws Written By White Men Should Be Abolished\n42:51 - 48:11 CBS News Claims One In Every 15 Adults Have Been At A Mass Shooting\n49:48 - 1:00:55 Cory Booker",
