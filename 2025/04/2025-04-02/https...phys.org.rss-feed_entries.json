So far, debris from SpaceX and Blue Origin rockets has landed in locations including the Bahamas, Florida, Poland, and Turks and Caicos and caused flight delays at airports in Florida. On February 18, NASA estimated that asteroid 2024 YR4 had a 3.1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032\u2014the highest probability of impact ever recorded by the agency\u2014although they later reduced that estimate to 0.004%.",
