        "description": "Whenever fans brought up Days Gone in the past, it was with equal amounts of appreciation and pain. The open-world post-zombie title had its ups and downs, but despite fostering an extensive community of fans, there were no hopes for a sequel or even a PS5 upgrade.\n\nThankfully, the latter will change on April 25th as Bend Studio is releasing Days Gone Remastered, an enhanced version of the title with improved graphics, shorter loading times, DualSense support, and more. It also offers several new modes for fans to enjoy, like Horde Assault, which involves surviving for as long as possible against massive hordes of zombies.\n\nSpeedrun and Permadeath also let you push your skills to the limit, while Photo Mode enhancements allow for even more stunning shots. Here's everything you should know about Days Gone Remastered before it arrives for PS5.",
