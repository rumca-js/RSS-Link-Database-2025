I wanted to ease myself in, so I began with a couple of Agatha Christie novels, followed by Pride and Prejudice as a warm-up. Then I decided to read Middlemarch as an act of radical self improvement - although all I really knew about it was that it was by George Eliot, whom I (fairly, I think!) assumed was a man!</p> <p>I found it a real slog at first, but something happened at the end of book 1 and I was hooked. There&#39;s not really a plot as such; just the lives of people in a provincial town, but what reels you in is the characters. Eliot describes their inner lives, their motivations so clearly and so directly you feel as though you&#39;re standing in the room with them, inside their heads, feeling their thoughts.
