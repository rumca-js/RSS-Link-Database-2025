When I got it few months back it seemed okay but now it keep sliding forward to my face and I have to keep tightening it up which makes it uncomfortable to wear. I have changed the pad at the back to honeycomb one but still same issue.

Its $60 on sale right now at B&amp;H and I grabbed one. Figured even if I can&#39;t get any PCVR out of it at all, I&#39;ll have a $60 SD card video player. </p> <p>I do have a Re-Live compatible video card, so no problem there. Yes, its resolution is less than that of the Meta Quest 2, but that device only supports IPD up to 68 and my IPD is 70. I tried the meta quest 2 and it made me dizzy and was blurry no matter what I did or what settings I adjusted because it simply doesn&#39;t support my IPD. Also, the Meta Quest 2 is more expensive, even used and I don&#39;t care about true VR experiences. I only want to be able to stream videos and games. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ibex333\"> /u/ibex333 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jpubde/htc_vive_focus_plus/\">[lin",

I want to avoid using more then one physical machine. I tried to use Aster multiseat software and Virtual Desktop Streamer but the software runs as system service and is no chance to run its multiple instances, one per seat. Using Windows embedded virtualization consumes a lot of hardware resources and is very tricky with setting up the environment. There is a movie on YT where one guy did it with Aster software and Virtual Desktop but without any explanation how to set it up. There was a promise that a special episode will be created but 3 years have been passed and nothing.

Seems like a no brainer to cash in on nostalgia and use the IP for older games. I would assume there is a whole sea of games that have Skyrim level graphics and below that could be reworked for VR fairly effortlessly(that&#39;s is an assumption, I have no experience with game development)</p> <p>Any thoughts?
