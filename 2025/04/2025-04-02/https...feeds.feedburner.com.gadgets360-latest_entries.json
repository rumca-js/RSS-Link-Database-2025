        "description": "Two fossils of an ancient arthropod named Keurbos susanae have been discovered in South Africa. The creature lived 444 million years ago during the Late Ordovician period. Its soft tissues, including muscles and guts, were found preserved but its shell, legs and head were missing. Researchers believe the species lived in low-oxygen conditions. The fossil site has now been buried due to quarrying, making the discovery even rarer.",

The phenomenon occurs when a massive foreground galaxy bends light from a hidden background galaxy, forming a near-perfect ring. This effect, predicted by Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, helps astronomers study galaxies from the early universe. The European and Canadian space agencies highlighted how gravitational lensing can magnify distant objects, offering insights into dark matter and black holes. The image was part of Webb\u2019s March picture of the month release.",
