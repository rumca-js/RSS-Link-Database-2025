So im thinking of buying &quot;Castles of Burgundy: Special edition&quot;(I&#39;m pretty sure my group and me included will like this game, so thats why im going all-in on this game). And I found a not so bad deal for 100+ euros of a non-english version of this game which is the cheapest option as buying an english version would cost me north of 180 euros. The main question is will the non-english version hinder the game experience in any way? I know BGG says this game has no language dependency and i could in theory DYI the bottom of the tiles to translate it to my native/english language and download the english rules. Are there any other things im missing that would in any way hinder the experience?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DugeonMan\"> /u/DugeonMan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/co",

I don&#39;t play with a lot of hard core players so Between Two Cities might be more ideal but I think also it gets kind of repetitive. I&#39;m not sure how many plays we will get out of it. Between Two castles is more complex but also has more complex scoring. I&#39;m also not sure if it&#39;s too complex for some newbies. I have both games on the essential edition, but like them both. Sadly I think the mechanics are too similar and I would rather cull one to free up shelf space.
