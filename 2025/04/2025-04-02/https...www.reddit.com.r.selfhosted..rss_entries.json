But then I&#39;d like to then use my storage pool for VM&#39;s and LXC&#39;s.</p> <p>But the question is how exactly? I was hearing about iSCSI drives, essentially virtual drives that I can just map to any VM or LXC&#39;s. So if I do it through TrueNAS, would Proxmox just automatically detect it?</p> <p>And also, I&#39;m kind of confused on LXC&#39;s. I ultimately want to run services like Traefik, Portainer, Pterodactyl, etc. These services come in containers, and generally speaking you need a Linux OS for these containers to run on.</p> <p>Based on my research, we can have Proxmox run these container&#39;s through LXC&#39;s. Are LXC&#39;s essentially a minimal Linux environment for the containers to run in? Can the virtual drives ",

But now I&#39;ve moved everything to Docker, and the python program I was running no longer works since the container doesn&#39;t have all the libraries (plus I was calling rsync, which isn&#39;t even in the container). Anyone ever done anything like this? I can&#39;t think of how to proceed. What I&#39;m doing is copying certain files to a share once they&#39;re downloaded. Is there like a daemon I could run somewhere that will wait for me to call it? The qbittorrent container has curl, so I could call it with REST or something like that.
