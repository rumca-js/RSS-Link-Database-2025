        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all</p> <p>The primary reason I&#39;m asking is that I&#39;ve noticed quite the long list of Proton versions when you consider Steam&#39;s and the GE variants. While ProtonDB is an excelent resource to find what version will run a game best, there are also instances where more than one version of Proton will be recommended. Is there a general rule of thumb for knowing what versions of Proton might work best over others or does it all just come down to trial and error?</p> <p>As an example say a game came out at the time of Proton 7 and some version of Proton 7 runs the game well. Is it fair to assume that Proton 7 will ALWAYS work with the game barring any large updates that overhaul the game or is it also possible that another newer version of Proton or ProtonGE can run the game equally well or possibly better? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheBigSad91\"> /u/TheBigSad91 </a> <br/> <span><a",

It was working great, apart from having two monitors with different resolutions (3840x2160 and 1080x1920). So, ditching the second monitor and it worked better, until &quot;Split Fiction&quot; came out. It started good, and a few levels in, the performance went from 90+ fps to 10+ fps. As it&#39;s a multiplayer game, I simply installed windows and carried on with it. </p> <p>Granted, this was using an RTX4070 Super. </p> <p>Now, I&#39;m wondering if I should go back, but I&#39;ve read some posts about my current GPU not performing as it should on Linux. </p> <p>So my question is, is it time, or do I still wait awhile for it to settle a bit?</p> <p>Don&#39;t really want to hear about my distro of choice, I like Bazzite, I prefer KDE Plasma, and unless there&#39;s an easy fix, I don&#39;t want to be tinkering too much.

However I had another system with a Ryzen CPU in it, and I wasn&#39;t able to game on it until I installed AMD drivers.

I use Proton-GE (latest) usually.</p> <p>I&#39;ll use 5 games to showcase the issue:</p> <ul> <li>Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</li> <li>DOOM (2016)</li> <li>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</li> <li>Metro 2033 Redux </li> <li>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</li> </ul> <p>Shadow Gambit works perfect as is. I get constant 100+FPS with or without Gamescope.</p> <p>Both DOOM and Epic Mickey lock themselves at 37 FPS, which is half of my monitor&#39;s refresh rate (75Hz). </p> <p>Here&#39;s where the headaches start.</p> <p>DOOM runs at 37 FPS with around 25% GPU usage; except if I go into GNOME Overview, then I see the FPS jump to almost 200 (which is around what I should be getting with my rig), and GPU usage with it. </p",
