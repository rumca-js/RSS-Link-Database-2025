Recently, I posted a tweet on Twitter criticizing transphobia within Korean feminism. This is what I wrote: &#39;The essence of women&#39;s oppression lies in the gender roles created by society. Trans women also face problems such as sexual violence, employment discrimination, and social exclusion while living as women. Feminism that aims to liberate women must also protect the rights of trans women. Protecting women&#39;s rights is not about deciding who to include, but about creating a society where all women are safe and respected. Ostracizing transwomen will only weaken solidarity within women and lead to confrontation with each other. Lastly, I believe that excluding trans women is not against discrimination against women, but creates another form of discrimination. The purpose of feminism is to create an environment where all oppressed women can fight together.&#39; This soon becam",
