I&#39;m comfortable with most of what I&#39;d need to do, but I&#39;m very unfamiliar with RS485. I&#39;d love to figure out some way to keep the Pi in my house and connect to the pool equipment via a wireless RS485 setup of some sort. Is that a thing? I do see some wireless RS485 adapters, but they all seem to have horrible reviews and documentation. Any recommendations? </p> <p>I&#39;m leery of keeping a pi outdoors in the summer heat. Also, I&#39;ve always used SSD disks for pi&#39;s that were going to be on 24/7, and in this case space will be at a premium if I put this outside. I thought I read that Pi&#39;s don&#39;t destroy SD cards like they used to if left on 24/7?</p> <p>Anyways, any tips or suggestions are welcome.

While it was a fun start, I couldn&#39;t help but think about fully stateless clusters where the compute nodes operate on an rw overlay over a ro root filesystem. In this scheme, anything which would require persistent state would be done through additional mounts (e.g., scratch and home directories). </p> <p><strong>Problem:</strong></p> <p>I&#39;ve found some obscure forum posts and articles which talk about the process for past hardware and software, or at least components of it (see resources)",

A controller that can upload the video to the cloud (no need for real-time streaming). Need to be able to connect to wifi</p> <p>I want to keep costs as low as possible. Is a raspberry pi 5 overkill for this project? Could this be done with a simpler, cheaper controller, like an arduino? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IVRafa\"> /u/IVRafa </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://w",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m attempting to write a script for my Raspberry Pi running Lite to control my Philips Hue Lights by detecting hotkey inputs from a macropad that will run commands based on the hotkey, e.g. increase brightness, decrease brightness, etc. The two main libraries to use are keyboard and pynput. The problem I ran into with keyboard was that it requires sudo to listen for keyboard hotkey inputs. Although my script works with: sudo ./path to virtual environment/bin/python ./path to script/myscript.py, I&#39;m hoping to find a non root solution. The alternative is pynput which either requires root or x server to be running. Since I&#39;m running lite headless on a pi zero 2 w, it seems counterintuitive to install x server, which from my understanding is for using a GUI (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong). </p> <p>Does anybody have any suggestions for an alternative solution to achieve this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",

So i wanted to basically image the current drive and dump the image on the new drive to use that one. I dont want to rebuild. So much stuff configured and running on it.</p> <p>Any suggestion on how to? Yes i can shut it down, remove the drive and make an image in windows. Would that be best option?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xlodarx\"> /u/xlodarx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jpeumz/nvme_image_to_new_drive/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jpeumz/nvme_image_to_new_drive/\">[comments]</a></span>",
