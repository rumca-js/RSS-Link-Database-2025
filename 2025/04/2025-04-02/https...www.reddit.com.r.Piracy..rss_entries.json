Granted, we won&#39;t know how it works until it&#39;s released either way. Maybe it recognizes the media, but won&#39;t run off of them, in which case, maybe it&#39;s as simple as transferring it to the built-in storage.</p> <p>I&#39;m not a dev or coder, I&#39;m literally just making this topic to put the hypothetical out there. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Valen_Celcia\"> /u/Valen_Celcia </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/P",

No price announced yet but the fact that it&#39;s a paid title is incredibly messed up.</p></li> <li><p>They&#39;re also raising the price for their first party titles. Mario Kart World will sell for 80$. Knowing Nintendo I assume none of their games will ever go on sale.</p></li> <li><p>Oh and how about enjoying Zelda TOTK, a game you already own, on the upgraded hardware? Wanna unlock higher framerate and other settings? Better pay up for that upgrade. Not even Sony is that greedy, most first party PS4 titles received free patches for PS5 unlocking higher framerates so you could easily enjoy your games with better settings for free.</p></li> </ol",
