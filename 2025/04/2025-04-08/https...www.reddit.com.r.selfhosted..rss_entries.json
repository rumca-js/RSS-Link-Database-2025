A few days ago, Meta released Llama 4 in 2 versions - Scout (109B parameters) &amp; Maverick (402B parameters).</p> <ul> <li>Both models are giants. So we at <a href=\"https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth\">Unsloth</a> shrank the 115GB Scout model to 33.8GB (80% smaller) by selectively quantizing layers for the best performance. So you can now run it locally!</li> <li>Thankfully, both models are much smaller than DeepSeek-V3 or R1 (720GB disk space), with Scout at 115GB &amp; Maverick at 420GB - so inference should be much faster. <strong>And Scout can actually run well on devices without a GPU.</strong></li> <li>For now, we only uploaded the smaller Scout model but Maverick is in the works (will update this post once it&#39;s done).

Danbooru is out due to it&#39;s licence and while I haven&#39;t looked into it it seems like overkill for a single user. szurubooru is more promising and seems solidly built, but is again more focused on being an online service than a personal one. Primarily it does not appear to have any filesystem-based import feature? I only see the web upload which is a no-go as I need to convert a Hy",

Ran through the normal troubleshooting and came to the conclusion there were no hardware failures or configuration errors on my end. So I call Spectrum and find out they throttled my 1G internet to 100M. After some back and forth they inform me it&#39;s due to copyright issues. My VPN and I both know that&#39;s unlikely. The rep keeps digging and informs me it&#39;s apparently an issue to have my router configured with a static IP and that that is the root of this whole situation. I have been self hosting Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf, Crafty, and a few other services since January and this is the first I have had any issues. Anyone else run in to a similar issue? I know what my options are I just never realized this was even a thing. I have Jellyfin set up to access remotely using our phones and Crafty is set up for a family Minecraft sever. Everything is local access only. ",
