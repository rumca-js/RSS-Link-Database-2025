Are there any other strategies for bypassing the encryption without resorting to brute force?</p> <p>I&#39;m considering several possibilities, such as identifying potential vulnerabilities in the LUKS2 implementation on RedHat 8.8 or trying to extract the encryption key from the system&#39;s memory through methods like cold boot or DMA attacks. Additionally, I&#39;m contemplating the use of social engineering to potentially acquire the passphrase from someone who may have access.</p> <p>I&#39;m open to all ethical methods, so any advice, suggestion",
