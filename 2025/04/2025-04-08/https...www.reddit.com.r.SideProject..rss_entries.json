Based on that, the tool suggests indie movies for your group to rate. Once everyone\u2019s swiped through them, it creates a ranked list of top picks that (hopefully) make everyone happy.</p> <p>It\u2019s still a beta version, but the goal is to make movie nights way easier\u2014and maybe even fun before the movie starts.</p> <p>Would love any feedback if you give it a try, and I\u2019m open to suggestions for making it better!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PerceptionTa",
