When they\u2019re applied, they raise the cost of goods, so right now, U.S. residents (and those near enough to be affected) must pay more on tech products and other affected items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But despite the flat numbers you may have seen in the news (i.e., a now 54 percent tariff on all imports from China, a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports, and the looming possibility of a 25 percent tariff on semiconductor imports), price increases may not end up so exact. Their full effect isn\u2019t known yet either, like possible lower availability of products, which could further affect costs.
