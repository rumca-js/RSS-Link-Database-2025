If I don\u2019t want anything too hearty, I\u2019ll often serve it with greens or a salad, so it really is a quick turnaround. I love this simple brown butter caper dressing, because it doesn\u2019t overpower the fish. However, if you want something a little punchier, add a spoonful of harissa to the mix.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/08/sea-bream-lemon-caper-burnt-butter-recipe-georgina-hayden\">Continue reading...</a>",
