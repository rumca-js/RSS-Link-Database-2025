They look nice, often have a clever design even. They are made of a nice material and are nice to hold. I feel like lots of books nowadays have a kind of paper that is a bit &#39;rough&#39;, which annoys me because then there&#39;s shadow spots on the pages when I&#39;m trying to read with a lamp, but Penguin ones tend to have nice paper.

I actually didn&#39;t know the actual length of the book and when I learned it&#39;s 1200+, I thought I was reading volume 1 of the book and I could download volume 2 later. Today when I tried to look for volume 2, I realized... I feel so upset!!! I missed so many foreshadowings, details and descriptions of the Count that would have made me like this book even more.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently in the Valentine chapter, very close to the end. I&#39;m debating what I should do. I don&#39;t really want to read the entire unabridged version (not sure if I&#39;ll have the patience because I know the general plot by now). For example I can skip Luigi Vampa parts but I want to read more about Mercedes and Dantes relationship, daughter of Danglars, and scenes in Paris society (because I actually felt like they were too little in the version I ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I just finished this book. Ken Croke is a retired ATF agent and the first to infiltrate the Pagan Motorcycle Club. He became a fully patched member, and he stayed undercover with Pagans for two years. </p> <p>Something that had me wondering the entire time was how he faked doing drugs. Whether they were using drugs as a test to see if he was a cop, or just hanging around, he never says anything about just passing it up. As that could raise a lot of suspicion either way. Meth and cocaine was making its way to him constantly and all he says is that he had some sort of sleight of hand trick to make it seem like he snorted whatever was in front of him. At first, I didn\u2019t really believe that. I was thinking that he had to have done anything to come his way, and that there\u2019s no way he did this for two years. But, learning that any Fed that\u2019s undercover that ingest drugs has to be taken to the hospital immediately, and that the ATF only allows the ingest",

It was, BTW, more or less what I would&#39;ve expected. Lots of sex, drugs, and Heavy Metal.</p> <p>I&#39;ll preface this by saying that I&#39;m not much of a Heavy Metal or even a Rock fan. My brother is, particularly when I was younger and sharing a room with him.</p> <p>So, on occasion, I listen to some metal songs he would listen back in the day simply because I liked them. That includes Iron Maiden, ACDC, Led Zeppelin, Megadeath, Metallica, Aerosmith, Pantera, Disturbed, Linkin Park, Judas Priest, System of a Down, and lots more.</p> <p>I, however, have never been to a concert. Any concert. Nor have I got plans to go to one. But, I&#39;m a sucker for biographies. So when I saw that the lead singer of Judas Priest had a book, I decided to give it a try.</p> <p>And, if you don&#39;t know, he is very British and very gay. And like Jennette McCurdy in he",

I&#39;ve finished all but Pretty Maggie, which I&#39;m almost done with but I need someone to talk to about them. Each of the narrators of the stories are awful in ways that make it clear that the author is aware that they&#39;re terrible, but uncertain if there&#39;s much distinction between the POVs of the characters vs that of the author. For the eponymous story, I feel like so much of modern sci fi owe the apparently quite litigious Ellison several royalty checks (in particular the Matrix and Black Mirror). It honestly kind of peaked at the title but that&#39;s more because the title was so evocative that it would have been nearly impossible to live up to it. That being said, the story itself cert",
