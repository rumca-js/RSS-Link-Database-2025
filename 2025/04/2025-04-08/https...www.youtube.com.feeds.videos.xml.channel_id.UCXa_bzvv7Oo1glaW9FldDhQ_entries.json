        "description": "The new entry in the long dormant real-time-tactics series returns on April 9th with the prequel game Commandos: Origins. This new entry honors past games in the series with the same class based commando units and isometric perspective but includes some new modern features.\n\nDeveloped in Unreal Engine 5, Commandos Origins features great visuals and some streamlined elements, notably the omission of enemy inventory. I quite enjoyed the variety of missions and plethora of ways to go about each, but had to overcome a number of bugs and other issues to do so.",
