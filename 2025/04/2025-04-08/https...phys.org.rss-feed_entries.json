That started changing after Sears and Roebuck's famous catalog became popular, allowing the firm to grow, while a rival, Montgomery Ward, also expanded. By the 1930s, the U.S. had 130,000 chain stores, topped by Atlantic and Pacific supermarkets (the A&P), with over 15,000 stores.",

Its selective hydrogenation to 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF), a crucial precursor for pharmaceuticals, nucleoside analogs, and specialty polymers, is of particular interest. However, conventional thermocatalytic HMF hydrogenation often necessitates harsh conditions (high temperatures and pressures), leading to substantial energy consumption and process intensification challenges.",

By analyzing regional differences in the rollout of the program, the study identified links between early childhood education and lower rates of juvenile violent arrests and teenage pregnancy. Published in the Journal of Public Economics, the findings suggest that improved noncognitive skills played a key role in mitigating risky behaviors, highlighting the lasting benefits of early-education policies.",
