Those laptops used to include the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2265434/razer-blade-14-review.html\">Razer Blade 14</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1801763/razer-blade-16-review.html\">Razer Blade 16</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/1977289/razer-blade-18-review.html\">Razer Blade 18</a>.
