It is conceived in the robustly muscular style of Bourne and Mission: Impossible, and features Rami Malek as nerdy CIA intelligence analyst Charles Heller, whose wife is murdered by terrorists in London. Enraged at a lack of progress in the case and suspecting a cover-up, he blackmails his immediate superiors into training him to be an assassin (by threatening to reveal their black ops), so he can hunt his wife\u2019s killers and whack them. His exasperated teacher is Colonel Henderson, played by Laurence Fishburne. It\u2019s based on an 80s bestseller by Robert Littell, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w",
