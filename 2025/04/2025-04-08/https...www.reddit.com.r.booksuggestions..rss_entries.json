Basically a runaway heroine who left the small town many years ago is back for whatever reason. I\u2019m not sure if any books like exist but it would be so good\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d</p> <p>She could\u2019ve left their town for any reason (valid or because she\u2019s spoiled), but it would be so good if the hero hates her for leaving. The town as well, similar to Forever My Girl. I basically just wanna cry and witness a cute love story. </p> <p>I prefer no pregnancy or kids, but if it\u2019s there I\u2019ll still read it.

It\u2019s got deep family drama, some comedy, and likable characters that all have arcs and flaws. This got me thinking why don\u2019t we have more book series that are like family drama tv series? I\u2019d love to read a book or series about just life drama. So recommend me some books that have similar vibes! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/brotherluthor\"> /u/brotherluthor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1juhugo/books_like_six_feet_under/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1juhugo/books_like_six_feet_under/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Books about women in their late 30s-40s that are a mess? I love all this literary fiction books about crazy, lost, feral, unreliable female narrators (think from Ottesa to Sayaka Murata) but most women are in their 20s or very early 30s. I just want to feel seen or less crazy lol (or feel less alone). I love thrillers and literally fiction. Please, if they deal with maternity directly I try to avoid them since it&#39;s a difficult issue for me (like Nightbitch). </p> <p>Thanks a lot! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Commercial-Spinach93\"> /u/Commercial-Spinach93 </a> <br/> <spa",

The only book I have is Astrophysics for People in a Hurry and I haven&#39;t even finished it yet. But I&#39;m listening to a StarTalk podcast right now and they have Richard Dawkins as a guest. They&#39;ve talked about some biology related topics, and I remember that I loved biology so much when I was in high school. So, I was wondering if you guys can suggest a book like Astrophysics for People in a Hurry but for biology or evolution or something? I did a bit of research and took an interest to The Selfish Gene but saw some feedback that it is outdated since it&#39;s an old book already. Would you guys still suggest it to this date? Or is there a better alternative?</p> <p>I apologize if I made any grammatical mistakes, English isn&#39;t my first language.<br/> edit: typo</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Uranova\"> /u/Uran",
