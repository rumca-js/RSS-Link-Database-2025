I still have a bit of time to play when the wife and baby go to sleep, but I\u2019m really starting to adjust what and how I play. Went from Pc to ps5. Picked up the first beserker khazan but realized that soulslikes aren\u2019t the most fun when you spend half the play session getting back into the swing of things. Now that I can\u2019t binge play these 50+ hour massive rpgs no longer have the same appeal.
