With AI finally becoming more standardized, this could be a push needed for a more widespread use of AI in diffrent fields. Django&#39;s robust data handling capabilities seem perfect to benefit from these changes</p> <p>Could we see a revitalization of Django in diffrent fields and applications as organizations look for reliable frameworks and try to re-implement legacy solutions to implement AI solutions that follow regulations?</p> <p>Mby i&#39;m just biased towards Django but i really have a feeling that the combination of python, great data handling and good community could put Django back on the map.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BiggerestL\"> /u/BiggerestL </a> <b",

Is there anyway to include the user sign in form on the landing page using the view/form from the \u2018users\u2019 app? So that when users visit \u2018https://sitename/\u2018 they will be prompted with the login form and then there will be a link underneath for new users which will take them to /register/. </p> <p>EDIT: Got it sorted, I was confusing myself by wanting to create a home page which had the same functionality as my login page, so I just changed my login page to be rendered instead of a home page.
