Thoughts on this? Would an external or an internal HDD with enclosure be best? Are internal HDD&#39;s safe to store not plugged in? I&#39;m not dead set on having it cold storage, but would prefer that. (Like once every few months plug it in and upload copies of new files, etc..) I see lots of suggestions for just cloud storage, but idk if I want to pay a monthly fee for that!
