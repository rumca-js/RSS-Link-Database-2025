Both projects are being helmed by Dan Trachtenberg, who proved his <em>Predator</em> chops directing the excellent <em>Prey</em>, and is now providing a compelling new chapter for the franchise.</p>\n<p>First up is <em>Predator: Killer of Killers</em>, an animated miniseries that will arrive on Hulu on June 6. That anthology dropped a first look trailer today and it's a taste of classic Predator action as the beast hunts down warriors across three different time periods. There are Viking raiders, samurai in feudal Japan and pilots from World War II. I imagine things end badly for the humans in every era.</p>\n<span id=",
