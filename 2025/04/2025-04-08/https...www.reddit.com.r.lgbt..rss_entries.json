I\u2019m going on a trip to Vegas with 4 of my best friends, the thing is, they\u2019re all gay. 2 couples and me, the straight. I\u2019ve been friends with them for over 10 years now and they\u2019ve made a point that with this trip they want to hit some gay bars and clubs. I have zero issue with this, I\u2019m a huge ally, I\u2019m just concerned about inserting myself in a queer space despite being there with my buddies. How should I handle this? Is there anything I should keep in mind while I\u2019m there?
