In a lot of card driven games, like Twilight Struggle (and everything similar, cant and wont name them all), there is a card mechanic where cards have event and values. Premise is simple, you either play card for its event or use it for its worth and perform some of the available actions. I am currently developing a strategy game that has a similar mechanic, but I am yet on the fence as to how to implement it. It is a historical card driven strategy game for 2 players. So I relized there are 3 main options mainly implemented in the games and I want to hear your opinion on what you think is the more interesting way of implementing it?</p> <ol> <li>Scripted events</li> </ol> <p>So in this way of implementing events into historical baord games (history inspired board games), events mirror the things that happened in real life. This is a good way of guidein",

I&#39;d seen some mixed options on SFG converting video games to boardgames, but was hopeful that it would be good. Unfortunately seeing the reveal the components look like thin cards cardstock for the maps and characters, generic dice/cubes, and of course solid but expensive miniatures. The illuminid were not included (maybe one of the unrevealed expansions), and automatons require an expansion with only basic terminids in the core box.</p> <p>Am I the only one quite underwhelmed by the components and game systems that they showed off? This would be my first SFG campaign so trying to get a pulse check especially with a almost $400 price tag on the big bundle once shipping is factored in.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Azmirit",

The monsters would have equipment icons that you would need to defeat them, assuming. </p> <p>The board itself was a typical medieval setting, however; in the center was a whirlpool where you can fold out the map into a dark plane.

I currently own a good amount of SoB Forbidden Fortress content but didn&#39;t play much of it (I just recently bought it). I&#39;ve done a lot of research and know that Darklight is a very unforgiving game but I&#39;m mostly worried about the similarities between it and Brimstone.
