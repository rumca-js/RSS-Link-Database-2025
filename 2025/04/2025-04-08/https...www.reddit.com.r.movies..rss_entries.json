Are there any vampire-themed films that you love the plot of - I get people are gonna say Blade and stuff, but that&#39;s cool....I discovered He Never Died, and thought that was quite interesting, for example - I&#39;m also looking forward to trying Sinners :) but any recommendations would be welcome.
