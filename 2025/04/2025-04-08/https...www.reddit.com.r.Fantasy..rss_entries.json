I can honestly say I\u2019ve never read a book like this before. Simon Jimenez wrote such a powerful, unique story that contrasts a lot of the fantasy books we all spend time with. The juxtaposition between the audience members and the introductory protagonist, and the two main characters taking up the majority of the story really made this book special. It introduced an almost magical element into the story that felt like reading folklore when you were a kid. The way Simon incorporated the inner monologue of characters who normally wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to have their story or thoughts voiced throughout the book really made this book shine. It added much appreciated perspective and gravitas to the story. I\u2019ve never read a book that has done this quite like this book does. The prose shines through here. It\u2019s beautiful and po",

I noticed a lot of people suggested the audio books instead and it solved almost all of my problems.

It doesn&#39;t matter how repetitive the books are if I&#39;m working out at the gym or doing chores around the house. I also started using the WOT compendium for the side characters and that has been very helpful. I reread book 2 with the audiobook and compendium app. I would&#39;ve rated book 2 a 6/10 before when I read it physically but now I&#39;d put it closer to a 9/10.

I admit, I miss Maia from THE GOBLIN EMPEROR but I have come to treasure my experiences with Thara. He is a rare kind of protagonist in that he is older, a gay, nonconfrontational. and a figure who uses his words far more than he ever does his fists. He is far more the kind of protagonist you\u2019d find in a mystery novel than you would your typical fantasy story and reminds me a bit of Brother Cadfael.</p> <p>I very much enjoy the world of Osreth because it is an incredibly realized world and whil",

The satisfaction of piecing things together - whether it&#39;s characters, connections, magic systems - is truly unique.</p> <p>The storylines themselves are gripping, the characters are great, the dialogue feels so natural, and the imagery is just incredible.
