To prepare, we sat down with The Last of Us creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin, as well as series cast Bella Ramsey, Gabriel Luna, Kaitlyn Dever, Isabela Merced, and Young Mazino to get their opinions on whether or not Joel was right, what made Season 2 the right time to re-introduce spores to the story, adapting the unadaptable, and their ideal end of the world food. \n\nSeason 2 of The Last of Us will challenge Joel and Ellie more than ever before, and the introductions of characters like Abby, Jesse and Dina will both elevated and complicate their story further. The cordyceps continues to spread and while a safe haven has been found in Jacksonville, how long can safety truly last in the apocalypse? \n\nOur The Last of Us interview is filled with laughs and serious discussions, as the cast and creators explore Joel's actions in Pedro Pascal's absence.
