One of my standard troubleshooting procedures was a driver update.</p> <p>OMG it went bad. Full on screen blackout, fans to 100% complete total system hang. Only a hard restart could fix it.</p> <p>Once I did that, it booted in a 640x480 resolution... on a 26&quot; screen... lol. so I <em>sudo</em> <em>dpkg --config -a</em> everything after which the problem appeared to have rectified.</p> <p>NOPE!</p> <p>Ran the game in question - a grand total of 0.01 or even less fps. It took 5 minutes for just the textures in the menu to load in. Funniest part of all? It was the only game that ran at all on this particular version of the drivers, every other game just straight up crashed.</p> <p>So I purged the drivers and tried again. Same result.</p> <p>In",
