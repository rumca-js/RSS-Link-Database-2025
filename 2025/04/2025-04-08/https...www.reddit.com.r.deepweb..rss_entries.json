It&#39;s called Domestic Monero Chan, has a mix of P2P XMR trading, imageboard-style threads, and even encrypted DMs (PGP support built in). The whole thing feels super minimalist, anonymous, and kinda nostalgic for early web communities. Just wondering if anyone else has stumbled across it? Curious to hear your thoughts if you&#39;ve used it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Original-Worker4005\"> /u/Original-Worker4005 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1jucueu/has_anyone_tried_this_localmonerostyle_p2p_xmr/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1jucueu/has_anyone_tried_this_localmonerostyle_p2p_xmr/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I had a unique username on a scrap ID and I wanted it on my personal ID....so I decided to swap it but because of 14 days waiting time I had to be precise on time so I decided to do it in midnight but after 14 days at that same time some &quot;hacker&quot; got that username and trying to sell it back to me. Damn I lost my very unique username because or this lame 14 days policy. He told me that they put the username on that bot and it works every mili second to get that username. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lockdown_nerd\"> /u/lockdown_nerd </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1jucpb0/does_anyone_know_about_telegram_bot_called/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deepweb/comments/1jucpb0/does_anyone_know_about_telegram_bot_called/\">[comments]</a></span>",
