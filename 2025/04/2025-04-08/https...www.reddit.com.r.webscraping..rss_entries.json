I have spent the last 10 hours in constant communication with ChatGPT as it has tried to write me script to extract annual reports from company websites.</p> <p>I need this for my thesis and the deadline for data collection is fast approaching. I used Python for the first time today so please excuse my lack of knowledge. I&#39;ve mainly tried with Selenium but recently also Google Customer Search Engine. I basically have a list of 3500 public companies, their websites, and the last available year of their annual reports. Now, they all store and name the PDF of their annual report on their website in slightly different ways. There is just no one-size-fits-all approach for obtaining this magical document from companies&#39; websites. </p> <p>If anyone knows of anyone having done this or has some tips for getting a script to be flexible and adaptable with drop down menus and several clicks. As well as not download",
