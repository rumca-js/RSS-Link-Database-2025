This video expands upon our \"RTX 4080 problem\" by looking at the entirety of the RTX 50 series, including how the RTX 5070 looks an awful lot like a prior 50-class or 60-class GPU. The video sets some metrics for comparison and defines them as we talk CUDA count against the flagship (and flagship against the max die), price creep, inflation-adjusted GPU prices, and perception of the brand for each card.\n\nWaifu GPUs here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bs1O21ibuKM\nAnd our AMD Fake MSRP video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPE95_RnL_Q\nOr our 4080 Problem video that started this for us last time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCJYDJXDRHw\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
