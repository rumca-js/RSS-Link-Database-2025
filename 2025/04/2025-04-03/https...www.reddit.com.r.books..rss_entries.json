But as much as I liked the references, the book made me cringe more times than I care to count, and everything outside of the nostalgia was either bad or forgettable. Still, I decided to give Ernest Cline another shot and read <em>Armada</em>, another video game-centric novel\u2014this time with absolutely no redeeming qualities.</p> <p>Cline has an obsession with making his protagonists know-it-alls who are effortlessly amazing at video games, and while that was off-putting in <em>RPO</em>, I didn\u2019t realize how bad it was until I started reading <em>Dungeon Crawler Carl</em> by Matt Dinniman. This is my first book by Dinniman, and I\u2019m only a few chapters in, but wow\u2014what a refreshing change. The protagonist isn\u2019t some flawless genius, the game mechanics are well explained, and the humor actually lands. You can tell that Dinniman is genuinely funny and well-ve",

I&#39;m glad to report that I was so very wrong. This is a sweet and very catchy story, with the struggles of the LGBT community and the centuries of oppression maskerading as &quot;tradition&quot; interwoven with the plot in a spectacularly intelligent way. I liked Heartstopper, but it felt too preachy at times. This, instead, taught me about queer history in a very subtle way, making people from centuries ago feel like living links in a very long, wonderful chain.</p> <p>This might be my favourite queer romance yet, and inspired me to up my game with the gay romance novel I just finished writing and I have now to edit. I&#39;m glad I read this and sad that I didn&#39;t read it sooner.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Haebak\"> /u/Haebak </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.",

The main character\u2019s last name being Grimm is way too on the nose. Nothing is subtle, and if I read the word \u201conyx\u201d one more time I\u2019m going to throw this book into the abyss. The writing is juvenile. The dialogue feels so forced, and everything is over explained. </p> <p>I can\u2019t believe I had this on hold at my library. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/yesletslift\"> /u/yesletslift </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jq7msv/phantasma_dnf/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1jq7msv/phantasma_dnf/\">[comments]</a></span>",
