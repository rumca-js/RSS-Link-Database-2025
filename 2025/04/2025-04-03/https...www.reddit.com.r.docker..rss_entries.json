When running it though, it says that no frameworks were found in the logs. It says I should install the missing framework and I did but it still doesn&#39;t work. Idk why it suggested that I install an AspNetCore framework when I am using the Microsoft.NET.Sdk and the target framework is net 9.0, at least that s what the project file says.
