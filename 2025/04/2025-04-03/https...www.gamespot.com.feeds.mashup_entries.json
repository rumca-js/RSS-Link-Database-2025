He's gone from one of the most infamous video game villains to a hero of his own platformer series, a rhythm game star, and more. His one attempt at a 3D platformer, Donkey Kong 64, was a bit of a low point in his storied career, but you can't keep a good ape down, and now he's back with another swing at the genre. After some hands-on time with the new <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/\">Switch 2</a> game, I think Donkey Kong Bananza may just be his 3D platformer redemption.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Donkey Kong Bananza carries some noticeable DNA from another Nintendo game, but its central hook is all its own.
