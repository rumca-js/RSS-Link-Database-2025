        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nIt's been more than a day since Nintendo's deep dive into the new Switch 2 and its software lineup. The consensus seems to be that it's more powerful than expected, but also way more expensive than most people thought, especially for games. Mario Kart World will retail for a whopping $79.99 in the U.S. (and more for physical copies in different regions). What does this mean for Grand Theft Auto 6? A release date hasn't been announced, and this could very well be an $80 game. Would you pay that much for GTA 6? In other news, Xbox's Game Pass Wave 1 for April has been revealed, headlined by South of Midnight. And finally, pets are coming to InZOI.",

        "description": "Check out our The First Berserker: Khazan review by John Carson on Xbox Series X, also available on PC and PS5 (PlayStation 5).\n\nOnce you find your foothold and gain some abilities, the devastating The First Beserker: Khazan bosses start to shine. They\u2019re the reason to play this brutal but impressive soulslike, and they only get better and more mechanically satisfying as you go deeper into The First Berserker: Khazan gameplay. It can be a steep and demoralizing climb, especially in the early hours, but there\u2019s an exhilaration in executing split-second guards and dodges in order to escape relentless attacks before hitting foes with your own flurry of steel. The First Berserker: Khazan might be the hardest game you\u2019ll play this year, but learning to take on the worst this soulslike has to offer at the start imbues you with the confidence to press on. The journey is tough, and it won\u2019t be for everyone \u2013 but with time and practice, it\u2019s well worth seeing it through.\n\n#TheFirstBerserkerKh",

        "description": "Watch our inZOI\u00a0review (Early Access) by Sarah Thwaites on PC.\n\ninZOI is by no means perfect, but it is impressive. Its Early Access launch is a mish-mash of unfinished ideas and engaging mechanics, and I\u2019m still finding little surprises 30 hours in. The character creator and build mode are already complex and relatively user-friendly, and the Karma system is a clever way to introduce drama into the world, but inconsistent behaviours across its uncanny locations and conversation topics don\u2019t put those good ideas in the best light. What\u2019s available right now is an enticing slice of something that could eventually be great. It\u2019s worthwhile enough already if your main interest is curating realistic dioramas to pose your custom Zois in like dolls. However, if you're looking for the moment-to-moment depth of something like The Sims, you\u2019ll need to let Krafton keep cooking for some time yet.\n\nWhat did you think of our IGN inZOI Early Access review featuring lots of inZOI gameplay?

        "description": "April\u2019s Nintendo Direct had a full blowout on all things coming to out on the Nintendo Switch 2 release and shortly thereafter. Along with a slew of first party titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, Nintendo brought with them a ton of third party publishers to show off the biggest games coming to Nintendo Switch. The Duskbloods is heavily thought to be a Bloodborne sequel from the developers of the much beloved PlayStation game by From Software. That\u2019s not the only From Software game highlighted in the Direct, as From Software also made it a point to show that Elden Ring will too be making its way to Switch 2. In a surprise twist, Hollow Knight: Silksong also made a very brief appearance assuring fans that the game is on track to release in 2025.\n\nSince the Nintendo Switch 2 will be capable of playing games at 4K, 60fps with up to 120fps at 1080p, the console will also take select games from the Switch 1 and give them a upgrade to help them perform better.
