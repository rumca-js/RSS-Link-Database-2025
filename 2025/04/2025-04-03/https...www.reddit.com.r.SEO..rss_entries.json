Or some are all the same.</p> <p>I checked her product feed. She has one feed, not multiples. </p> <p>I thought maybe it was listing one for each scent she offers. But she offers 7 contiditioner scents, not 6. And there are only 3 listings for her shampoo, yet 7 scents available. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that.</p> <p>What are your thoughts here?
