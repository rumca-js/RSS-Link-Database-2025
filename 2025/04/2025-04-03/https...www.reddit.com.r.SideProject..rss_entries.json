This allows real world creators to monetise much more of their online activities, which is very difficult for them at the moment because their audiences are not easy to move over to those platforms.</p> <p>All of the same arguments for why this model wouldn&#39;t work in events applied to Substack, OnlyFans, Patreon, and even Airbnb, before they were created.

With over 10 million installations. Tampermonkey is a browser extension that lets you run custom Javascript on any site, letting you tweak layouts, automate tasks, remove elements, or add new features.</p> <p>I recently thought, why not combine Tampermonkey and AI?
