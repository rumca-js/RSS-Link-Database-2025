Not even necessarily buggy, but like how early 3d games often accepted crazy amounts of clipping and distortion in final release products due to the limitations of hardware and 3d programming knowledge. The question isn&#39;t limited to 3D though. Any games that were released in an incredibly janky state are of interest.</p> <p>Thought of this after seeing a mention of the Runabout games. I remember seeing the first Runabout on PS1 and being amazed they released the game looking like that.

If it was just a few games, I wouldn&#39;t care, but this is A LOT of stuff, north of $500 of games, and an Xbox Series S).
