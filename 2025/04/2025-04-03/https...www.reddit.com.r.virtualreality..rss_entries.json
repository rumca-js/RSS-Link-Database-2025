        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Researchers at the University of Arizona have developed a new eye-tracking technology that dramatically improves the precision of VR headsets. Unlike traditional systems that track about twelve eye points, this method uses deflectometry to capture over 40,000 points in a single shot, creating a detailed 3D model of the eye, including the cornea and surrounding areas. In tests, it achieved tracking accuracies as low as 0.46 degrees in humans and 0.1 degrees in artificial models. A patent has been filed, with future plans to enhance the system using AI and 3D reconstruction. This innovation is especially important for VR and AR features like dynamic foveated rendering, which boosts performance by focusing graphics where the user is looking.</p> <p><a href=\"https://mixed-news.com/en/new-eye-tracking-method-could-dramatically-improve-vr-headset-accuracy/\">https://mixed-news.com/en/new-eye-tracking-method-could-dramatically-improve-vr-headset-accuracy/</a",

I got a Pimax Crystal Light, and while the image can be really solid, I get really thrown off by the amount of chromatic aberration. As soon as my eyes drift out of the center, edges have aberration and fringing colors. I made sure to properly adjust the IPD too, so I&#39;m not sure what else I could tweak. </p> <p>I really like the racing experience in VR but I feel a bit let down by the Pimax. Are there other VR sets I could try that have less chromatic aberration or is this just a reality of VR? I am also really intrigued by the Big Screen Beyond 2, but don&#39;t want to risk getting another set that suffers from the same aberration issue.
