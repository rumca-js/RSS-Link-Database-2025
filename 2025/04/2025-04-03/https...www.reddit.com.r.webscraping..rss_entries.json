If you can find use for it that would be great . It started as a custom package to help me save time when making bots . With time I&#39;ll be adding more complex shortcut functions related to web scraping . If you are interested in contributing in any way or giving me some tips/advice . I would appreciate that. I&#39;m just sharing , Have a great day people. Cheers . Much love. </p> <p>ps, I&#39;ve been too busy with other work to make a new logo for the package so for now you&#39;ll have to contend with the quickly sketched monstrosity of a drawing I came up with : )</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/scriptilapia\"> /u/scriptilapia </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1jqp0mi/i_made_an_open_source_web_scraping_python_package/\">[link]</a></span>",

The idea was that if the server sent a 200 response, I would decrease the request interval, and if the server sent a 429, 500, I would increase the request interval.
