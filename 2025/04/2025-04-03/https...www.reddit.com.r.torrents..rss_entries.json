I wanted to ask about something that just happened to check if it is unusual or not.</p> <p>So, for the past few days when I&#39;ve been learning about torrenting and how it works, I&#39;ve had mostly sparse seeding moments, with my best ratio as of this morning being about 2.7, and the next one sub-1. Additionally, out of random action, I set the ratio limit of my BitTorrent to 5.</p> <p>However, when I came back to my computer just recently, after a few hours, I suddenly had over 900GB uploaded (when I&#39;m pretty sure it was not even 80GB last night), and three torrents, NOT the one I mentioned above with a 2.7 ratio, being gone and this somehow had reached a ratio of 5.</p> <p>What I want to ask is if this is unusual or typical behavior, if I shouldn&#39;t need to worry about it or if I need to check on something with my computer relating to this sudden spur of activity?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

Most apps either need me to upload the video to a cloud service (like Rave with Google Drive) or only allow screen sharing (like Kast), which isn&#39;t ideal.</p> <p>I even tried Syncplay on PC, but it keeps making my videos disappear when I browse for them. Plex is also out since I only have Android devices. Why is there no simple app that just lets two people sync-play a local video together without all these workarounds? Does anyone know a real solution for this?</p> <hr/> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Redddisher\"> /u/Redddisher </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1jqos1m/why_is_there_no_proper_app_for_syncing_local/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comme",
