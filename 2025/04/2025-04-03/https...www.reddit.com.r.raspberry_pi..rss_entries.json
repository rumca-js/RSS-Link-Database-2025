I am on Windows 11 so I found that I needed to download the RNDIS Gadget driver, but after going through about five of them, one 1 ended up working enough to where the PI was recognized as an ethernet adapter in control panel. The problem is that no matter what I do, it reports &quot;Network cable unplugged&quot;, I&#39;ve tried switching out cables, trying different drivers, editing the network config files on the PI to set it up beforehand, and even re-flashing and starting over to make sure I didn&#39;t mess something up but nothing. I&#39;ve found others online that have had this same issue before but from what I can tell nobody gave them an answer. Here&#39;s one of the guides I followed for reference: <a href=\"https://www",
