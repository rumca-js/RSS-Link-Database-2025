My end goal is to have 30-ish words written on pieces of poster board in such a way that when they&#39;re all put together on a wall they form a drawing, or at least hint strongly at it, like the kind of art that when you&#39;re up close you just see the words but when you stand back you see the overall image.</p> <p>I&#39;d like minimal variance in letter skewing (though of course some will be necessary), minimal variance in font size. Since each word will be on its own piece of poster board, each word will need to be contained within its own discrete rectangle, though of course the pieces of poster board will vary in size. I&#39;m okay with some words being sideways. </p> <p>I do have a specific image that I&#39;d like them to form. The final image will just be black and white. If the art can hint at shading, that&#39;s great, but just line art is fine. </p> <p>This seems",

So, at the time of their publishing, these instructions helped top tier LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta set world record scores on Alan Turing Institute benchmarks for Theory of Mind over the scores the models could return solo without these instructions. As of now, these benchmarks still outscore OpenAI\u2019s new GPT-4.5, Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7, and Google\u2019s 2.5 Pro in both emotional intelligence and Theory of Mind. Interference from U.S. intelligence agencies blocked any external discussions with top tier LLM providers regarding the responsible and safe deployment of these instructions to the point it became very clear that U.S. intelligence wanted to steal the IP, utilize it to its full capacity, and arrange a narrative to be able to deny the existence of this IP, so as to use the tech in secrecy, similar to what was done with gravitation propulsion and other erased technologies. Thus, we are giving them to the world.</p> <p>Is",
