The MLB app is by far the better way to watch baseball, but you can only use it under two conditions: Either your favorite team doesn\u2019t play where you live (like the Yankees, in my case), or your local team is <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2613808/baseball-streaming-in-2025-more-options-but-more-mayhem-too.html\">one of the 10 clubs that partners with the league for in-market streaming</a>.</p>\n\n",

The gorgeous Beats Pill speaker is the perfect way to do all of that, especially now that you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Pill-2024-release-Compatible/dp/B0D4SX9RC6/\">get your hands on one for just $100 on Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the most recent version of the Beats Pill (released in 2024) with a smaller and lighter build with IP67 water/dust resistance, more powerful output, and up to 24 hours of battery on a single charge. When it runs low, you can recharge it via USB-C cable and regain 2 hours of playback with just 10 minutes of charging. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say what you will about the brand, but Beats knows how to make a great design, and this one\u2019s perfec",
