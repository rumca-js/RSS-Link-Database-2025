Or does it have to be the first car I move I have to use whatever command I chose?</p> <p>For choppers, after you place the chopper and resolve the shooting, does the chopper get to shoot whenever another vehicle is in the arc directly in front of it?

It really seems like a lot of people are tired of them, but it still seems to be a viable way to get a dream project off the ground. Why is that?

Kyoukai will be an ECG/LCG, but this isn&#39;t really an ad, so I&#39;ll leave it unlinked.</p> <p>On my end, my resources are pretty tight, so I&#39;m running thin and trying to promise everything with tempered expectations, and make sure each dollar is actually paying for something the backer GETS.
