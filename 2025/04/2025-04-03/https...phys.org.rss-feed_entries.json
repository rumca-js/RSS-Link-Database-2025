A study published in The Lancet Planetary Health led by Lund University shows that greenhouse gas emissions from anesthetic gases have decreased by 27% over the last 10 years. By swapping out the anesthetic gas with the highest climate impact, the climate impact of anesthetic gases could have been reduced by a further 69%.",
