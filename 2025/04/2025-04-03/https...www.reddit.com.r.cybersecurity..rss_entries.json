From what I\u2019ve heard, they often share the firewall configuration file, which is then checked with tools like Nipper to spot any vulnerabilities.</p> <p>But I\u2019m wondering\u2014why isn\u2019t there a standard way for clients to give read-only CLI access for a direct look at the firewall? I guess each vendor, like Cisco, Palo Alto, or Fortinet, has different CLI commands, which can make manual checks a bit hit or miss. Is that why using Nipper or similar tools is more common\u2014for ease and consistency?</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts:<br/> - What do clients typically provide for firewall audits?<br/> - Is read-only CLI access ever included, or is it just the config files?<br/> - Do you have any other tools or methods besides Nipper? </p> <p>Thanks for sharing your experiences!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sr",

I already successfully did a small project of monitoring endpoints and generating alerts. Now I want to explore how to do the same for an AWS cloud infrastructure. Basically I want to monitor for misconfigs like public access enabled S3 buckets, Security groups allowing SSH on 0.0.0.0/0 and stuff like that. My question is how do I implement this? How do I monitor these and send it to Splunk? I was thinking of using a Lambda function to periodically perform scan and sent results to Splunk but I feel that it would not be scalable as in I will have to keep on creating lambdas for different vulnerabilities because they are endless. Any suggestions?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi All, I\u2019m a 35 year old guy who\u2019s been in the workforce for about 12 years, with the last 6 being in the Salesforce ecosystem (doing analytics and no-code building solutions). My company has a new partnership with a local university where we\u2019re able to get a certificate free of charge. I saw cybersecurity and jumped on it, as it\u2019s something I wanted to get into for a while. I\u2019m planning to take only 1 course at a time (4 total courses), but I would also like to somehow build a portfolio and show off any experience I learn. I was thinking to also take the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate at the same time, but curious if there\u2019s a different route that makes more sense to build experience and knowledge? I have no strong desire as of right now to tackle one specialty or another in the cybersecurity space.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheKielCenter\"> /u/TheKielCenter </a> <br/> <span",
