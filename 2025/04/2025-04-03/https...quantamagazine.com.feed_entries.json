        "description": "Despite the hype, it\u2019s been surprisingly challenging to find quantum algorithms that outperform classical ones. In this episode, Ewin Tang discusses her pioneering work in \u201cdequantizing\u201d quantum algorithms \u2014 and what it means for the future of quantum computing.            <p>The post <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-the-true-promise-of-quantum-computing-20250403/\" target=\"_blank\">What Is the True Promise of Quantum Computing?</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org\" target=\"_blank\">Quanta Magazine</a></p>",
