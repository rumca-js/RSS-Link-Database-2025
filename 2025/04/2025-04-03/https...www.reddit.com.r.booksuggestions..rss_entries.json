She also has a fondness for true crime, mostly in movies and TV but i\u2019m sure she would also eat up a good mystery novel. She doesn\u2019t like fiction much otherwise.</p> <p>The caveat is she is not a native english speaker.

She enjoys both books and audiobooks and prefers historical fiction. Recent faves have been the Dragonfly Pool, Jacqueline Wilson\u2019s books, My Friend the Octopus, and the Anne of Green Gables series (including some of the adult books). Prior to that she had an Enid Blyton obsession, especially around her boarding school stories. Oh and she is also getting into mysteries and has started ploughing through Nancy Drew on audio. </p> <p>I am hoping to find her some good stories that model positive worldviews and inclusivity, teach her about the world and include heroes from a wide range of different ethnicities, genders etc. I feel like everything she\u2019s been reading lately has been about white kids, set in western history, so really want to diversify on that.

Recently found myself enjoying The Pillars of the Earth and I just started carrion comfort and it is definitely right up my alley. But the SA scenes in both of these books are really souring my opinion even though they both objectively tick all of my other boxes. Does anyone have any recommendations for books like this written by women? Or men who don\u2019t insert weird creepy descriptions of a women\u2019s physique or SA.

I don\u2019t know where to start in terms of finding something I will like, I\u2019m not big on fantasy, and as a teen my favourite books were dystopian vibes (that can include a little fantasy maybe) like the hunger games or divergent. I actually just read the new hunger games prequel as motivation to get back into reading knowing I would like it since I liked the original series\u2026 LOVED it and want more of this vibe. I like dark themes, if I do like fantasy it\u2019s not usually fairies or dragons, more pirates and sirens as even when I did read fantasy as a teen that was more of my interest. Can be smutty but I don\u2019t mind either way, just need some suggestions! Also I am an audiobook listener as well as physical book reader so points for it being available on audible! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nahm",

I would be that guy if you knew me. I decided to become a freelance content writer in my late 20s on a whim after a horrible professional burnout and had to quit my job because the company tanked. I got a client through a referral and started my journey, but when you write for B2B companies, all you do is rewrite what&#39;s already available. That&#39;s what I did and things got stale pretty fast. Writing became repetitive and the novelty wore out. And with no formal training, I didn&#39;t know how to improve my writing.</p> <p>Even today, I feel so paralyzed that if I have to write something from scratch, I just can&#39;t do it. I have to read something to &quot;get inspired.&quot; And I hate it. Also, I&#39;m a quiet person and don&#39;t talk much",
