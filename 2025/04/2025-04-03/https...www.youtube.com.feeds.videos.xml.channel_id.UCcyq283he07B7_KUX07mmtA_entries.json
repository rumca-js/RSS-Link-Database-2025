        "description": "People love eggs. They\u2019re a grocery staple. But in the first few months of 2025, the average price of eggs in the United States reached $6 per dozen, double what they cost at the same point last year. The main reason behind the increase is the spread of the avian flu, which has led to the killing of about 170 million birds in the United States. Fewer hens mean fewer eggs on the market, driving prices up. And now there\u2019s a new fear: For the first time ever, bird flu\u2019s been found in cows.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n#eggs #economy #businessinsider \n\nBusiness Insider tells you all you need to know about business, finance, tech, retail, and more.\n\nVisit our homepage for the top stories of the day: https://www.businessinsider.com\nBusiness Insider on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/businessinsider \nBusiness Insider on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/businessinsider \nBusiness Insider on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/businessinsider \nBusiness Insider on",
