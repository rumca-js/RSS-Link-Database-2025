Why?</strong></p> <p>My personal preference is to prefer H.265 files closer to 5 GiB and bitrates closer to 5000 Kbps -- which I think is a good balance between size and quality. I am usually able to find media I want close to that target, but not always, since it seems most H.265 encoders prefer to skew towards smaller files and lower bitrates. It&#39;s like you sometimes have to choose between a big H.264 and a small H.265 -- nothing in between.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

Maybe corrupt countries of the middle east or latin America? Dunno.</p> <p>Anyhow, generally what would happen if someone, for example, made a Switch emulator that ran perfectly and was distributed from Russian-hosted websites? Same for a hardware exploit that would be shipped from Russia or Russian satellite companies in Europe?</p> <p>We&#39;re assuming here that the devs would promise some cash to some Russian oligarch or some government officials from X or Y country in exchange for being essentially untouchable by Nintendo&#39;s lawyers.

My next thought was to just specify on a case by case basis through the CLI but I don&#39;t seem to be using the correct format there either to specify output. For the config file I have the following setup:</p> <p>&quot;OUTPUT&quot;: &quot;{playlist}/{playlist_num} - {artist} - {song_name}&quot;,</p> <p>But no idea how to add any of the other options so that they can be used when I download an album for instance. As it stands if I download anything not from a playlist it gets chucked in a folder named {playlist}. I would like Zotify to change the output when playlist is not applicable.</p> <p>If anyone has some fixes for this or can share their output format usage",

With the advent of consoles basically being computers now is it easier to actually emulate newer systems like the Switch or PS4? Is it becoming easier or because of proprietary hardware it&#39;s still hard? I feel like if I have a 5090 card I should be able to emulate anything but I know that&#39;s not the case. </p> <p>I was obviously thinking about all this since the $80 price tag on new Switch 2 games and rumors of GTA 6 prices. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mythicdragon75\"> /u/Mythicdragon75 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1jqbf48/some_questions_on_emulation_going_forward/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1jqbf48/some_questions_on_emulation_going_forward/\">[comments]</a></sp",

Does anyone know how I can go about downloading this textbook without going through and taking screenshots of the entire textbook? (yes I&#39;ve done that before \ud83d\ude05) any help would be appreciated. ",

My modded PS Vita decided that after a few years today was a great day to wipe my memory card (not sure how it happened) while I was playing a game. In the middle of the game I was playing, the console shut down, restarted, and my memory card was completely blank. All my home brew was gone, my emulators; everything. When I originally modded it, I used the super-involved method TheFlow developed that required a specific game demo to perform.</p> <p>My question is, what is the best way to get my Vita back to a &quot;stock&quot; config so I can re-mod it using the new browser method? I&#39;m not finding much, and I&#39;ll admit maybe I&#39;m googling the wrong thing, but I&#39;d like to redo it and I know there&#39;s ways to get it back to stock (or close) to make modding it easier. </p> <p>Appreciate it! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/montanasucks\"> /u/montanasucks </a> <br/> <sp",
