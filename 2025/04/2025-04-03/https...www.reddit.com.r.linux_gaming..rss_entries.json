I have to first point out, that I did not run into same issue when using not downgraded version and proton 9.0 on steam. After launching ver. 1.0, window related with vulkan shaders doesn&#39;t start, but game does. After first two intro slides (Audio Company and Nvidia I think) games go completely black and unresponsive. In non-downgraded version some sort of video intro would start playing, yet here I can&#39;t even properly tab out of game (I can use keyboard but not mouse). I don&#39;t really know what to do, as I really want to use downgraded version on steam, as it worked out in other games I run on Linux. All future answers are welcome.

When I repeated the same test with FSR I got through every single option with no hitching or stuttering until I turned on bloom. The stuttering happened. I decide to play 4 hours with the bloom off but everything else on ultra and it was Rock steady. Turn the settings to low turn the bloom to high and the stuttering happened again.
