Trying to decouple our house from so many US based services and hopefully setup more control running ourselves. </p> <p>I\u2019m testing out ebook servers. Well actually we want to setup ebook and comic servers but we think we might have to run separate ones. </p> <p>So far Komga seems to be the best for comics but ebook management is basic. </p> <p>So we have Kavita and Calibre-web automated setup. Kavita seems ok but needs a particular setup for the folder structure. </p> <p>Calibre web seems the best I think? Which do you prefer?</p> <p>But for all these, you need smtp to setup the send to e-reader setup that my wife wants. What\u2019s the easiest way to do this?

I have a server, and it was running everything right, my domain working perfectly (let&#39;s call it domain.com). The subdomains worked perfectly. But recently I changed state and consequently had to change IP. Since then I have been having problems. Firstly my ISP didn&#39;t want to sell me a public IP, so I ended up acquiring an IP per l2tp to be my public IP, so far that&#39;s fine. It turns out that my ISP offered me a public IP... Then my problems start. I got the IP and switched on Cloudflare. But when I put the new IP (let&#39;s call it 123.456.789.001), I get error 522, and I can&#39;t access anything externally. When I return to the IP l2tp I bought (let&#39;s call it 987.654.321.001) everything works right. Now comes the funny thing. I created a subdomain (example ip123.mydomain.com) and pointed to IP 123.456.789.001, Everything works well. What could be wrong? some idea?</p> </div><!-- ",
