That is the conclusion of a research study conducted by educational sociologist Margriet van Hek. The fact that boys' friends misbehave more often probably has to do with gender norms. \"If boys play truant, are late or argue with teachers, it is more likely to be construed as 'cool' than when girls do it.\"",
