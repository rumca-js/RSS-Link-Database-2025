A spunky, young girl whom Rosso takes under his wing and she tries to understand who he is. Miyazaki always had a great knack for female protagonists.</p> <p>And this movie has my favorite Joe Hisaishi original score for a Miyazaki movie. For years, I&#39;ve been trying to find the piece which scores the flashback scene of young Rosso flying with young Gina. I&#39;ve never found it. If you know the title, please tell me. I&#39;d be grateful.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CinephileCrystal\"> /u/",

He binge eats because he&#39;s essentially given up on himself due to a combination of guilt and self loathing. He abandoned his family and failed his lover. Every day he&#39;s alive reminds him of what a piece of shit he feels he is. When you&#39;re that deep in the hole, it&#39;s not so easy to just pick yourself up and try to get better. You don&#39;t feel like you deserve it. In his mind, he deserves to die, and the only thing about him that&#39;s worth giving to his daughter is his money.</p> <p>So he saves money for his daughter as a way for him to justify his continued existence, and he doesn&#39;t really believe he deserves to be part of her life, so he keeps his distance.</p> <p",
