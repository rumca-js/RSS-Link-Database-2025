He suggested this one because he says there was a lot of buzz in his anime fan groups about Netflix undermarketing it. It&#39;s from WIT studio with character designs by the author of Fullmetal Alchemist and work from the action animators from Attack on Titan.</p> <p>Again, I don&#39;t watch a lot of this but even I can tell the artwork here is something special, the space scenes look a lot more computer animated while the character scenes are hand drawn in style, but both are meshed seamlessly. The characters are for the most part interesting and easy to become fond of.</p> <p>I had a little trouble keeping track of the story because it bounces in time a bit, but I still found it very engaging.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vissara\"> /u/vissara </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/F",

I watched the Don Bluth adaptation as a kid and it&#39;s been my favorite animated film since. But I&#39;ve just recently finished the actual book. I have pet mice, so I guess I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for rodents. But I also loved the protagonist, Mrs. Frisby. She&#39;s just a small mouse, a widow, a mother, and she often incredibly terrified and feels helpless, but she pushes forward anyways, all for her children. As a 20 year old guy I didn&#39;t expect to enjoy this novel so much, but it&#39;s one of the few books in recent years that kept me hooked.</p> <p>I do know about the &quot;Redwall&quot; series and plan to check them out.

Just like with The Tainted Cup, there was never a dull moment here as the plot move with a blistering pace. There was always something going on to keep the reader hooked onto the happenings of the story. The only place the plot falters for me is at the end because this blistering is maintained, perhaps even accelerated, so the build up to the mystery feels haphazardly resolved, and feels particularly muted.</p> <p>However, the characters, just like in the The Tainted Cup feel accessory to the story. Din and Ana are the only characters that matter, and they feel like caricatures of themselves at many points throughout.
