I like to build a history just like a book, start to end.</p> <p>Well, on my stories I use the same persona with small variations on personality. But always same name, which is one nickname for my real name. I&#39;ve used about 2 platforms mostly for this.</p> <p>Today I found a new platform and wanted to give it a test. Clicked on one bot. This platform don&#39;t have deep description for characters, so I just answered a bit generic, introducing the story but not saying my name.<br/> On the bot second message, it called me by my nickname. Please mind you, I didn&#39;t subscribe or nothing. I just saw recommendation on reddit, searched on google, clicked on the bot with the most number of messages.</p> <p>I realized I&#39;m cooked!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/QueLaVemEla\"> /u/QueLaVemEla </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Artific",

I simply to not have time, knowledge, are awareness to know everything I need to know which makes me turn to the easiest solution...AI. I love AIs depth in aiding someone to learn, its ability to be used in addition to material provided in school is helpful, but when I use it as a end all be all there is just a part of me that I find difficult to accept. Am I actually worth this degree? Am I using AI to protect my self-image of obtaining an education? Why have I become comfortable, why have I gotten used to using AI to complete assignments? These questions linger in the back of my mind. Truths that I don&#39;t want to hear the answer to. Maybe its not that deep? Maybe it is? I have heard so many people who have agreed with me",
