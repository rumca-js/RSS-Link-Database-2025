        "description": "Quantum gravity could help physicists unite the currently incompatible worlds of quantum mechanics and gravity. In this episode, Monika Schleier-Smith discusses her pioneering experimental approach, using laser-cooled atoms to explore whether gravity could emerge from quantum entanglement.            <p>The post <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/can-quantum-gravity-be-created-in-the-lab-20250417/\" target=\"_blank\">Can Quantum Gravity Be Created in the Lab?</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org\" target=\"_blank\">Quanta Magazine</a></p>",
