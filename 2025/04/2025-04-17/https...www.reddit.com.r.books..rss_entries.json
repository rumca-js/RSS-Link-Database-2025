Maybe I&#39;m biased because I went into this &quot;knowing&quot; that the protagonist would be super annoying but kinda rightfully so, and I tried to read into that with a bit more care than I normally would (but truly, I suck at interpretation). </p> <p>But now that I&#39;m done, I have a pressing question: why is it that seemingly half of the people who read the book think that Holden is a whiny little bitch &quot;just because he sucks at school&quot;, when literally every abuse and horrible thing that happened to him is EXPLICITLY written in the novel? I&#39;d understand if it was all just hidden in the subtext and open to interpretation because again, I&#39;m not too creative either to read too much between the lines.

I will admit that some of the stories like &quot;A Mother&quot; and &quot;Ivy Day in the Committee Room&quot; were a drag to get through, but I was rewarded by stories like &quot;A Painful Case,&quot; &quot;Counterparts,&quot; and, of course, the famous &quot;The Dead.&quot; IMO some of the best literary realism stories I&#39;ve read. Would like to hear what your favorite and least favorite stories were in this book.</p> <p>My first Joyce book was A Portrait of the Artist, which, although I found Stephen to be unlikeable, I could still relate to his life progression a great deal, and the moment of epiphany when he realizes he wants to be an artist.
