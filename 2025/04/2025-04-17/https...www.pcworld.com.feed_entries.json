They offer many of the same channels you had with cable or satellite TV, but deliver them over the internet to your smart TV or streaming device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These services also include cloud-based DVRs, so you can record your favorite shows (not to mention skip through the commercials when you play them back). In many cases, they provide the only means of watching specific pay TV channels without cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that said, live TV streaming services have been getting more and more expensive, and in some ways they won\u2019t be <em>exactly </em>like what you had with cable or satellite.
