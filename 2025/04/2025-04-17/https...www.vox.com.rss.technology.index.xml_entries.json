My old toaster had died, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/your-toaster-will-eventually-fail/\">as old toasters do</a>, and I wanted to buy one cheap enough that I wouldn\u2019t be mad when I had to replace it. If President Donald Trump\u2019s current 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports remains in effect, the same toaster could cost me about $45 when that time comes.</p>",
