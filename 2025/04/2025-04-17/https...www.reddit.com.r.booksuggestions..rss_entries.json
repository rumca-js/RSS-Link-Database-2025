A few months ago, I went through a pretty rough fallout with someone I thought would be in my life forever. It was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve had to deal with, and I felt so lost for a while.</p> <p>I ended up reading <em>The Midnight Library</em> by Matt Haig, and it honestly made a huge difference. It\u2019s about a woman who gets the chance to explore different versions of her life and reflect on what could\u2019ve been. It helped me understand that even when relationships end, there are so many different paths we can take, and sometimes those paths lead to growth, even if it\u2019s painful at first. Has anyone else read it? Or do you have other recommendations for books that help you deal with friendship loss? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Edgeless_SPhere",
