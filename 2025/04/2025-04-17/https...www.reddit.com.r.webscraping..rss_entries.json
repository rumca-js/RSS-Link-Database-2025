If this isn&#39;t the right sub for my project, hopefully someone can point me in the right direction. TIA.</p> <p>I am essentially looking to pull data from a web site, compile it, and get it into excel or google sheets. It&#39;s a mostly manual process for me today and I&#39;d like to believe it can be automated. The web pages I&#39;m grabbing data from are not always the exact same so I haven&#39;t really figured out a way to make some of the chrome plugins (like Instant Data Scraper) work for it.</p> <p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly complicated or will be a heavy lift, but I&#39;m also not sure what&#39;s entailed technically. Looking for someone who&#39;s familiar with web scraping or similar that I can speak with and perhaps pay to get this going.</",
