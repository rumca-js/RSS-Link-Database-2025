Okay.</p> <p>I bought from DKoldies because they have a pretty friendly customer support and always have stock. Yes I&#39;m aware their prices are ass, but what I bought tends to be the market price on average for Sega Saturn, SNES and n64 expansion pak. </p> <p>The quality? Better than things I&#39;ve gotten from Ebay. Now from what I&#39;m told, it&#39;s a mixed bag with DKoldies. You can either get decent quality or shit, but their return policy exist for that reason. In fact, I&#39;m surprised they&#39;re so lenient on it. Can I get better pricing? Sure, but those people don&#39;t tend to keep their stuff in great condition. I&#39;ve returned a Sega Dreamcast twice from ordering online. One from Ebay and the other from Etsy. Both came in non-working condition. Maybe I got unlucky, but to me it&#39;s not worth trying again. ",

That was my first console and I have a lot of nostalgia for it\u2014Super Mario Bros 1 and 3, Duck Hunt, TMNT2\u2014and other classics.</p> <p>But for some reason, I completely skipped the SNES. It just wasn&#39;t in my house or on my radar at all. Then the N64 came out, and when I saw Super Mario 64 for the first time at my local Blockbuster, it totally blew my mind. It felt like this huge leap forward, and I begged to get one.</p> <p>I&#39;m curious if anyone else had a similar experience\u2014jumping straight from NES to N64 or PS1 without touching the SNES. Why do you think that happened? Was it timing? Budget? Just a weird gap in awareness? I&#39;d love to hear other people\u2019s gaming timelines to see if this was somewhat common. </p> <p>Edit: for those who grew up playing NES and ended up skipping the SNES, it would be interesting to know what year you were born. </p> </d",
