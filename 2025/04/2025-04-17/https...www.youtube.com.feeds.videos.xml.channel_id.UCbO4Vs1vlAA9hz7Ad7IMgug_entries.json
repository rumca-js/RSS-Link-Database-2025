Jay and I break out the new Starter Set for HEROQUEST, with a double sided game board and 10 new Missions to play as a prequel to the original big boxed game. \n\nComing in at just $70 CAD, this is a complete Heroquest game with the same board and components, some in cardstock and some still in plastic.
