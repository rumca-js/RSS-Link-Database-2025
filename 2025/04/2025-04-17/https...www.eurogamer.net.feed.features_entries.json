I caught a glimpse of the dragon soaring through the sky when I first arrived on Ashenfall. I knew it was a threat at the time, like all dragons usually are, but thought it was one I wouldn't have to worry about for a while. The dragon's second visit proved me wrong. Thinking it would be nice to see it again, I looked up. Rather than seeing a scaly beast, though, I found myself drenched in poison. This is how I tasted death for the first time in <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape\">RuneScape</a>: Dragonwilds - the new survival crafting game from Jagex, which recently saw a surprise Early Access release.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/runescape-dragonwilds-proves-im-aw",
