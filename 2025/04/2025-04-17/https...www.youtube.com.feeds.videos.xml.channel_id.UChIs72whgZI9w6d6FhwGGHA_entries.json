        "description": "Sponsor: ID-Cooling Frozn A720 Black on Amazon https://geni.us/VDnou4Y\nThis video is about the WinRing 0 driver (not to be confused with Security Ring 0, but related in this story) and how it has propped-up the fan control and RGB industry for over a decade now. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, security updates have broken this code, resulting in a mad dash to re-develop RGB and fan control software by the hardware vendors. Several already began the transition, while others only recently had to reckon with the decision to use a driver now quarantined by Windows for security reasons. This is the history of WinRing 0 and a story about how important it has been to the PC industry.\n\nGrab the new PAPER LAUNCH cotton T-shirt: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/paper-launch-cotton\nAnd the Tri-Blend version of it: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/paper-launch-triblend\nYou can also grab an anti-static Modmat here: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversa",
