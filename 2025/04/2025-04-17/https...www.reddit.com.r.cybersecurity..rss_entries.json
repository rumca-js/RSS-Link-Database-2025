Our latest blog post covers how modern browser security features do (or don&#39;t) protect users from this often-overlooked vulnerability class. We discuss Total Cookie Protection in Firefox, Private Network Access in Chrome, and review the SameSite attribute&#39;s role in CSWH attacks. The post includes a few brief case studies based on situations encountered during real world testing, in addition to a simple test site that can be hosted by readers to explore each of the vulnerability conditions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://blog.includesecurity.com/2025/04/cross-site-websocket-hijacking-exploitation-in-2025/\">https://blog.includesecurity.com/2025/04/cross-site-websocket-hijacking-exploitation-in-2025/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IncludeSec\"> /u/IncludeSec </a> <br/> <span><a href=",

I am genuinely curious as to what actual cybersecurity professionals think about this.</p> <p>There&#39;s been a rise in Chinese-brand electronics over the past few years, namely handheld game consoles and computers (many of which are pretty damn cool). From what I&#39;ve seen, these companies operate primarily out of Shenzhen, China. Obviously there are pretty widespread concerns about foreign data collection, TikTok probably being the most recent involving China. Chinese companies are largely subject to strict government control to fit its agenda, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s out of the realm of possibility that they could be forced to include some parts or software that the government wants to be put in. </p> <p>Is it a realistic possibility to consider that these <em>could</em> be secretly used as a network of devices transmitting back to China to harvest untold amounts of data?
