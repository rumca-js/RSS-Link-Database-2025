I thought for a while I have a very common setup but with all the issues I have to forward port trough a VPN I started to doubt myself I use a private server built at home and run transmission on docker. I have set up a vpn with differents provider on and off docker but struggling a lot to have my peer listening port actually open. Is it an old way that no body use anymore? Is it because I shouldn&#39;t use docker ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YKw1n\"> /u/YKw1n </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1k15ai9/whats_your_solution_to_seed_with_vpn/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1k15ai9/whats_your_solution_to_seed_with_vpn/\">[comments]</a></span>",
