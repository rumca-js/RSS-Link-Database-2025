So:</p> <ol> <li>Is there any way to recover these original quality music videos? A: Most probably not. <strong>If you know any other answer, please reply.</strong></li> <li>Anyone tried or achieved a full archive of these original quality music videos before the replacement? A: Less probably not, <strong>so if someone was able to archive some and is willing to share some</strong> (I also archived some back in 2016!), you can DM me if you&#39;r",

It goes from 4096 bytes to 2048 kilobytes (2MB).

I heard a statistic that 20% of men die before making it to retirement and also having had two family members die without any kind of will or plan got me thinking I need to make plans of my own. </p> <p>Kind of embarrassing, but the one thing that I\u2019m hung up on is what to do with my computer and collection of adult vids. Probably have a few TBs at this point. I don\u2019t even watch most of them a second time, I just have an obsession with saving them. Maybe the data hoarder sub can relate. </p> <p>I think the way to go is to leave an encrypted/passworded drive with instructions to destroy and leave the password to the rest of my system so family members can access important docs, photos, etc. Anyone make similar plans? I\u2019m wondering if this is the way to go or not. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway-567189\"> /u/throwaway-567189 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://",
