        "description": "Even before the cameras started rolling, it was clear that The Fantastic Four: First Steps will be a very different take on Marvel's First Family. First came word that Julia Garner has been cast as the Silver Surfer. Then Marvel confirmed that the movie is set in an alternate universe that exists as a retro-futuristic, 1960s version of the MCU. And thanks to the newest First Steps trailer, we\u2019ve gotten confirmation of another big twist. Vanessa Kirby\u2019s Invisible Woman is pregnant.\nIf you\u2019re not a hardcore FF reader, some of these reveals may raise more questions than they answer. Why is Silver Surfer a woman in the MCU? Why is it such a big deal that Susan Storm is having a baby? Here\u2019s what you need to know about both twists and why First Steps is shaping up to be far different from any Fantastic Four movie we\u2019ve gotten before.\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps stars  Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Ralph Ineson, Julia Garner, Paul Walter Hauser, John",

All the new game modes were explained, along with a breakdown on new items. In related Nintendo news, there's some confusion over a disclaimer Nintendo has for the Switch 2 version of Tears of the Kingdom. Currently, it sounds like the game won't support the cloud saves you may have via Nintendo Switch Online. A similar disclaimer was placed on the Switch 2 versions of Breath of the Wild and Mario Party Jamboree, but have since been removed. You will still be able to get your old saves over via manually transferring your data, but it would be a lot more convenient to do it over the cloud. And finally, a new form of currency has been added to Marvel Rivals. Unstable Molecules will be used to change the color of your costume, at about a rate of 100 unstable molecules to every U.S. dollar.",
