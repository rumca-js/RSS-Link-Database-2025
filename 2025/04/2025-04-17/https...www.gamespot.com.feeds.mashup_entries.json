However, the Steam release has been delayed.</p><p>Co-op was one of Lords of the Fallen's standout features, but now the update lets both players save all main story progress. There are some caveats, though. Both players need to be on the same \"New Game\" and must have defeated a similar number of bosses. They will retain all loot and 100% vigor.</p><p>There's also a new Friend Pass that lets players invite another person even if they don't own the game. The invited friend gets to keep all loot and character classes.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-update-gets-a-surprise-friend-pass-feature/1100-6530947/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",
