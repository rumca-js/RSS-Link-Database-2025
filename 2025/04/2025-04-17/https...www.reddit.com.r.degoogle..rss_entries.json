My issue is that I have an awesome HP Chromebook that I paid a lot for and pretty much run my whole life through it. It&#39;s a great piece of hardware (HP Dragonfly Pro) for navigating the Google ecosystem and linux Penguin terminal is enough for my needs (desktop version of Obsidian, ffmpeg, bash and python scripts). I could run Firefox in the linux subsystem but it doesn&#39;t run like a native app and performance degrades under heavy use. Chrome is really the only option in ChromeOS.</p> <p>Given the political climate and enshitification of the internet from all these big tech companies, instead of changing browser or device, I&#39;ll move to take control of my digital footprint and make the leap to daily driving linux and self-hosting where I can. </p> <p>I&#39;m most worried about the frequent technical hiccups I&#39;ve run into in the past reoccurring and ruining my work",
