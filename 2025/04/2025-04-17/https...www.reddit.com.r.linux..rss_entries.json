I have always been a Windows user and have zero idea how to work with the terminal. Is there a linux distro that is very similar to Windows in usage.</p> <p>Don&#39;t care about the UI, I mean actual usage. Like being able to easily install programs without going all sudowoodo. Last time I tried POP-OS and honestly I wouldn&#39;t be able to do anything in it if ChatGPT wasn&#39;t there to tell me exactly what to do to solve very basic issues.</p> <p>So, any Windows-like Linux distro that would let me do things mostly using GUI?

The state of TTS in Linux is described as &quot;next to worthless&quot; due to the lack of quality tools and the difficulty in integrating better voices.
