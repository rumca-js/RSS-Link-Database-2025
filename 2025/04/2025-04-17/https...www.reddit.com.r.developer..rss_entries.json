I could really use some guidance from someone who\u2019s actually implemented and maintained a setup like this in production. If you\u2019ve worked on something similar, <strong>please hmu</strong> ......</p> <p>I\u2019d love to pick your brain about designing the workflow, structuring the architecture, and best practices (especially around reliability, message routing, retries, etc.).</p> <p>Thanks in advance \ud83d\ude04</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Adventurousonemel\"> /u/Adventurousonemel </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1k18meh/anyone_here_experienced_with_maintaining/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/co",
