Object permanence: 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Trump fought the law and Trump won (permalink) The saving grace of the first Trump administration was its administrative incompetence: for every terrible thing Trump I and his henchmen pulled off, ten more awful plots were thwarted because they were so bad at being evil. Remember the Muslim Ban? It died because Trump repeatedly, publicly said he was banning people from his disfavored \"shithole\" countries because of their religion. The courts took one look at that and said, \"Nope, you can't discriminate against people on the basis of their religion, it's right here in the First Amendment.\" ",
