Even if tariffs did cause the iPhone\u2019s price to\nsurge, we would have plenty of cheaper options, like buying last\nyear\u2019s phone model instead of the latest and greatest.</p>\n\n<p>The most important lesson we can learn from the turmoil: The only\nconsistent way to save money on tech is to use devices for as long\nas possible, which requires maintaining them as you would a car,\nand upgrading only when you must.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This whole angle is no surprise coming from the tech columnist whose advice to readers who think their aging phone cameras don\u2019t perform well in low light is \u201c<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/09/you_could_always_just_use_flash\">Just use flash</a>.\u201d If phone prices go up because of Trump\u2019s tariffs, <em>all</em> phone prices are going to go up, including those for older models, whether you\u2019re buying new ",
