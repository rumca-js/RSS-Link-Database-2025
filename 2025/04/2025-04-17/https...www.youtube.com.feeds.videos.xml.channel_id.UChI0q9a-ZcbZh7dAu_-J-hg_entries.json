        "description": "4Chan (the notorious online message board) has been hacked, and currently taken offline. After a rival community gained deep access to the website files, and published the source code online... the site is now struggling to get back on its feet with a long road ahead of it when it foes. \n\nAntiquated files, archaic security and a lack of updates left the message board vulnerable... with a breach that in a strange way exemplifies what the website itself has often stood for. Even as it falls... the website still manages to spawn troll posts, misinformation, and even waste the time of Mainstream Media outlets. \n\n4Chan is an internet institution (love it or hate it) if ever there was one. \n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https://linktr.ee/upperechelonsecurity\n\n\n\nODYS",
