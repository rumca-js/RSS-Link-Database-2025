I connected the camera correctly and I&#39;m using libcamera (especially libcamera-hello) to preview the video.</p> <p>The issue is that the preview is extremely slow and laggy, to the point that it&#39;s almost unusable. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried:</p> <p>Updated the Raspberry Pi and firmware.</p> <p>Tested different commands like libcamera-hello, libcamera-vid, etc.</p> <p>Lowered the resolution \u2014 it helped a little, but the feed is still not smooth.</p> <p>Used VNC to access the Pi \u2014 but even with everything else working fine in VNC, the camera preview is the only thing that lags badly.</p> <p>Recorded a video using libcamera-vid, and when I played the video, it looked better than the preview \u2014 but it sometimes has static lines or glitches.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen others with the same setup (Pi 4 + Camera Module 3) and they don\u2019t seem to have this problem.",
