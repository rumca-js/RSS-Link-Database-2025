Gabriel Jesus has been absent since the turn of the year and Kai Havertz suffered a torn hamstring in February, leaving them short in the final third. Mikel Merino filled the void admirably. Indeed, only Havertz (nine) has more league goals for the club this season than Merino (six), who scored in important wins over Leicester, Chelsea and Fulham. Fans will want the club to invest in the summer but Merino has done remarkably well, given he had not played up front since he was nine years old.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2025/apr/17/unexpected-stars-season-premier-league\">Continue reading...</a>",

And so I decided to interview more than 70 women and non-binary people with physical and mental health conditions \u2013 from famous actors to legal experts, musicians to psychologists. The result was a vast and varied catalogue of disabled life: from stories about workplace microaggressions and good and bad dates on the apps, to finding freedom (and judgment) using mobility aids.</p><p>What I didn\u2019t anticipate was that as the months went on, and my word count went up, the disabled cohort I was writing about would grow to include more and ",

Kennedy has said that the best way to prevent measles is to get vaccinated \u2013 but he has also caused alarm among paediatricians, vaccine experts and lawmakers by promoting vitamin A and nutrition as treatments for measles and questioning the safety testing of the MMR vaccine. He also recently announced a US-led scientific effort to establish the cause of what he terms the \u2018autism epidemic\u2019, with some experts concerned that this study will support the widely discredited association between autism and vaccines. US health reporter Jessica Glenza tells Ian Sample, the Guardian\u2019s science editor, how these mixed messages are already impacting scientific research.</p><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-texas\">RFK Jr says his response to measles outbreak should be \u2018model for the world\u2019</a></strong></p><p><strong><a hr",
