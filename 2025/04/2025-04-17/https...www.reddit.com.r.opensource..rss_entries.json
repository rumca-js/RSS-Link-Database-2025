All of these themselves have Licenses, and what i dont understand is when to and if i have to credit them if i use those in my application. Do i have to explicitly include each and every License of these in my own project?

But with the, let&#39;s say, unstable political situation in the world, and in the US specifically, I no longer trust that an American company will keep my passwords, secure notes, and other information safe from prying eyes, and it feels like there is only one on executive order from total infiltration of my privacy, even if I am European. Yes, I know Google already knows everything about me, but let me at least have an illusion of privacy :P So the question is, I am looking for a recommendation for a self-hosted open-source password manager with at least these features:</p> <ol> <li>Plugins for all major browsers</li> <li>Apps for Linux, Windows, Android, and Mac (I use all 4 both privately and at work)</li> <li>Can be hosted on a Raspberry Pi 5 (or similar)</li> <li>is open source, and has a good and big community, both for acces",
