Chief video correspondent Graham Flanagan spent five days at the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot in San Diego, California, where he observed different companies at various stages of training.\n\nEnlisted recruits who live west of the Mississippi River attend basic training in San Diego, where women have only trained since 2021.
