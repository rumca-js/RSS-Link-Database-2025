I know it sounds childish but I have a sibling who&#39;s 7 years younger than me and she&#39;s really upset about her account got hacked by some random Germany (unless if they were using vpn) and on her game called Adopt Me it was shown proof that a person actually hacked to her account and traded all of her pets on an alt account. I hope someone can help me out by adding me on discord and I would preferably if you know how to do those click links (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s gonna be able to trick the person who hacked her account).
