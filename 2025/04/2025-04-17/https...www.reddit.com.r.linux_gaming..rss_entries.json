With no video content on the side I maxed out on my monitor&#39;s refresh-rate of 120 fps.<br/> Today I got suspicious and compared a few browsers. Turns out that Twitch in Chrome keeps me on stable 120, with no stuttering. Even better, LibreWolf (FlatPak) also has no performance degradation!

I built my PC a few days ago and decided to use Ubuntu as the OS. I downloaded steam and, using Proton Experimental, I was able to play a few single player games. Then I tried playing R.E.P.O with a few friends and every time I would join the game I would get the steam notification &quot;Steam not responding&quot; with the options to wait or to force quit. I tried both and neither worked. (Force quit did not even force quit steam but it did terminate the game).
