But with Cursor and a lot of late nights, I built a tool that tracks open roles across AI companies I care about \u2014 and alerts me as soon as something new drops.</p> <p>I used Supabase, built a scraper from scratch (lol probs the wrong move), integrated Stripe, set up API calls, hosted the backend on a VPS\u2026 the whole thing. It works now, and people are signing up.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t take a weekend. It took like ~3 months of nights and weekends.
