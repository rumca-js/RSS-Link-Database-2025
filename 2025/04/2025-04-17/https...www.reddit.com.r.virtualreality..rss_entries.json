There&#39;s basically two problems here: you need to take a controller and have it be accepted by SteamVR (either by disguising it as an existing VR controller or adding a new controller for it to exist as) and you need to give it tracking, which in most cases would be stapling it to a Vive tracker or some equivalent (SlimeVR trackers or something like Amethyst are effectively virtual Vive trackers as far as SteamVR is concerned as far as I know).

But if we stuck to the types of games available on Quest, with those kinds of graphics and tech, even a 10-year-old PC with a GTX 970 could run them smoothly.</p> <p>Second, isn\u2019t that the same issue for flat games? If you want to play the latest PC games, you obviously need more than a potato, right? The alternative is consoles and there\u2019s already PSVR, and we could imagine a world where Xbox also had its own VR headset. So what? Are the target users for standalone VR actually more like mobile gamers, people who own neither a console nor a PC?</p> <p>Another argument I ",

That means stick locomotion with acceleration tied to the player character&#39;s animations, smooth turning, all the nasty stuff, and yet I was totally unfazed. The only thing that felt off was the camera panning in cutscenes, but even that wasn&#39;t bad at all. I never used smooth turning before, and I&#39;m gonna switch to it in every game that lets me from now on.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been conditioned by crashing virtual rally cars, so I&#39;m probably not quite the average VR user in this aspect.

Meaning I could still kind of point at stuff, but I couldn&#39;t actually move the controller around in the space. Imagine holding your hand above your head, and all you can move is your wrist. Thats basically whats happening, but its not always above my head. It will freeze in random places. Pressing the PS button to pull up the SteamVR menu, then closing that seemed to fix it some of the time. But not all of the time, maybe not even half the time. </p> <p>As far as the setup, Ive got one of the Bluetooth adapters Sony recommends, and Ive got it plugged into a USB 2.0 extension cable, and into a USB 2.0 port, exactly how Sony says to do it.

I was planning on getting an Xbox but I\u2019m not sure I have always wanted to get a head strap with an extended battery and more games because the only paid game I have rn is bonelab. Keep in mind I do have an Xbox in the living room for me and my parents to play, my dad mainly plays but is happy to let me play whenever AND my budget is around 200. So basically what I\u2019m asking is if I don\u2019t get a console and invest in add-ons and games for my vr, am I going to get a good gaming experience?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/XChocoX0\"> /u/XChocoX0 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1k10sek/should_i_invest_in_my_vr/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1k10sek/should_i_invest_in_my_vr/\">[comments]</a></span>",
