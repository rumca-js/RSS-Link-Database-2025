Treyarch predicted it all right down to the year... with a timeless video game that feels increasingly accurate with each passing month of the year. \n\nObviously there are significant portions that don't match, but the mark of good Sci-Fi is plausibility, and Black Ops 2 is far more than just plausible. In a sense, it almost feels likely. \n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https://linktr.ee/upp",
