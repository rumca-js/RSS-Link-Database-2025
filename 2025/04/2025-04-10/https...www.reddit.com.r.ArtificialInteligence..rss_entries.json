Currently, the Llama 4 Scout and Maverick variants are available for developers with open weights. This means anyone can download the models and start using them on their own machines.</p> <p>The real issue is that these models are enormous, with the smallest, Llama 4 Scout, containing 109 billion total parameters. This means that even the quantized versions of the models cannot be run on local machines. For a 4-bit quantized model, you need at least 80 GB of VRAM.</p> <p>In this blog, we will learn about three platforms to access Llama 4 models.

One key reason is that unsupervised learning (next word prediction) leads to copying behavior, and it cannot easily distinguish truth from fiction. Reasoning solves this problem.</p> <p>Outcome based RL makes it so that using true facts and mechanics leads to better outcomes than using false or incoherent ones. The model is essentially reinforced to make a coherent and consistent relation between its concepts in order to use CoT succesfully. Looking at the weights of the model, this means that logical and coherent concepts get enforced, while illogical ones get suppressed. This is what eventually will prune a world model that is consistent and logical, similar to that of humans.</p> <p>The idea that r",
