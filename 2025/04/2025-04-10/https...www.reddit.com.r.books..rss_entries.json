You\u2019re rooting for them even through the difficulties that their fiery relationship bring. In Wuthering Heights, it\u2019s very clear throughout the book that Healthcliff and Catherine and both difficult/terrible people. Heathcliff is very much an anti hero. When he abuses people, you don\u2019t feel betrayed as the reader or upset. It\u2019s in his character to betray. Everyone hates him, including the reader! But in The Favourites, when Heath betrays Katarina again and again, it\u2019s agonizing and heartbreaking because he\u2019s a true hero. He loves he, he\u2019s quiet and grumpy but basically a devoted guy. So at the end, when he betrays her in a way that the author clearly shoe horned in there as an unjustifiable nod to Wuthering Heights, the reader",

So everything\u2019s a bit of a blur, I feel it\u2019s a very warranted re-read lol. I haven\u2019t read the two newer ones at all, though.</p> <p>First question- are the newer books worth reading? I\u2019m skeptical of the book about Snow- I hate a retroactive sympathetic arc- but I\u2019ve heard good enough things to be hesitantly hopeful that the book won\u2019t do that. I\u2019m actively excited to read the other one, but would still appreciate y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts on it.</p> <p>Second question- if you think those other books are worth reading, what order would you suggest reading them in? Like, original trilogy and then the new ones? New ones after the trilogy reread? Or maybe something like Ballad, Hunger Games, Sunrise, Catching Fire, Mockingjay?</p> <p>Super curious to hear ppl\u2019s thoughts on this, thanks \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

It&#39;s a book that exceeds the emotional involvement of even major novels, pushing you into various psychological upheavals that many significant books struggle with. It&#39;s a book about romanticism, adolescence, and certainly a lot about the destructiveness and vulnerability of human emotions.

Not much has changed for me in that regard haha, but I saw a question earlier about someone asking for recommendations on books for their 14 year old. Which got me thinking about some of the books I read at that age. A lot of Anne Rice, Lestat was my first book crush. Also had a trip down memory lane with the author Francesca Lia Block she wrote a book called I was a teenage fairy which still sits with me over 20 years later. I also got to grow up with Weetzie Bat which was super cool as she wrote a book about her as an adult that I got to read when I was about the same age as the Weetzie.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have recently been thinking of how impactful certain books might be on our view of the world. We tend to think of books such as 1984 providing us with a common perspective on totalitarianism and ways to recognise it and describe it. Similarly books where racism is tackled such as to Kill a Mockingbird is generally accepted to have played a part in shifting views amongst its readership.</p> <p>So I wondered what people thought about other books that have proved very popular but appear to have less overt political messaging. Maybe they&#39;ve still changed the collective perspective of their readership.</p> <p>For one I thought of how widely read the Harry Potter series has been. How does a book series like that affect how we see friendship or good and evil or other themes it touches on. Do vast numbers of people think a certain way because of it? Have our children been indoctrinated to think British boarding schools are fun? /s. </p> <p>In what ways",

The last few were Musashi (both the book by Eiji Yoshikawa and vagabond the comic) and Siddhartha which have really been my first foray into some Asian religion, philosophy, and thinking. Something particularly weird happened after I finished Siddhartha. The book spoke to me about many things and I thoroughly enjoyed it. One passage was talking about how it is better to simply view a thing as it is and that words are a deceitful thing. I thought this was weird at first as I&#39;ve always only pictured things in my head as the thing itself, but as this day has past I hear this annoying ass voice in my head. Instead of simply making tea as a normally do in the evenings, I was almost talking to myself about objects. For example &quot;I love my wife&quot;, &quot;Ow the cup is too hot I need to let the tea cool down.&quot; &quot;Ow you idiot",
