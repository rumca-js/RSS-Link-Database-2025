It follows vis, the orphaned son of a noble family that was murdered by the Republic, the government that now rules the lands. He must infiltrate the Republics most prestigious school to find the truth behind a death. Holy guacamole, it&#39;s so good. The characters are very memorable and feel so so real. Edhin is easily one of my favorite characters out of all the fantasy books I&#39;ve read, lol.</p> <p>I just wanted to take a brief moment to recommended this work. Its so good, and I can&#39;t wait for the second book in the series to come out this November!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58416952-the-will-of-the-many\">https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58416952-the-will-of-the-many</a> (The good reads page)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

Obviously I still have some more of the series thatll take me a couple more months to get to but I have already started to panic thinking what should I read after? </p> <p>I&#39;ve been trying to get back into fantasy for awhile now because it was such a love of mine as a kid but I mostly have read literary fitcion and classics as an adult. This feeling of being completely obsessed/ absorbed in a world is what I miss. I have tried to pick up the odd fantasy book but have found a lot of the modern fantasy I pick up feels very YA almost?
