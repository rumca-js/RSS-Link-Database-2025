I really love the vibe of this type of music AND IT RELATES because I like books that I read to mimic or somewhat copy that vibe. For example: I loved My Year of Rest and relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh, in fact I love all her books, her short stories SLAP. My Year of Rest and relaxation really vibed with me as much as the music I like. </p> <p>Another example, &quot;You too can have a body like mine&quot; by Alexandra Kleeman. another fire book imo. Alice in Wonder Lewis Carroll. I love the complex and sumblinal and liminal mental space, I like the blur of real and not real, dream and reality, but it&#39;s not super fuvking deep, you know? It&#39;s still tangible and you can get what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s not pedant material or some lame depression writing, it&#39;s not instabook. I want somet",

We had archaeological, psychological and astronomical insights and suddenly it all clicked. Why the gravitational theory had a gap and what was coming (the eclipse, the fire, everything). 10 pages later, one of the characters confirms my hypothesis.

We were together 13 years, married for 9, with two children. I am very much still in love with sober him, and am codependent. I already have started Codependent No More, which is ringing true for me. I also read Why Does He Do That? and liked it as well. I was wondering if there are any other books that might be helpful in this situation?

I find it hard to find fantasy books that have good male protagonists. Lately everything I see is warrior women, and while I live those books too, reading the house witch made me realize just how few books on my bookshelf have male leads that I admire. So, if anyone has any recommendations, specifically in the Fantasy genre but I&#39;ll take anything at this point, with male protagonists, I&#39;d love to hear about them! Queer books with male leads are also good, romance isn&#39;t a must. I&#39;m hoping maybe I&#39;m just looking in the wrong place and so I&#39;m missing some real gems out there. </p> <p>Thanks for your recommendations! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheAlterSystemAlex\"> /u/TheAlterSystemAlex </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksug",

Preferably not where this is because vampires control the world, but could be enjoyable if the story&#39;s whole point/end condition isn&#39;t &quot;all vampires need to die&quot;. Other non-human creatures are welcome, as are queer perspectives, and romance so long as plot is still substantive.</p> <p>I&#39;ve enjoyed Fred the Vampire Accountant and What We Do in the Shadows, but have struggled to find books which do not lean into this narrative of romanticized mystery.

I just got a Kobo for my birthday (yeay to being 25!) and am now looking for stuff to read on it so I can get back into the habit!</p> <p>I like the fantasy genre a LOT, and I like romantasy but I&#39;m a bit picky about it, I prefer it when books have a focus on the plot and the romance, while essential to drive the plot foward, is not the main focus of the book. For example, I really enjoyed the folk of the air series! Smut is nice, but not necessary.</p> <p>I enjoy flourished and descriptive prose (LOVED the night circus and the invisible life of addie larue) and would like something along the lines of historical fiction or high fantasy, as I&#39;m big on DnD and love to immerse myself in such settings.
