The lead human is grumpy cap-wearing Farmer Hoggett, played by James Cromwell, later to be hard-faced Captain Dudley Smith in LA Confidential and Prince Philip in Stephen Frears\u2019 film The Queen.

This was in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, close to where Todd still lives. Hidden away from the picturesque beaches was the town landfill, including lagoons of toxic waste from septic tanks, which was being left to seep into the groundwater below. So Todd, then a 45-year-old biologist, decided to design a solution.

But I\u2019m disappointed to realise I\u2019m no longer able to do so anyway. We all have the instinct for fight or flight. Fleeing civilisation to try your luck in the wild is the most extreme expression of the second option. Somewhere, deep down, we\u2019re hardwired with the false security of this last resort. Or perhaps it\u2019s just me. Either way, I\u2019ve reached the sad conclusion that, in my case, it\u2019s not possible.</p><p>I started thinking through how I\u2019d do it. Right, I\u2019m off, I decided, hypothetically. Hmm, what to take with me? Well, there\u2019s my eyesight to consider. Just take my specs, or some contact lenses, too? I\u2019ve only three weeks\u2019 worth. How do myopic soldiers manage behind enemy lines? There must be a way.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/10/go-off-grid-where-would-i-get-my-meds-compression-socks-and-corn-remover",
