        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello! My first purchase of a VR headset was a little while ago now, I bought a Vive Cosmos. The screen I find beautiful but the tracking is god awful, it\u2019s been good for sim racing but really not much else and I haven\u2019t used it much at all for that reason. I tried to watch some movies but although comfortable it\u2019s still quite heavy and gets sweaty. That\u2019s to say my first experience with home VR wasn\u2019t ideal.</p> <p>I\u2019m wondering what you all think would be a worthy upgrade over my Vive Cosmos. Honestly not sure how much is worth spending on this. I\u2019m much more interested in PC VR than standalone VR like the quest. Is now a bad time to upgrade or a good time considering prices and possible future releases? My use would be mainly for gaming (Eg. SUPERHOT) which the cosmos isn\u2019t great at, it consistently loses the location of the controllers and controls are really finicky</p> <p>Thanks for reading, looking forward to any ideas on where to go :)</p> </",

Not to mention how sick it makes you feel with camera movement being all janky i hope they fix it soon. Other than that the game is competent enough to play and actually decent nothing is really cut from the flatscreen version </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SaicaFox\"> /u/SaicaFox </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jvlaoj/civilization_7_vr_has_huge_performance_problems/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1jvlaoj/civilization_7_vr_has_huge_performance_problems/\">[comments]</a></span>",
