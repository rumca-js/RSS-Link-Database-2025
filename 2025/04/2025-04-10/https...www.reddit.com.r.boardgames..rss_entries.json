I got senjutsu battle for Japan, and my thought was: These are really nice minis, but it&#39;s a pity they are grey. I need to paint them. Now I&#39;m curious are you leave them unpainted or make them nice and colorful? Do you even consider it? Or it&#39;s just me, beacuse I also play wargames and my army MUST look good.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Daimlah\"> /u/Daimlah </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jw0aar\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1jw0aar/do_you_paint_yo",
