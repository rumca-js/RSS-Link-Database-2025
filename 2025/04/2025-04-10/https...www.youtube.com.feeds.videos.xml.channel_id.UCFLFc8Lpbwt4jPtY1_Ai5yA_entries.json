Using nickel-63 and diamond semiconductors, these tiny power sources are being developed for use in medical, aerospace, and even consumer electronics like smartphones. Linus and Luke marvel at the tech\u2019s potential and its surprisingly tiny size, literally smaller than a keycap.\n\nWatch the full WAN Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4fVtzRYLYw\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners",
