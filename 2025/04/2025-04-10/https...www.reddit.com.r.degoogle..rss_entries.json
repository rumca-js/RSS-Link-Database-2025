I even wanted to delete google map and degoogle that phone, I use it as a spare phone so I really need 3 or 4 apps anyway, but I get a message that it will affect the functionality of the phone. </p> <p>I am an iOS user so I need to say that I am kinda ignorant on androids but it sounds ridiculous as I deleted Maps, Apple map app, from my iPhone long time ago and I don\u2019t have location issue. </p> <p>How should I fix this?
