Need some recommendations on what games are fun to practice on and have a lot of changeable features. 2 games I already plan on practicing on are &quot;the forest&quot; and &quot;hollow knight&quot;. Mods I am interested in are fun things like rapid fire on both guns &amp; melee weapons, godmode, superspeed, inf ammo/money/items ,etc.</p> <p>Was planning on maybe also trying &quot;raft&quot; or another survival/resource intensive game. Thanks in advance for the recs</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gloomy-Floor-8398\"> /u/Gloomy-Floor-8398 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1jvs66e/need_unity_game_recs_for_dnspy_practice/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GameMods/comments/1jvs66e/need_unity_game_recs_for_dnspy_practice/\">[comments]</a></spa",
