The Folktails will zipline through the wasteland, soaring high above the ground, while the Iron Teeth navigate through water-sealed tubeways. Since all beavers are skilled terraformers, in Update 7, they are expanding their capabilities beyond simply building dams. By layering dirt, they can now create hanging gardens, grow plants on rooftops, and even construct tunnels and artificial caves. \n\nTimberborn's Update 7 - Ziplines & Tubeways will be available on May 8, 2025!",

The console features a three-dimensional Pikachu sculpted on top, a power switch shaped like a Pok\u00e9 Ball, and a reset button located on Pikachu's foot. Best of all, when you turn on the console, Pikachu's cheeks light up.\n\nWe also discovered a rare complete-in-box copy of Pok\u00e9mon Stadium.
