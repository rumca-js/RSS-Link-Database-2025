The problem is I <strong>don&#39;t have my VR headset with me</strong> right now, and I just want to play on my regular monitor.</p> <p>I&#39;m not using Steam, so I can&#39;t set launch options through Steam like <code>-nohmd</code>, but I\u2019ve tried creating a shortcut and adding <code>-nohmd</code> manually to the target line \u2014 no luck. I also tried closing SteamVR and Oculus software completely, still no dice.</p> <p>Can I add the game to steam as a non steam game, or will I get in trouble? I don&#39;t want my steam account to get banned</p> <p>Any ideas? Is there a config file or registry setting I can change to disable VR completely?
