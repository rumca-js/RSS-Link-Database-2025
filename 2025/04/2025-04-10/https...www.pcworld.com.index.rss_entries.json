Just a few weeks ago, I lost my resolve and finally picked up an OLED gaming monitor\u2014so I missed out on this deal, which would have gotten me a much bigger one at a similar price. If you mosey over to eBay, you can find <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/315432430626\">a massive Samsung ultrawide OLED for $879.99</a>, almost a thousand bucks off its original price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure, $880 ain\u2019t chicken feed, especially when you can find 49-inch super-wide screens for about half that if you don\u2019t want an OLED panel. But for an OLED screen that can do 5120\u00d71440 resolution\u2014that\u2019s two 1440p panels in one\u2014and still handle 240Hz of refresh for super-speedy games, it\u2019s a downright deal. Assuming your gaming PC can actually handle pushing nearly 1.8 billion pixels that quickly, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This gigantic 49-inch display is impressi",
