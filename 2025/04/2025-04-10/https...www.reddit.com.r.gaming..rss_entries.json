It feels like jumping into an old save I just feel somewhat lost and not good to play whether it\u2019s because of I want to start the story over again or just want to start fresh with more combat focused games. For example I made it to chapter 5 in Black Myth Wukong and stopped playing for a few months and want to jump back into it but don\u2019t want to jump into my old game even though it will take me dozens of hours to get to where I was.

The silencer is my go to for anything. Sniper and handcanons are a close second, it\u2019s the damn thrill of it. You telling me when you\u2019re shooting a pistol like 007 you aren\u2019t a fucking gangster? Absolutely hands down more fun but less viable depending on how you use it / if the game rewards it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

I&#39;ve been playing video games all my life, in many different genres, from Civilization to Warcraft to Wolfenstein 3D to Halo to Half Life to Fallout to Fornite to Red Dead Redemption to The Witcher to Cyberpunk 2077 and many in between. My wife knew this shortly after we met and of course when we got married. She had always said that she doesn&#39;t &quot;get them&quot; or understand why anyone would want to play them but she understood that it was something I found relaxing and enjoyable.</p> <p>Fast forward to this week and she flat out tells me (while we were arguing about something else) that she thinks video games are juvenile, she can&#39;t believe that a 42 year old man plays them, and that playing them makes me less attractive to her. For reference, I&#39;m a manager at work, we have a nice house, four kids and 2 dogs. So it&#39;s not like I&#39;m just bumming around. And I take care of my hygiene and appearance - basically I do",
