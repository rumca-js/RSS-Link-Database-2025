Never Flinch is King's first full-length novel since September 2023.

You can replenish or gain more steps each day through the following means:</p><ul><li>Entering bedrooms</li><li>Eating food scattered around the house</li><li>Eating a scrumptious meal in the Dining Room</li><li>Buying or acquiring certain items</li><li>Entering the sauna</li><li>Making use of lab experiments</li><li>Unlockin",

Tomo: Endless Sea is an anime-inspired, open-world action-RPG in which players will get the chance to tame mysterious creatures named Tomo, craft various contraptions, and explore a procedurally generated oceanic world known as Endless Blue. The game will also support online multiplayer, and is labeled as an MMO, in addition to its other genres. Tomo: Endless Blue is currently scheduled to release sometime in 2026.</p><p>Alongside its announcement, Onibi Studio shared a first-look at Tomo: Endless Blue in an adorable trailer that turns shockingly dark in its final moments. In it, two characters approach an island aboard a flying whale-like creature that is seemingly an island itself. The pair catch their first Tomo before delving into the ocean below, swimming to shore, and starting off",

Today, the development team announced the first seasonal event of that roadmap, Cursed Hollow, which will run for three weeks starting April 17.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Cursed Hollow event will bring Easter-themed decor--with a spooky twist, of course--to nine of the game's maps--with one of them being Bleasdale Farmhouse, which is one of the reworked maps from the roadmap. Jackalope totems will be available for collection during each run, but interacting with them will alter the rest of the run in both positive and negative ways.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4473638\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" ",
