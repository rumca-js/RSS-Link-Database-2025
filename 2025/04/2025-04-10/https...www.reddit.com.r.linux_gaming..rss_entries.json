But it&#39;s quite annoying to switch operating systems so I&#39;d like to be able to play games on linux.</p> <p>So I downloaded Counter Strike 2 from steam today, and ran it but I was getting terrible FPS. On windows I get between 100-110 fps usually. On linux, I was getting 30-70, and it just felt unplayable. Even the menus were extremely slow and painful to navigate.</p> <p>I have a ryzen 5 2600x and an rx580. I&#39;m running fedora 41 with kde and wayland. One difference between my windows and linux setup is that on linux, because I didn&#39;t want to commit, I have installed CS2 on an NTFS formatted HDD, whereas on windows it&#39;s installed on an SSD. But surely that shouldn&#39;t affect the actual framerate, just the loading times?</p> <p>So really, I&#39;m wondering whether linux gaming is just like this, or whether I&#39;m doing some",

REcently I managed to pair my Oculus Quest 1 to my Linux macine (Linux Mint 22.1) via ALVR and been having some fun on VR Chat. It made me wonder if I can get some motion capture done to play along side VR Chat. MOst of the Motion capture tech in the market is way too much in cost but I know that the Xbox 360 Kinect has been used before in VR chat motion capture for the avatars and a used Kinect is right around my budget. I know it can be done on windows with the right software using the Kinect as a form of webcam to capture body movement but I wish to know how possible it is to be done on Linux comparitively. Has anyone attempted this before? Any advice will be apprecaited, I apologise if tis is not he right place to ask this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SuckieMcDuckie\"> /",

A little trivia: I have installed Linux Mint on my second SSD just yesterday, and my friend (he\u2019s using Windows 10) wanted to play the new snapshot. On Windows we used Radmin VPN to setup a virtual network and play minecraft on my \u201csingleplayer\u201d world that I opened to LAN. However, I did not find a way to do the same on Linux: I tried installing Radmin VPN through Wine, but I could not create neither connect to a network, so I gave up and booted up from Windows. </p> <p>So my question is, how do I play with my friend (who lives in a different country and uses Windows) on LAN-hosted server that I host on my PC? Maybe there is a Hamachi/Radmin VPN alternative for Linux that will also work on Windows and create a network link between our computers?</p> <p>Oh and by the way, buying Realms subscription or using free/non-free host providers is really not an option for us.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
