(I&#39;ve been using LSDJ on the Gameboy since 2006 so 4 channels of samples seems fancy haha.)</p> <p>I would like to experience using Protracker on an actual Amiga. There seem to be a *ton* of options though, between all the different models and add-ons. </p> <p>What I can&#39;t seem to find is this: what&#39;s the minimum I need if my goal is only to have an original Amiga and run Protracker?</p> <p>I&#39;ve read threads that suggest you need a later model and upgraded RAM, and was looking into that, but I saw a video yesterday where cTrix said he wrote most of his music on a stock Amiga 500. A stock Amiga 500 is definitely easier/cheaper to get that something else, so that would be desirable.</p> <p>Does anyone here know what the minimum I&#39;d need to track MODs?
