From what I&#39;m reading even when powered they draw about as much power as a sleep mode modern console, though I&#39;m not confident in that assumption.</p> <p>For anyone who has larger setups: how significant is the power draw when everything is plugged in and just powered off? Should I just get wireless power plug shutoff to just avoid the situation entirely or is it insignificant enough that just putting the modern consoles on a shut off power plug will take care of the majority of the vampire power draw?</p> <p>Edit: and several charging docks/cables for handheld and controllers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",
