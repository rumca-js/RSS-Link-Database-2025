        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>For me, I would love to see a Tarantino movie with Daniel Day-Lewis. Could you imagine Tarantino\u2019s script and dialogue in the hands of DDL? Everybody brings their A-game when showing up to a Tarantino set, established actors or not. Day-Lewis is the game.</p> <p>I once read somewhere that Day-Lewis spent roughly a year preparing for his role in \u201cLincoln.\u201d The product of course, was mesmerizing. It\u2019s one thing to bring a fictional character to life. It\u2019s quite another thing when somebody can bring back an iconic figure in history back from the dead, so convincingly that it felt as Day-Lewis simply held a seance and channeled the President himself. </p> <p>Tarantino needs no argument here. </p> <p>Honestly neither does Day-Lewis for that matter. </p> <p>I believe the level of craftsmanship of both Tarantino and Day-Lewis coming together would be a force to be reckoned with and a cinematic feat of achievement that would be unparalleled. </p> <p>Thoughts",

I didn\u2019t think either would be good movies but just dumb fun and they both ended up being decent. They do both have Seth Rogen and James Franco so maybe that\u2019s a factor.

Like true examples for everyone imo.</p> <p>They are kind, as in their offer support and want to help their children. They even adopted one.</p> <p>They are humorous, they continuously joke around to their kids and to eachother and constantly smiling. The &#39;I am adopted&#39; joke was hilarious.</p> <p>They show love, they are concerned about their daughter but not in a dramatic way. They ask if something is wrong and if they can help and when their daughter says no they drop the subject but still keep an eye on her. Also they show love to eachother.</p> <p>This kind of parenting style isnt for everyone of course, but imo it&#39;s near perfect!

Also......DAMN did the second movie double down on drama and emotional moments!</p> <p>I&#39;m pretty glad this movie is getting a part 3.........I just hope Carter won&#",
