        "description": "<p>I recently finished my Fire Dragons and I was excited to paint more Aeldari, so I decided to crack on with the new Swooping Hawks. The kits are lovely and have lots of options for the Exarch and multiple head choices but I went for a pretty standard build. In today's post I have lots of tips for building and assembling your Swooping Hawks as well as a detailed painting guide. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/04/showcase-aeldari-swooping-hawks-inc-painting-guides/\">Showcase: Aeldari Swooping Hawks (inc. painting guides)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
