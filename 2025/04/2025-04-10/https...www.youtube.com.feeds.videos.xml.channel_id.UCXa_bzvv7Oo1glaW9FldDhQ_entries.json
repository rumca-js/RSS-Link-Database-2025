        "description": "As a long-time fan of Garou: Mark of the Wolves, it's exciting to finally see it get a sequel as Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves launches on April 24th for Xbox Series X/S, PS4, PS5, and PC. However, much has changed this time beyond the new characters and art direction.\n\nFamiliar mechanics like Gears, Just Defend, and T.O.P. (now S.P.G.) return, but players can experiment even more with combos and special moves thanks to the REV System. You also have a choice between the classic Arcade fighting style or Smart style for easily executing techniques and combos. Even the single-player modes are more extensive than ever, thanks to the new Episodes of South Town and its RPG-lite elements.\n\nMultiplayer fans will also find plenty to like with rollback netcode and cross-platform play alongside the usual Casual, Ranked and Room Matches. Here are 15 things you should know about Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves before it arrives later this month.",
