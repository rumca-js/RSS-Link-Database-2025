I know(?) that relays are usually used to isolate circuits; however, I noticed that this relay only has a single ground. Is that implying that the trigger pin voltage from the Pi GPIO (IN) will be compared against the ground from the LiPo battery (DC-), and if so, should I be hooking up the LiPo battery and Raspberry Pi to have a common ground to make sure that the trigger pin voltage is read correctly? Is that as simple as bridging the ground of the battery to the GPIO ground pin?
