Why I created it: I noticed many developers (myself included) faced a common problem - needing a simple waitlist solution without complex setup or paid services. I built this for my own project and decided others might benefit too. Details: - Tech: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Google Sheets API - Features: Email validation, flip-card UI, dark/light theme, mobile-responsive - **Setup:** Detailed guide in README, takes ~10 minutes - **Benefit:** No database required, just connect your Google Sheet **Open-source philosophy:** I&#39;ve tried to make it as accessible as possible with thorough documentation and simple customization options.
