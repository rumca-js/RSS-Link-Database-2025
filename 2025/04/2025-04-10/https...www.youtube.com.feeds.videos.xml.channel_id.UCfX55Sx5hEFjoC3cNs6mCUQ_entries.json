Shipping these changes with confidence requires us to understand our systems at scale.\n\nWithout telemetry, we\u2019re quite literally in the dark. The only way to understand how a piece of software is working is to look at its outputs, and the end user-facing outputs usually aren\u2019t that useful when you\u2019re trying to track down a bug or improve system performance across thousands or millions of users.\n\nIn this webinar, Austin Parker, Director of Open Source at Honeycomb, will discuss how OpenTelemetry and semantic telemetry will reshape observability. You\u2019ll learn:\n\n- How OpenTelemetry makes AI-assisted development safer and more effective.\n- OpenTelemetry's relationship to wide events and how it speeds the adoption of observability 2.0\n- Why traditional tooling is",
