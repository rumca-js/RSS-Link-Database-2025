It\u2019s a super minimal local inference engine for running LLMs using Python. The UI is curses based and kept intentionally simple. The whole backend is under 100 lines because the idea is for it to serve as a platform for your own ideas.</p> <p>Whether you want to build your own chatbot, experiment with local models, or just poke around and learn, it\u2019s a surprisingly good starting point, especially for beginners who want something lightweight to tinker with.</p> <p>If that sounds interesting, feel free to check it out \u2014 there\u2019s a demo in the README and everything\u2019s open source.</p> <p>Let me know what you think!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Quick_Ad5059\"> /u/Quick_Ad5059 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/96cjek9w3xte1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#3",

The problem is not critical at all but I can&#39;t wrap my head around it, so I reckoned someone might be able to enlighten me.</p> <p>My setup is as followed: I&#39;m running Proxmox on a enterprise mini PC. In Proxmox I have 1 Ubuntu Server VM running most of my services. In the Ubuntu Server VM I&#39;m running Pterodactyl. In Pterodactyl, I&#39;m running the Valheim server on port 27000. I am forwarding the port 27000 in my router. Everything works fine and everyone can join with &lt;Public-IP&gt;:27000<br/> I also have a DuckDNS-Domain pointing to my public IP, so people can also join via &lt;DuckDNS-Domain&gt;:27000</p> <p>However, my idea is that it would be neat to have my mates only remember one domain without the port. And I thought this could be easily done with a reverse proxy (as I&#39;ve &#39;secured&#39; my internal network with Nginx Proxy Manager, so I get rid of the browser warnin",
