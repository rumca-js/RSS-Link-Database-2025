It always reflects a time (on each story) one hour in advance of my time (or Eastern time). This is annoying only in that it always makes the ESPN stories the lead stories in my unread articles feed every single time. I&#39;m pretty sure, short of deleting the feed, I cannot adjust this somehow. Has anyone else seen this and how did you remedy?

I&#39;d like to give it an RSS feed, and have it give me back an RSS that is identical except for the fact that the entries are always delayed by exactly 6 weeks from when they were originally posted by the source feed. I know this is a really weird request. Is there ANY tool out there that is capable of doing this? I&#39;m willing to use something paid if necessary, but I&#39;d prefer something as streamlined as possible, obviously. Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: Found <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/769008/time-delay-an-external-rss-feed\">this StackOverflow post</a> with more or less my exact request. The replies state that it apparently was possible with Yahoo Pipes, but I&#39;m about a decade too late for that to be an option, sadly. Still hoping someone here knows of an alternative!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",
