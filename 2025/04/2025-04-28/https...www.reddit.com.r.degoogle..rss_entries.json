I am growing my Bluesky, but right now Instagram funnels commissions and patrons to me so I can make a living. I am trying to do more video work, so I decided to check out Edits. I installed it, thought it was nifty and creepy that it immediately identified me as my Insta account, and then saw that using it would opt me into Meta&#39;s Art Theft Woodchipper. So I closed the app and un-installed it. </p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions for a lightweight, mobile app for minimal video editing on the fly? Something as simple as just being able to stitch multiple videos together would be enough for now while I do more deep dive research after Faire season.
