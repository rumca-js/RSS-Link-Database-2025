It has 10% on Rotten Tomatoes, and it&#39;s based on a crackpot theory about the pyramids from the rear end of Graham Hancock. But somehow, no matter how many times I see this movie, I never get tired of it. The scene where Steven Strait javelins the Pharaoh and shouts &quot;He is not a god!&quot; is one of my favourite movie scenes ever. Also, the music is awesome, the filming locations are gorgeous, and the miniature pyramid models used in production are fantastic. So despite the story being illogical and stupid, and the historiography being absolutely batshit, 10,000 BC will always be one of my guilty pleasures.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepThinkingReader\"> /u/DeepThinkingReader </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1k9x39r/whats_a_critically_panned_movie_that_you_just/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"",

So I thought I&#39;d ask a sub of movie lovers. How many of you still enjoy going to the movies? Personally I still go when there&#39;s something that really peaks my interest. But current ticket prices have made me a lot more selective and obviously I tend to favor the big movies where the theatrical set up really shines vs the samller films that you can enjoy at home without missing much in terms of bigger screen and super duper sound set up. But, I do agree with the aspect that streaming has &quot;democratized&quot; the movie viewing experience. Not everyone lives close to a movie theater and not everyone has the time to go to one. Being able to press play and just enjoy is a huge plus. Also, home set ups are becoming more advanced. Some OLED and Mini LED tvs are out of this world in terms of quality and you can get a great sound system",

One of my favorite chase scenes from any horror movie tbh. I love how they used the soundproof rooms and the way you can see Ghostface just behind her in the studio walls. </p> <p>And I just love Gale and Dewey so even though I\u2019ve seen this movie 100 times, I\u2019m still upset when he gets stabbed. Courteney Cox sla the hell out of it too and I think Scream 2 is my favorite version of Gale.</p> <p>Betwee",
