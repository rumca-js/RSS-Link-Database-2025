I want to get him excited about them. We used to play a lot of Magic The Gathering, and he is enthusiastic about that game. However, when it comes to other \u201creal\u201d board games, he isn\u2019t very open to them\u2026 at least not yet. He did say he would be willing to try something with me. So of course, I\u2019m thinking it needs to be the right game to really hook him! The options I have are Wingspan, Rajas of the Ganges, or The Castles of Burgundy. Alternatively, maybe something smaller first, like Sea Salt &amp; Paper, Port Royal, or 7 Wonders Duel. What do you think would make a good introduction? I\u2019m also open to other game suggestions, but my collection isn\u2019t very big.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Appropriate-Art592\"> /u/Appropriate-Art592 </a> <br/> <span><a h",

Elements of deckbuilding or deck construction to achieve this would likely be necessary.</p> <p>Role-playing mechanics I am looking for include character progression and a campaign with branching paths based on the decisions made in-game. While that would probably include some sort of narration or story, I would prefer for stoppages in play for reading to be kept to a minimum.</p> <p>I would also like for the game to not be too &quot;rules-heavy&quot;. I don&#39;t mind a little bit of overhead, but prefer for my games to not burn my brain by constantly introducing new rules and mechanics. A good rulebook or tutorial system could go a long way, but medium-light games are my preference.</p> <p>EDIT: It doesn&#39;t have to be strictly an &quot;rpg&quot; if it fits these parameters, but",

I think maybe the center card had a category (something round, a food, a city, etc) and the surrounding cards had letters? And whatever category was revealed, players had to use one of the letters around it to answer, and if they did, they took that letter tile and the center card got flipped over to replace that tile with a new letter, at the same time revealing a new center category card.
