I\u2019ve used it to develop models of cancer cell metabolism, to get critiques of a screenplay I\u2019m writing, and for discussions about life adversity, grief, and professional burnout, etc. The thing that worries me is that its algorithm is tuned for performative empathy. It clearly doesn\u2019t have empathy or compassion, since it doesn\u2019t have emotions at all. Yet it is very good at mimicry of these characteristics. If a human were to display these traits, we\u2019d call it psychopathic. I found myself deriving comfort from chatGPT\u2019s advice and reassurance, until I forced myself to realize that it is all performative. Yet I\u2019m on the fence. As a doctor, I know that mental health resources are woefully unavailable for many people. And its advice was pretty good.
