So i sent him a message and waited for a reply.. as you can see better then my family but still not coming out for my own safety. Im just so frustrated he compared being trans to money! Being trans isnt a want it\u2019s simply a fact of my life that i have to live with. Im just greatful I checked his option before coming out\u2026 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/welcometothechaos9\"> /u/welcometothechaos9 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ka3ukh\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comment",
