I am new here.</p> <p>Tiny story: A few days ago I refunded my Switch 2 preorder, after seeing how nearly all the games that I actually wanted were releasing on Key Cards only (aka... Downloadcodes in fancy packaging), which is very bad for me, as I am also a collector (although not totally hardcore) and already lost a few digital collections thanks to a Data leak a few years ago. Since then I want to own what I play, even if I play it through an ODE or similar. So the Switch 2 was dead to me... at least for now. And after getting back my 470 Euros I thought... why dont I buy the last system, that I actually always wanted to own? I have all the other systems I want already. But the Amiga? That one is still missing in my collection! Which I skipped so far, because I never had one back in the day. Never played much on it via emulators (I did beat Road Rash once and LOVE Monkey Island!) and all of it seemed always very daunting to me.</p> <p>L",
