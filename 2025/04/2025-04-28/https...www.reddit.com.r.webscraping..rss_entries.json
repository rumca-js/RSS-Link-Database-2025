I am building a web app that lets you input airbnb/booking link and it will show you safety for that area (and possible safer alternatives). I am scraping airbnb/booking for obvious reasons - links, coordinates, heading, description, price.</p> <p>The terms for both companies \u201cban\u201d any automated way of getting their data (even public one). Ive read a lot of threads here about legality and my feeling is that its kind of gray area as long its public data.</p> <p>The thing is scraping is the core behind my app. Without scraping I would have to totally redo the user flow and logic behind. </p> <p>My question: is it common that these big companies reach to smaller projects with request to \u201cstop scraping\u201d and remove any of their data from my database? Or they just dont care and try their best to make it hard to continually scrape ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DinnerLe",
