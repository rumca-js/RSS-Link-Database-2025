It&#39;s been a while since I started working on Ungrabber (it was originally a website), and it&#39;s my first real project. This module is designed to retrieve the C2 (Discord webhook in this case) from many well-known Python info stealers, whether they are compiled with Pyinstaller or directly from a .pyc file.</p> <p>Any feedback, suggestions, or pull requests are very welcome. Thank you for checking it out :3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lululepuoff\"> /u/lululepuoff </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/lululepu/Ungrabber\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/comments/1ka4thc/a_c2_extractor_python_module_for_known_python/\">[comments]</a></span>",
