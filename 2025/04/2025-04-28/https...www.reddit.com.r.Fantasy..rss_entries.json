I\u2019m really a novice reader and don\u2019t really read as a hobby but I\u2019d like that to change (I want another activity rather than going on my phone). I\u2019m an avid gamer who\u2019s like 250 hours deep into Elden Ring and the DLC. I also liked games like Dark Souls and The Witcher. Also loved LOTR movies growing up. I did my due diligence on this sub before I ask this question. Do you think the Wheel of Time is for me as a beginner into fantasy? WoT as well as Malazan were constantly recommended on posts for people looking for \u201csoulslike\u201d books, but after more research it sounded like Malazan might have been too much of a challenge. People mentioned WoT was much more accessible. I picked up the first WoT book last night and liked the first 40 pages or so, but I can\u2019t help but feel like I won\u2019t finish due to the length. I guess my questions are: should I continue on to see if I like it? Does anyon",
