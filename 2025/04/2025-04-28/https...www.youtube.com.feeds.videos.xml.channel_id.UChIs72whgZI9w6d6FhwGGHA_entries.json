This thermal paste deep-dive uses scanning electron microscopes to look at paste particle size, testing equipment to evaluate differences, and machines to manufacture the thermal paste itself. All of this was filmed in Germany, near Berlin, at Thermal Grizzly's new factory. We can finally see how much thermal paste is too much. This video goes into thermal paste differences, how to make thermal paste, good vs bad thermal interface material, and more, all to talk about what cools CPUs and GPUs.\n\nWe have a full multi-part series for our Made In Germany Factory Tour videos coming up!\n\nWatch Der8auer's video, \"The Secret of Testing Thermal Paste,\" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BfSx5IG42c\nTOO MUCH THERMAL PASTE: https://www.youtube.c",
