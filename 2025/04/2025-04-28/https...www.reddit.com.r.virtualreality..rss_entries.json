The first solution that came to mind was to look into headsets, as they are more or less enclosed. I\u2019m running a Getac eight core i5 with onboard graphics, which is more than enough for video feed, but probably not enough for most headsets. All I really need is for something to duplicate what the monitor displays. Is this even the right avenue to go down? Any suggestions would be great.

Basically, it\u2019s a new take on the Broadway musical, but done with virtual reality technology. Let me explain how I see it working. </p> <p>Basically the performers would be wearing headsets and body rigs with virtual avatars that could be shuffled around the stage with preset blocking so the actors could focus on their individual performances. All rehearsals and performances would take place in VR (meaning if you had your equipment you could participate at home). The stage itself could be any shape or size the animators and team working on the project need it to be, basically combining the live theater and animated film experience. The audience would also be wearing VR headsets as well, at home, and could select multiple angles to view the performance. After the initial line of performances (or however that worked) we could release a filmed version t",
