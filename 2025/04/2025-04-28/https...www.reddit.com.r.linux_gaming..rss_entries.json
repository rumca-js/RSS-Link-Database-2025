So I wanted to ask if anyone here knows how to get this thing to work on linux:</p> <p><a href=\"https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/\">https://ntcore.com/4gb-patch/</a></p> <p>It&#39;s a common and well known 4Gb patcher. Perhaps there is a different one people use for Linux? Any help here would be greatly appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mastershake2013\"> /u/mastershake2013 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1k9p3va/is_there_a_4gb_patcher_or_can_i_make_this_one_work/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1k9p3va/is_there_a_4gb_patcher_or_can_i_make_this_one_work/\">[comments]</a></span>",
