I&#39;m not particularly knowledgeable with either, I just watch videos every once and a while and do what I can to improve my SEO.</p> <p>Recently, my local board of trade / chamber of commerce updated their website. Now on my backlink audit in Semrush, it shows that their website has a high toxicity score (80+). Normally I&#39;d just use the disavow tool but this is a legitimate backlink so I&#39;m unsure of what I should be doing here.
