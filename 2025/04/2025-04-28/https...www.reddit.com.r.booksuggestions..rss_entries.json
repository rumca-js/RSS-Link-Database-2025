I have been for a while, but I feel like my brain has rewired itself in such a way that I\u2019m almost unable to process reading material. I take full accountability in not trying to push past my depression and letting my brain deteriorate to this point - but now that I\u2019m starting to recover, I realize how much I miss reading and getting lost in the magic of those written worlds. I recently picked up The Book of the New Sun by Gene Wolfe as it was recommended for avid enjoyers of Dark Souls. I\u2019m not going to lie, my brain might be a little too liquid right now to process even the first page. Would you guys happen to have any recommendations for books that would help ease a brain of cobwebs back into the light? Back when I used to read, I really enjoyed dark fantasy, fantasy, the classics, and whimsical fiction like Tales of the Earthsea or Somnium. I\u2019m definitely open to all genres and all age levels of written work. Than",
