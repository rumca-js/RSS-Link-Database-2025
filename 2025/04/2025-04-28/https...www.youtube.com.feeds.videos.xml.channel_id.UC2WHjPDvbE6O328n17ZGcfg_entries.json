It's something I\u2019ve been dealing with lately.\n\nI have 4 projects I\u2019m actively working on right now and jumping between lol - actually make that 5, I just started another one.\n\nSo I\u2019ve done a lot of science-backed research to figure out why this is a thing, so I can know how to combat it, or how to harness it. Why do I keep jumping from project to project? Well, I figured it out and in this video I share it all with you. I hope you enjoy and I hope it helps!\n\nA portion of this video is sponsored by monday.com.\n\nIf you're a developer, sign up to my free newsletter Dev Notes \ud83d\udc49 https://www.devnotesdaily.com/\n\nIf you're a student, checkout my Notion template Studious: https://notionstudent.com\n\nDon't know why you'd want to follow me on other socials.
