So we have to update ModelB timestamp.

It&#39;s about understanding needs, imagining solutions, making smart decisions, being creative, sometimes even intuitive. Tools can help, sure, but fully replacing a developer is a whole different story. Building software requires common sense, communication, and a lot of adaptability.
