I recently downloaded Bitfarm-Archive to manage my personal documents, from home to car, work, bills, and so on. I\u2019ve downloaded a PDF guide and watched several videos on how the program works, and I\u2019m gradually learning it. However, there\u2019s one thing that worries me quite a bit. I installed Bitfarm on my PC (server version), and during the installation, it created an account and assigned a router port. This makes me think the program connects to the internet, and I\u2019m seriously concerned about the risk of cyberattacks that could compromise or steal my data.Given my lack of knowledge in this field, can someone recommend a guide on how to protect myself and back up my personal data?

This approach brings a few key benefits for self-hosters:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Higher bandwidth efficiency</strong>: No extra IP/TCP/UDP headers.</li> <li><strong>Fine-grained access control</strong>: You can expose just specific apps instead of entire networks.</li> <li><strong>NAT reverse proxy</strong>: Easily expose internal apps without requiring public IPs or heavy reverse proxies.</li> <li><strong>Performance boost</strong>: Optimized for direct app-to-app communication.</li> </ul> <p>Use cases I&#39;m personally exploring: - Releasing expensive VPS pub",

I also am super paranoid about my server&#39;s security so I&#39;m not sure if that works to my advantage or disadvantage.

I\u2019ve heard duck dns is a workaround but am unsure as to whether it would work. I have an Alienware laptop running windows 10 hosting a game server for my friends and I but every three to seven days my hosting program stops working. I assume it\u2019s due to having a dynamic ip I use ngrok to get around port forwarding since I can\u2019t get freedom fiber to work for me. My question is do I need to get someone to program a batch file or program something so that it\u2019ll detect when my public ip changes and then restart my laptop and then automatically start my server and hosting programs or is there another program I can leave running that will prevent all of this to begin with?
