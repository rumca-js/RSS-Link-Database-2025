I was trying to grab an obscure torrent with little peers, but it takes so fucking long to download that i started looking into port forwarding as it&#39;s meant to help with that.</p> <p>My understanding is this: It lets any internet traffic connect to your private network, and it allows your private network to connect to them You can filter internet traffic through that lens. (?)</p> <p>Is that correct at all? I have absolutely no clue, but I would like to know more.</p> <p>My main concern is doesn&#39;t that allow yourself to be opened for attacks?</p> <p>I also have run Proton for years and only really turn it off when a site/game starts giving me issues after it detects i&#39;m running a vpn.
