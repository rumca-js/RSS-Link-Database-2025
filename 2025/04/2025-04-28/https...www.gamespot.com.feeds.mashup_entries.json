Despite middling ratings and reception when it originally aired in Japan, the anime found new life in North America several years later thanks to its after-school time slot. The show, with its dramatic mech-on-mech action and even more dramatic sci-fi melodrama, almost single-handedly established a foothold for the entire Gundam universe in the West. In the process, it created an entirely new generation of Gundam fans eager for more, helping to bring more Gundam shows overseas and creating a new market for the franchise's popular Gunpla plastic model kits.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Flash forward to 2025, ",
