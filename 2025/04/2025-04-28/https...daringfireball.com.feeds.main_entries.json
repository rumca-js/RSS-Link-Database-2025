I wasn\u2019t sure of the exact name of\nthe ETA, so I just searched \u201ctravel to UK.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The results were all about obtaining an ETA and I picked a link\nthat looked like the official UK government site. It was not; the\nofficial site was lower, below an AI summary, some sponsored\nlinks, and other junk on the results page. Luckily for me, I did\nget a legitimate travel pass\u2009\u2014\u2009but the site I picked overcharged\nme by about $70.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know what the name for this sort of thing is, but it\u2019s like a semi-scam. There are similar services to what Pressman ran into here for expedited passport renewals, for example\u2009",

        "description": "<p>Airbnb CEO (and founder) Brian Chesky, back in October in an interview with Nilay Patel, regarding Tim Cook\u2019s eventual successor:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This goes to the very awkward thing that no one wants to talk\nabout. Succession planning is hard because the people that are\ngreat product visionaries are typically young. They\u2019re young and\nthey\u2019re less mature. Who wants to put a young, not-super-mature\nperson at the helm of a giant company? Founders are allowed to\nmanage people older than them because they\u2019re the founders. If\nyou\u2019re not the founder, people just don\u2019t want to be managed by\nsomebody younger than them who\u2019s maybe a virtuoso, a wunderkind,\nbut they\u2019re a little immature. The companies don\u2019t want to take\nthat risk, so they bias towards senior, grown-up, functional\nexperts. But typically that function is not the product, and I\nthink that\u2019s a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] is more technical. I think that\nhas afforded them more, but he mostly just got them",
