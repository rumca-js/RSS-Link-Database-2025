Most of its run, this phone torrented stuff just fine, but in the last year things went bad. Now it has some sort of hiccups in downloading speeds. At first, the speed goes up, then crashes back down. It can stay down for some time, or go up again immediately. This rollercoaster never ends through the whole file size.</p> <p>It&#39;s not a client problem, both Flud and LibreTorrent behave like that. It&#39;s not a seed / peer problem, since same torrents go stable on my PC, and this weird behaviour is universal for every type of torrent on my phone. It&#39;s not a power management problem, you can&#39;t even limit power usage for those clients in current MIUI build, and it happens even when my phone is in maximum performance mode.</p> <p>What can it be?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DedicatedBurner\"> /u/DedicatedBurner </a> <br/> <span><a h",
