The observed uplift, however, varied significantly, with some areas experiencing as much as a 5-meter rise in the ground surface.",

Study findings call into question the credibility and legitimacy of state institutions like the presidency, parliament and security forces, including the police. The study also shows that many Africans still believe in traditional and religious figures, raising concerns about the effectiveness of governments. It also highlights the disconnect between state officials and the public. The Conversation Africa asked Koffi Am\u00e9ssou Adaba, a political sociologist and one of the authors of the Afrobarometer study, to unpack this loss of trust and its implications.",

For the bacterial species that inhabit your gut, there's a frenzy of viruses called bacteriophages that naturally infect them. Although they co-evolved with bacteria, phages get far less glory. They're harder to classify and so deeply entangled with the bacteria they target that scientists struggle to understand what functions they serve.",
