And when I\u2019m short on time but craving squidgy carbs tangled with spiced lamb mince, the cuminy noodles are my self-loving pleasure.

The mother of a young journalist opened it. To her astonishment, it was the security services looking for her son. No details were provided. Thus began an informal campaign by the authorities against the media and civil society in Poland, including our thinktank, <a href=\"https://kulturaliberalna.pl/\">Kultura Liberalna</a>. After hearing the news about the journalist, we called Aleksander Smolar. The legendary anti-communist dissident, who ran his own NGO, told us that the security services were also trying to arrange \u201cinformal\u201d meetings with his staff. And he comforted us: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve had a playbook for this kind",
