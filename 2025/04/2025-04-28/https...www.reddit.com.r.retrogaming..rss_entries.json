Amongst Mega Man fans, it was clear that this game was the worst and 2 was the best. Nowadays, I don&#39;t feel like people are as eager to immediately declare 8 the worst game of the series. It still is an opinion people have, but I think its positive qualities are a lot more recognised nowadays.

Back in the late 00s and early 10s, the holy trio of bad sonic games was Sonic 06, Sonic Genesis and Sonic R. But I don&#39;t think Sonic R is viewed to be particularly disastrous anymore, and I think that&#39;s because most people who played it did so on",
