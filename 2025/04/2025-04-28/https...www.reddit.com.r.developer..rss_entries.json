I am also doing an internship as an AI Developer, with four months completed so far. Before this, I gained experience through unpaid internships related to web development, primarily using Django. The current internship is for six months, and they have mentioned that there is a possibility of a PPO if things go well, although I am keeping my expectations neutral. Considering my studies, freelancing, and internship experience, can I now consider myself a little experienced? Also, are internships and freelancing counted as valid experience?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WriedGuy\"> /u/WriedGuy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1ka2wpp/are_internships_and_freelancing_considered_valid/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",
