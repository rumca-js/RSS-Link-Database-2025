Recently, I added a guide specifically for Melbet Casino users, since good local information is still pretty limited.</p> <p>Building it took more time than I thought, especially getting the legal research right and making sure the site works well on mobile. I also learned a lot about SEO for Arabic and French users along the way.</p> <p>The guide is live now. If you have a moment to check it out, I\u2019d really appreciate your honest feedback \u2014 both the good and the bad.</p> <p>If you&#39;re interested: Here\u2019s the guide: <a href=\"https://casino-tunisie.com/casino/melbet/\">https://casino-tunisie.com/casino/melbet/</a></p> <p>I would love feedback on the UX, content clarity, or any ideas you think could make it better!</p> <p>Thanks for reading happy to chat about the project, the process, or anything else \ud83d\ude80</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#",

I know it&#39;s a bit too long time for such a project, at least for it&#39;s current state but it really is hard to maintain your motivation and embrace the difficulties that come up in the way of buildijg your dream project. I took a bit time in building my side project this far, sometimes took weeks long of break. When I first started building this project in the middle of July of 2024, I was a new graduate who was looking desperately for a job in the field, I was at my limit due to the hardships of being unemployeed. This project was one of the reasons to overcome the difficulties of finding a job and building my portfolio. After like 2 months, I could find a job but stil",
