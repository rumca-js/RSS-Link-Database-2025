It boots up and runs as expected. This issue only happens when the fan is plugged in. Using every OS available make the charge of the components when a Linux OS is booting",

This a port of the game &quot; The Legend of Zelda - Majora&#39;s Mask &quot;, made by the community. More especifically bu the team of Harbour Masters (libudtraship).</p> <p>Actually this is not the real final state. After compiling and port-ing the rom, I installed the mod &quot;MM reloaded&quot; wich adds high definition textures to everything in the game.</p> <p>But the port itself increases the resolution and the game performance as it runs natively, is just that the textures are not in hd.</p> <p>So basically here it is the video. It really looks awesome. I&#39;m planning to make a github repository for anyone wanting to compile or directly play it on their own raspberries. </p> <p>It is cmpiled on raspberry pi os 64 bit (debian bookworm) so it should be compatible if you&#39;re using this OS.</p> <p>I managed to compile it with the help of deepseek and chatgpt. I know this is not",
