I started with the Google Cyber Security certificate and then wanted to learn hands-on, which I also enjoy. I went through three learning paths from LetsDefend and until just now the Jr Penetration Tester from TryHackMe. I also try to understand everything, do the practical exercises and if I don&#39;t understand something, I do some research. My problem is that by the time I&#39;m two or three exercises in, I&#39;ve already forgotten the things before that. I can explain roughly how something works, but if you put me in front of a computer and I had to show you how to do a penetration test or find out if you&#39;ve been hacked, I&#39;d probably be stumped. I&#39;ve already forgotten most of the commands, as well as most of the tool names or which event ids I have to check :) </p> <p>Here&#39;s my question: What approach would you recommend for learning",
