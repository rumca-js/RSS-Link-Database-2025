Find out which areas are voting and search for your own</p><p>In many other years, the first set of local elections with a new government and prime minister in place would be scrutinised keenly as a judgment on the PM\u2019s performance so far. This year the runes will be harder to read because so many of the councils that are up are Conservative councils in Conservative areas. Few of the big cities are up, although some university cities and towns will be voting.</p><p>In contrast, the results will probably be read as judgment on the performance of the new Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch. The last time these council seats were contested, in most cases, was in 2021, when the Conservatives under Boris Johnson were riding high in the polls on \u201cthe vaccine boost\u201d, and before the partygate scandal started to dent their popularity.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/20",
