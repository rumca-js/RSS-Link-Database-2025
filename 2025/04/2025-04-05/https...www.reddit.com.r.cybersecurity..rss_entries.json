Fast Flux rapidly changes DNS records to avoid detection and takedowns. Variants like Single Flux rotate IPs linked to a domain, while Double Flux goes further by also changing DNS name servers, making threat actor takedowns much harder.</p> <p>Who\u2019s using it? Groups like Gamaredon, Hive ransomware, and others exploit Fast Flux to stay hidden. Even bulletproof hosting providers support this tactic, frustrating traditional cybersecurity defenses.</p> <p>CISA\u2019s advice?

Additionally, if you\u2019re comfortable sharing, I\u2019d like to know what salary range to expect when starting out in GRC\u2014just to get an idea of the market rate.

But since it\u2019s only parttime and I\u2019d be on my own for rent and living expenses, I\u2019d likely need to get a second job just to make it through the summer.</p> <p>Anyone been in a similar situation or have advice?
