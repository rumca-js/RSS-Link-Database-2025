I&#39;m really interested in hosting services like Nextcloud, Jellyfin, and maybe Bitwarden in the future.</p> <p>Right now, I&#39;m trying to figure out the best approach as a beginner. I&#39;m torn between:</p> <p>Using Proxmox as a base system, and then creating a VM or LXC container where I run Docker + Portainer</p> <p>Or skipping Proxmox entirely and just installing Docker + Portainer directly on the bare metal OS</p> <p>I&#39;m not super familiar with Docker yet, but I&#39;m willing to learn. My main goals are ease of use, flexibility, and being able to recover if I mess something up.</p> <p>What would you recommend for someone starting out? Any tips, experiences, or setup advice would be hugely appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PandaBeneficial9609\"> /u/Pa",

Recently I moved to a new apartment and I am unable to access my home devices. I am able to get successful pings remotely ~200ms, but no actual connection. I am unable to ssh, connect to proxmox, or connect to my Network storage.</p> <p>I am assuming this is a problem with the presets with the router for this apartment, but I am not sure where to start with it. Any advice on where to start with this problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lil_squiddy_boi_\"> /u/lil_squiddy_boi_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jrvxum/help_with_tailscale_for_remote_access/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1jrvxum/help_with_tailscale_for_remote_access/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Fast forward to 2017, as I was frustrated with all the other Dropbox alternatives, I figured we should have a better path, instead of forcing parts you can&#39;t swap over to another, the better way integrates with an ecosystem of 3 different kind of interoperable packages: a storage, a web UI and a sync tool. There&#39;s literally more than 100 storage servers available, a couple great options for sync, but what we were really missing is the web UI that integrate everything together. That missing piece became my mission, and 8 years later, I&#39;m very proud of the result even though there&#39;s still a very long way to go.</p> <h1>Milestone in v0.6</h1> <ul> <li><p>The frontend was entirely rewritt",
