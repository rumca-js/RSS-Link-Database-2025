I have been running Mint with my 3090 for a while now but have recently upgraded to an HDR enabled OLED monitor which is when I try to log in using Wayland I get a black screen and nothing else. I do not really want to wait for Mint to catch up and want to try a new distro that has more feature support, but I wonder if I should also try and sell my 3090 and switch to a 7800 xt? Would love to hear some thoughts. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jaws_of_joey\"> /u/jaws_of_joey </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jrqm8k/need_advice_on_gpu_brand_and_distro_for_hdr_oled/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1jrqm8k/need_advice_on_gpu_brand_and_distro_for_hdr_oled/\">[comments]</a></span>",
