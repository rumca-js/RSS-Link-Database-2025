I will be using Vs code, node etc but would like to be able to jump from my desktop machine and laptop on the same project without too much messing. Any thoughts appreciated. I&#39;m guessing setting up both environments the same e.g installing Vs code and all required dependencies and using shared for source \ud83e\udd37. I&#39;m currently on windows 11 environment.
