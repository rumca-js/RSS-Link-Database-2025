But let me explain: We started out with 7WD because it was recommended so much and we liked it. But when Duel for Middle Earth was published I bought it without a second thought... Well because LOTR. And I loved it! The artwork is gorgeous and the gameplay is really similar but even better. The theme is implemented nicely. Recently we have been trying to downsize our (not so huge) collection, not to have less games, but to be able to get more. So 7WD had to go, because we both prefer the &quot;new version&quot;. I have been seeing the og 7Wonders a lot lately and I have been wondering if I should get it... It&#39;s supposed to be very good, but we usually play with 2 people and every few weeks we meet up with others to play. Is it worth it?<br/> Is it different enough from Duel for Middle Earth when played with 2 players? I mean I got rid of 7WD can I justify buying 7W?</p> </",

And I like the matte finish in both sides, it feels smoother and helps with reflections.</p> <p>The problem is that I&#39;ve printed a 3d insert for my Galaxy Trucker 2nd edition and it doesn&#39;t fit sleeved card with Gamegenic because, I can fathom why, the american std. gamenecic sleeves are considerably bigger than the norm (59x91mm). Is there any good alternative?

But most of the players have strategy of scouting and playing strong sets almost from 1 to 10 out of hand. The sets 1 to 10 is imposible to beat. Or have playing sets(8cards) from 2-8 was quite come on. The game kind of was just only to scout one or two cards for the strong set and beat others. People who start had no chance of winning the round. And many players and up with minus - 5 to - 15 end score. </p> <p>The people do not mess up the rules they just get the cards quite offen quite good to have really strong set from begging. We try to shuffle them and reordering precisely but do not for well. </p> <p>And getting sets of let&#39;s say 4 cards of same number never beats the cards from 1 to 7 cards. So it seams there is no point of ordering cards for the same number. </p> <p>They need just one card to have this strong set. Do we something wrong? Any thoughts or house rule on that? </p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-",
