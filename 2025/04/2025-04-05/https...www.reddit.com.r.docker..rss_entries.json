Rosetta can run the machine (mysql 5.5), but I have a massive mysql restore that uses over 40GB of memory. When it hits the Docker limit, the Docker service crashes. This doesn\u2019t happen on my Intel i9 Mac. I\u2019m not complaining, but it seems like a memory handling bug. Anyone else have similar issues? Before someone says why I\u2019m using 5.5, Amd64, and configuring limits in my.cnf, my point is that it shouldn\u2019t crash the Docker service.

This might work but what happens to volumes when I want to update the images? My guess is the updated images get treated as completely separate services so new volumes are started and thus data gets cleaned up.</p> <p>So is there any way to update the images without loosing the data in the volumes?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Maypher\"> /u/Mayp",

I can&#39;t avoid that.</p> <p>I then add my proprietary application to the image, which does not rely on any GPL libraries.</p> <p>Does this class as a &quot;mere aggregation&quot;, much like a Linux distribution?
