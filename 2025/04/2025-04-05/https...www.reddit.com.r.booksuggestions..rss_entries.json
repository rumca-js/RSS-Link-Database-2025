Read a lot of things like Hatchet, Call of the Wild, Warrior Cats, Julie of the Wolves stuff like that in elementary school and then got into more dystopian books when I reached middle school. Thanks to my 7th grade English teacher I started reading a looooot. Like 2 books a week almost. It being like 2014/15 lots of things like Hunger Games, Divergent, Maze Runner, and things were really popular and I read them all. I got to high school and stopped reading as much and now I&#39;m in my last year of college and still not reading much... last two books I really read were Wicked (before I even knew about the musical lol) and Stardust by Neil Gaiman. I liked those but I&#39;ve been more distracted lately and it&#39;s been harder for me to read. I was also on a medication that made it harder for me to concentrate. The last two weeks I decided to re-read the Selection Series by Keira Cass and had so much fun read",

I like how it&#39;s informative about the events, but also how you can connect and understand the feelings and mindset of people (soldiers, civilians and partisans) who are going through this exceptionals events. Can you suggest me a book that takes place in more recent wars (even better if it&#39;s about guerrilla&#39;s war) where the author also has a concern to describe people in it besides the actual events, and is good describing people&#39;s psychology in a entertaining way? If it&#39;s non-fiction, even better. I loved My War Gone By, I Miss it So by Anthony Loyd. By recent war, I mean a war that took place in the last 50 years. </p> <p>P.S. I don&#39;t like Ken Follett&#39;s historical books. I find the description of the characters very shallow and unbelievable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pfurt\"",
