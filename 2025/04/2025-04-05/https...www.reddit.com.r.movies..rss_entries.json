And give up and coming directors like David Fincher and Paul Thomas Anderson their breakouts. Heck they manage to greenlight all three Lord of the Rings in one go. </p> <p>They were like the equivalent to a punk rebel teenager doing movies their way </p> <p>Unfortunately that\u2019s what killed the studio after Return of the King putting whatever out there and most of them were box office failures or absolutely terrible like Son of the Mask or Hoot and then spending $180 million on The Golden Compass which bombed so hard that Time Warner decided to it was enough to absorb it into Warner Bros. </p> <p>And now it\u2019s just a small label under WB that makes some horror movies and 2 or 3 movies in other genres that\u2019s kind of forgotten about within",

It was marketed as a comedy, so I wasn&#39;t prepared for how sad and serious some of the stories would be. I had an uneasy, anxious feeling while watching, uncomfortable with the un romanticized nature of the stories. The gold prospector story was nice but still disturbing to see calloused competition and cruelty.</p> <p>I watch horror movies and usually don&#39;t feel disturbed so it&#39;s been puzzling trying to pin down why Buster Scruggs got to me.</p> <p>You just know that things like that did happen during those times and while they happen today too, what disturbs me is that back then it was much more common and normal for tragedies to occur, and there was much less opportunity for accountability and awareness of the true events.</p> <p>It disturbs me to think that people in the film had a limited ethical and moral compass not because they were evil outlier",

The range on his acting ability was incredible. I first saw him in Top Secret and laughed my ass off, or that cocky prick then nice guy in top gun. The one not so popular movie was The Salten Sea, scarred the living shit out of me! My all time favorite is the Doors. Jim was long before my time but from the \u201cin the know\u201d ground said he nailed including the actual singing from Val! God bless you and thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AbeFromenn\"> /u/AbeFromenn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jrtld1/100_badass/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jrtld1/100_badass/\">[comments]</a></span>",
