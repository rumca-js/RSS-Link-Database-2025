It&#39;s a concert live from Zaiko, and I&#39;ve already paid for the digital ticket a couple of days ago. It&#39;s a great live, and I&#39;d like to have it in my personal collection since this band hasn&#39;t released any live concert videos, aside for a couple songs.</p> <p>The problem is downloading it. I have seem a guide here before on downloading it, but have yet to try it myself. I know downloading stuff that&#39;s locked behind something is quite complicated, and I&#39;d like for someone to show/guide me into doing it.
