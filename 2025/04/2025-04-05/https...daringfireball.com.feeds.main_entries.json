Your cost, for the 256GB\nversion, is $1,100. The cost of all the hardware inside\u2009\u2014\u2009aka the\nbill of materials\u2009\u2014\u2009was about $550 to Apple when the phone was\nintroduced, says Wayne Lam, research analyst at TechInsights,\nwhich breaks down major products. Throw in assembly and testing\nand Apple\u2019s cost rises to around $580. Even when you account for\nApple\u2019s advertising budget and all the included services\u2009\u2014\u2009iMessage, iCloud, etc.\u2009\u2014\u2009there\u2019s still a healthy profit margin.</p>\n\n<p>Now factor in the newly announced tariff for goods from China,\nwhich currently totals 54%. The cost rises to around $850. That\nprofit margin would shrink dramatically if Apple didn\u2019t up the\nprice. And you don\u2019t become a trillion-dollar gadget company by\ncharging for things at cost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also w",
