These were polished experiences that tried to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment medium, for some reason there was a really different aesthetics and atmosphere compared in comparison to later VR titles. For example, First Contact, despite being a short tech demo, played as cozy 80s retrofuturistic experience and there was nothing like that in traditional flatscreen games. Lone Echo allowed me to be actually inside a really immersive sci-fi experience with greatly written story and characters. HL Alyx was a fullscale actual HL game. There was much less jank and much more polish than later titles for some reason too.</p> <p>Since Oculus became Meta, the magic is completely gone - I know ",
