One way to measure these relationships is through the distance between words in text.

Something like SyntaxFm is for Web development, but for AI engineering. </p> <p>I&#39;m seeking podcast episodes that go through how to train a Lora, how to fine tune an open source model, the cloud GPU space, autoregression vs diffusion etc. Most podcasts I have tried are either focussed on ML or they are mostly focussed on news about the latest frontier models and interviews about ethics.</p> <p>I find it difficult to find resources and often find the most useful info on social media or hidden away in a blog post on Civet. If anyone knows of any learning resources that fit this description, please share.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sad_Butterscotch4589\"> /u/Sad_Butterscotch4589 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1",
