After the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, there was so much support and so many hugs and flowers from the left, right, and center. Cis gays and lesbians finally got their piece of the pie. Bisexuals and other sexualities, and transgender people - were not far behind. The most homophobic thing you could even say was &quot;marriage is between a man and a woman&quot;; there was nobody calling for trans people to be publicly hanged. </p> <p>It seems like schools, workplaces, third places, and residences were flying rainbow flags. The Progress flag did not exist back then, so BLM signs and trans support signs were found next to them. Granted I live in a liberal city (Madison, WI) but 2015-16 is when the apex happened. Fuck Fox News, Trumpism, and everything else for ruining this moment. <strong>I WANT MY JOY BACK!</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=",
