They are intensely savoury, umami-rich and a vibrant, golden colour, much like bottarga, or Italian-style cured fish roe. Once dried, they take on a firm, grateable consistency, and are ideal for giving dishes a final punch of flavour \u2013 I often use them instead of cheese: try grating over pasta, risotto or steamed greens.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/05/how-to-turn-excess-egg-yolks-into-an-umami-packed-flavouring-recipe-zero-waste-cooking\">Continue reading...</a>",
