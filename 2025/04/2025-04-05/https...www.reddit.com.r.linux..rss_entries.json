I can even watch YouTube videos at 720p60 with no lag at all \u2014 TikTok too! My girlfriend has a newer laptop from 2017 with either an i3 or an i5, I don&#39;t remember exactly, but it runs Linux much worse compared to this one, and I don&#39;t know why. It&#39;s still using an HDD.</p> <p>I could upgrade the processor to a newer one from that era \u2014 it has an <strong>PGA988</strong> socket. Do you think it&#39;s worth it? I could also replace the HDD with an SSD. What do you think?
