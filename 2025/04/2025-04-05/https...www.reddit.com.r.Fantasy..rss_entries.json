In particular, mainstream monotheistic religions and planetary monocultures. Basically, a fancier version of Planet of Hats. So, Earth, and to a much greater extent Mars and the Belt have a single overriding culture that everyone belongs to equally. There&#39;s very little evidence of subcultures or even ethnic cultures present in the vast majority of space opera or hard SF with outer space settings, whether asteroid or planetary colonies.</p> <p>This is an a hatepost for The Expanse. the large majority of outer space sci-fi is pretty much the same. In fact, entire multi-planet or multi-system nations often have what amounts to a single culture for the entire population. It&#39;s even more common in stories with only the human species spreading out from earth.</p> <p>There are sometimes good in-world reasons for this. Mot often",

The most striking one was that she needed to reach a cave on the side of a mountain, but there was a valley full of spiked rocks between her and it. She starts crying because she thinks the task is impossible, and when her tear falls on one of the rocks, it melts down into a smooth one. She realizes what happened and immediately starts thinking of the saddest possible things to make herself bawl. Then she walks through the whole valley melting her way with tears. </p> <p>So cool!
