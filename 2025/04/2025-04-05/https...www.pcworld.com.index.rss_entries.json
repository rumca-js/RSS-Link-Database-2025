More than anything else, the infamous error screen is characterized by its bright blue color, the sad smiley face, and the bluntly plain \u201cAn error has occurred\u201d message, which all make the screen so instantly recognizable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Microsoft is now changing the design of the blue error screen and breaking with tradition. In fact, it won\u2019t be called a \u201cblue screen\u201d anymore because, at least in the current preview version of Windows 11 24H2, the error screen is now <strong>completely black</strong>. (For Windows Insiders on test versions, the error screen will be green instead.)</p>\n\n\n<div clas",

That\u2019s all well and good but the result is that I\u2019ve accumulated an awful lot of cables that have ended up in a giant tangled heap. I\u2019m talking about a thicket so dense and entwined it could rival the Amazon rainforest\u2019s most inaccessible parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cables that make up this pile come in a variety of types, from USB-A to USB-C cords, power cords, HDMI cables and chargers \u2014 and, with many having no distinguishing feature other than the size of their connectors, it can be incredibly frustrating and time consuming trying to tell them apart. Clearly, I\u2019m in desperate need of a fix \u2014 and thankfully \u2014 I\u2019ve found one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"my-aha-moment-with-usb-cables\">My aha! moment with USB cables</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My aha moment came when I stumbled on these <a href",
