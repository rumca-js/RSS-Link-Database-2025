The original is also quite good, but I&#39;d say not as good as the remake, though they&#39;re pretty much the same story, i.e., a pathetic nobody gets offered seven wishes from the Devil in exchange for their soul, but the Devil makes all their wishes go bad, though at the end, everything works out for both innocent characters (no spoilers here!) to the detriment of the Devil, who needs to look for another soul.</p> <p>One thing I prefer about the remake, besides the Devil being played by a very hot woman, is that I thought it was quite thought-provoking concerning good, evil, and what really matters in life.
