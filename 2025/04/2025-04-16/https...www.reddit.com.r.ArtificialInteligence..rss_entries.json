I\u2019m super curious: how does this kind of AI actually work behind the scenes? Like, how is it trained, and what kind of data does it learn from? Also, where is it being used in real workplaces? I imagine it&#39;s more than just chatbots and cool art\u2014maybe in writing, coding, or design? Just trying to get a simple understanding without all the super technical jargon.
