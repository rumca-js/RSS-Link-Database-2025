The embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the data, making them useful for tasks like search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, they can struggle with more complex materials, such as documents comprising a mix of text and images, so enterprises often have to build pre-processing pipelines to get data ready for AI to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canadian AI company Cohere hopes to solve this problem with Embed 4, its latest multimodal model that supports frontier search and retrieval capabilities. The model can quickly search ",
