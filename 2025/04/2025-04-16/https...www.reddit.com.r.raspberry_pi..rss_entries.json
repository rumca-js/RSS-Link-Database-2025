My plan is to add some kind of hdmi hub to the hdmi plugs to split the channel. Then friends and i will write a program to assign each video to a specific hdmi output and start playing them. It doesnt have to be perfectly perfectly synced, but good enough for not having a very noticable delay after a couple of hours. It is important that every output is recognized as the same output every time, so the videos are always in the same screen.<br/> Has anyone done something like this before and can tell me what i need to pay attention to and what kind of hdmi hub i need. And maybe if a raspberry pi is the best choice for this.<br/> thank you &lt;3",

Within Python I have set pin 3 to an input and as High when button pressed. How is it that the Pi senses that the button is pressed when there isn&#39;t 3.3V being sent to it? (If that makes sense). The button is connected to GND and to the input, that&#39;s it, but it somehow knows the button is being pressed. It&#39;s a stupid question I know but I&#39;m curious!

When booting, Chromium is starting automatically, connecting with my HA Interface via IP adress and local network on a router. But i need to be more independent. In the future when everything is set up i can only use the Pi and touchscreen with out an &quot;external&quot; local network. Do you have any solutions how I can still connect my pi with the HA Interface?</p> <p>Currently I have only one thing in mind:</p> <p>- Setting up the Pi with his own local network.</p> <p>Or are there other options out there? Is there an easy and reliable way? </p> <p>Thank you in advanced and excuse possible spelling mistakes.</p> <p",
