Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is a classic throwback from publisher Dotemu (Streets of Rage 4, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge) and developer The Game Kitchen (Blasphemous series). But while Ragebound shows their respect for retro craftsmanship, it feels more like an evolution of the 8-bit originals than a broad reinvention. This is still an action-platformer at heart, serving as a respectful homage to Ninja Gaiden classics that picks up right where those left off.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">During an extended hands-on with Ragebound I was able to try a lengthy chunk from the early hours of the game: a playable story sequence, tutorial, and then a few stages full of tense combat and new mechanics that fit right into the classic feel of Ninja Gaiden.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-ref-id=\"2300-6465897\" data-src=\"/videos/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-official-kumori-gameplay-reveal-traile",

While the feature isn't planned to be added until Year 2 Season 3, Ubisoft has shown off some early gameplay footage.</p><p>Despite low player numbers, Ubisoft has just revealed a full year of new content planned for Skull and Bones. While ship-to-ship combat on the high seas is the game's bread and butter, land combat is one of the big items on the menu for Year 2.</p><p>The teaser shown off as part of the Skull and Bones Year 2 Showcase shows early gameplay with pirates dual-wielding blades and firearms. It looks like players will have the option of getting up close and personal or picking enemies off from a distance, depending on their choice of weapon.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skull-and-bones-is-finally-adding-land-combat-this-ye",
