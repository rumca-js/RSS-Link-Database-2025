Now in Moving Houses, it's your turn\u2026 whether you really want to leave or not. Enjoy a silly physics-based game about moving on as you box up your life while immersed in casual comfy gameplay and the instant gratification of task-based gamification of packing chores. Be neat, be careful or be a chaos goblin. The choice is yours!\n\nAs you navigate in first-person, you\u2019ll pick up furniture, plants, paintings and more, loading them carefully (or not so carefully) into the moving truck, completing checklists of important tasks to progress. Run, jump, kick, drop, throw, rotate objects and more! But be warned, not all is as it seems in this quiet little house. An eerie mystery could lie beneath the mundane monotony of the task at hand.\n\nMoving Houses is now available for PS5 and PS4.\n\n#ps5 #ps5games #ps4 #ps4games",
