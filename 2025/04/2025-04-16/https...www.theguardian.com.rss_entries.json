Saka had missed a first-half penalty that might have set up their passage sooner, but he was not sunk.

The implicit argument is that placing Thiebaud into a personal canon of artistic mentors and influences doesn\u2019t diminish him but actually makes him better than ever before.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguard",

A golden pastry base, which cleverly doubles as the crumble topping, holds the tender apple and rhubarb fruit filling, and a thin meringue layer strikes just the right balance of buttery, sweet, and tangy. Meanwhile, a pudding that creates its own sauce while baking always feels magical. The secret lies in the different densities of the batter and the liquid poured over it just before baking \u2013 during its time in the oven, the two layers separate into a cake with a rich, molten sauce beneath.
