Now, however, using a forward genetics approach, researchers have identified that a gene named LIRI1 regulates this process, significantly increasing oil storage in leaves while reducing starch levels. Their findings provide insights into carbon allocation mechanisms, offering the potential for the development of renewable biofuel resources or low-starch foods.",
