I have always wanted to implement this feature and do it properly: a feature to automatically adjust keyboard lights and LCD backlights using the data provided by the Ambient Light Sensor.</p> <p>I enjoy low-level programming a lot. Since I have this free time while waiting for other opportunities, I delved into writing this program in C. It came out well and worked seamlessly on my device. Currently, it only works for keyboard lights. I designed it in a way that the support for LCD will come in seamlessly in the future.</p> <p>But, in the real world, people have different kinds of devices. And I made sure to follow the iio implementation on the kernel through sysfs. I would like feedback. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/donjajo\"> /u/donjajo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/donjajo/als-led-b",
