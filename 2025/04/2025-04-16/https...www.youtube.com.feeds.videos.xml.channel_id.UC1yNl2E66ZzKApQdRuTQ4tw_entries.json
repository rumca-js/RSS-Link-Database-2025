But in a new study, researchers have used the equations of quantum mechanics to determine a brain\u2019s \u201ccriticality,\u201d a measure which allows them to separate waking brains from sleeping ones. I think they\u2019re onto something. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.014410\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n\ud83d\udd17 Join this channel ",
