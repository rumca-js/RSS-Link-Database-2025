The Power Rangers dbg is the only one that has an official storage box designed for the game, but has anyone tried using it for the others? It appears the small inner boxes are designed for oversized character cards, which leads me to believe it would be a good option for Transformers, but what about the tarot sized cards from GI Joe?

I was disappointed to find out it&#39;s more of an optimization puzzle. While I&#39;m learning to enjoy it now, I&#39;m still in the mood for a cool dungeon crawler. Preferably something similar to Bloodborne with exploration, side quests, decisions, combat, and leveling up your character.</p> <p>Ideally it&#39;s about as complex as Bloodborne too. I think a rating of 3 point something on BGG would probably be a good frame of reference. I&#39;m willing to consider higher or lower tho, as I haven&#39;t totally ruled out Mage Knight yet. </p> <p>Mods I hope this post falls within the rules! I know recommendation posts are a grey line here and I try to keep mine to a minimum. If anyone has any suggestions I would really appreciate it!

I&#39;ve tried some well known games, like Carcassonne for example and i like it, when you can awe at what you and your teammates were able to build through the game. But i crave something more.
