I&#39;m assuming not - what would you suggest instead?</p> <p>Reeder&#39;s display format, ease of use, and flexibility are definitely keys. I&#39;ve used TTRSS and a few more clunkier self-hosting options years ago, but I&#39;m sure things have moved on past then.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Impressive_Hall5855\"> /u/Impressive_Hall5855 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1k0lfvx/reeder_classic_selfhosted_website_rss_feeds/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1k0lfvx/reeder_classic_selfhosted_website_rss_feeds/\">[comments]</a></span>",
