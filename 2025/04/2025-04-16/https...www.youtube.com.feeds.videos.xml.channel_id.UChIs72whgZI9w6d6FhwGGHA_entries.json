Right now though, we just don't see where you buy a card unless truly in need as the pricing situation is out of control across all tiers, used and new alike. We benchmarked the RTX 5060 Ti vs. the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB, the RTX 3070 Ti, 3080, RX 9070, RX 7600, and dozens more video cards to test the performance of something that will ultimately be leveraged by parasites.\n\nLike our content?
