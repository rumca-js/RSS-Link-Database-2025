I have already moved to navidrome for music, jellyfin for video, vaultwarden for passwords, immich for photos (with a script that downloads the latest photos from the apple server to the immich library, then deletes the photos from apple to keep usage within the free plan and still be able to use the native camera app), etc. All that remains, the single thing still taking up more than 5GB of space - is the messages app. I know that I can download an archive of my messages, but I dont think that is the same thing as &quot;self-hosting&quot;. Ie, is there a way to self-host all of my messages history in a way where the data cant just be modified to insert fake messages that never existed? Or is that stored by the phone companies anyway?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/devshore\"> /u/devshore </a> <br/> <span",

I currently backup my Nextcloud (with their bultin backup) and Immich (backup cron script) to a cloud separately. My Plex Media folder is inside of Nextcloud so it gets a backup as well.</p> <p>I currently do not have backups for my Plex database or any of my other containers and it will be pretty tedious to make a separate backup script for each one of them.
