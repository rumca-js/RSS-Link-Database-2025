Then Lowen, a complete stranger to the family gave the idea to kill verity and how can she live her life guilt free with Jeremy after reading that letter.

Don\u2019t get me wrong it was heartbreaking to see the internal struggle and self hatred of David and the slow descent and desperation of Giovanni, but when I compare how I felt near the end with other readers online who filmed themselves crying/recommending to read this book asap is such a stark contrast with my reaction. Am I desensitized? I\u2019m all against torture porn so its not that I need the story to be extravagant to make me feel something but I\u2019m just slightly disappointed I guess because I expected more. James Baldwin is a great author so I feel like I don\u2019t get the extent of his writing I guess, anyone else struggle with the same thing? Doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be about the book.

Since I&#39;m an avid reader of thrillers and crime novels, I decided to give it a try when I saw it sitting in my university&#39;s library. </p> <p>The book started strong. It starts with the discovery of a dead farm family by a police officer, who eventually got killed by one of the family&#39;s sons. That immediately caught my interest and when the book moved to present day, I was trying to figure out which character matched with the boy&#39;s age and potential motives. But it wasn&#39;t that simple. </p> <p>Despite its length, the book was fast-paced. Its short chapters and simple writing made it quite easy to be devoured. The chapters passed on really quickly, although I feel like they could have been a little longer at times because I felt like I was reading a transcript. But overall, the pacing was pretty good and it ",

While it wasn\u2019t a bad read\u2014it\u2019s fast-paced and I finished it in just a day and a half\u2014I personally found it quite predictable. Having read a fair share of mysteries, this one didn\u2019t offer much in terms of surprise or depth.</p> <p>I think the book owes its popularity to teenagers or adults who read once in a while. It\u2019s engaging enough for a quick read, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to frequent or seasoned readers. One major drawback, in my opinion, was the writing\u2014it occasionally felt a bit cringe (which I have heard is common with such books).</p> <p>I think I might need to turn to a classic like Don Quixote or The Count of Monte Cristo next to truly satisfy my literary cravings.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Waste_Project_7864\"> /u/Waste_Project_7864 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1k0",

If you read a lot of books by African, especially Nigerian authors, you realize that the same sort of characters pop up in books. That was how I felt in the first 100 pages. I felt I had seen similar characters and relationship dynamics before and that made it hard for me to go through the book at first, but I was still interested. </p> <p>In addition to that, I found the way Adichie wrote the men in the book very interesting. She has a way of writing men and their relationships with women. I&#39;m not saying she writes men in the same light, but the more you read her books, t",
