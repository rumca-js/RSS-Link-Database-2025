Some equivalent of alt-tabbing is what I am looking for. </p> <p>For some I can force them small by using the fullscreen key. Some, I can send to another desktop. Others ignore that at all. Some catch my mouse, so even though they are small, it is hard to use the mouse in any other window. </p> <p>Any good tricks?

I&#39;m running the latest arch kernel (6.14.2) btw.</p> <p>The issue though is that after a not so long gaming session (30-45 mins in average) with awesome FPS the system just slows down (card GPU clock goes down, power draw as well, etc.) and I go from 140FPS to an unusable choppy performance. If I close the game entirely and re-launch it, it works fine for another 30-45 mins.</p> <p>It doesn&#39;t seem to be the game, since its the card that slows down completely (you can see it clearly on LACT if left monitoring).</p> <p>Has anyone experienced this?

I am trying to run a few games using gamescope in order to use HDR but when I run the game, my mouse isn&#39;t bound to the window and moves to other monitors. I tried using --force-grab-capture but I had the same results. When I don&#39;t use gamescope, the mouse is captured. I was trying to use gamescope with gnome (also on wayland) and while I was testing, I don&#39;t remember running into this issue. I have tried a few different launch options but I will leave below my latest that I was testing with along other specs.
