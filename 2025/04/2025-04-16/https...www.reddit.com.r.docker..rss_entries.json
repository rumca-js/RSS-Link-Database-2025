It makes spinning up open-source LLMs locally <em>so easy</em>.</p> <p>So I recorded a quick walkthrough video showing how to get started:</p> <p>\ud83c\udfa5 <strong>Video Guid</strong>e: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH_vdF2iGdo\">Check it here</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/model-runner\">Docs</a></p> <p>If you\u2019re building AI apps, working on agents, or just want to run models locally, this is definitely worth a look. It fits right into any existing Docker setup too.</p> <p>Would love to hear if others are experimenting with it or have favorite local LLMs worth trying!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",

The problem I am having is after around 20 browser opens and closes, the Docker container itself can&#39;t do any more scraping and times out.</p> <p>So my question was: I was wondering how should I optimize it?</p> <p>Should I give it more RAM when running Docker? I only have 4 GB of RAM on this (ubuntu) VPS.</p> <p>Or add a way to reset the Docker container after every 20 runs, but wouldn&#39;t that be too much load on the server?
