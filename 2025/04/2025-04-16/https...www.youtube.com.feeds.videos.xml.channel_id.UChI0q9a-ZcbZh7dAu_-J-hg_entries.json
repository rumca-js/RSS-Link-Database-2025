        "description": "As the US grapples with apparent financial corruption at the highest level of politics, todays video examines the topic of insider trading, presidential pardons, and general malpractice in the world of public service. \n\nLeft, Right and Center... no sector is immune to the problem, with politicians on either side of the aisle enriching themselves with seemingly nothing ever done to stop it. When the governing public servants are able to become Deca millionaires with reliable predictability, it requires questions to be asked about what their true priorities are... and whether or not that money is influencing their behavior. My assertion is yes. It is. \n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https://linktr.ee/upperechelonsecurity\n\n\n\nODYSEE INVITE: https://odysee.com/$/inv",
