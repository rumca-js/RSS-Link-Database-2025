Yoshida praised Nintendo and called the reveal a smart move, citing the new hybrid's technical advantages over the Switch 1. But he also said Nintendo seems to be losing their identity, and called out the Switch 2 for maybe not being the go-to platform for third-party games. In related news, Mario Kart World is getting a dedicated Nintendo Direct tomorrow morning, so join us on IGN.com for a special episode of Nintendo Voice Chat. And finally, Doom: The Dark Ages drops next month, and in addition to the game, you can also preorder new Doom-branded Xbox controllers, both in standard and Elite edition.

Bernthal makes his long-awaited return in Episode 4, as the series follows up on a huge cliffhanger involving White Tiger (Kamar de los Reyes) being shot dead by a vigilante wearing the Punisher skull. That episode answered the burning question of whether it was actually Frank who killed White Tiger, but that\u2019s just the beginning of the show\u2019s dramatic new Punisher storyline.\n\nBernthal\u2019s character returns in the dramatic Season 1 finale, where he teams up with Charlie Cox\u2019s Matt Murdock to take on an army of corrupt NYPD officers all proudly wearing the Punisher emblem. Frank Castle makes his stand, and he leaves no uncertainty regarding how he feels about his image being co-opted by those sworn to uphold the law.\n\nBernthal\u2019s return is exciting for any number of reasons, but the biggest by far is that Marvel has found a strangely perfect antagoni",

        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster that's one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming these days just got an unofficial step closer to being announced. Images from the game were posted to developer Virtuos' website, and quickly spread on Reddit. Virtuos then took the images down (and probably their whole site, as it remained mostly unaccesible for the day), without any comment. The remaster was first revealed during the Microsoft vs FTC trial a few years ago, but it was never officially announced. In other news, fans of Dune who are already hyped for the long-awaited MMO Dune: Awakening, may have to wait a little longer. Feedback during the game's beta period is prompting some extra development time, and the release date has been pushed to June 10. And finally, the chicken jockey may have just saved cinema, as A Minecraft Movie has crossed the $500 million mark at the global box office. The movie could very well be 2025's first billion-dollar hit.",
