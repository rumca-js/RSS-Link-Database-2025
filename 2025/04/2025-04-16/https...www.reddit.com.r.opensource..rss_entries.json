It all runs locally but it also supports a server mode.</p> <p><strong>Key features</strong>: - Understands code at a conceptual level using local ONNX models (no API dependency) - Syntax-aware parsing for Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, YAML, and Markdown - Multi-repository and branch-aware indexing - Search using natural language queries like &quot;how do we handle authentication errors?&quot; and it will retrieve the most relevant code snippets - GPU acceleration on Linux (CUDA) and Mac (Metal)</p> <p>I built this with Cursor in about 2\u00bd weeks with help from Claude 3.7 and Gemini 2.5, writing approximately",
