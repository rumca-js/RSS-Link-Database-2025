This lightning talk highlights how C++ can play a crucial role in optimizing cloud services, especially when integrating existing C/C++ libraries within an Elixir-based environment. Although Elixir excels in scalability, performance bottlenecks can arise when interacting heavily with native libraries. Instead of rewriting the functionalities in Elixir, leveraging the power of existing C++ libraries through Native Implemented Functions (NIFs) offers a compelling solution.\nThis presentation showcases how C++ can overcome these performance challenges, enhancing cloud applications while preserving the efficiency of well-established libraries. The talk underscores the importance of C++ in modern cloud ecosystems, even in domains typically dominated by other languages.\n---\n",
