They don\u2019t necessarily need to be oppositional to the extent of Frieren, but enough to cause confusion by someone of different species. The link above goes into more detail on exactly what.

It felt like this book had EVERYTHING, even at 800 pages, that\u2019s bloody impressive.

I have recently been seeking good fantasy books that are <em>not</em> about war, do not feature war, and do not use war as the stakes (so not &#39;if we don&#39;t save the princess, our kingdoms go to war!&#39;).</p> <p>But I also don&#39;t want any &quot;cozy&quot; stories or mellow ones. I still want important and fairly consequential stakes, danger and adventure and such, just specifically curious to read books without war as a key component. (nothing against it actually, I even enjoy it sometimes, but I just am in the mood for something else).</p> <p>My other tastes include:</p> <ul> <li>Focus on adventure and friendship</li> <li>Minimal romance or exceptionally good romance (or romance that isn&#39;t the sole focus)</li> <li>Any other fantasy tropes are fine (chosen one, magic, royalty, etc)</li> <li>Can be human or fantasy races or xeno</li> <li>Angst is a good bonus if the ending is relatively not grim</li> <li>A nobledark or at",

But when I read fantasy, AN ACTUAL SERIES, suggested by a friend from my book club, it had my more of my attention as compared to thriller. I assumed it was because of the adventures, but in crime and thriller, nearly everything is an adventure. I can&#39;t seem to pinpoint exactly which element it is that holds readers. Even children. The world&#39;s bestsellers are in fantasy- THRONE OF GLASS, GAME OF THRONES, HARRY POTTER and many more.
