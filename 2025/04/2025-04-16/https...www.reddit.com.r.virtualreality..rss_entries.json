My only real complaint with the image is the strong chromatic aberration around the periphery, which feels like more of a cost saving measure than a limitation of grinding the glass to shape. Setting the IPD manually was finicky at first but once it was set right I didn&#39;t have to worry about it again.</p> <p>The overall weight of the headset was heavier than I initially expected (~1 kg) but after some time breaking it in and getting used to wearing a VR headset I am now abl",

The remaster is using Unreal Engine for rendering graphics while still running gameplay and physics on the Gamebryo/Creation Engine. </p> <p>Personally, I&#39;m 80% sure the VR injection will work out of the box, if not I have faith in praydog and other VR modders to tweak things up. Still, it&#39;ll take some time before someone makes a UEVR profile for motion controls and other stuff, that part might not even be doable depending on how this weird mixture of engines work. Whatever we end up getting I&#39;m super excited to experience the magic of Oblivion in VR!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/uniquecartridge\"> /u/uniquecartridge </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1k0crux/the_elder_scrolls_oblivion_remaster",
