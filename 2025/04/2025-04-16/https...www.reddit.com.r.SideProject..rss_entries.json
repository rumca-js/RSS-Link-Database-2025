I&#39;ve been hitting the gym a while now and I&#39;m way too lazy to keep writing down my reps with the week&#39;s day and all that. Plus, I had a hard time knowing if I was really improving or not, so I checked out some apps for help\u2014but most them were super expensive, either because they threw in stuff I didn&#39;t want like nutrition or just charged way too much for what they offered. So, I teamed up with a friend to create a website that we could use at the gym\u2014something easy to use overall. The site is called <a href=\"https://www.gymbenchmark.com/\">gymbenchmark</a> in case anyone finds it useful. It&#39;s nothing fancy since it doesn&#39;t have a ton features, but it does exactly what we wanted: it&#39;s simple, nice, and comfortable to use. And cheap ahsshaasas. If anyone gives it a try, we&#39;d really appreciate some feedback to improve it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",
