I can&#39;t exactly define what that vibe <em>is</em>, but I find it insanely immersive and heart-rending. Maybe it&#39;s all about seeing a recognizable world go to shit in a way that most apocalypse stories kind of skip over?

She said she wants to give reading a try, we did Libby for a bit but she needs a physical copy to read. What book would you recommend for someone who\u2019s getting back into reading?

I have been aware of the problems academia faces - particularly wrong incentive structures, the publish and perish culture, irreprodcibility of research, irrelevancy even when the research is reproducible and so on and so forth. I have also been fortunate to be under the mentorship of professors who acknowledge these issues and try to work around them. However, many of the efforts feel a bit isolated from each other and perhaps without a common framework or manifesto. There seem multiple islands of good scientists who want to look outside the blinders provided by the academic career. I wonder if anyone has composed together a manifesto or a document that addresses how academia or science should improve as a field and the role of individuals in it. The closest that comes to mind are philosophers of science. </p> <p>The other way of life is to take up a regular job that is hopefully directly relevant and contributing to",

He needed me a lot and I unfortunately didn&#39;t realize how bad she was struggling too because she wasn&#39;t vocal like he was. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been having a hard time getting along with her when she reminds me a lot of my ex and she still feels neglected and I&#39;m trying to fix all of this. She knows she can count on me but when we argue, we ARGUE, and it gets bad. We both say a lot of hateful things and it&#39;s so unhealthy. I&#39;m accepting the blame for all of it ",
