I knew it&#39;s a little bit strange, but when I was kid, we with my older sister had a one favourite game about family&#39;s adventures. I don&#39;t remember how this game called, so if someone played or remember please help. The game is a 2D platformer with a story about a family. There is a mission where you as a mom of the family have to run through a store with a shopping cart, and the store has an elevator and three or four floors. Then there&#39;s a mission where you play as the son, who is swimming underwater (if i remember right, he was swimming underwater because they car sink). At the end of the game, in the jungle, the father of the family is kidnapped by a large,big and bulky gorilla or another monkey, and the son runs across the map with this gorilla at the background. The game has a side-scrolling camera. I don&#39;t remember platform. I have a lot of memories about that times and i remember that game makes me feel happy",

There&#39;s rising lava from underneath and you have to move across platforms and move upwards to escape the lava. It&#39;s an upward scrolling game (as I remember). As I remember you can fight evil creatures or bad guys (can&#39;t exactly remember what they are) and also save people from the rising lava (I think). The character is a male. Not much details cuz it&#39;s pixel style. But the game didn&#39;t have a simple look. It has a lot of elements like trees, buildings and people and stuff. I had to move up (also left and right from one end to the other), jumping and moving over things. I THINK it had a kind of pipe organ kind of &#39;crisis&#39; vibe music. I THINK it was in like a Roman context or something. The rising lava, maybe because of a volcano eruption I don&#39;t know the story.</p> <p>Ah also this game had 2 modes. The playing one is the important one but it also had another",

I think older graphics have a charm to them which I love and I like gimmicks too but the problem is some things are just crazy expensive.
