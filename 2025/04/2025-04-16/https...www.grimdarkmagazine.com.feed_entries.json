        "description": "<p>Ooooh damn, A Promise of Blood doesn\u2019t just deliver on all the great potential that A Pocket of Lies promised, but it completely takes the Amefyre series to the next level. It gets bigger, darker, riskier, sexier, and even more cruelly twisted, and it\u2019s bleeding with the most exquisite tension, inner turmoil and emotional gut punches that just hurt oh so good. Now, if there\u2019s one thing we learned from book 1, it\u2019s that Suri seriously can\u2019t catch a break. After all the brutal trials and tribulations that she somehow managed to survive, she has now ended up in the legendary City of the Damned; the city under the rule of none other than our deliciously dark Fae Lord Kol, who believes her to be the key player in the prophecy that forespells his people\u2019s salvation. In other words, hello deadly high stakes, hello forced proximity, hello complicated feelings, and hello forbidden desires\u2026 let\u2019s goooo, I am so here for the drama!\u00a0 You know, I really liked these characters in A Pocket of Lie",
