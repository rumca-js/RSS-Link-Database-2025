I just received two brand new harddrives, some Seagate Barracude 4TB ones, and i have four used ones arriving, 2 of which are 4TB and 2 which are 2TB. </p> <p>I, however, missed that there is something called &quot;SMR&quot; and that its generally recommended against, even to the point of &quot;never use it&quot; when it comes to data hoarding contexts. As far as I&#39;m aware, all the incoming drives are SMR. I&#39;ll be returning to the store to see if I can exchange the newly bought ones for CMR, because I&#39;d rather have more durable and better drives for not too much more, but that still leaves ~12TB of storage that is SMR. </p> <p>Can I combine these in a setup for 1 to 1 mirror redundancy or something similar to that, or must they all be CMR. From what I can research, I think SMR should still be good enough, and will make a note to replace these with C",

Do I get a USB 3.2 at 10gbps or do I get USB 2.0/ 3.1 Gen 1 which does 5gbps for data transfer speeds?</h1> <p>For spinning 3.5&quot; HDDs I&#39;m sure thunderbolt 3 or 4 won&#39;t affect its max data transfer speeds. So I want to make sure I either buy a docking station for HDDs (DAS) that I get the proper equipment. Especially if I&#39;m only using it for HDDs backups.</p> <h1>2.</h1> <p>Also if I&#39;m buying another machine (docking station) for 2.5&quot; SSDs is it best to get thunderbolt 3 or 4 or will USB 3.2 -10gbps be suffice? I&#39;m sure the data transfer speeds for SSDs are much faster than spinning HDDs. So is 10gbps good for this or will 40gbps good for SSDs?</p> <p>Thanks for clarification and help!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ramir",
