Hackers got into their system, locked up a bunch of internal data and basically demanded a payout to release it. Thankfully they had emergency protocols and kept patient care going but the fact that something like this can hit a healthcare giant is... unsettling.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just them. Ransomware attacks are everywhere now hitting schools, small businesses, city governments and regular people. It\u2019s not just about losing files anymore. It\u2019s about disruption, trust and in cases like healthcare potentially risking lives.</p> <p>This stuff used to feel like it only happened to big companies with poor security. Now? It feels like everyone\u2019s a target.</p> <p>Anyway just thought ",
