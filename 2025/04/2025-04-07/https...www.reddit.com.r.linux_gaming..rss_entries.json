I&#39;ve observed that playing one game in particular (Stormgate to be precise) on Linux makes the light of the room actually lightly flicker, especially each time i press keyboard keys (the game being a RTS, the make key pressing makes it pretty obvious). Maybe it&#39;s happening with other games, i haven&#39;t noticed. However I don&#39;t think this is happening when i play the very same game over my Windows system. Can anyone think of an explanation? Does Linux OSs manage power differently? Does it manage power drains of GPUs differrently? I have absolutly no idea at all of what i should be considering. Any idea of tests i could conduct to investigate? </p> <p>Thanks,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/my1staccountonreddit\"> /u/my1staccountonreddit </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/l",

I was on Kubuntu 24.04 with no GPU and with a Ryzen 5600G and its integrated graphics. A friend of mine gift me its old MSI GTX 1060 3GB and i mounted it on my pc, fair and square, installed the drivers via <code>ubuntu-drivers</code> command. So it was NOT a clean system installation, because of course on my system there already were old AMD drivers for the integrated graphics of the CPU. Anyway, with this card i get incredibly low FPS on many games i could play without the dedicated GPU, like Hi-Fi Rush via Proton, for instance. I looked on the web for days, but nothing. With the Unigine Heaven test i get to about 88 FPS on average, but not on the games.</p> <p>Another suspicious thing is that my telegram desktop app started telling me that &quot;There may be a problem with your graphics drivers and OpenGL. Try updating your drivers. OpenGL has been disabled. Yo",
