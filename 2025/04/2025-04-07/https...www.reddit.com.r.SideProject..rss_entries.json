        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi All! I\u2019m thinking of building a <strong>Duolingo-style app for beginner investors</strong> \u2014 short, gamified lessons that teach investing fundamentals. Think 5-minute daily learning, quizzes, and streaks \u2014 no jargon, no stress.</p> <p>The goal: Help total beginners build real investing confidence without getting overwhelmed by Reddit threads, YouTube rabbit holes, or confusing terminology.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019m curious about:</p> <ul> <li>Would a product like this be helpful or interesting to you (or someone you know)?</li> <li>What\u2019s the biggest challenge you faced when first learning about investing?</li> <li>Are there tools out there you tried but didn\u2019t stick with? Why?</li> <li>Any concerns you&#39;d have using an app like this? (privacy, trust, usefulness, etc.)</li> <li>And if you could add ONE AI-powered feature \u2014 what would it be?</li> </ul> <p>I\u2019m still in the very early stages, so any thoughts, feedback, or brutal honesty is super appr",

It\u2019s a blueprint for post-work life \u2014 a decentralized system where AI helps coordinate meaningful human contributions, and everyone gets rewarded based on usefulness instead of job status. We&#39;re testing the foundations now, but the vision is much bigger.</p> <p>This is a side project I\u2019ve been working on for a while. For the first phase, the idea is to coordinate small, useful tasks and pay people fairly for doing them \u2014 no resume or job title needed.</p> <p>I wanted to test: Can you build a dignity-first alternative to work that\u2019s lightweight, transparent, and actually helpful?</p> <p>There\u2019s a prototype running now. You sign up, get a small useful task, and get paid. Tasks are short and flexible.</p> <p>Would love any feedback \u2014 on the concept, UX, trust, or anything else. I\u2019m genuinely trying to build something people would want to use.</p",
