        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a crowdfunding campaign for the black teen who stabbed a white kid to death has now raised well over $150,000. People are rallying around him and giving him money because he killed a white kid. What does that tell us about the culture? We\u2019ll discuss. Also, more anti-Trump and anti-Elon protests over the weekend\u2014we\u2019ll check out the highlights. A bipartisan group of women in Congress has been fighting for the right to work from home, and it looks like they\u2019ll get their way. And for our Daily Cancelation, sadly, today I must cancel Megyn Kelly. \n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:29 Opening\n02:11 - 15:48 Black Teen Raises Thousands In Fundraiser After Killing White Student\n17:13 - 26:53 Hundreds Of \"Hands-Off\" Protests Occurred This Weekend\n26:54 - 35:46 Representatives Continue Advocating For Accommodations For Mothers\n35:47 - 41:42 DoorDasher Attempting To Help Homeless Man Gets Stabbed\n42:13 - 1:02:58 Megyn Kelly Is Canceled\n\nEp.1570\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://x.com/ThePa",
