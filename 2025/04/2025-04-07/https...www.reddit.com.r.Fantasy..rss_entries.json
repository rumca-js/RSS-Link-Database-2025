There is also stuff like Going Postal by Pratchett or Paladin&#39;s Grace by T. Kingfisher. I don&#39;t read a lot of this type of stuff, but after reading Paladin&#39;s Grace, I found myself at a loss in trying to explain this sub-genre to my husband. All I could say was &quot;low-stakes,&quot; but I figured there had to be another name for the genre</p> <p>The best I can think of is &quot;cozy fantasy,&quot; like the term people use for video games a lot--many of which take place in a fantasy setting. </p> <p>So, when it isn&#39;t epic, what is this sub genre called?

They live on the edge between worlds, both in terms of where they live and the nature of their livelihood. Though they\u2019re as close as sisters can be, it\u2019s pretty clear that a divergence is coming at some point: Esther is drawn in her heart to the Fairy lands, and Ysabel is drawn towards the mortal world.</p> <p>The plot of the story (without giving away spoilers) centers on the two suitors of Esther, the elder sister. One is their neighbor; a marriage would unify their two properties, to the increased prosperity at all. A very sensible, solid match.

These are all very different books of course, but all older works have a marked similarity in overall tone. What do you all think? Is it due to the writing style, language use, and dialogue?

I&#39;d heard lots of good things about it and seen it recommended multiple times so I thought I&#39;d give it a shot. </p> <p>The story follows an elf known as Tamsin who wakes up back in his homeland after thousands of years of war Over the Waves. We get to follow him as he journeys towards his home and on the way we learn about his life and what happened during the war.</p> <p>The first three chapters were very slow and repetitive, but after that it picked up the pace somewhat and I got invested in Tamsin&#39;s story. Unfortunately, the story went back to a snail&#39;s pace shortly after. This is a very slow and philosophical story and you shouldn&#39;t read it if you prefer books that are plot focused. There were glimpses of story that kept me invested, but for the most part, the plot dragged. </p> <p>There are two parallell storylines but not much happens in eith",

The later books absolutely improve, and characters like Manon, Elide, and Dorian became real highlights for me. But I still can\u2019t get past how rough the first two books are, especially in how Celaena is written. The disconnect between how the story describes her (world-class assassin, cunning, feared) and how she acts (impulsive, shallow, repeatedly outplayed) has always felt like a major flaw.</p> <p>What I\u2019ve noticed is that a lot of fans seem to acknowledge those early issues, but still encourage new readers to push through them.

Looking back, that probably should\u2019ve been my first warning sign, especially since I kept seeing people call it one of his best.</p> <p>From there, I decided the most consistent way to dive into his universe would be to read his works roughly in release order, so I could follow the progression and (hopefully) see steady improvement. So next up was The Blade Itself. I\u2019d read online that it\u2019s his first published novel and that I shouldn\u2019t expect too much, so I went in with lowered expectations. ",

Description below!</p> <hr/> <p>AWARD-WINNING CHILDREN&#39;S FANTASY NOVEL What would you do if you met Death face to face? Death guides usually have rather normal names like John, Mary, Harry, and Jessica. And even ones not quite so normal, like Bartholomew or Ambrosia. They also have the most interesting tales behind their deaths. But one particular death guide has a few problems: she cannot remember her name or the details of her demise, and thus has no story of her own. One fateful night, she meets a young girl that may change her death forever. Inspired by the works of Tim Burton, and in the style of Children&#39;s tales of old, The Death of Death is a tragic, yet sweet little tale about loss and acceptance. Suitable for ages 12 ",

He\u2019s currently watching a pack of wolves on his own while Fitz journeys to find Verity after his plan to assassinate Regal falls through. I\u2019m so terrified of this wolf dying :( I\u2019m also thoroughly convinced Molly is pregnant with Fitz\u2019s baby when she left, so he has a kid. And I\u2019m puzzling out a theory that the pocked man, Chade, also has another identity that we know, besides Lady Thyme. </p> <p>Anyways- anyone with any theories up to this point in the series or other series recs that are similar! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DwaneSchrute\"> /u/DwaneSchrute </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jtbd18/just_started_book_3_of_the_assassins_apprentice/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jtbd18/just_started_book_3_of_the_assassins_appr",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Feed, by M.T. Anderson, is a 2002 YA Sci-fi/Dystopian that warns the dangers of capitalism and letting ourselves become the product. The concept may feel a little less fresh than it did in 2002, but Anderson did a great job with the relationship at the center of the story, and I was unexpectedly moved by it and admired how he didn&#39;t shy away from making his main character complicated and somewhat unlikeable. This was a quick read and would recommend for any YA dystopian fans or genre completionists. </p> <p><strong>Rating: 3.5/5</strong> </p> <p><strong>Bingo categories:</strong><br/> Down with the System (hm)<br/> A Book in Parts (hm - 4 parts)<br/> Small Press (normal)<br/> Biopunk (normal)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/P0PSTART\"> /u/P0PSTART </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1jtaz38/2025_bingo_review_feed/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://",

I\u2019ve found I enjoy series with a first person perspective, preferably with a likeable or relatable main character.</p> <p>While I\u2019m still sussing out the elements that make a fun reading experience for me, maybe I can narrow it down by listing series I have enjoyed. In no particular order:</p> <p>The Inda series by Sherwood Smith The Taltos series by Steven Brust Kings of the Wyld series by Nicholas Eames Shattered Sigil series by Courtney Schafer The Chronicles of Osreth series by Katherine Addison (though I enjoyed most the first book, \u201cThe Goblin Emperor\u201d) Jig the Goblin series, by Jim Hines</p> <p>I hope this helps. Bonus points if it\u2019s available on Kindle!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Due_Dependent_6514\"> /u/Due_Dependent_6514 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
