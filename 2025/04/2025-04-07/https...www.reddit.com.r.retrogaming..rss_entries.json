Its a PS1 game. The cover and CD both had an evil tomato on them. the cd was silver-ish and the art on it had a blue hue. The evil tomato in question looked a little bit like the yugioh card &quot;Mystic Tomato&quot;. Sadly i dont have any more information since i couldn&#39;t play the game for long, because the CD scratched.
