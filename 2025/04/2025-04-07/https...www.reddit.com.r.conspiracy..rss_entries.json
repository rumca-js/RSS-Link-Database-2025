Not to mention all of the water works and scat situations as well for adults. How is this normal or acceptable? Again, I understand to a degree of course it&#39;s art and it&#39;s all fictional, but I truly have to wonder why he entertained these themes so consistently. </p> <p>I started down this rabbit hole with him when I started examining a lot of Stanley Kubrick ",

Then came the push for smoking bans. It was said that second hand smoke was an inherent danger to everyone, basically mustard gas and it was vital we kick smoking out of polite society. Smokers were ostracized, cigarette taxes sky rocketed, one couldn\u2019t even smoke in certain areas outside. Then it comes out that in the most recent studies proclaimed even in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute that the case made of the dangers of second hand smoke were false and exaggerated to push the anti smoking agenda.
