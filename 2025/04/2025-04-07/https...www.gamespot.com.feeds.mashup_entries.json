In practice, players must navigate this manor, solving the puzzles within each room before deciding which one to go into next. It has a roguelike structure, so the rooms within the manor reset each day and can slowly be upgraded over time depending on the player's actions. You might not have heard of Blue Prince before because it's an indie first-person puzzle game. That said, critics love its experimental structure and are heaping it with praise.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goj5usM4tGM\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\">          <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Goj5usM4tGM\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfu",
