My primary usage is strictly for Passkeys and SSH keys, so these are the features I focused on the most. I tried to be as thorough as possible with my research. The article includes how Linux \u201csee\u2019s\u201d the keys, each key&#39;s build quality, and how SSH keys are stored on the device. For example, does it support SSH? If it does, does it support ECDSA and/or ED25519? It\u2019s a pretty nerdy article, but hopefully, some of you find it useful. </p> <p><a href=\"https://blog.k9.io/p/key9-the-2025-security-key-shootout\">https://blog.k9.io/p/key9-the-2025-security-key-shootout</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Top-Word6656\"> /u/Top-Word6656 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1jtxhtr/2025_security_key_shootout_yubikey_trustkey_etc/\">[link]</a></span> ",

I am currently leveraging Mend to do code vulnerability scanning and the platform gives you the opportunity to select CVSS 3.0 or CVSS 4.0. Based on what I&#39;ve read, in order to stay ahead of the industry and because we are starting with a fresh, ground up security program, I thought it would be best to tailor all thing towards the latest standard of CVSS 4.0.</p> <p>While running the program, I leverage both the UI and reports and it came to my attention that in certain circumstances the reports issued different CVSS scores from the UI. When I submitted a support request to Mend, they claimed that this was an expected behavior as the UI can show data based on CVSS 3.0 or CVSS 4.0 but the reports will only generate information based on CVSS 3.",

Just as frequently as I see these phrases, I see people giving useful resources such as tryhackme, hackthebox, etc. In all those helpful resources, they cover the fundamentals. Aside from customer service experience, why is it that people are constantly being told to work helpdesk or that they don&#39;t understand the fundamentals or what theybare securing until they&#39;ve worked helpdesk for a year? What do you guys feel is lacking from the tracts on tryhackme, hackthebox, blueteam lvl 1, etc. I guess you could say the theory is different than actually doing the jobs, but there&#39;s a ton of helpdesk roles where resetting passwords are the closest thing ",
