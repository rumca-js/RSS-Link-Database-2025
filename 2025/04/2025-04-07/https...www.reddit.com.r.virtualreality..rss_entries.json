Essentially, a head-on big screen inside a visor. Other options like multiple screens floating in a virtual space could also work, but its not necessary. Doesn&#39;t need to be able to use any sort of 3d/VR software, games, etc. Just display a screen</p> <p>It&#39;s got to be able to work with an android smartphone. </p> <p>The option that stands out to me so far is the PSVR1 headset. Use the hdmi in port with a USBC-to-HDMI from the phone.</p> <p>Cheap used, HDMI compatible, bonus points that I have a PS4 in case I wanted to try it.</p> <p>Does anyone here see a reason this <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> work?

Even today, I was trying to record a video with my friends and every time I tried to load into VR chat, It would freeze. Then uninstalled reinstalled, but the quest would legitimately not let me download PCVR until I restarted and only when I left my party voice chat. I Had similar issues with Rec room, and have had countless others, mind you all with stand alone. I&#39;ve tried both wired and air linked PCVR with quest 3 and I&#39;ve consistently either lost connection, been bricked out of being able to get into any game, or just have such a crappy experience that I lose all will to try to record before I get started. Long winded way of saying, I&#39;m trying to find a good PCVR only headset to basically just do what I need to on PC and not have to deal with linking over Bluetooth or wifi, or have to struggle constantly. Any suggestions? Thanks ahead of time!</p> <",
