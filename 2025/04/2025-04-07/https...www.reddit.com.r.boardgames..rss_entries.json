The game itself took about 10 minutes to play and was 2 vs 2. The winners of the game would move to the next highest table and the losers would stay. If you lost at the &quot;king&quot; table, you restart at the bottom. Every round, partners would switch, so you&#39;d never be with the same person twice. I loved the way this fostered interaction between people and was a fun icebreaker, but I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the game itself since it was much too random for my taste, relying very heavily on the luck of the draw.</p> <p>Are there any other good games that fit this format? Take under 15 minutes to set up and play, and are 2 vs 2?</p> <p>For example, though not a board game, foosball would fit this requirement, assuming we have a ton of foosball tables!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Phys",
