It makes sense, bearing in mind that the firm exited the console specs arms race with the Wii back in 2006. The pattern continues with <a data-keyword=\"true\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced\">Switch 2</a> and its core processor with only the Nvidia partnership confirmed and by extension, the fact that the new machine has both machine learning capabilities (hello, DLSS!) and hardware-accelerated ray tracing. So how much horsepower does the machine have? How does it compare to, say, PlayStation 4 or Steam Deck?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2-the-tech-specs-that-nintendo-and-nvid",

To a T begins with the young player character waking up in the morning before school and, first things first, needs to use the bathroom. Cue alarm bells, a sprint, and some awkward door opening before sweet relief accompanied by an orchestral chime.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-creators-to-a-t-is-full-of-colour-and-joy-but-is-also-a-serious-and-affecting-depiction-of-living-with-disability\">Read more</a></p>",
