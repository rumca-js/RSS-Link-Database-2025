        "description": "After skipping last year\u2019s game, the team at Milestone has pushed to reboot the Monster Energy Supercross series into the Unreal Engine 5 era. Does it succeed? Well, I wasn\u2019t particularly impressed, but it\u2019s not a complete dud either. One of the most notable additions are enhanced rut formations on the tracks. \n\nTracks change over time as more bikes ride across sections, forming deep ruts in corners. You feel the difference of these ruts in the loss of bike stability, adding some variety to laps. Unfortunately, the rigid rider movement is largely unchanged from past entries, and turning feels unintuitive and understeery.\n\nThe modes aren\u2019t anything to write home about, with a bare-bones track editor and a Career mode echoing the many EA sports titles over the decades. Still, with a sizable track lineup and better graphics than ever before, this supercross game may delight hardcore fans.",

        "description": "The DOOM timeline can be pretty confusing, especially with id Software having provided few official and concrete answers to the fanbase\u2019s many, many questions (and especially when you throw DOOM 3 into the mix, though that\u2019s a whole another can of worms)- which means that even though we have a rough idea of the upcoming DOOM: The Dark Ages\u2019 placement in the series\u2019 overarching timeline, there is still that we don\u2019t yet know in terms of the specifics. \n\nWe know that The Dark Ages will be set before 2016\u2019s soft reboot, and we know that it will cover an important part of the Doom Slayer\u2019s past- but in what other specific ways will it be tied to all of its predecessors?",
