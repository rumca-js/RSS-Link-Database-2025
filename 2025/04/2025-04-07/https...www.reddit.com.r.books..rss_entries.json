Like, there is something important about discussing his learnings, but i feel like that could have been done without horrific anecdote after horrific anecdote. As someone with some trauma, I find myself often heightened while listening, and can&#39;t imagine what it would do to survivors of SA, war, or other violence or abuse.

Even though I <em>might</em> have a couple stacks of unread books waiting for me. I was talking about this with my daughter and she said that it&#39;s because I already know the outcome of the books, there are no surprises, nothing to throw me off emotionally.</p> <p>One of my favorite authors to read when I feel like this is Anne Tyler. I&#39;m on Saint Maybe right now, finished Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant and The Accidental Tourist recently and just ordered The Clock Winder because my old copy seems to have disappeared. Tyler&#39;s storylines just comfort me, her style of writing is gentle and easy to follow, even when it&#39;s hard to concentrate.</p> <p>What are some of your favorite comfort reads?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/herbalhippie\"> /u/herbalhippie </a> ",
