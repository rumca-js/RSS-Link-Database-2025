Now here&#39;s why glomble is a great alternative:</p> <ol> <li><p>The recommendation system. Rather than letting some soulless algorithm that prioritises watch time over enjoyment pick videos for everyone separately, in glomble you can recommend videos yourself; if you watch a video you end up really enjoying you can press the recommend button to put it higher on the homepage. You get three uses of this button every eight hours and recommendation counts reset every week.</p></li> <li><p>No ads. Ads are one of the best ways to ruin a platform, only second to making the company publicly traded. Ads incentivises the platform to keep people on the site longer so they can get more money, this leads to promoting content based on time spent",

I&#39;m asking this because I couldn&#39;t find Pixel phone to buy here. either they are 128gb which is not enough to me or it&#39;s too expensive to buy.

They&#39;ve made it likely to happen only with root which required bootloader unlock which I won&#39;t do on a new phone. So seeking some other tips for privacy, like one is I&#39;m using TrackerControl app from F-Droid to block trackers from apps to system apps. The main component, <em>msa</em> (main system ads) cannot be controlled at all even with Shizuku nor TrackerControl does it.
