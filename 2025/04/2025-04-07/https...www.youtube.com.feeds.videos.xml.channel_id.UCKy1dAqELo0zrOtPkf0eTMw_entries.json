Unfortunately it hasn't all been glowing praise, with many criticizing Nintendo's decison to make Mario Kart World\u2014the Switch 2's headlining launch title\u2014a whopping $80 for the game itself. In an exclusive interview with IGN, Nintendo's Bill Trinen has explained why they think the game is worth the hefty price tag. In related news, it's been revealed that another Switch 2 launch title, Welcome Tour, will cost $10, which doesn't sound so bad at first, but many gamers think the game should have been a pack-in title with the system itself. And finally, in gaming-adjecent news, A Minecraft Movie has already broken box office records by having the biggest domestic opening weekend of any animated movie ever.",

Released on the Super Famicom by Bandai in 1993, Super But\u014dden features characters like Goku, Vegeta, Dr. Gero, Piccolo, Frieza, Android 16, Android 18, Cell, and more.\u00a0\n\nPlus, we spotted a rare Irwin Toy Super Size Warriors Vegito from the late '90s. Standing at 16 inches tall, the Super Size Warriors were some of the largest Dragon Ball figures ever produced.\n\nThanks so much to NHTSA for coming along on this ride, and for reminding us about the dangers of driving distracted.\u00a0 Collecting can be a fun hobby, but",
