Modern fantasy literature is rife with magic schools, but none as grim or as brutally dark as Khaw\u2019s Hellebore Technical Institute for the Gifted.

With a campus environment like that, it\u2019s no wonder that the primary means of student recruitment is through abduction. Although Hellebore promises its students a normal life after graduation, the school harbors a much darker secret: on graduation day, the faculty embark on a hungry rampage, feasting ravenously upon their students.

The ensemble cast is led by Alessa Li",
