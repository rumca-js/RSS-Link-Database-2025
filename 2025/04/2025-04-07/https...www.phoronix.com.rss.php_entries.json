While those numbers were positive, the Ubuntu 25.04 beta performance I am seeing on AMD EPYC 5th Gen \"Turin\" servers is even more exhilarating. As the first of a lot more Ubuntu 25.04 server benchmarks to come, today is a first look at the Ubuntu 25.04 beta performance on AMD EPYC 9005 compared to Ubuntu 24.10 and the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS releases.",
