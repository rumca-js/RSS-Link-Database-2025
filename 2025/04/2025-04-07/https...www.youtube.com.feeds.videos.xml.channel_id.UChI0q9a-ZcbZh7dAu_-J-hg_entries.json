        "description": "Contrary to my cynicism of the past, lately I find myself refreshingly hopeful that AI will not only fail to render portions of the YouTube content creator world obsolete, but it will specifically fail to replace or even threaten the niche that I personally operate in. \n\nSince AI strives to produce the most likely sequence of letters and words, it fails to make unique connections, and will struggle possibly forever to connect obscure dots of information and draw complicated conclusions afterward. Segmented data repositories, alignment concerns, and other restrictive measures being taken will help ensure that actual thought provoking YouTube content (hopefully) remains the realm of human creators for a long time to come. \n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_-J-hg/join\n\n\n\nNEW WEBSITE: https://upperechelon.gg/\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE CYBER SECURITY PRODUCT LIST: https:/",
