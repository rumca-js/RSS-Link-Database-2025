They have some strict anti bot protection and AWS WAF Captcha . I would like to grab a few thousand PDF files and i have the direct links, if i paste the link manually in to my browser it downloads and works. </p> <p>When i have tried using automation Selenium, beutuiful soup etc i just keep getting the same errors hitting the anti bot detection. </p> <p>I have even tried simulating opening the browser and typing things in. still not much joy either. Any ideas on how to approach this? I have considered using a rotaiting IP which i think will help but it doesnt seem to get me past the initial issue of the anti automation detection system.</p> <p>Thanks in adavance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Still_Steve1978\"> /u/Still_Steve1978 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http",
