But to program correctly, you have to understand a project\u2019s requirements. So you have to be technically minded. Usually, technically minded to the point that you have to know which APIs to call to acquire the information required for completing some task. So Anthropic has released MCP, which among other things, offers a standardized format for interacting with LLMs, all the way down to which APIs to use and what their parameters and return types are. Except now you have less control over how your code is called and you have no visibility into your code\u2019s failures, so you can\u2019t debug as well.

I suppose it&#39;s a matter of fine-tuning, but does that mean the developers had to train the model on pre-coded data such as \u201cgrandma phrases\u201d? And so on for many specific cases... So the generic training is relatively easy to achieve (put everything you&#39;ve got into the model), but for the fine tuning, the developers have to think of a LOT OF THINGS for the model to play its role correctly?</p> <p>Thanks f",
