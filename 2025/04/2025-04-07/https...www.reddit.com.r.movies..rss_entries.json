Both represent the industry way too well, especially the downward spiral. The ending was super well, to me it was super relatable. The desire to be great-to be just be so great that people will remember you even after 100 years. </p> <p>The ending to me was such- Neille and Manny wanted to be part of something great, something bigger than human life. This was their connection. For Manny, the dream ended because he chose to get away from the screen, or to put it better, found satisfaction off-screen. Manny, on the other hand, found herself in the spotlight. Her character was obsessed with attention. She, too, wanted greatness. When watching the film, Manny realized that while Neille might have died at 32, but was still alive in people&#39;s memories, so was Jack (Brad Pitt) He remember his words-maybe felt regret",

For example, each time I visited, she had made my favorite sandwich with the exact proportions of condiments and meats I preferred with absolutely no tomatoes anywhere nearby, purchased my favorite soda (she would never keep soda in her own fridge as she did not like it, so she always bough one fresh the day I visited), and have a selection of candies I liked (or at least which she remember I liked from when I was 5).

Yes it&#39;s a lot of physical gags. But... It&#39;s executed so well. I don&#39;t know how any of the actors filmed that movie with a straight face especially with any scene involving Brendan Frasier because he&#39;s so over the top. The humor as an adult is great because so much shit flew over my head as a kid. The 4th wall breaking is also great. I also didn&#39;t realize this was a Disney film and I can&#39;t believe they greenlit something that not only lampoons their own IP, but also has so many gags that would be normal in something like Scary Movie.</p> <p>All in all, if you&#39;re a mid 30s millennial like me you should wat",

This movie was a success based on Cruise alone. </p> <p>It was a Razzie winner but I can&#39;t help loving this movie. The soundtrack is great.</p> <p>That said, the plot was kind of crazy. The character Tom Cruise plays is so sure he\u2019ll take New York by storm even though he has no special skills and a minimal education. Then he goes on to believe he\u2019ll find wealth through bartending. We\u2019re people more naive in the 80s? Then, he finds love on cute Elisabeth Shue in Hawaii but dumps all of that so he can be a &quot;kept boy&quot; for horny older woman, Lisa Banes. Oh, and Bryan Brown romances Kelly Lynch and her string bikini. And Gina Gershon shows up. </p> <p>Any fans of Cocktail?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CinephileCrystal\"> /u/CinephileCrystal </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1jtnibd/cocktail_1988_juggling_beer_bottles_li",

Its ultimately revealed that everything is a virtual reality simulation and the &quot;wives&quot; are being held against their will. Frank, as it turns out, runs a misogynistic podcast, like Jordan Peterson or Matt Walsh. At the end of the film, he&#39;s stabbed by his &quot;wife&quot; Shelley, who calls him a stupid man. </p> <p>Now, my headcanon is that, in the real world, Shelley was a critic of Frank. She was a journalist or something and ran a Twitter account that countered his lies. He had her kidnapped and entered into the Victory simulation in order to both test the system and to have the satisfaction of making a woman who so utterly hated him into his adoring housewife. However, she quickly realized that Victory wasn&#39;t real. Rather than try to escape, she played up the role in order to destroy Frank",
