And a lot of the problems that it finds are issues in the body content which can mask more serious errors.</p> <p>So I write an <a href=\"https://www.rss.style/feed-analyzer.html\">RSS/Atom Feed Analyzer</a> that checks for things like headers, consistent links and backlinks.</p> <p>One of the (potentially) more controvesial things it recommends is using the content type &quot;text/xml&quot;. The normal recommendation causes the &quot;Save As&quot; dialog popup in some browsers, which is IMHO a horrible user experience.</p> <p>Anyhow, give it a try and let me know what you think! I also made a list of <a href=\"https://www.rss.style/#examples\">high-profile bloggers&#39; feeds that you can try",
