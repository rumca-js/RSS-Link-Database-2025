Can be firefox based or chromium based.<br/> Good sync capabilities (Brave sync is a pain copying codes across),<br/> less bloat (vivaldi stuff is too much for me)<br/> More or less similar UI across board<br/> And some theming, so it doesn&#39;t feel i&#39;m using a back box</p> <p>If there are any suggestions pls do let me know. I have tried all mainstream browsers and loved Arc but sadly they shut shop. Currently using brave. Was using vivaldi a bti ago, but I have several small issues with it.</p> <p>If only there was a way to use edge and completely remove all MS tracking, it would literally be perfect. Since I need to use PDFs a lot too.</p> <p>Thanks :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shadowdroid\"> /u/shadowdroid </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1jtc5tm/need_a_",

Plus, their interfaces and feature sets feel way more distinct.</p> <p>Brave, on the other hand, just feels like a Chrome clone. Strip out accessibility stuff, swap sync for a worse version, lock down toolbar customization, toss in an ad blocker, and then pile on all the crypto extras. To be fair, they\u2019ve added split view and vertical tabs, which Chrome still lacks. But overall, the two feel super similar.</p> <p>Am I off here?
