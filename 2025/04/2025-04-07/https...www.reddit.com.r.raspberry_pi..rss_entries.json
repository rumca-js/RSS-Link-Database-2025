My end goal is to be able to use the AI camera to detect a specific object and if that object is detected I basically get an alert. So far I have the alert part working. What I need assistance with is understanding how to get the objects detected by the camera and reference them in my code. I&#39;m not much of a programmer so I&#39;m learning as I go. I just cannot seem to find the resources for this which is why I&#39;m asking on here. For example, I want to detect a person. I turn on the camera and it detects me and says Person 78%. I can get that far, but I&#39;m just lost on how to actually grab that detection and work with it further.

Is it possible to create an image/iso of the preconfigured system (other stuff besides the nextcloud) so I could reset to that image anytime I fail to set up the application? </p> <p>With that question I was searching for a solution and found different answers, which I have tried but at the end I come to this moment to write this post.</p> <p>TLDR: I am searching for a convenient and easy solution to backup the entire system (firmware, settings, data etc.) which should be compatible with Linux Lite so I can always reinstall the clean/properly working state of the OS.</p> <p>Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/T",

I have a raspberry pi4b that i put a 7&quot; touch screen on. I have loaded Moode audio on it. I am using the hdmi 0 output into the back of my stereo receiver for audio. When i do this Moode will automatically change the resolution from 800 x 600 to 2720 x 1080. once i unplug the hdmi cable the resolution goes back to 800 x 600 and the touch screen works. I am not for sure which direction i should go in to resolve this issue. Should i use something like a usb to hdmi cable to get the audio into my receiver, or is there a way to force the resolution to stay at 800 x 600 when the hdmi is plugged in? I have also thought of putting a DAC hat on the PI, but the touch screen case i have would not allow me to put the cover and fan back on then, and would not look as clean. I appreciate any advice on this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",

I wanted to share a bit about my final year project and seek your suggestions to enhance it. I\u2019m a final year student in Computer Systems Engineering, and for my project, I\u2019m working with two Raspberry Pi Pico boards. I\u2019ve set them up on a breadboard with several sensors, including an LDR, a few LED lights, and a BME680 sensor. I\u2019ve also configured HiveMQ for messaging and set up a cloud database for data storage. For visualization, I\u2019m using Grafana, and I\u2019m pleased to say that everything is functioning well so far. However, I feel that my project isn\u2019t quite at the dissertation level yet. I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or ideas on how I can improve it or add more features. Thank you in advance for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ShineOk15\"> /u/ShineOk15 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jt8",

She is very intelligent for her age and she regularly bugs me to use Khan Academy for kids. I thought I would build her a little cute Raspberry Pi system for her bedroom so she can learn to code. I assume I will need windows or some sort of operating system so she can go through the traditional websites to do that eg. Scratch, <a href=\"http://Code.org\">Code.org</a> and blocky games as an example.<br/> I am also a Bitcoin head and I plan to run a node on it 24/7 to support the network!<br/> I&#39;ve got no idea what I need to add to the shopping list. I am based in Australia! Any guidance much appreciated.<br/> Thank you :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/uniqueheadstructure\"> /u/uniqueheadstructure </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1jt8tic/need_some_help_for_my_daughter_please/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>",
