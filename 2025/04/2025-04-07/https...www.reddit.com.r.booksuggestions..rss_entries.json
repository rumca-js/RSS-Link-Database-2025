I read The Stranger by Albert Camus because my brother recommended it, and I actually really liked it. It took me like 3 months to finish (apparently that\u2019s a long time considering it\u2019s a short book lol). After that, I tried reading The Plague by the same author but gave up &#39;cause I found it super boring. Then I tried Mrs Dalloway by Virginia Woolf but ended up quitting too because the language was kinda hard to follow. I always do this - I start a book and then give up &#39;cause I feel like I need to have read a bunch of other books first before I can read something considered \u2018difficult\u2019.

I don&#39;t read, I stopped years ago because I guess I just lost interest in everything that was available to me. My friends had me read this book and i could not put it down. Most past posts I&#39;ve seen on here about this book have been about the flowy prose and I honestly could care less about it, I just really loved how it all unfolded. I treated reading it like some sort of logic puzzle, trying to catch each reference, allusion, and potential clue that could mean SOMETHING even though I had no idea how it would end. I ended up figuring out a lot of big parts of the ending with zero spoilers and it felt really fun and rewarding! The unconventional way the narrative was presented and romance were cool but not a make or break. I just like that it made me think in a way that didnt feel like a chore and really compelled me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
