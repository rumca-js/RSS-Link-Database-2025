It&#39;s really nice simply as a manager and I can quickly click a button in the interface to email to Kindle. It also has the added benefit of being able to read from web if I would like.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something that can do all of the above, but also lets me search within the ebook, and ideally, across multiple ebooks. So if I want to find any ebooks that contain the word &quot;randomword&quot; - I can find hits to that. Unfortunately Kavita can&#39;t even search within a single ebook and I have to use an ereader on my mobile device to do so.</p> <p>Any ideas?

I pointed the cloudflare tunnel to npm (localhost:80), and npm set up to redirect the various subdomains to the differetn web apps. But it got me wondering, what is the point now of using npm, as opposed to just having the tunnel connect to the various docker containers?
