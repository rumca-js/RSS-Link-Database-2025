Today, Amazon is offering Alienware\u2019s brand-new 27-inch 4K OLED <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-QD-OLED-AW2725Q-Gaming-Monitor/dp/B0F148HG5M/\">for just $749.99</a>. That\u2019s $150 off, only a month after it launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the full scoop on the Alienware AW2725Q, <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2640120/alienware-aw2725q-monitor-review.html\">check out Matt Smith\u2019s review on PCWorld</a>. Long story short, it uses an eye-popping OLED panel, super-fast at 240Hz and thus suitable for intense multiplayer games, and already smaller and cheaper than many alternatives at its original $900 price. The lack of USB-C video is a bit of a bumm",

But to miss the chaos unfolding from the Trump regime\u2019s massive tariffs, you\u2019d have to be living under a rock, under a penguin, on an uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean. The current owner of Vaio is leveraging this chaos to sell a few \u201ctariff free\u201d laptops. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the first point: Yes, Vaio (stylized VAIO) laptops are still a thing, originally launched by Sony back in 1996 but spun off into an independent Japanese manufacturer when Sony exited the laptop business <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/443738/sony-sheds-vaio-pc-business-turns-tv-unit-into-subsidiary.html\">about a decade ago</a>.
