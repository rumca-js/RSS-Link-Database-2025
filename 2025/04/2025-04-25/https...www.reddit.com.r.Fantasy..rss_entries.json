I really liked it at first, the wordbuilding was really interesting and the writing was good. But the part where he gets his father killed is so incredibly painful to read because of how it goes down. Not because of the emotion, but because of how unbelievably stupid the mc is. His father steps in for him in a fight to the death after MC insults a noble. Not only that, when his father gets his hand cut off, and the other guy was going to leave it at that, MC takes his father&#39;s sword and points it at the guy. This makes the guy kill his father because of the further insult. Then the idiot picks up the damn sword AGAIN and tries to attack the guy, and another person who was moved by the father&#39;s sacrifice keeps him from doing this and hurts his own reputation.

I am glad I read Malazan first it just makes me appreciate Black company even more. Considering it was published in 80\u2019s and had quite unique angle for a fantasy series being told from the perspective of mercenary group caught in nasty war between dark forces (who they serve ) and rebels (who are just little bit better than other side ), this series stood test of time and it\u2019s fresh as it was published today . Eriksen improved on every aspect of military camaraderie that Glen Cook established in Black Company but BC stands on its own and it is great series to be read and enjoyed.</p> <p>I am only 2 boo",

It seems the story is over, and I was deeply invested in the world and characters this saga had to offer.</p> <p>Are there any other series out there like this? I&#39;m about to just reread the first 11 at this point because I liked them so much.</p> <p>If you have any recommendations I&#39;d love to hear them. I loved the fictional setting, the variety of creatures, the young love, the magic, the struggles, basically everything about the saga lol </p> <p>Thanks in advance.
