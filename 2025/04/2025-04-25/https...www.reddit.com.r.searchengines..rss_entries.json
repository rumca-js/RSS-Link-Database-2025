I am on a graduate visa but unable to find agencies or in house firms that offer sponsorship! I have worked with enterprise brands like Samsung, Starbucks, Kingfisher, Polaroid, Mars etc. but it&#39;s sad to see how your talent is limited by borders and your right to remain. I&#39;m also started to think that there are no SEO jobs with sponsorship in the UK. Is any one else in the same pickle as me? I&#39;m from an Asian country just for context.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PristineDay9164\"> /u/PristineDay9164 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1k7ywjs/help_uk_seo/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1k7ywjs/help_uk_seo/\">[comments]</a></span>",
