A minor documentation gripe, though, is\nthat the behavior around multithreaded compression is a bit unclear.\nI understand it's chunking the work and sending chunks to\ndifferent threads to parallelize the compression process, and this\nmeans that I should expect to see better use of threads on larger\nfiles because there are more chunks to spread around, but what is the\nrelationship?\n\n\n\n<p>\n\nWhen I look in <code>man zstd</code> I see that you can set\n<code>-B&lt;num&gt;</code> to specify the size of the chunks, and it's\ndocumented as \"<code>generally 4 * windowSize</code>\".  Except the\ndocumentation doesn't say how <code>windowSize</code> is set.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\nFrom a bit of poking at the source, it looks to me like the way this\nworks is that <co",
