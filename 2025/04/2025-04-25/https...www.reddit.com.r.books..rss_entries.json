My husband tends to think of &#39;literature&#39; and &#39;literary people&#39; as a club he doesn&#39;t belong to. What would you all say (specifically) makes John Irving novels, for example, literary, and George R. R. Martin novels not qualify as literature? My view is that literature is more subtle. Balanced subtlety allows for more individual interpretation so that readers can dig through the mine and find their own insights about how people think and behave, as it applies to their own life. Entertainment, on the other hand, is a cut-and-dry ride that doesn&#39;t make a reader pause and ponder.</p> <p>Penny for your collective pretty thoughts? No snark, please.

There were of course plenty of awesome suggestions, but <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> received more than double the upvotes of the next-highest upvoted novel, <em>Shogun</em>.

So tonight I got to finish the second book of the series &quot;Beyond The Blue Event Horizon&quot;.</p> <p>So now back with Robinette Broadhead, who was made rich from a Gateway mission which had also cost him the love of his life, as he bankrolls and expedition to a Heechee food factory that was found beyond Pluto&#39;s orbit, designed to graze a cometary cloud and turn its basic elements into large and untold amounts of food.</p> <p>He thought his own motives were simple enough: gambling on a likely breakthrough that could forever end famine, and make him the wealthiest man in all history. But his own tough minded wife knows that something else is driving her husband: the visions of his lost love, who is forever poised at the &quot;event horizon&quot; of a black hole where Broadhead had abandoned her.</p> <p>And with every single scrap",
