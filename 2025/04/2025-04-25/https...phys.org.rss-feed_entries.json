As the landers touch down and lift off from the moon, rocket exhaust plumes will affect the top layer of lunar \"soil,\" called regolith, on the moon. When the lander's engines ignite to decelerate prior to touchdown, they could create craters and instability in the area under the lander and send regolith particles flying at high speeds in various directions.",
