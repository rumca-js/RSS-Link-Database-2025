        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nCapcom thanked fans for 10 million gamers playing the Resident Evil 4 remake by posting a fun little video. However, some are seeing teases for Resident Evil 9 via a wooden sign in the video. Capcom has already confirmed a new mainline entry is in the works, but it might be a ways off. In other news, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is lighting up the sales charts, with around 500,000 copies sold in 24 hours. That's a great start for a new IP with a weird name, and it could be a huge franchise in the future, with a live-action movie already in the works. And finally, be careful when traveling with your cool\u2014probably expensive\u2014game merch. The TSA confiscated a Call of Duty Monkey Bomb from a passenger's check-in luggage, and reminded the public that replicas of weapons and explosives are not allowed on planes. No, the Monkey Bomb wasn't real, but still, the rules are the rules.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
