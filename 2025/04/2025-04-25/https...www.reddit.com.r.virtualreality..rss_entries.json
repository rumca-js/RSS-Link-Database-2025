Ideally i just wanted one for PC or I&#39;d try Standalone, but what&#39;s the difference? I&#39;m still a bit confused at what im looking for and whats the right fit, so what do people recommend to get? Originally i didn&#39;t want to be spending to much but they all seem a bit pricey anyways</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Low_Wave_1745\"> /u/Low_Wave_1745 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1k7xj5x/help_choosing_headset/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1k7xj5x/help_choosing_headset/\">[co",
