Then with the robot and that slow realization that 9000 series computer is a fucking killer to his slow mercy pleading death. No jumpscares or anything, just empty shots and crazy good cinema. Didn\u2019t think it was possible to convey such fear, eeriness, nothingness in such shots. Incredible and creepy. Then it just started getting even worse. Hallucination like extraterrestrial shots with colors and sound that make you feel like you\u2019ve gone insane. The occasional look of horror from the crew member as he is experiencing this is also DEEPLY unsettling. Then finally, the room. Was expecting a jumpscare but nothing. Just weird play with time and age. Extremely unsettling. </p> <p>Was expecting so",

Many audiences, misled by trailers, expected a gory man-vs-nature action movie. What they got instead was a quiet, brutal meditation on masculinity and meaning. Many left the film disappointed, and it suffered as a result. The thing is, this film is fantastic.</p> <p>On paper, the plot is simple. After a plane crash strands a group of oil workers in the remote Alaskan wilderness, the survivors try to make their way back to civilisation, all while being stalked by a relentless pack of wolves. However, instead of leaning into typical action thriller territory, The Grey trudges in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Read at <a href=\"https://theweeklywatch.substack.com/p/the-grey-deep-dive\">theweeklywatch.substack.com</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gstevens123\"> /u/gstevens123 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"",
