        "description": "At the end of the day, wherever you play Forza Horizon 5, you are in for a treat. From excellent gameplay to gorgeous vistas, Forza Horizon 5 still holds up remarkably well almost four years later. \n\nThe PS5 Pro version is clear the winner here thanks to its more powerful hardware but kudos to the development team for actually adding additional features for it. The PS5 version does a great job in holding up against the Xbox Series X version in terms of performance and image quality.\n \nForza Horizon 5 is a technical stunner on all major platforms and a must play for all racing fans.",

        "description": "With Post Trauma, developer Red Soul Games is trying to bring back a lost era of horror game designs by emphasising puzzle solving and fixed camera angles. The game tells the story of train conductor Roman, who mysteriously wakes up in a seemingly-abandoned train. \n\nThings quickly start getting even stranger, and Roman ends up trapped in what seems to be a series of nightmares. When it comes to its minute-to-minute gameplay, Post Trauma tends to do things right more often than wrong. \n\nThe fixed camera angles especially tend to make use of excellent framing to add even more tension to what might otherwise be a safe area, and this sense of dread is carried over excellently the further you get into the game. \n\nHowever, there are bouts of awkwardness when it comes to some of the puzzle design in the game, and the first-person gameplay segments often feel rote and uninspired.",

        "description": "Mods are the lifeblood of any new Elder Scrolls game or Bethesda title, and though The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is technically neither new nor developed by Bethesda Game Studios, the expectation for most people likely is for it to build up an extensive and active modding community over time. \n\nOf course, with the game having shadow dropped only recently, it's going to take some time for it to get to that point. But even though it's early days yet, Oblivion Remastered does already have several smaller-scale but solid PC mods available nonetheless. \n\nHere, we're going to talk about a few of the best mods you can get for the remastered open world action RPG on NexusMods.\n\nLinks to all mods:\n\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/35\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/48\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/58\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13\nhttps://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/72\nhttps://www.nexusmods.co",

        "description": "Against several odds, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered launched on April 22nd on Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC. The timing is somewhat conspicuous, especially since Bethesda officially announced and shadow-dropped the title on the same day. Nevertheless, it's caused a frenzy among longtime fans and newcomers.\n\nThe timing is also interesting due to the release of another anticipated title - Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Available just two days after Oblivion Remastered, it was touted as the major Game Pass release this month. As such, it felt a little counterintuitive to pit a much more well-known IP against it.\n\nRegardless, those who can make room for both or want to prioritize a newer experience must check out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It not only offers one of the experiences out there today but one of this year's best in gaming.",
