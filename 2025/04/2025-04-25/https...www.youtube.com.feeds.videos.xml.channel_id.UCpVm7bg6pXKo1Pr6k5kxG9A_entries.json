        "description": "Emmanuel Duverneau hosts a Haitian cook-off straight from his family\u2019s Sunday traditions. His aunt is cooking goat with rice and fried plantains, while his grandma brings her signature macaroni au gratin\u2014a cheesy, epis-infused dish that\u2019s always a hit at family gatherings. With no recipes in sight and generations of cooks in the kitchen, it\u2019s a battle of big flavors, a bit of dancing, and a lot of love.\n \nFood connects us all: bridging generations, cultures, and traditions. But as each generation changes, so do our recipes. \"\"Grandma Versus\"\" is a cooking competition where grandmothers face off against family members in a recipe swap challenge. What do we learn about our past and our future when we cook together? That\u2019s exactly what creators & foodies Lorena Abreu, Emmanuel Duverneau, and Ellen Park are going to find out.\n \nWatch more No Taste Like Home with Antoni Porowski here on Disney+: https://on.natgeo.com/3RysXU6\n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: http:/",
