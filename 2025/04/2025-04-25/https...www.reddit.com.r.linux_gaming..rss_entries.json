It seems like i&#39;m the only one with this problem. everyone who played the game had no issue like mine and every game that caused me trouble i was able to fix it. </p> <p>any help, pos",

Specifically, does FSR 4 work smoothly in native Linux games when using bleeding-edge setups like Mesa-git and Proton Experimental?</p> <p>Any insights or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!</p> <p>Thanks in advance, and have a great day or night, depending on your time zone! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikadini\"> /u/Mikadini </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1k7vhie/current_state_of_fsr_4/\">[link",

I also tried setting all resolutions the same and scaling to 100% which did nothing. If i turn the other monitors off, i can still move my mouse to the edge of the screen while in game that of course causes issues with looking different directions. Can anyone with experience with this give me some advice on where to go from here? I&#39;ll switch distros or whatever I need to do.
