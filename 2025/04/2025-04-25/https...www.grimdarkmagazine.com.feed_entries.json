        "description": "<p>A Claiming of Souls is finally here, and it\u2019s absolutely nothing short of suri-eal what R.A. Sandpiper accomplishes in this epic and soul-stirring conclusion to the Amefyre trilogy. Filled with equal parts action and emotion, love and loss, and heart and hurt, this is truly everything you could wish for from a grimdark romantic fantasy. After the intensely bittersweet ending of A Promise of Blood, I was beyond excited (okay, and quite nervous) to dive into the grand finale to Kol and Suri\u2019s story. In some ways, they are stronger than ever, yet at the same time things have never looked so dire for our precious broken babes; a soul has been taken, a prophecy remains unfulfilled, and a war comes ever closer to destroying all they know and love as threats both human and divine grow more deadly dangerous with each passing second. In other words, the stakes are high, the emotions run even higher, and absolutely zero punches are pulled. Honestly, it almost feels unreal how far we\u2019ve come ",
