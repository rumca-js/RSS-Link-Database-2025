Two years ago I finally took a look at my A500 8A and noticed the RAM expansion had a battery in there. It had been around 30 years so of course the battery was leaking. </p> <p>At the time, the board worked fine, so in a hurry, I just desoldered the RTC battery and checked it after. It still worked fine so I postponed the task of cleaning it to some future date. </p> <p>Well, the date has come, because upon checking now, when the expansion is switched on (original 90s switch hack), I get a green screen. The corrosion looks pretty bad but it did originally work. </p> <p>W",
