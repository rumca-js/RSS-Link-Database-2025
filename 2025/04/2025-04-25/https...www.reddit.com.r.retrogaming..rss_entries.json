        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So the backstory is that I was looking at the history of erotic software on the C64 console as while people back then though those days were over on the Atari 2600, the funny thing that it didn&#39;t stop some developers from wanting to make smutty software on the C64 as some examples include Stroker, a game about the protagonist just pleasuring himself, and then there was Sex Games, which as its title implies, is a game about letting the player control a naked couple.</p> <p>My point is that I just wanted to look back at those old days of gaming because I found it fascinating to see the stuff that game developers could get away with because there was no ESRB, which meant that game studios could basically have free will to do whatever they wanted when it came to obscenity in video games back then as to put it simply, things have changed a lot with what video games as a medium can allow on mainstream platforms.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted ",
