With iPadOS 19 and iOS 19, expected in 2025, the gap\nbetween iPad, iPhone, and Mac continues to shrink. [...] One of\nthe most exciting changes will benefit those using the iPad with a\nMagic Keyboard. When connected, the interface will adapt to show a\nmenu bar at the top, just like on macOS, turning the iPad into a\nmuch more laptop-like experience.</p>\n\n<p>Another key update is Stage Manager 2.0, an enhanced multitasking\nmode that activates automatically when the keyboard is attached.\nIt will make managing apps and windows smoother and more\nproductive than ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth spending too much time thinking about these changes until we actually see what Apple is doing, but the menu bar is one of the great achievements in the history of UI design, and the Mac has always had the best design for a menu bar\u2009\u2014\u2009at the top of the screen, not at the t",
