Windows will have you covered, regardless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is releasing new Insider builds as of Friday in multiple channels. The key feature, as it appears in Windows 11\u2019s Beta Insider build (26120.3941) is an updated profanity filter for voice typing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can turn on voice typing using the <strong>WIN+H</strong> shortcut and begin dictating. It recognizes your voice about as well as a smartphone but without the need for an AI-powered NPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dictation, however, can be formal such as using my voice to type an article like this or more casual like orally recapping a meeting. In certain cases, you might be tempted to drop in a swear word here and there. With the new update, you can simply opt to either \u201cb",
