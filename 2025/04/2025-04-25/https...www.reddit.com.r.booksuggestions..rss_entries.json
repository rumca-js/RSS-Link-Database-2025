So I\u2019ve been plowing through audiobooks the last 3 months.</p> <p>So there is an idea of what I\u2019ve been absorbing, my last reads have been: </p> <p>The last two Dark Tower entries. The Stand. Project Hail Mary and 11-22-63.</p> <p>Easy to see I\u2019ve been on a Stephen King bender outside of Hail Mary, but by no means have to have a King suggestion. </p> <p>Any suggestions were appreciated, and thank you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/airfenley\"> /u/airfenley </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1k7stcb/looking_for_my_next_listen/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1k7stcb/looking_for_my_next_listen/\">[comments]</a></span>",

On the surface, she\u2019s clearly the victim: kidnapped, imprisoned, and ultimately left to die by the cold, calculating Frederick Clegg. But once we get into her own words\u2026 things get murky.</p> <p>In her diary\u2014which Clegg reads after she dies\u2014Miranda reveals a lot more than just her fear. She writes with raw honesty about her past, including her complicated relationship with GP (her older artist mentor), her sexual encounters with other men, her manipulations, and her open contempt for Clegg. She paints herself as cultured, enlightened, and superior\u2014sometimes painfully so.</p> <p>This got me thinking: Does Miranda\u2019s arrogance, elitism, or even promiscuity (as Clegg would judge it) make her any less of a victim?

Something that would keep him reading until the last page, something gripping with a twist, not too scary and something that would make him want to explore more literature.</p> <p>Does anybody have a suggestion?

I&#39;m a final year PhD student (well I&#39;ve been a final year student for the past two years...sigh) and I find myself stuck in a depression, battling inner demons for the past couple of years. For context, I have a brilliant education where I got enrolled in my country&#39;s top university for my undergrad studies and later got my master&#39;s degree and continued on to a PhD. I was on track to finish my PhD with tons of research under my belt. From an outsider&#39;s perspective, my life may appear perfect but it is anything but. What started off as a burnout quickly turned into something much more darker as my mental health steadily deteriorated and I started getting suicidal thoughts. I&#39;m the type of person who&#39;ll take his inner thoughts to the grave rather than share it with a friend or family member. I even considered making a new account to post this but ultimately decided against. I found myself running away from my problems",

I want to expand my horizons to fiction books! I&#39;m looking for suggestions for sci-fi books; maybe kindred or adjacent to something like Dune, but I am absolutely open to any sort of sci-fi! Even old books! Thanks y&#39;all!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/littletchotchke\"> /u/littletchotchke </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1k77eyb/help_for_a_nonfiction_lover/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1k77eyb/help_for_a_nonfiction_lover/\">[comments]</a></span>",
