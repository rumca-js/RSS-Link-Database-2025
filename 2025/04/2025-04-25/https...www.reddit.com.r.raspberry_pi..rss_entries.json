I plan to work on the autonomus driving section.</p> <p>The vehicle will be around 1.5 meters long, 1.25 meters wide and it will perform in a parkour that is 3 meters wide and has 8 sections. Those sections will be divided by signs and you can detect and set your vehicles speed etc. according to them. Those sections each has different properties like muddy environment, steepness, deep water (should be around 40 cms deep). Also there is a time limit, of course.</p> <p>Systems will run on probably Raspberry Pi and vehicle should be fully autonomus in parkour. Design is subject to change but budget is capped as well, but probably we will run the system using cameras. I am not sure about other mechanical properties.</p> <p>I am currently doing research about what to use etc. </p> <p>I think i can use basic libraries for detection of",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have one RPi 3B+ running Pi-Hole and another running OSMC as a media server with a USB HDD connected. Whenever the house power drops out (too often in this area), one or both RPis will sometimes corrupt an SD card and won&#39;t reboot. I need an uninterruptible power supply with at least two 5VDC USB outlets, as well as 2-3 12VDC outlets for my modem/router and media server/HDD. I don&#39;t want a &quot;typical&quot; 120VAC multi-plug UPS, as that requires plugging bulky AC adapters into it for each device. I found some &quot;micro UPS&quot; systems online, but they&#39;re mainly geared for routers and security cams. They have multiple 12VDC coax output jacks, but only a single USB 5V output for &quot;charging a cell phone&quot;... probably not enough current for a RPi. I considered using a car jump starter (with 5V and 12V outputs) and leaving it plugged into the wall charger all the time, but the chargers probably won&#39;t handle the passthrough ",
