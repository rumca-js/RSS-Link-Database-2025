I am trying to pick a Linux distro to put on my old laptop, but I\u2019m really not sure which one to pick and I was hoping I could get some advice/opinions. I have a newer MacBook Air I use for school/work, so this would be a hobby computer to play around with, learn more about Linux, and maybe do some basic personal productivity. </p> <p>The computer I\u2019m wanting to put Linux on is a 2019 HP Envy x360 laptop. It has 8gb of DDR4 RAM, a 256gb SSD, and a Ryzen 5 cpu. It\u2019s slowed down about what you\u2019d expect for a 6 year old laptop, but it still runs Windows 11 pretty admirably. I just don\u2019t like windows and want something snappier, more fun and customizable, and less bloated. Biggest drawback of the laptop is the battery, it gets MAYBE 2-5 hours of screen-on-time depending on usage, might need a battery replacement soon. Either way, battery optimization would be important to me for a Linux distro, at least something not heavier than Windows. </p> <",
