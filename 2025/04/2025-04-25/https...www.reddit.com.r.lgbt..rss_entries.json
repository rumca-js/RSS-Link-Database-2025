The attraction to boys has always been non-existent and just speaking a few sweet words to a girl makes my heart beat faster. It was always like that, as a child, I didn&#39;t want to get married, I was hyperfocused on sapphic couples and well, my &quot;way&quot; always gave me away.</p> <p>It&#39;s easy to be a lesbian only on the Internet, right? It makes me forget who I am in real life too. And when I sit down and realize that, I just think: Holy shit, I&#39;m fucked. </p> <p>My mother clearly noticed, how could she not? I&#39;m 14 years old and I&#39;ve never talked about a single boy with her. And how do you think she reacts to this? Do you support me? Call me to talk?</p> <p>&quot;Being a lesbian or being gay is wrong&quot;, &quot;That gay friend of mine?
