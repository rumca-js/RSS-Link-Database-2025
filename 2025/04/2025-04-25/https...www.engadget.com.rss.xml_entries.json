        "description": "<p>What feels like a million video games with online multiplayer seem to arrive every week, but good games you can play on the couch with a loved one have only become rarer. If you\u2019re looking for some cooperative fun, let us help. Below we\u2019ve rounded up several of the best couch co-op games we\u2019ve played across the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox and PC. Just note that we\u2019ve limited our selection to genuine co-op experiences, not games that have local multiplayer but aren\u2019t truly cooperative in practice. (So, no <em>Mario Kart</em> or <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em>.) Still, our guide covers everything from platformers and puzzlers to RPGs and arcade shooters.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-couch-co-op-games-for-2025\">Best couch co-op games for 2025</h2> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"0137a2c059e54a02852c039c89a85228\" data-type=\"product-list\" data-original-url=\"https://sovrn.co/60q7a47\"></core-commerce></p> \n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"81ad558c2d744448a4dc74e392ca69a8\" data-type=\"product-list\" dat",
