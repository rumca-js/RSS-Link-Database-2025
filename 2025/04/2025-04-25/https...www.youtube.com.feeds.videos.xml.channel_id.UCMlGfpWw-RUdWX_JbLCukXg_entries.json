If you want structured bindings support, you need to specialize both. But surely, `std::tuple_element` is just `decltype` of `get`, no?\n---\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nJonathan is a Software Engineer at think-cell. There, he is responsible for maintaining think-cell's core libraries, which include a custom range library, a fast and convenient JSON parser, and many other utilities and data structures to write elegant C++ code. Before working at think-cell, he wrote many useful open-source C++ libraries. He is also a member of the C++ standardization committee, where he serves as the assistant chair for std::ranges, and a frequent conference speaker.\n---\n\n\nCppCon is the annual, week-long face-to-face ga",
