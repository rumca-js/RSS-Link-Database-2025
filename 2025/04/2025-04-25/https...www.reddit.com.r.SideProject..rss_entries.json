Super simple idea: you drop in a text (article, script, raw idea, small prompt), and the tool automatically generates a social media video (TikTok-style \u2014 with editing, AI voice-over, transitions, etc.). We have great results on generation time: about 20 seconds for one minute of video --&gt; <a href=\"https://hoox.video\">https://hoox.video</a> </p> <p>The goal is to help:<br/> - Solo creators<br/> - Small businesses without a media team<br/> - Agencies that want to scale content production </p> <p>We just launched the MVP. It\u2019s free to test, so if you have a few minutes, I\u2019d love your feedback on:<br/> - The onboarding<br/> - The overall UI/UX<br/> - The quality of the video output </p> <p>Also, what features would you consider <em>must-have</em> for this kind of tool? </p> <p>Thanks a lot for your time! And if you want to push the test further, happy to hook ",

I kept convincing myself I\u2019d post \u201ctomorrow\u201d when I had more time, or when I had the perfect image or caption.</p> <p>Guess what? That day rarely came.</p> <p>Eventually, I started scheduling all my content every weekend no matter what. I write a few updates about my journey, my product lessons, or even dev memes. I let AI clean them up, schedule them, and forget about it till the next batch.</p> <p>This system helped me build a real rhythm. I even ended up creating a lightweight tool that helps me do this across multiple platforms just so I wouldn\u2019t fall back into the trap.</p> <p>If you\u2019re juggling a day job and a side hustle I highly recommend doing this. It helped me show up every day without burning out.</p> <p>What\u2019s helped you stay consistent?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kwesi_dev\"> /",
