        "description": "<p>Hearing scheduled for Friday as residents say AI company has distributed leaflets that downplay pollution dangers</p><p>Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company is stirring controversy in Memphis, Tennessee. That\u2019s where he\u2019s building a massive supercomputer to power his company xAI. Community residents and environmental activists say that since the supercomputer was fired up last summer it has become one of the biggest air polluters in the county. But some local officials have championed the billionaire, saying he\u2019s investing in Memphis.</p><p>The first public hearing with the health department is scheduled for Friday, where county officials will hear from all sides of the debate. In the run-up to the hearing, secretive fliers claiming xAI has low emissions were sent to residents of historically Black neighborhoods; at the same time, environmental groups have been amassing data about how much pollution the AI company is likely generating.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.co",
