One of those cities is Chorrol, which is close to the end of the Black Road in the western part of Cyrodiil. Chorrol allows you to freely enter and join the Mages Guild by simply talking to Teekeus inside the guild's building. By doing this, you immediately start the \"Chorrol Recommendation\" quest in Oblivion Remastered. The Mages Guild requires you to get recommendations from all three of its headquarters. To get Teekeus and Chorrol's recommendation, you have to check in on a woman named Earana, who has recently made it into town.</p><p>To see how to fully complete the Chorrol Recommendation quest in Oblivion Remastered, check out our walkthrough below.

Some fear advancements to such systems might lead to negative consequences, while others predict a rosier future. Still others, like Larian Studios boss Swen Vincke, are trying to thoughtfully implement new technologies to help empower developers, not replace them. We caught up with Vincke recently, who discussed a range of subjects, including machine learning and AI.
