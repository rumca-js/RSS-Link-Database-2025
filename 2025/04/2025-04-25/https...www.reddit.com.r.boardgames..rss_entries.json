Cards were placed around the house labeling areas as Arianna&#39;s Glenn, The Dark Forest, and other locations. I don&#39;t think there was a board but possibly. I just remember walking around to different locations, I think gathering an item at each location and ending back at the start location to win the game. </p> <p>Does anyone have an idea what this game was? I have already read the other game question feeds and those aren&#39;t it.

We&#39;ve played a couple of semi-heavy games, but nothing too crazy. The last couple of sessions we&#39;ve played some rounds cosmic, but it never really clicked, it&#39;s usually because one alien completely steamrolls the others to the point where it kinda isn&#39;t fun for anyone. Do you guys have any tips for how to fix this? Are we just bad at countering powerful aliens? Do we need to get better at the core game to maneuver around the alien powers? We really like the idea of cosmic, and would love to enjoy it more.
