I am an outsider to your sub, but I didn&#39;t know where to ask.<br/> I have used browsers such as brave, Firefox and of course Chrome. I switched over from them because Edge was pretty good and I didn&#39;t find a lot of problems. Bing search was not a big shift for me from google. </p> <p>But since yesterday, My edge has been glitching a lot more, Normally it performs well but now it has been glitching like Tabs freezing fully, or only partially. Sometimes the New tab will open but the browser will freeze (idk how to describe it well). And it has happened so much in the past 2 days, I am genuinely getting distracted from what I am trying to do, and I don&#39;t think a browser in this day and age should stutter and stumble on a PC with 64 GB of RAM. Should I go back to firefox, or something else? Or wait for a Microsoft edge update which may fix it?</p> <p>Anyone else findings similar problems that have started recently?<",

Fiber internet with 1gig up and down. </p> <p>No matter what site I am on, youtube, netflix, twitch etc, I get videos stuttering until I swap them to the highest quality. Once it is on the highest quality I don&#39;t get any stuttering. This seems so backwards to me because you would assume if I was going to have any playback issues it would be on higher quality settings not on the lowest. </p> <p>I have tried googling but I have found nothing.

The main thing is the development philosophy. While I do get that making new features core parts of the browser is the only way to get people to try them, they are almost always not for me and the about:config fixes to disable them aren&#39;t always fully baked in my experience. </p> <p>Does anyone know of a modern gecko browser with good customization? So far I&#39;ve been on the edge about switching too floorp, would anyone have input on this? Bonus points if I am able to theme it to look transparent like mica or aero. </p> <p>Many thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Literally_Canada\"> /u/Literally_Canada </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1k79ko9/alternatives_to_zen/\">[link]",
