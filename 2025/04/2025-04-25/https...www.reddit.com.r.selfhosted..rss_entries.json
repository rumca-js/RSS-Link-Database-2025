Recently I had my ISP changed my public IP Address, and it broke my setup(I know, I should have DDNS, I just haven&#39;t gotten to that yet). I changed my Cloudflare Domain A record to point to my new IP Address, but for some reason, I am no longer able to bring up my sites when I have the Cloudflare Proxy enabled. When I turn it to &quot;DNS only&quot; it works. Another thing to mention is that my SSL Certificates on NGINX Proxy Manager were expired, I realized, and I couldn&#39;t get them to renew through the interface. After trying a bunch of things, I ended up generating new SSL Certificates through Cloudflare and manually pasting them in. So the Certificates are enabled, and I have https when I turn off Cloudflare Proxy I get to the sites.",

Currently it draws around 70W at idle, which to be honest isn&#39;t ideal.<br/> My current build was previously meant as a gaming rig, so Ryzen 5 3600X paired with GTX 1660 Ti and few HDD&#39;s.<br/> I noticed that at idle, the GPU alone draws around 20W. So I was thinking about removing the GPU entirely. The thing is that sometimes the client devices accessing Emby needs to have some movies transcoded. I have lot of 4K HDR@50-100Mbps movies, that mostly are transcoded to 4K@40Mbps(with Tone Mapping) and I&#39;m asking if the CPU alone would be able to transcode these files on the fly without being too slow.</p> <p>Thanks..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/meeRoot\"> /u/meeRoot </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1k7fjbc/lowering_down",

At home, I use <strong>NGINX Proxy Manager</strong> along with a <strong>DuckDNS</strong> domain. So, for example:</p> <p>\ud83d\udccd <a href=\"http://portainer.myduckdns.org\"><code>portainer.myduckdns.org</code></a> \u2192 routes to local <code>localhost:9000</code></p> <p>This works fine <strong>within my home network</strong>, but my ISP gives me a dynamic IP that changes twice a day (super annoying). So for remote access, I started using <strong>Tailscale</strong> \u2014 I installed it on my server and on the devices I use outside home. Works great in terms of connectivity!</p> <p>The issue: when I\u2019m outside, I have to access services via my Tailscale IP and port like <code>100.x.x.x:9000</code>, which is not very memorable. I\u2019d love a way to access my services using custom, easy-to-remember domains even when I&#39;m outside my netwo",
