Are there other games that stand out to you as being *unusually* deep &amp; crunchy given the number of rules they have?</p> <p>Edit: Forgot to say, please say something describing both the level of the complexity of the rules and what level of depth you think it has (compared to other games or in any other sort of way), just so I/we can get an idea. E.g., justify your suggestion as if the reader is skeptical. Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: Great point about this being the wheelhouse of abstract games.

You get dealt a hand and you either have an easy time or have a trickier time. That&#39;s how any game where you get dealt a hand or roll dice works. I don&#39;t understand why they singled out Scout and then all agreed. Shouldn&#39;t this criticism apply to so many games?

You could get power up items if you rolled on them. one of the items was you switch players with someone on the board. </p> <p>sadly this is all i can remember for right now. if i remember more I will edit the post if nothing is found yet.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Trynnagocrazy2\"> /u/Trynnagocrazy2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1pummhe/can_you_help_me_find",

This won&#39;t be a permanent game table so I will just roll-up and bring out for game nights. </p> <p>My table is an unusual 41 inches wide and 92 long. </p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of a nice 5mm allplay mat, but those are 42 inch wide (by 66 long). Length wide this is fine since we normally play &quot;in the middle&quot; of the table. But is the extra 1 inch width (1/2 overhang on each side) ok???</p> <p>Alternatively I am looking at 36 wide mats (72 inch long or perhaps even longer) from places like crafting kingdom. I think that might only be 4mm though? My concern is that wood border of a few inches on both sides is so skinny it&#39;s not really usable, so in effect our gaming space shrinks. </p> <p>Any thoughts on which size would be best? Ok with a little overhang on a nice thick mat? Or prefer a few inches of wood border of the table around the mat? </p> <p>Thanks for the input!!!</p> </di",
