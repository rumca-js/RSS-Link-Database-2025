        "description": "A SpaceX Starlink satellite suffered a major in-orbit failure in December 2025, losing communication after venting its fuel tank and beginning an uncontrolled orbital descent. The malfunction caused the satellite\u2019s altitude to drop and produced minor debris, prompting close tracking by SpaceX, NASA and the U.S. Space Force. High-resolution imagery from Maxar/Vantor\u2019s WorldView-3 satellite confirmed the spacecraft was largely intact. The incident highlights both the risks of large satellite constellations and the growing role of rapid orbital monitoring in space safety.",
