But it blew my mind a little. You put on the headset, grab the controls, and suddenly you\u2019re in a warehouse. The sounds, the weight simulation, even vibrations when you bump into something, it felt way more real than I expected. And the best part? You could mess up without consequences. No broken equipment, no safety risks, you just reset and try again.</p> <p>It got me thinking: why aren\u2019t we using this for everything? Surgery, firefighting, driving, etc. I know some industries already do, but it still feels underused. The tech\u2019s not perfect I know, I did get a bit motion sick, but the potential is huge. I ended up going down a rabbit hole looking at different VR setups online (even skimmed a few simulator rigs on Alibaba just out of curiosity). Some of the stuff out there is surprisingly affordable if you\u2019re not goin",

Once I hit my 50&#39;s I started to need reading glasses to focus on anything close, but my distance vision is still better than average. I&#39;m at the point now that I have prescription progressive lenses I wear full time, but the top (distance portion of the lens) is basically zero. Without glasses, anything 4-5&#39; away or closer is blurry.</p> <p>Now here&#39;s the weird bit. When I put on VR goggles (Meta Quest 3), I don&#39;t need to use glasses. I can hold virtual objects right up to my face, and they are clear. Objects in the distance are clear as well. How does this work?
