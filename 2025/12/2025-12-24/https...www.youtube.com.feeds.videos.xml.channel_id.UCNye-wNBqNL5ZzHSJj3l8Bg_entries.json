        "description": "Americans are expected to spend nearly $900 each this holiday season, the second-highest level in 20 years.\nThe surge reflects strong consumer demand and a continued shift towards online shopping.\nHowever, many shoppers say they are worried about the economy and rising living costs.\nPrices have been pushed higher by inflation nearing 3 per cent and tariff-driven cost increases.\nAffordability has become a major political issue, fuelling fears of economic slowdown or recession.\nPresident Donald Trump rejects the concerns, claiming strong economic growth under his administration.\nWith midterm elections approaching, voters remain divided between festive spending and economic anxiety.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Mike Hanna reports from Washington, DC. \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com",

This film explores how assimilation became a method of rule and a source of resistance.\n\nAt the heart of French colonial rule was the mission \"civilisatrice\", a doctrine that claimed to lift up colonised societies through education, administration and the French language. In practice, this system sought to reshape colonised people's identities, loyalties and cultures, replacing local traditions with French norms while maintaining strict political and economic control. Schools, legal systems and bureaucracies became tools of empire as powerful as armies.\n\nThrough case studies in Algeria, Indochina and West Africa, the documentary shows how colonial administrations operated on the ground. In Algeria, settler colonialism and mass repression led to war. In Indochina, education and bureaucracy coexisted with exploitation and nationalist resistance. In West Africa, language policy and ind",
