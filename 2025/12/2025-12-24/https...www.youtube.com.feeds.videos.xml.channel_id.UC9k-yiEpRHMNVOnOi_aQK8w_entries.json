        "description": "A dozen holiday puppies got a Hollywood ending, literally, thanks to a Hollywood star. \"Clueless\" actor Alicia Silverstone noticed their pregnant mother was on a list to be euthanized. She stepped in to help, and was able to connect mama, named Noel, to the Helen Woodward Animal Center in southern California. In the center's care, Noel gave birth to a dozen festively named puppies: Drummer, Piper, Lord, Lady, Maid, Swan, Goose, Ring, Calling Bird, French Hen, Turtle Dove and Partridge.",
