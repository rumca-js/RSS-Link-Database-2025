We have an onsite Synology server that is redundant as hell but aa small meteor could take us out and be real bad as we store content for large companies that would be pissed if it was gone. So, need an offsite solution. We used Backblaze in the past but it was 35K a year and I didnt see enough value there. The chances of us ever needing to recover it are tiny so I really dont care how much of a hassle it is to recover. If the monthly is cheap but to recover is expensive.. dont care.</p> <p>Heard Crashplan might be the solution for this? On the cheap side but sucks to recover.</p> <p>We also have a second Synology server that could be configured to have 300TB of space. We could place that offsite and use it as BU too.</p> <p>Am I simply dodging the fact this is going to be expensive? north of 35K</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DrSoulCrusher\"> /u/DrSoulC",

I dont need to be downloading from it regularly or anything. It is highly likely once I get everything uploaded I will rarely need to download from it. I just need a large online backup that has a decent transfer speed (I am limited to 40mbps upload for now anyway) and wont cost me an arm and a leg.
