This time, I picked up some flowers at the market\u2014cheap, lively, and blooming beautifully\u2014to replace all the withered branches and fallen leaves at home.\nGrandma always likes to grow all kinds of vegetables in the flower beds. This time, we dug out a lot of fish mint, and I made sure she ate it all in one go\u2014just to stop her from secretly planting it back again!\n\nHello, everyone! I am Dianxi Xiaoge, a Yunnan native. If you enjoy my videos, please keep subscribing to my channel. I'll continue to share my life and Yunnan-styled food in my uploads. Wish you have a happy life and enjoy tasty food every day\n\nYouTube\u3010\u6ec7\u897f\u5c0f\u54e5 Dianxi Xiaoge\u3011\u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2MH1T5N\nFacebook\u3010\u6ec7\u897f\u5c0f\u54e5 Dianxi Xiaoge\u3011 \u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2TsGflr\nInstagram\u3010dianxixiaoge_apenjie\u3011\u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2Wagkze  \nTikTok\u3010di",
