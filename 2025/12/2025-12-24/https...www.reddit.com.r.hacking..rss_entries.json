Some tools focus heavily on fingerprint randomization, others on strict profile isolation, and some rely on controlling consistency rather than randomness.</p> <p>Curious how people here view this:</p> <p>Are these tools fundamentally limited by the browser runtime itself?</p> <p>Does most detection today rely more on browser data or everything around it?</p> <p>At what point do these browsers stop providing meaningful advantages compared to traditional isolation methods?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bhuvan_boy\"> /u/bhuvan_",
