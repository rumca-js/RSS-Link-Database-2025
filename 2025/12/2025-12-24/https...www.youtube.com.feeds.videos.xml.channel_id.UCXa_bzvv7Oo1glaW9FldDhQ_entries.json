        "description": "If you're yet to see the gameplay for Crimson Desert, you might not be aware of how solid it's shaping up to be. Its combat is a flurry of attacks, parries, dodges, and some incredible finishing animations that make it look brutal and fraught with peril. \n\nThe world hides a lot of cool things to discover, as well as bringing a plethora of varied activities to the table in order to keep players busy. It looks like it's weaving its story quite well into the moment to moment gameplay, a facet of any open world experience that automatically elevates it over the competition. \n\nCrimson Desert could be one of the 2026's best titles, and might just be the one that has everything I want in a medieval fantasy title.",
