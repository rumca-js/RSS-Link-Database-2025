The AI is a guest. But what if we reimagined an OS where: - **AI understands the compute workflow** (scheduler knows when to infer vs. reason vs. memory-intensive tasks) - **Relationship and context are architectural** (not hack-based memory injection) - **Privacy is default** (local-first, user owns all data/weights/hardware) - **The system learns your patterns** (genuine personalization through LoRA personality adapters) ### What Makes Echo-OS Different **1.
