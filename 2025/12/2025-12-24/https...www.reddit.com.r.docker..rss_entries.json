Docker has officially released their entire library of <strong>Hardened Images (DHI)</strong> under the Apache 2.0 license.</p> <p>Previously, enterprise-grade security (CIS benchmark compliance, minimal footprint, CVE scanning) was locked behind paywalls or required hours of manual Dockerfile optimization. Now, it seems they are democratizing &quot;secure-by-default&quot;.</p> <p><strong>Key Technical Wins:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Zero Bloat:</strong> Stripped of non-essential binaries (shells, package managers) to reduce attack surface.</li> <li><strong>Auto-Patching:</strong> Maintenance is handled upstream.</li> <li><strong>Apache 2.0:</strong> Free for commercial use.</li> </ul> <p>I did a deep dive into the architecture and how this aligns with the &quot;Shift Left&quot; security philosophy.</p> <p><strong>Full Analysis &amp; Migration Guide:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nexaspecs.com/2025/12/dock",

I\u2019d love to get your feedback on a concept I&#39;m exploring.</p> <p>The Problem: Onboarding to a new project usually takes days of manual setup, fighting with outdated READMEs, and missing dependencies.</p> <p>The Concept: 1.Provide a Git URL 2.AI scans the codebase (manifests, ports, DB strings) 3.Infers the architecture 4.Generates all Dockerfiles and a fully linked docker-compose.yml.</p> <p>The goal is to go from cloning a repo to a running local simulation in minutes, with zero manual config.</p> <p>Feedback needed for R&amp;D:</p> <p>Is there a tool that handles the entire repo-to-orchestration flow (not just single Dockerfiles)?</p> <p>What\u2019s the biggest technical deal-breaker for you in an AI-generated setup?</p> <p>If reliable, would you use this for dev onboarding?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
