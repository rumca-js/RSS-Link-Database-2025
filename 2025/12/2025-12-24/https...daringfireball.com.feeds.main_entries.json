        "description": "<p>Smart, fair video from Quinn Nelson on the gap that remains between iPadOS 26 and desktop OSes. I think it\u2019s right that there is a gap there. Apple has the Macintosh, the best desktop/workstation platform in the industry. So whatever the ideal is for iPadOS, it ought to fall short of MacOS in terms of technical capabilities, and instead offer a degree of simplicity and can\u2019t-screw-it-up-edness that the Mac can\u2019t match. But, some of the limitations that remain in iPadOS are just frustrating. iPadOS 26 is a huge leap forward, and I think sets the stage for Apple to address those limitations.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018\u2018The iPad\u2019s Software Problem Is Permanent\u2019\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/24/snazzy-ipad\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",

As part of the FTC v.\nMicrosoft hearing, Sony supplied a document from PlayStation chief\nJim Ryan that includes redacted details on the margins Sony shares\nwith publishers, its <em>Call of Duty</em> revenues, and even the cost of\ndeveloping some of its games.</p>\n\n<p>It looks like someone redacted the documents with a black Sharpie\u2009\u2014\u2009but when you scan them in, it\u2019s easy to see some of the\nredactions. Oops.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is sort of the exception that proves the rule <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/12/23/trump-doj-pdf-redactions\">regarding redactions</a>. If you redact a document digitally, you have to know what to look for (e.g. metadata) to be certain you\u2019ve redacted everything you want to redact. If you redact a document on paper, you can just look at it, with good light and sharp eyes.</p>\n\n<div",
