From my experience on Raspbian 64 Kodi is not using the hardware acceleration and even 1080p HEVC in software decoding to be absolutely unplayable even at 5.2Mbs bitrate which is extremely low. Constantly dropped frames, audio desync and subtitles are desynced from both. Kodi is reading the file from an NVME and I have a tower cooler - its not a read speed or thermal throttle issue</p> <p>If I use LibreELEC and if I initiate playback manually with ffmpeg the same file is perfectly fine.
