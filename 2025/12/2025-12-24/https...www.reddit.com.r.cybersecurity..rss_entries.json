I am extremely concerned that we are giving away responsibility/protection of American data/companies to foreign workers who have no genuine interest in protecting US citizens. I noticed the quality of work from Indian coworkers in the past to be extremely bad. Part of me wondered if it was them lying about certifications/experience or simply not giving a damn because they think &quot;screw Americans&quot;. Customer service isn&#39;t as big of a deal to me honestly because the responsibility isn&#39;t as big. At least H1B visa workers are typically vetted + higher skilled + live in the country.</p> <p>To me it feels akin to replacing the US military with foreign nationals who have no allegiance to the country. Am I just being paranoid/&quot;racist&quot; or is this a genuine fear/valid point?</p> </div><!-- S",
