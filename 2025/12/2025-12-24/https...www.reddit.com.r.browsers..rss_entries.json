I&#39;m a Firefox user on Linux and Android, and I like it for its balance of customization, performance, and the fact that it&#39;s still open source. Everyone&#39;s aware of the direction Firefox is taking, and I&#39;m somewhat... intrigued by what might happen.</p> <p>I&#39;m not that demanding. I use Firefox with the vertical bars and some extensions that are everywhere (uBlock is non-negotiable). What I do ask is that it has an Android equivalent that allows for cross-device synchronization, and that&#39;s it. Oh, and that it&#39;s not a beta fork maintained by two people in Pakistan (nothing against Pakistan, but you get the idea).

Maybe one based on Firefox instead of chronium.</p> <p>My only two requirements on my broser would be workspaces and squishing tabs instead of making me scroll through them, like chronium based browsers have them. So far i only found one Firefox based browser called Floorp that got workspaces, but it also makes me scroll through the tabs instead of squishing them together until only the logo of the page is visible</p> <p>Are there any Firefox based browsers that have both of these or maybe some extentions that make this happen on Firefox?
