It&#39;s where it promises to give you something, actually gives you it, but traps you in the website the malware is on (on all devices) so you can not access any other apps (including the rewarded app). It does this while stealing all possible data (search history, IP, address, phone number, etc.) But please don&#39;t make a malware website like this, it&#39;s very harmful and you&#39;ll get on the naughty list this year (hehe)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Question-Asker523\"> /u/Question-Asker523 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1puu0g1/possible_malware_type_in_the_future/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1puu0g1/possible_malware_type_in_the_future/\">[comments]</a></span>",
