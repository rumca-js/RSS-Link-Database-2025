To give a TL;DR, and frame context, I had worked on Medal of Honor: Allied Assault and the very first Call of Duty with Vince in Tulsa, OK. Wanting to go home and be close to family, I had decided to fully let go of game devopment completely and do other things that would favor my geographic preference. Vince called me somewhere near a year later and hooked me up to some remote work on COD: UnitedOffensive.</p> <p>I went on to do some awesome contributions to Call of Duty, including the endings of both MW1 and MW2, and continued to help Call of Duty thrive all the way up to 2024.

From the outside, it looks simple. Not a AAA project, simple visuals but. During production, it turned out to be anything but.</p> <p>One thing we didn\u2019t expect was how much time goes into systems that already \u201cwork.\u201d A mechanic can be functional, bug-free, and still fail because of group of players reads it differently. Fishing was a good example for us: no crashes, no major issues, yet we kept iterating because some players felt lost in the first minute. Fixing that took longer than building this system </p> <p>Another surprise was how fragmented attention is. During a festival demo, feedback arrived fast and from all directions. Streams, chats, comments. It was extremely useful, but also very temporary. Once the event ended, the signal almost completely disappeared. Not in a bad way just how the ecosystem works.

Need something for nights when it is just 2-3 of us. Enjoyed the hell out of Left4Deads and mods, Risk of Rain 2, and Helldivers 2. People can jump in or out and play together at the same level (essentially). Unlocks aren\u2019t game changing progress. We don\u2019t take things too seriously so we typically prefer playing in smaller groups together rather than risk a toxic public player clashing with our laid back style. Don\u2019t care if game is brutally hard or just fun.</p> <p>Edit: just been a few minutes and already lots of games I\u2019m interested in that I never saw listed in any article I came across.
