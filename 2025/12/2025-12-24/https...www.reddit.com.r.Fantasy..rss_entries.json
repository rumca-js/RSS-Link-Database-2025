It&#39;s an epic fantasy story that wears its inspiration from The Legend of Zelda and similar properties practically on its sleeve; it&#39;s obvious from page one that the author intends for readers with a gaming-heavy background to see many references and easter eggs to those properties.</p> <p>In addition, this book is an extension of the author&#39;s wider universe, where most of his books take place. Due to (in my opinion, excessive) time whackery and odd properties of the world at large, it&#39;s tough to tell exactly where in the wider timeline this book takes place, or even if certain characters introduced and followed are even the original version of that character, or some sort of magical simulacrum,",

I started with Shadow Slave and really enjoyed the early parts \u2014 it felt like true struggle fantasy, and that hooked me. But toward the end of the war arc, I ended up dropping it because the MC started feeling a bit too strong, and the tension faded for me.</p> <p>After that, I read Primal Hunter. I know LitRPG can be hit or miss, but I genuinely loved it. The power fantasy was fun, yet the MC still felt like he was in danger, which I appreciated. What really stood out to me, though, was his profession \u2014 alchemy. I didn\u2019t expect it, but I ended up absolutely obsessed with it.</p> <p>So now I\u2019m looking for novels where the MC uses alchemy as their main source of power, or something closely related to it. Progression fantasy, LitRPG, or standard fantasy are all fine. Bonus points if necromancy is involved, since I\u2019ve loved that kind of power ever since I was a kid.</p> </div><!--",

I understand the point being that they become grow as the series progresses or do well by other means, but I&#39;ve been reading the Black Witch Chronicles (SUPER UNDERRATED BTW!) which was especially glaring to me. For 4 books the main character has been powerless and never tried to become competent while watching everyone else around her be competent. </p> <p>I also hate when they suddenly become powerful too like a cheat code. E.g. in quicksilver, main character is strong for a <em>human</em>, but actually not strong because she&#39;s in a world of fae, but then just gets give powers because a prophecy etc. In the black witch, the FMC does eventually become strong but it&#39;s in one sentence saying <em>over weeks she learned this.</em> </p> <p>So what I&#39;m asking is what books have a FMC who is already strong/competent, ",

I want to add to it, though, because as I was reading, I was given very much Kratos from God of War for the main character, for his personality, and how he was being pushed forward. I really enjoyed reading, and the ending had me blown away. That&#39;s all I can say without giving it away, but it&#39;s definitely worth the ride to get there.</p> <p>I give this one a solid 4.5/ 5 stars and look forward to reading more of Ma\u0407nas&#39; work.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SammiCMiRoMa96\"> /u/SammiCMiRoMa96 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1pupka1/review_the_poisonous_crown_by_ma\u0457na/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:",
