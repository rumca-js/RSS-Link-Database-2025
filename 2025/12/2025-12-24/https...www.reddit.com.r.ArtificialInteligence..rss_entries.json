There\u2019s been a lot of progress in the last week, with some videos to show the work in progress. We also have some new testing plans and a slight alteration of course in the development of PBAI.</p> <p>So in the last update, we were working on getting an efficient and effective maze runner simply to use it as proof of concept and baseline for \u201cprimal\u201d behavior testing grounds. What we wanted to see was an agent with no knowledge, be dropped in a random environment, and have to traverse its way through resolving which paths were possible areas of action. We had gotten to the point that PBAI could exist and move, but it moved without intent. Here\u2019s another video of play during tuning.</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/6hgnTGTXOXk\">https://youtu.be/6hgnTGTXOXk</a></p> <p>Now that has changed.
