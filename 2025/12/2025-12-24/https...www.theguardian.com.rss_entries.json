Happy holidays! </p><p>Sitcoms aren\u2019t meant to go anywhere: the default setting is one location full of characters who keep resetting to zero. Few have followed that rule as faithfully as Two Doors Down, a low-key comedy set on a middle-class close on the outskirts of Glasgow and focusing on retirement-age couple Eric and Beth Baird (Alex Norton and Arabella Weir), whose quiet life is forever interrupted by their eccentric neighbours inviting themselves in. That might be why it\u2019s stayed on air for more than a decade: it\u2019s never essential but always entertaining enough. You know what you\u2019re getting.</p><p>The show prefers to stay put in the Bairds\u2019 lounge, and if it does venture elsewhere it will usually just be to someone else\u2019s house \u2013 nothing flashy.

Since 1968, therefore (or a couple of years earlier, depending on whether you count the precursor Whistle and I\u2019ll Come to You, directed by Jonathan Miller \u2013 and who am I to tell you nay?), the BBC has sporadically provided one in the form of the Ghost Story for Christmas series. These days, it is an annual event, delivered as a half-hour adaptation by Mark Gatiss of a spooky short story from the Victorian or Edwardian archives, which gives us some shivery distraction and provides some lovely actors with gainful employment of a not too onerous kind in the lead-up to Christmas.</p><p>To begin, the recent reboot of the series comprised mostly adaptations of Gatiss\u2019s greatest ",

This is true for&nbsp;Tabasco on eggs, for fragrance in an elevator, for confidence in the karaoke booth, and it is also, I have belatedly realised, the secret of how to wear lace.</p><p>All these years, I\u2019ve been getting lace wrong by wearing too much of it. Killing it with overenthusiasm. Lace is beautiful stuff: delicate and romantic. Look closely at it and you will see tiny motifs and patterns, flowers and symbols, crafted in miniature like secret messages. Lace has drama: it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the fabric of marriages, funerals and christenings, after all. And it can switch vibes: white is chaste, red is raunchy, black is sophisticated. Lace&nbsp;has it all going on.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/dec/24/jess-cartner-morley-on-fashion-lace-trimmings\">Continue reading...</a>",
