But during this conversation my step dad said if I&#39;m gay then &quot;I want to be a girl&quot;, and boys are supposed to like girls. Then my step dad says that bisexuals don&#39;t exist, and the government wants to make people gay so they can&#39;t have children, and after the conversation I was aggervaited.

This happens a LOT when we&#39;re hanging out, especially in public. They think it&#39;s completely okay to call random women ugly or comment on their appearance in ways that make me uncomfortable. Every time I call this out and say it&#39;s sexist, they get angry at me and say it&#39;s not sexist and that it&#39;s fine because they say the same things about men too. I&#39;ve talked to some other gay friends about this, ones who don&#39;t know them, and they said they never do that and find it disgusting. I feel like they can forget they&#39;re men sometimes because they don&#39;t want to be put under the same umbrella as straight men who have oppressed them, and I think that&#39;s totally valid, but I don&#39;t know how to stop them from doing this. I love them so much, and I don&#39;t want to stop se",
