        "description": "Welcome to the second session of the 16-Kata series, where I continue breaking down what I have learned about building and scaling companies over the past decade.\n\nIn this session, we focus on the hardest problem that emerges after early growth: coordination at scale. We examine why quality degrades as teams grow, why most services businesses fail when they scale too fast, and how leadership, incentives, and clear communication reduce coordination costs across large organizations. The session also explains why caring deeply about customers outperforms aggressive expansion, how leaders propagate standards through layers of teams, and why writing, incentives, and mastery matter more than control.\n\nIf you are leading teams, scaling an organization, or trying to understand how alignment actually works inside growing companies, this session is designed to give you a practical mental model.\n\n00:00 - Introduction \n00:53 - The Challenge of Scaling Quality\n08:20 - What Really Drives People?\n11",
