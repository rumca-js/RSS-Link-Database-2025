I&#39;ve been self-hosting a limited array of applications on Yunohost for about a year now, and I am a software engineer but in a field that is very far removed from hands-on server administration, so I don&#39;t have a lot of relevant background knowledge.</p> <p>Most discussions I read around various self-hosting spaces center on the idea of the home server as a &quot;NAS with additional capabilities&quot; and almost always assume some flavor of RAID. I&#39;ve been puzzled since the beginning why, and whether I am missing out on some benefit from it. </p> <p>My current &quot;specs&quot; for my setup are:</p> <ul> <li><p>Applications: Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Kavita, TT-RSS (and I plan to expand to Joplin and Immich in the future)</p></li> <li><p>The entire media library is currently under 1TB, I cannot imagine a scenario where it ever grows past 2TB</p></li> <li><p>I am the only user of the system</p></",

Can do this without exposing a massive security hole in my home network?</p> <p>Ideally I would like to use Mac OS X Server 10.4, then put it behind a modern Nginx reverse proxy. Would that be safe enough that I wouldn&#39;t need to worry a ton? If not, is there better method, or is using a 20 year old web server a complete non-starter? I&#39;m only planning to host a static site written in plain HTML/CSS.</p> <p>My backup option is to just install OpenBSD instead, since that sill supports the hardware.

I&#39;m going to point it at a domain because I don&#39;t have a static IP so with my beginner level of coding and some internet copy paste and ai chats I think I can do all of this, I just need to know it all looks right, makes sense and if anyone see&#39;s anything they would change because its wrong without making it more complex. I&#39;ll be sharing my media library with 4 people outside of my home and they live all over the world, the file server with just be for me to have something I can save a file to on my phone when I&#39;m out or with a client or whatever.</p> <pre><code> Site Address \u2502 \u2502 \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510 Dynamic DNS Cloudflare \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518 ",
