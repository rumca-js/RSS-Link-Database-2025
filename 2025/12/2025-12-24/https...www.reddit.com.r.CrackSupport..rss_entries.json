Drive location issues, &quot;run out of ram&quot;... Even tho I have 32gb and an extra 4gb swap, game infinitely installs staying at 0.0%, install gets to 0.2% and runs into an error. I have spent countless hours problem solving this in so many different ways and pushing my Linux abilities. It has made me really question Linux (mainly drive access has made me think Linux is ridiculous).

I feel bad but it is deserved for the Sims 4 community. Unfortunately, I updated my sims 4 without knowing about this and now I am dealing with setting up my DLC. </p> <p>I watched several video unril I understood how to them. I download the DLC unlocked, extract it and instal it. Then I downloaded the DLC I am missing \u2014 which are not alot since of anadius but the impacts of my world was heavy. Then I extract the ones I wanted, get the installation out with the DLC I wanted and then I put them in the Sims folder. (I tried to out them in DLC folder, _installation folder and the Sims 4 folder since they didn&#39;t work). In the videos, most of them put the extracted DLC in the Sims 4 file and I did that multiple times. It has got to the point that I don&#39;t know what to do so I came to ask here. Thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",
