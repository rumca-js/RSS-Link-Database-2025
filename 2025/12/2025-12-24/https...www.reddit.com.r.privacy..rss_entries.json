        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I live in an apartment and have a neighbor with a ring camera that points towards my door (not directly, but close enough). I rarely see the neighbor and have not had an opportunity to discuss this with him. Is anyone in this sub aware of any legal privacy mechanisms I can take to reduce the intrusiveness of the Ring camera?</p> <p>Edit: I apologize if this post seems redundant. I didn&#39;t realize someone posted something similar about Ring cameras and their HOA. I still believe my question is slightly different and appreciate any insight into my dilemma. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TeaTechnical3807\"> /u/TeaTechnical3807 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1puoms6/dealing_with_a_neighbors_intrusive_ring_camera/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1puoms6/dealing_with_a_neighbors_intrusive_ring_camera/\">[comments]<",
