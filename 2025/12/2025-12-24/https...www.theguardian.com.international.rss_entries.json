Among them were a&nbsp;clutch of literary stars: Oscar Wilde, Evelyn Waugh, Muriel Spark and Graham Greene. But there was a whole&nbsp;host of poets, artists and public intellectuals less known to us today, whose \u201cgoing over to Rome\u201d provoked envy and dismay.</p><p>In this thoughtful though brisk book, Melanie McDonagh, a columnist for The Tablet, gives us 16 case histories of Britons who went \u201cPoping\u201d during the scariest decades of the 20th century. At a time when reason and decency appeared to have been chased out by political extremism and global warfare, it was only natural to long for something solid.
