Like I play these if I&#39;m sick or can&#39;t sleep at night, or if I have spare time in the mood, or if I&#39;m traveling. I&#39;ve also been flirting with the idea of finally playing Chrono Trigger also. Final Fantasy games and other RPGS don&#39;t interest me for some reason. Never been a Zelda or Mario guy either. Also Super Metroid looks interesting. I forgot about this one but I&#39;ve always liked retro Sonic, esp Sonic 2 game.</p> <p>How about you? :)</p> <",

Thanks in advance.</p> <p>First up, a bit of what I think will be useful context. When I was a kid, my parents got a PC from somewhere like Currys or PC World. This was in the UK and would have been around 1998-2000 I reckon. I&#39;m pretty sure it was a Win 98 PC. We got a few games with the PC and they were proper games, not edutainment or anything like that. The game I&#39;m looking for was included. I know for certain that one of the other games was Total Annihilation Kingdoms, so that might help with dating this a bit. They came in a soft, red plastic case with plastic sleeves.</p> <p>The game itself was some sort of medieval fantasy thing. I remember it being 3rd person and I&#39;m pretty sure the camera was from a sort of 45 degree perspective. Like a high over the shoulder and from a fair distanc",

The SCART cable from the switch to the transcoder is the included one (about 1.5 m). Could cable length or quality be the issue?
