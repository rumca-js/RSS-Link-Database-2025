I&#39;ve got most of them locked down but a few recommendations wont hurt. First off i have someone who&#39;s a Stephen King fan who just wants the newer stuff he hasn&#39;t read. I want to branch out from that but horror isn&#39;t my genre of choice so I&#39;m unsure of what to get them. The next one is a younger adult who has expressed an interest in Greek mythology but i don&#39;t want to get them Percy Jackson books as they are incredibly popular and i don&#39;t want to get them something they&#39;ve already read. The last is someone who has expressed an interest in darker plots from the fantasy genre. Not prince of thorns level dark but just a step back from that. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/The_hypest_Shit\"> /u/The_hypest_Shit </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Romance and happy warm books were always my favorite thing to read, ive always loved them and were usually my to-go genre to read. But lately, as life caught up with me, it deosnt feel the same anymore, whenever i read a book about a protagonist getting the love they longed for and so deserve i get a very serious feeling of envy and resentment that its unhealthy at this point. So i thought maybe if i read a book that speaks a bit to whats going on in my life, it could help. So, if anyone has a recommendation for a book about a protagonist with complex character that yearns and is living with low self esteem and crippling self hatred i would highly appreciate it. An LGBTQ one would be ideal.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bahaa_Ch\"> /u/Bahaa_Ch </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pum2eo/book_that_explores_the_themes_of_self_hatred_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#",

After watching it a few times, I finally read Hippos and realized it was the same story and I was hooked.(totally didn\u2019t know the connection , did both things separately, was shocked to realize the connection)</p> <p>I\u2019ve been trying to find that same vibe ever since. But here\u2019s the thing:</p> <p>Kerouac on his own feels ego-driven. Burroughs on his own is way too druggy and hard to follow. Hippos works because them together balances it out and the story actually lands.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to find something else that gives the same vibe as Hippos and the movie. Any recommendations?</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried to read ginberg journals but he wrote a lot of (I think) pretended this time wasn\u2019t important or didn\u2019t share the real details.
