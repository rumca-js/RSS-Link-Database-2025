You&#39;ve probably never heard of it but neither did I a little while ago. I&#39;ve been checking it out for a few days and wanted to make a little video covering the language with a small little run down. It over&#39;s things like syntax flexibility, multi-paradigm, and built in libraries. I hope you check it out and hopefully enjoy it to at least some degree.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sup1109\"> /u/sup1109 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW6bw8dMPc0\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pugi0i/ring_best_programming_language_for_2026/\">[comments]</a></span>",
