Noting that I do not have a CRT and have not had one for a *long* time (and am thus principally going off of some childhood memories), It does seem to me that CRT filters have gotten a lot better as of late-- the above images are of Ocarina of Time (running on Ares at 1x Native resolution) with and without stock CRT-Royale [captured on a 4K monitor]. </p> <p>I certainly think it&#39;s a nice change of pace from time to time (as a non-purist). That said, I&#39;m curious how other emulation veterans (and/or those with actual CRTs) feel about CRT filters, etc.</p>",
