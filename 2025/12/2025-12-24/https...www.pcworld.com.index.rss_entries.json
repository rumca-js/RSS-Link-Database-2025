While unsightly edges and artefacts appear with a conventional enlargement, Upscayl reveals additional details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that even slightly blurred or too-small photos can be saved. This works by the AI guessing the possible details. This is exactly what it is trained to do. Upscayl uses the Real-Esgran and Vulkan architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this means that Upscayl requires a Vulkan-compatible GPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It does not work with most integrated GPUs.
