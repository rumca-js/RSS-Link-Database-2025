Here\u2019s my honest take, without hype or fear-mongering. First, from a belief perspective: I truly believe income doesn\u2019t come from a job itself \u2014 a job is just a means. What really matters is how adaptable and useful you are. Now, let\u2019s be practical. Before worrying about AI, ask yourself one simple question: Who are you right now? A business owner? An employee? A student? If you\u2019re a business owner: AI is not your enemy. It\u2019s leverage. You can use it to automate emails, customer support, internal processes, and decision-making. Less time wasted, more focus on growth. If you\u2019re an employee: The real risk isn\u2019t AI taking your job. The risk is someone else learning AI faster than you. If you work in research, AI can help you work 10x faster. If you work in customer support, you can build or manage AI systems that reduce workload and increase your value inside the ",

I got my camera and filmed the fire. I thought, &quot;This could be a good screensaver.&quot; I took the recordings and transformed them into a special format. I also built a weather generator with real sounds. I released the first version in 2004. Even though it was summer, it was immediately well-received by users. It soon became a massive hit and has been downloaded by a very large number of people. I was one of the first to release a fireplace app like this. I have released some new versions over the years.</p> <p>In 2011, my father became very ill. Before he passed away, I showed him the next version of the screensaver. He really liked it.</p> <p>Today, there are many mobile apps showing a fire. On mobile, mine is just one of many. But there isn&#39;t as much competition on the PC. Many people still use it there today, ",
