I won't deny that it was once a game I was embarrassed to be playing. But now? I'm all in, dude. I'm an English 27-year-old who is invested in Japanese horse racing. And if you too can push past your misgivings, you'll find one of the better strategy games released this year.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2025-umamusume-pretty-derby\">Read more</a></p>",

        "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/nightreign_NOFIMIK.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Back in May, FromSoftware stepped outside of its comfort zone and did something it hasn't done before: it released a multiplayer game. Sure, the Dark Souls series and <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042\">Elden Ring</a> both feature the ability to summon friends and invade foes, but <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign\">Nightreign</a> is FromSoftware fully committing to co-op play, and in the process delivering the most playful game in its history.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2025-elden-ring-nightreign-was-my-playground-for-experimentation\">Read more</a></p>",
