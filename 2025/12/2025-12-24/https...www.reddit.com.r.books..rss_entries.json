I\u2019m wondering if setting a higher goal would motivate me or just add pressure and I\u2019ve decided to increase my reading goal from 52 books a year to 60 books a year. It\u2019s not a huge increase but I want to challenge myself and I know audiobooks will help me too. There are many TBR lists on my shelf and there are so many books I want to read so 60 books feels justified for me. I don\u2019t want to miss my chance on this earth by skipping great books especially classics. When you think about it, there are millions of books out there and even if only 1% are gems, that\u2019s still hundreds of thousands of great books. I really don\u2019t want to miss out on them.

The almost cyclical/reincarnating nature of the working class and question of free will, and the concept of a rebellion needed for real change....all while addressing destruction, corruption and questions of morality.

There have been many instances where I\u2019ve found that the audio format hugely benefits the story, so much so that I couldn\u2019t imagine the experience without it. My personal favorite examples are Dungeon Crawler Carl (Jeff Hays is amazing), Joe Abercrombie\u2019s First Law universe, Project Hail Mary, and Daisy Jones and the Six.</p> <p>Without the narration of those books I truly feel like I\u2019d be missing out on part of the experience. However I know that there are some books where an audio format would hurt the storytelling: House of Leaves comes to mind. I was also informed that The Spear Cuts Through Water suffers as an audiobook. I want to dedicate more of my time to physically reading and was looking for recommendations that work better on paper compared to their audio counterparts</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",

In my point on view, the book it&#39;s mainly about an extreme desperation to escape the innate humane nature of carnal sin and to become naturally pure. First by becoming a Vegetarian (in the dream that propels such decision, the main character gets disgusted at the idea of having meat and guts, rather graphically being shoved into their mouths), the family responds to such decision with physically and emotionally violence which we come to learn was habitually done, the husband is apathic to this and decides to abandon the main character, the in law takes carnal desire on her (not beauty, nor passion, in the flowers in her body,, but ",

And each book gave me the distinct feel of Tim Robinson&#39;s most recent projects, that&#39;s the film Friendship and The Chair Company (TCC).</p> <p>I think they both satirise the American way of life by taking mundane social anxieties and amplifying them, making them surreal and grotesque. Like a nightmare of the American Dream. </p> <p>They both harness absurdist humor. Their characters, who are extremely neurotic and temperamental, are constantly pitted in highly tense and volatile situations that tend to spiral out of control. Add to that, dollops of existential angst and social alienation. </p> <p>I read Miss Lonelyhearts first, and started to notice comparisons by all the bizarre situations and characters the protagonist is faced with. Those odd little interactions that go on a tangent and spiral out of control. </p> <p>",
