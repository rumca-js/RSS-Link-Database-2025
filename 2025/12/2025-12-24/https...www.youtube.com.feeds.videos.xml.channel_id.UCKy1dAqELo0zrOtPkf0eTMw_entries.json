He has been gaming's best known auteur for decades, and his sheer talent for pushing the envelope can't be disputed, and yet, his fixation on bodily functions, toilet humour, and titillation is on full display in every one Hideo Kojima's games. So what are his daftest ideas that actually made it into published games? Well, here's what we think... but there's so many, you can probably tell us what we've missed in the comments.\n\nWith Metal Gear Solid, Hideo Kojima made the case for video games as a rich storytelling medium, and this innovation ultimately paved the way for modern gaming as we know it. With Death Stranding, he teamed up with popular television actor Norman Reedus to deliver a new kind of experience that pushed the boundaries",
