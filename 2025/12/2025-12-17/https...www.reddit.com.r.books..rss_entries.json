But my main issue is that while he raises a lot of big, compelling arguments, he often assumes the reader already understands things he never fully explains. He\u2019s very good at diagnosing problems but less clear about solutions, particularly with his claim that Black liberation depends on white liberation, which he never really defines in practical terms. The idea of \u201cthe fire next time\u201d works as a strong warning, but it\u2019s also vague, especially given that Baldwin doesn\u2019t actually believe in divine punishment, so the book ends up feeling more like a moral plea than a clear argument. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Acepokeboy\"> /u/Acepokeboy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

A couple I thought were boring suddenly read like they were written by someone who has actually lived a little, and now I get what they were aiming for. It made me wonder how many books I wrote off just because I wasn\u2019t the right reader yet. Probably the one that surprised me most was a novel I dropped after fifty pages because it felt slow and overly moody. Picked it up again last month on a random night and ended up reading until three in the morning. Same story, same writing, but it landed completely differently this time. I\u2019m curious how often this happens for other people.

I also understand that local bookstores will disappear if no one buys from them which is already happening as many of my local bookstores have closed in the past few years. (2 shops in 5 years) </p> <p>This is my dilemma, is it morally wrong to purchase books online when their prices are approximately 10\u201320% lower than those of local bookstores? Should I support local bookstores? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Delicious_Maize9656\"> /u/Delicious_Maize9656 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1poro9t/is_it_morally_wrong_to_buy_",

It\u2019s not always like tied to an adaptation either. Sometimes it\u2019s just one clip, one quote, or one person talking about it at the right moment, and suddenly it feels like everyone I think is reading the same thing. It\u2019s interesting to watch how these waves start. A book that once felt \u201cniche\u201d ends up everywhere, and people talk about it as if it just came out yesterday. I\u2019ve picked up a few older titles because of this and ended up loving them, so I\u2019m not complaining - just curious about what actually makes a book hit that second life. Have you noticed this too, and do you have any favorites that blew up again long after release?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway",
