In other news, Terminator: Survivors has been delayed indefinitely. The sci-fi survival game was announced a couple of years ago, and we haven't really seen much from it. And in related news, James Cameron is returning to the Terminator franchise once he's done with the upcoming Avatar: Fire and Ash. Cameron also stated that it's time for new characters in the series, so don't expect mainstay Arnold Schwarzenegger to return.\n\n#IGN #gaming",

        "description": "Destiny 2: Renegades expansion reviewed on PC and Xbox, also available on PlayStation.\n\nTo my surprise, Destiny 2: Renegades works a lot better than I thought a Star Wars crossover would, offering a light-hearted and often corny story, an extraction-inspired mode with some neat ideas, and an endgame dungeon that lives up to Destiny\u2019s strong track record. The main thing holding it back is that there just isn\u2019t much to it, with three maps you\u2019ll see a whole lot of while running Lawless Frontier, a short story that\u2019s been padded out by filler, and a dungeon that\u2019s far faster to complete than usual. Some new weapons, especially the Praxic Blade lightsabers, vehicles like the Behemoth walkers, and Renegade abilities that let you call in airstrikes on your adversaries, go a long way to mix up this overly familiar sandbox. It\u2019s definitely a breath of fresh air for Destiny 2 overall, it\u2019s just a bit of a shallow breath.",

But while the gears are aligned by the time credits roll, the genuine excitement hasn\u2019t quite started yet. Much of the opening half-hour feels like flicking through your quest log and rifling through your inventory to remind yourself of where you were, and the seemingly inconsequential vault-based storylines threaten to get lost among better ideas. But even with those problems, this is a good hour of television that signals even better things to come. \n\n#IGN #FalloutTVSeries #Fallout",
