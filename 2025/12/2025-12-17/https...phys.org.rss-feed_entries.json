Some regions, like the Hollywood Basin (a small region in and around the West Hollywood neighborhood), are increasing their reliance on these aquifers in order to reduce the amount of water imported from elsewhere. A new Caltech-led study provides the most detailed picture to date of how the Hollywood Basin responds to groundwater usage, revealing that current estimates of sustainable groundwater yield may be too high.",

Understanding these microbes is vital because they are one of the main drivers of the global ocean's life-support system; they move and recycle the carbon and nutrients that sustain all other marine life. By better understanding them, scientists can more accurately predict how the entire ocean ecosystem, and the global climate, will react to threats like pollution and ocean warming.",

        "description": "How can you tell if fruit has reached its optimal ripeness without picking it, touching it or carrying out any test that might damage it? A research team from the Department of Analytical Chemistry and Organic Chemistry at the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) has found the answer by applying near- and mid-infrared spectroscopy to the leaves closest to the fruit. They discovered that the technique allows reliable information to be obtained about the fruit's developmental state without damaging it.",

This innovation can help solve a major bottleneck in mosquito control strategies that rely on releasing only sterile males. The approach uses gene editing to produce dark males and pale females, offering a practical and safer alternative to current sex-separation techniques.",

Because RNA is both incredibly important to human life and health and poorly understood, the ability to tag disparate RNA with different colors and watch them, in real time, as they do their work is a giant step forward in understanding one of life's basic building blocks.",
