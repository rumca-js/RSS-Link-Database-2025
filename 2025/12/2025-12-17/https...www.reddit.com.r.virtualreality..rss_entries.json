Bitrate . I used the codec h264+ and whacked it up to 500 and the game looked perfect but gives high latency so therefore not very nice to play on . I lower bitrate and the game starts to look bad again. </p> <p>So how can I get round this to keep that bitrate up and make it playable ?</p> <p>I currently have a 500mg internet plan with a basic sky WiFi 6 router and a dedicated puppis prismxr WiFi 6 router that&#39;s connected by ethernet from router to pc and my vr headset connects to the dedicated router. </p> <p>What can I do to improve this ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/motormathersonfire\"> /u/motormathersonfire </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ppatf1/bitrate_problem_with_virtual_desktop/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <s",

I will not be the one giving the program so what ever I do have to be very simple for them to use. I messed around with Unity trying to do something similar 6 years ago but gave up.
