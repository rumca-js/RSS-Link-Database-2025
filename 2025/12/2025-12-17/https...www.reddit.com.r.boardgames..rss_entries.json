Games were submitted by players, categories were designed around how people actually play (2-player, 6+, production, etc.), and every category is decided entirely by community votes.</p> <p>It\u2019s intentionally grassroots and pretty small-scale, but we\u2019ve had solid participation so far and even a few publishers/designers recording short messages for the final video (which will premiere late January).</p> <p>I\u2019m posting here less to promote and more to ask:</p> <ul> <li>Do fan-voted awards like this feel meaningful to you?</li> <li>Are there categories you think matter more than what awards usually focus on?</li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019re curious, voting\u2019s open here. We already have 1,500 votes in!: <a href=\"https://gamingcaravan",
