        "description": "Thanks to CyberPowerPC for sponsoring this video. Check out the Christmas PC deals here: https://bit.ly/48ZL52t and go here for the Christmas Giveaway: https://bit.ly/4pZY4Hf\n\nHere's a 14-odd minute video that basically says \"Hardware Unboxed got it right\". In this follow-up coverage, we take a look at the undoubted quality improvements of FSR Redstone ML frame generation over the legacy FSR 3.1 \"analytical\" version, before looking at the reason we don't recommend using it: the delivery of frames is so uneven, it can actually look less smooth than running with frame-gen off.\n\nVisit the new Digital Foundry website: https://www.digitalfoundry.net\n\nGo here to check out DF merch! https://store.digitalfoundry.net\n\nSubscribe for more Digital Foundry: http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe\n\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:02:47 Image Quality improvements\n00:04:48 Frame-Time Issues and Unconsistent Frame Pacing\n00:13:30 Conclusion",
