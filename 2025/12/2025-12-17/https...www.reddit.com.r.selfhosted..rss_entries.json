Both for personal stuff as well as a agent that can help out colleagues at work.</p> <p>I&#39;m fairly skilled as a Python programmer so I naturally liked PydanticAI as it just worked. I created some MCP servers using FasterMCP that exposed a couple of methods under /docs for testability as well as providing the /mcp endpoint for the AI to use. I don&#39;t like to have to resort to yet another tool for testing the MCP so I kind of liked that I could use MCP and the docs page for documentation/testing. However, even though I liked PydanticAI there&#39;s always more stuff to add and tweak so it quickly grows into a rather big project. Users need to be handled correctly, so does memory. What makes coding an AI agent great is that you, based on the user, can wire up the MCP",
