        "description": "How do you grapple with national history, legacy, and the stories you tell yourself? Clint Smith is the author of the narrative nonfiction, How the Word is Passed, and the poetry collection, Above Ground. Clint joins Chris to talk about the cognitive dissonances that shaped American history. From understanding the complexities of Thomas Jefferson, who wrote \u201call men are created equal\u201d while enslaving over 600 people \u2013 to reflecting on growing up in New Orleans \u2013 a major site for domestic slave trades, Clint urges you to examine historical contradictions. He also discusses his love for poetry and why it\u2019s crucial to teach joyous moments in Black history too. So students won\u2019t see slavery and Jim Crow as the totality of the black historical experience but can envision themselves of possibilities beyond subjugation.\n\nJoin us in person at a TED conference: https://tedtalks.social/events\nBecome a TED Member to support our mission: https://ted.com/membership\nSubscribe to a TED newsletter: h",
