Do you think it&#39;s worth the upgrade? Should i upgrade or wait a few more years? </p> <p>(Upgrading CPU is not easily possible because of DDR5 Prices) Do you think that GDDR6 is also going up in cost? Afaik is only DDR5 or GDDR7 the issue.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/neogoth1337\"> /u/neogoth1337 </a> <br/> <span><a hre",

This was a rarer problem on windows where most crashing games could be alt-tabbed out of and killed.
