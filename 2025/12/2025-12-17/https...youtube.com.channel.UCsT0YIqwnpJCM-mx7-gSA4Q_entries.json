Drawing on cutting-edge science and deeply human moments, she explains why connection, intention, and even imperfection are essential for building resilient brains. This talk challenges us to think more carefully about how technology fits into raising future generations. Dr. Meghan Puglia is a neuroscientist, storyteller, educator, and data enthusiast \u2013 passionate about understanding how brains are built and how early experiences shape who we become.\n\nIn her own words, \"I lead the Developmental Neuroanalytics Lab, where we use brain imaging and data science to understand how babies grow, learn, and thrive \u2013 especially those born prematurely or at risk for developmental challenges. My work looks at how biology and experience come together to influence each child\u2019s unique developmen",

In The Fairness Question Behind Salaries, Sandro Colombo questions this promise and shares his story of co-creating an impact-driven pay system. A story that includes bold intentions, painful missteps, and a phase where everything felt broken. It shows how a team learned, grew, and redefined fairness together - and why progress in compensation has less to do with formulas but more with ownership, trust, and continuous (self-) development. Sandro Colombo is co-founder of indigo online AG, a Swiss software agency creating digital solutions with purpose and impact. After starting out as an apprentice application engineer, he co-founded indigo at 19 and has led the company through growth, innovation, and organizational transformation including adopting holacracy \u2014 a change that reshaped both structure and culture.

The education system seems to have a singular view of success that is only achieved with a narrow path filled with methodical examinations. However, this close minded view has lead to the crushing of creativity and individuality as well as curiosity and has left many students demoralised and discouraged from pursuing education and knowledge. This has also lead to anxiety and the phenomenon that is burn out. Is this singular view of education helpful or harmful and what would be alternatives? And can exams truly assess our understanding of a topic when many are more focused on learning exam technique rather than understanding the content?

It belongs to those who are brave enough to stand there despite not being perfect.\nToday, I embrace every opportunity to speak up\u2014whether at forums, Open Mic events, flag team performances, or even the U.S. Congress. What I hope to share with you is this: you don\u2019t have to wait until you feel ready. When you stay present and stay true to what you love, each moment on stage becomes a turning point that shapes you into a stronger version of yourself. \n\n\u6211\u662f\u674e\u7dc1 Jacqueline\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u7528\u71b1\u60c5\u599d\u9ede\u4eba\u751f\u7684\u8868\u6f14\u8005\u3002\u6211\u7684\u8868\u6f14\u65c5\u7a0b\u59cb\u65bc\u570b\u5c0f\uff0c\u90a3\u6642\u6211\u662f\u6821\u5712\u88e1\u7684\u821e\u8e48\u5bb6\u8207\u5c0f\u6f14\u54e1\uff0c\u76e1\u60c5\u63ee\u7051\u6c57\u6c34\u3002\u5347\u4e0a\u570b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u7a7f\u4e0a\u660e\u9053\u4e2d\u5b78\u85cd\u8272\u52d5\u611f\u6a02\u5718\u65d7\u968a\u7684\u7ae5\u8ecd\u670d\uff0c\u7528\u65d7\u5e5f\u821e\u52d5\u9752",

The strict discipline and cultural differences once left me discouraged, but with support from friends and a willingness to reframe my thoughts, I learned to turn pressure into motivation and loneliness into self-reflection. This journey taught me that challenges change the moment we change our perspective. More than saluting or sailing, it was the beginning of learning how to face life with a positive and resilient mindset. \n\n\u6211\u662f\u738b\u5b5c\u8a60\uff0c\u4e00\u500b\u5c0d\u4e16\u754c\u4ec0\u9ebc\u90fd\u597d\u5947\u3001\u4e09\u5206\u9418\u71b1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u71b1\u5230\u6703\u885d\u53bb\u7f8e\u570b\u8ecd\u6821\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u8eab\u908a\u7684\u4eba\u5e38\u5f62\u5bb9\u6211\u8df3\u75db\u3001\u53db\u9006\u3001\u56fa\u57f7\uff0c\u56e0\u70ba\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u4eba\u8aaa\u300c\u4f60\u4e0d\u8981\u9019\u6a23\u505a\u300d\uff0c\u6211\u5927\u6982\u5c31\u6703\u7acb\u523b\u53bb\u8a66\u8a66\u770b\u3002\u5f9e\u570b\u6a02\u73a9\u5230\u9435\u4eba\u4e09\u9805\uff0c\u518d\u7a81\u7136\u98db\u53bb\u8ecd\u6821\uff0c\u5927\u5bb6\u90fd\u5728\u554f\u6211\uff1a\u300c\u4f60\u5230\u5e95\u60f3\u5e79\u561b\uff1f\u300d\n\u8001\u5be6\u8aaa\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u53cd\u6b63\u5c31\u9806\u5176\u81ea\u7136\u5427\uff01\u9019\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u70ba\u6211\u7684\u4eba\u751f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u7fa9\uff01\u53bb\u5e74\u6691\u5047\uff0c\u5728\u6211\u4ed4\u7d30\u601d\u8003\u4e86\u6574\u6574\u4e09\u79d2\u5f8c\uff0c\u6211\u548c\u670b\u53cb\u6c7a\u5b9a\u5728\u7562\u696d\u9694\u5929\u98db\u53bb\u7f8e\u570b\u8ecd\u6821\u590f\u4ee4\u71df\u3002\u7d50\u679c\uff0c\u624d\u525b\u5230\u4e0d\u5230\u4e09\u5c0f\u6642\uff0c\u6211\u5011\u5c31\u958b\u59cb\u5077\u5077\u88fd\u4f5c\u9003\u8dd1\u8a08\u756b\u3002\n\u9019\u5834",

To act righteously is to face the truth, to choose the path of integrity, and to work for the common good, even when the road ahead is uncertain. My journey took me from international climate conferences to community-driven initiatives for net-zero transition. Along the way, I\u2019ve seen how the voices of youth, women, and vulnerable communities can rise above the noise \u2014 and, when amplified, can shape just transition policies.\nIn this talk, I will share how we can transform empathy into action, and action into systemic change. Because in the face of the climate emergency, every honest step we take can become the spark that lights a more just and sustainable future.e climate crisis is the defining challenge o",

For too long, our society has been shaped by the traditional belief that academic achievement is the sole path to success, where students are judged only by scores and rankings. Yet education must be more than grades. Over the 25 years at Mingdao, we have encouraged students not only to study for exams, but also to discover their potential and talents, and to reflect on the relationships between self and others, and between individuals and society.

With so few of us compared to the crowds in traditional schools, homeschoolers often seem mysterious and easy to label. I was homeschooled through elementary school, then joined a private junior high later on. At first, I learned alongside my mom, figuring out how to self-study while trying hard to shake off those labels. Then, when I stepped into my dream private school, my dad helped me redefine what being \u201ca homeschooler\u201d could mean. This is the story of me and my label \u2014 how we fought, made peace, and now walk forward together. Homeschooling isn\u2019t just a system, it\u2019s a skill; a label isn\u2019t only a stigma, it can be a badge.What I hope listene",
