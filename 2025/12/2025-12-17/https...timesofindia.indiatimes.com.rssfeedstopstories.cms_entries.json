Programs such as income-driven repayment plans, Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF), Teacher Loan Forgiveness (TLF), and disability-based forgiveness can lower monthly payments or cancel debt entirely. Surveys show significant portions of borrowers are unaware of these options. Financial advisors urge borrowers to explore StudentAid.gov and related resources to access repayment plans, avoid default, and reduce overall student debt.",
