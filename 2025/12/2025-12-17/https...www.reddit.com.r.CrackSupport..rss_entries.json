I had to reinstall my game for unrelated reasons, but saved the DLC files (EP, GP, SP folders) elsewhere and then moved them back into the Documents/Electronic Arts/The Sims 4 where they&#39;re meant to go, and reinstalled the DLC unlocker. For some reason, the game now only recognizes SOME of the cracked DLCs. Specifically, it no longer recognizes:</p> <p>EP14-20 (Horse ranch-Adventure Awaits), SP20-74 (All of the kits + Home chef hustle stuff pack + crystal creations stuff pack)</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried everything I can think of, including various combinations of uninstalling the DLC unlocker, redownloading the DLC folders manually, moving the DLC folders back in, and reinstalling the DLC unlocker. Tried looking online to see if anyone had similar issues, but it was all &quot;all or nothing&",

The game itself works, and in the game it shows that I own the DLCs, but it also says that they need to be downloaded.
