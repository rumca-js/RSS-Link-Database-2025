Only a day after my post here I got in contact with a traveling warlock who offered to help me. They agreed to mediate a deal between me and Nazdaqhar so I don&#39;t get locked into some awful pact. </p> <p>I decided to take up both offers, an increased mana pool and the passive regeneration. The warlock confirmed with Nazdaqhar that I would only be casting conjuration spells for the ancient one. In return I would be getting a mana pool that lasts me 2 weeks instead of the previous 1. The regeneration would get me mana at 125% of the speed I spend it at, so I get a tendays mana in about a week; same obviously goes for lesser time periods.</p> <p>After the deal was &quot;signed&quot; Nazdaq",

She is arriving her 3rd year of life, and naturally, I have been administering minor healing spells through &#39;kissing boo-boos&#39; whenever she is in distress. However, due to local balls and social appearances, she has caught various ailments and illnesses and spread them to me. I didn&#39;t think I was a frail wizard, but I do believe that I am developing my third cold this season. I do not wish to be sick anymore, and would like to take measures against acquiring these curses. The young heiress will panic if i do not administer boo-boo healing though, as she is considerably superstitious. Do I generate a small force-field around my lips? Do I simply blow her kisses instead? Or do I simply mix nightly Vitamin-C elixirs? Any and all ideas are welcome. Thank you, fellow wizards.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/saltwater_flaaffy\"> /",
