I ran an audit with faceseek on an old avatar I used for a clear net tech forum years ago.</p> <p>Even though I used a burner email and a VPN back then, the AI linked that old photo to a group pic from a high school reunion that was posted last month. Your bone structure is a permanent link. If you\u2019ve ever let your face touch the clear net even once, you can be tied back to your real identity in seconds.
