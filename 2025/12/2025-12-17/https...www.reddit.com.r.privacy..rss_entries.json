The only way to get it back is to send them some sort of age verification via an ID or my CREDIT CARD. im stuck on what to do, I want the feature back as its one of the ways I communicate with my friends but also am really not sure on giving tiktok (of all apps) my personal information with a picture of my face. I just want to know the risks that go along with this so I can think about the pros and cons and make a decision from there. So, should I? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Javier_theAmerican\"> /u/Javier_theAmerican </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1poifoe/tiktok_is_asking_to_verify_my_age_via_an_id_is_it/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1poifoe/tiktok_is_asking_to_verify_my_age",
