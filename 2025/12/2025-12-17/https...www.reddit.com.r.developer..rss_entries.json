        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, everyone! I recently started a Nonprofit that will be based around an app/website. All initial donations are going to be going towards the app and website development. I&#39;ve fully made the website/app through AI (Base44) to help visually show the idea to potential partners, but I don&#39;t want my actual app/website to be built by AI so I plan on going through a real developer. I&#39;m curious if having that template of exactly what I want would possibly help with the overall cost or the time it would take a developer to make. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OkResearcher8678\"> /u/OkResearcher8678 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1pon5w0/do_ai_created_sites_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1pon5w0/do_ai_created_sites_help/\">[comments]</a></span>",
