Unfortunately the website shutdown back then but I continued journaling manually on my own with the help of google docs.</p> <p>After a few years, managing google docs got a little crazy and not as sustainable so I decided to build myself a successor / alternative to OhLife over at <a href=\"https://deardiario.com/\">https://deardiario.com</a></p> <p>The premise is pretty much the same: the web app automatically shows you a prior entry (yesterday, last week, last month, or last year depending on what&#39;s available) so you can read your prior entry before you write today&#39;s entry. This has kept it fun and fresh for myself throughout the years and it has been really interesting to see how far I&#39;ve come (or not come at all!) a year later. Puts things in perspective and just makes journaling more fun!</p> <p>Let me know if you give it a try and if you have any feedback! It is",

I felt like every time I needed to quickly convert an image or format some JSON, the top results was always the same: certain limits or they asked for a subscription.</p> <p>So I built Celestools. It is a collection of utilities like a secure P2P file sender, image converter, and markdown editor. Most of the tools run entirely in your browser for privacy. I just released an update that lets you log in to save your work to a personal dashboard, but you can still use everything as a guest.</p> <p>It is completely free to use.

I noticed that getting votes was the hardest part for creators, so I added a <strong>Share feature</strong> and I am currently working on a <strong>&quot;Voter Prize Pool&quot;</strong> to reward people who vote.</p> <p><strong>I need your help:</strong> I am still refining the platform.

Recently, I&#39;ve had teachers mention to me that many kids don&#39;t read often in their free time.</p> <p>Today many kids have easy access to videogames and social media. Which leads to lower incline to read in their free time. Through research, I found only 30% of kids who actually enjoy reading on their own (a bad habit for adulthood).</p> <p>I wonder if we can take the combine games with reading to create something that improves reading/speech in kids. While also motivating them to READ on their own. </p> <p>My roommate and I are building a game with FUN mechanics are around vocabulary and pronunciation. We plan on expanding to more games after we our real product on Unity.</p> <p>I linked the <strong>scrappy prototype</strong> below (unfortunately videos are not allowed).
