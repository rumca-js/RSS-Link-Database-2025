Qatar\u2019s PM stressed that aid must enter Gaza without conditions and that any stabilisation force must act impartially. \nDiscussions included the force's potential role in disarming Hamas, though many obstacles remain. \nUS officials hope to announce the force's composition early in the new year. It is proposed to consist largely of Indonesian and Turkish troops, raising concerns about language barriers with Arabic-speaking Palestinian residents of Gaza.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Alan Fisher joins us live from Washington, DC to discuss the latest developments.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www",

He detailed the severe risk of hypothermia and disease due to a lack of warm clothing and adequate shelter amidst a collapsed healthcare system. While UNICEF is distributing winter kits and blankets, he stressed the aid is insufficient for the scale of over a million children in need. Cricks emphasised that living in tents for months is unsustainable and called for more permanent solutions. He noted that although the fragile ceasefire has allowed more aid to enter, the sheer scale of destruction remains the overwhelming challenge.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/alj",
