So I pulled out the Govee Outdoor Lights and turned my home into the brightest, most colorful spot on the block.\n\nThe transformation was insane \u2014 and honestly, I think I might have a real shot at winning this thing.\n\nIf you like this video - don't forget to subscribe :)\n\nProduction Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound www.epidemicsound.com",
