While you can't see the full details of the operator skins, the silhouettes clearly hint at operators for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus in his power armor. Call of Duty's big IP collaborations also usually come packed with events for players to participate in. It's uncertain if the skins will be included in an event pass or as shop bundles for purchase.</p><div data-embed-type=\"tweet\" data-src=\"https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/2001351763375325384\" data-has-image=\"true\"><blockquote align=\"center\" class=\"twitter-tw",
