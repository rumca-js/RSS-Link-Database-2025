        "description": "Trailer For Normal in 4K ULTRA HD Quality\n\nNormal Plot : Odenkirk plays a sheriff who arrives at his post in the Minnesota town of Normal looking for a little peace and quiet. What\u2019s supposed to be an un-eventful place becomes anything but when a botched bank robbery inadvertently exposes the town\u2019s dark secrets.\n\nIf he hadn\u2019t already before, Bob Odenkirk proved that he was more than capable as an action star with the film Nobody (2021). The actor of Better Call Saul fame fits perfectly into the role of average guy turned ass-kicking hero. And it looks like he\u2019ll once again do just that in the trailer for Normal, a new neo-western from director Ben Wheatley (Kill List) and writer Derek Kolstad (John Wick).\n\nAll The Videos In The Channel Are Enhanced To 4K (3840\u2009\u00d7\u20092160 px; also known as Ultra HD and UHD) Quality.\n\nNORMAL Trailer (4K ULTRA HD) 2026 | Bob Odenkirk",
