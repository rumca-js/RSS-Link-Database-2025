However, many software engineers remain hesitant to adopt them. There are two main reasons for this: unfamiliar syntax and potential performance penalty. Whereas the first issue is more individual, the second one is general. Let\u2019s have a look at it together! In this talk, we'll explore the implementation details of std::expected, explore techniques for decomposing code, and demonstrate how to leverage copy elision to avoid unnecessary resource allocations. I'll compare the performance of a monadic interface with traditional approaches, including exceptions and return codes, using real-world production code samples to highlight common usage patterns. This talk will be useful for software engineers interested in adopting std::expected but ca",
