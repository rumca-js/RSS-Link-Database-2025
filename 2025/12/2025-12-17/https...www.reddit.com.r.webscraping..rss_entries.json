This site has quite stringent and tricky measures. The text is scrambled in the html but then unscrambled by a custom font applied by css. It&#39;s scrambled when I copy and paste manually, it&#39;s scrambled when I try to vibe-code and scrape the innertext/dom with playwright. I tried to access the api, but that&#39;s secured as well. Is it possible to scrape this besides the old screenshot and OCR route which takes a lot of computing power for this many novels and chapters? I know one option is manually making a key to decript after downloading the fonts but I&#39;d prefer to avoid that since the fonts are changed like every two days or so. I feel like I&#39;ve exhausted all",
