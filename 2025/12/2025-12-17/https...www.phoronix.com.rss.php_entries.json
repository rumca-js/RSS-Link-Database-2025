        "description": "Since receiving the Gigabyte R284-A92-AAL1 a while back as a Xeon 6900 series 2U server platform to replace the failed Intel AvenueCity reference server, I have been getting caught-up in fresh Xeon 6980P Granite Rapids benchmarks with the latest software updates over the past year. I've provided fresh looks at the DDR5-6400 vs. MRDIMM-8800 performance, the AMX benefits for AI, SNC3 vs. HEX mode, Latency Optimized Mode, Cache Aware Scheduling, and more with the fresh Linux software stack and this production Gigabyte server platform. One of the areas I have been meaning to re-visit is a fresh head-to-head benchmark battle between 5th Gen AMD EPYC \"Turin\" and Intel Xeon 6 \"Granite Rapids\". In this article is a 128-core showdown between the Xeon 6980P and EPYC 9755 128-core processors with the latest open-source Linux software as of the end of 2025.",
