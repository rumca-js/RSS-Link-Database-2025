        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a viral op-ed calls attention to the extreme institutional discrimination against white males. Lots of people are acting shocked by it. But this is not new information. Also, Congress \u2014 which is controlled by Republicans, by the way \u2014 removes a Robert E. Lee statue and replaces it with some black woman you\u2019ve never heard of. And Kamala Harris might consider running for president again. I for one am really concerned about this and make a plea for the mercy and grace democrats are well known for. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show.\n\nEp.1709\n\n-- -- --\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos daily. https://www.youtube.com/@mattwalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\nClick here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\n-- -- --\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:32 Opening\n01:52 - 21:43 How Anti-White Male Discrimination Is The Root Of Our Decline\n24:02 - 47:17 The Robert E Lee Statue Gets Replaced By Barbara Rose Johns In Capitol Building   \n49",
