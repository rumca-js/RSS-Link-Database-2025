I\u2019ve been searching for a book, yet everthing I find is rather boring or my teacher doesn\u2019t allow it. So far, we have read A Long Way Down, The Lord of the Flies, and Romeo and Juliet. So, anyone has any book suggestions that are really interesting? I like things like Harry Potter, LQBTQIA+ based books, adventure, fantasy, mental health, sci-fi, phycological, poetry, topics like that. I quite dislike reading, so anything that will keep me on the edge of my seat while I turn pages would be great!</p> <p>Again, needs to be about the Adolescent Experience, Teenage life, and basically growing up!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YOUR_MOMZ_BEANZ\"> /u/YOUR_MOMZ_BEANZ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ppbc2t/need_books_based_off_",

Romance is okay, but nothing rushed, I prefer slow burn.</p> <p>I am also a big fan of Castiel and Dean Winchester from Supernatural, which would be something like angel x human being while the angel was supposed to kill the human being but rebelled and fell for him, which happened in only one of infinite timelines.</p> <p>Thank you for every recommendation! :) I will look through every single one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mychildfreeass\"> /u/mychildfreeass </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pp80dh/fantasy_supernatural_beings_angel",

I&#39;ll start by saying that i know Italian but I can read english too so those are the languages I&#39;m looking for. Now, I&#39;m okay with any kind of book, but of course I would like something that tells the truth about history and that could give me an analysis of war in general or an analysis of a specific war. It would be great to have more options so to make a list of books to read. I&#39;m probably not prepared for a big book that only have a deep philosophical analysis, but if any of you have any suggestions on that kind of books too, I&#39;d be happy to hear it. Also, you can suggest also books that do not talk about wars specifically but even revolutions, I don&#39;t think they can be called wars so I say that just to be sure.

I need a short romance book, because if she finds it &quot;too long&quot; she won&#39;t read it (I&#39;d say something that is not over 300 pages long). I&#39;d prefer not to give her a book with spice because I think that she might refuse to try other types of books if I do so, however, I&#39;m open to any sugestions you may have.

And to be frank I grow tired of liking the work of white women only to find out they&#39;re transphobic anti-vaxxers or have become grifters in recent times. I&#39;d much rather read literature that is written from the POV of women of colour. But I feel like I&#39;m doing myself an injustice by ignoring this sect of literature. Margaret Atwood could very well be a right wing grifter that only cares about the liberation of white women, but does that mean her work is entirely void of meaning or relevance? I don&#39;t know.

But maybe a book to change that type of view. If you have read any of the many depressing, albeit great books about racism in the U.S. and the Caste system, then i want you to recommend me a book that is like the opposite of that.
