Sci-fi that is interested in thinking about how people&#39;s sexuality might manifest in the future. In ideas of transhumanism. How might people want to look, and how might they go about that? How might they modify their body to be more appealing - or more fetishistic? Alter their DNA? How would various alien contact - and completely different alien approaches to sexuality and gender - affect human society? Will we immediately Rule 34 any alien encounter (or will they exploit humans)? Will sex continue to be sold and advertised as now - more egregious, or less capitalistic? What bizarre - even twisted - outcomes might occur? What new ethical considerations arise?</p> <p>I&#39;ll confess ",

I think it\u2019s logistics. Or more precisely, the lack of them.</p> <p>In medieval worlds, the causal chain between decision and consequence is short. A king decides to go to war, and the war happens. An army can be raised in weeks or months, not decades. Weapons are forged locally. Strategy lives in human heads, not in spreadsheets, committees, or industrial pipelines. Power is concentrated, personal, and legible. Like, for example, a Knight can be trained in weeks or months. And he can single-handedly be the cause for an army winning a battle, although I guess that can be a bit of stretch so I get if people want to contest that, but at least in a fantasy setting, I think that&#39;s common.</p> <p>Contrast that with anything even vaguely moder",

But my cousin is more nerdy (as am I) and so I wanted to do his portrait (along with his wife) in the style of a franchise they both like. He said he likes A song of ice and fire. But since I&#39;ve never watched Game of Thrones or read the books, I&#39;ve come to reddit for help. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can make a portrait in this style? Would it just be medieval type of clothes? I&#39;m having a hard time with this one since its a novel series so I dont have much imagery to go off of.</p> <p>Any suggestions are much appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd_Pop_4448\"> /u/Odd_Pop_4448 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1pomdie/cousin_loves_a_song_of_ice_and_fire_how_can_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1pomdie/c",
