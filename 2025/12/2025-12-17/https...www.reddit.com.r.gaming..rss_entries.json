It respected my time and did not feel bloated.</p> <p>Other 2025 games that really stood out to me:</p> <p>Hades 2 because every run still feels fun and fast.</p> <p>Ball x Pit because it is easy to jump into and hard to stop.</p> <p>Pokemon Legends Z A because the real time combat finally felt new.</p> <p>Dispatch because the writing kept pulling me forward.</p> <p>So, I am curious.
