I am speaking with seo companies in my area and a couple agree my site is outdated and could use a rebuild which I completely understand. My concern is my site is our only form of marketing and I&#39;m concerned with someone building out a new site for us do do time it would take to rank the new site. We need all the calls we can get in the winter since it is our slow period. One company suggested if I wanted to keep the old site since it does produce and he could build a new site with a slightly different name like &quot;AAA Company Name&quot; with a different phone number to track results. He would then seo monthly this new site. He stated there are ways to do this without red flagging google or confusing search engines. Curious as what some of you think k about this strategy and if it seams solid. Thank you all.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"http",

It&#39;s been a while since having to fix others issues, what I&#39;m womder is, can I download the images and reupload with the correct name and update the title to the same area in Media in WordPress and it will replace it on the page, or would I need to go to each page and reupload there?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nectar_agency\"> /u/nectar_agency </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1poq3bi/reupload_images_into_media_area_of_wordpress/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/S",
