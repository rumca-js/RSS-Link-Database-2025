But in the grip of the pandemic, Cook found himself rediscovering the sound of \u2014 and his love for \u2014 piano. Now five years on, Cook has released a solo piano album called Appalachia Borealis, produced by his lifelong friend, Justin Vernon (he of Bon Iver).\n\nPhil Cook visited The Current studio to play selections from 'Appalachia Borealis'; watch a performance of \"Ambassador Cathedral\" above.\n\nMusician\nPhil Cook \u2013\u00a0piano\n\nCredits\nGuest \u2013\u00a0@PhilCookMusicNC \nHost \u2013\u00a0Bill DeVille\nProducer \u2013\u00a0Derrick Stevens\nAudio \u2013\u00a0Cameron Wiley\nVideo \u2013\u00a0Ruben Schneiderman, Will Keeler\nGraphics \u2013\u00a0Nat",
