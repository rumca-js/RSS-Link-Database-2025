The holiday show is a tradition we love \u2014 and have missed \u2014 at NPR Music, so when considering an artist to deck the halls of the office, I kept coming back to Sixpence None the Richer.\n\nSo much of the holiday season, especially as we grow older, is about finding a balance between bright lights and dark nights.
