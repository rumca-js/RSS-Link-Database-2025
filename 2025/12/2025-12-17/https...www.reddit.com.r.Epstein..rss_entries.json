They are photos of pages 13 and 14 of a Virgin Islands newspaper article from Thursday 28 February 2019 - which are the 2nd and 3rd pages of a 3 page article.

Institutions were accused of protecting elites. Expectations were set very high.</p> <p>Then reality hit. DOJ and FBI concluded there was no verified comprehensive client list and released limited, contextualized material. Around the same time, it became undeniable that Trump\u2019s name appears in Epstein-related documents, including flight logs and contacts.</p> <p>That mattered because the exposure was no longer one-sided.</p> <p>Bongino did not publicly blame Trump, but his role depended on disclosure producing explosive results. Instead, transparency produced ambiguity, legal limits, and political discomfort across factions.</p> <p>The backlash was not just about Epstein.
