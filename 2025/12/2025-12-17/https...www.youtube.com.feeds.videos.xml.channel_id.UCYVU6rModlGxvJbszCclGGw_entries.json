        "description": "Sometimes we do not have a choice but to use Windows 11. I will tame Windows 11 so all the privacy invading features are turned off. And the only way to do that is to use a Local Account and this has to be a long term solution.\n\nBut this is a complex process since you must follow certain steps or Microsoft will have a hardware record of your device. And if you have Windows 11 Home, Microsoft does its best to lock you out of local account options. And many solutions offered out there like OOBE Bypass no longer work. Rufus method works but is not guaranteed for the long term. Here, we offer a safe long term solution.\n\n----------------------------------\nBraX3 Privacy Phone is on https://braxtech.net\n-----------------------------------\nBrax Virtual Phone, De-Googled Phones, BytzVPN, BraxMail, BraxRouters are available on https://brax.me\n-----------------------------------\nMerch Store \nhttps://my-store-c37a50.creator-spring.com/\n-----------------------------------\n\n\nI'm the Internet Privac",
