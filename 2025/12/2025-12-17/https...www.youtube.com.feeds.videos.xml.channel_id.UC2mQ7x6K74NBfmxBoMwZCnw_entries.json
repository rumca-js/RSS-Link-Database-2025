        "description": "Luka organized a game with a guest where he would play Warhammer 40k 10th Edition on two tables.  For this they are playing Space Marines vs Eldar, and they split it into two games.  The first game is above ground on a typical gothic ruined table that you would expect in Warhammer 40k.  The goal is to get as many units below ground as possible.  The second game then takes those units that made it underground and plays another game in the Depths of Perdition tile system, which is great for smaller games like Boarding Actions, Kill Team, Necromunda, and smaller games of Warhammer 40k 10th Edition.\n\nCheck out the Depths of Perdition at MiniWarGaming.com/perdition",
