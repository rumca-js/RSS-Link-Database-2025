Every time I dive into guides, one says RAID 5 is perfect for balancing speed and protection with its parity blocks across at least three drives, letting you survive one failure while keeping reads fast, but then another warns it&#39;s terrible for heavy writes due to the overhead of calculating parity, and you might as well go with RAID 6 for dual parity on four or more drives to handle two failures without sweating. RAID 0 sounds great for striping data across two or more drives to boost throughput and cut latency, like when I used it for temporary video editing files where speed mattered more than safety, but lose one drive and everything&#39;s gone, no redundancy at all, which bit me once when a cheap HDD crapped out mid-project.</p> <p>Then there&#39;s RAID 1, mirrorin",

I found out this is because I have a bunch of sparse files. Mostly torrent files that haven\u2019t finished downloading. Since, drag and drop is extremely inefficient when trying to copy over an entire drive to another, I had Claude write me a powershell 7 robocopy script that would copy everything over with the parameters I wanted. I wanted all the files and folders to be transferred with the original metadata and for any file permission issues to be handled so that I would have admin access to everything from the destination Drive once everything was copied over.
