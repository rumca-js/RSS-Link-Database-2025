Here, we present MatAgent, a generative approach for inorganic materials discovery that harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). By combining a diffusion-based generative model for crystal structure estimation with a predictive model for property evaluation, MatAgent uses iterative, feedback-driven guidance to steer material exploration precisely toward user-defined targets.

It\u2019s fast, clean, and perfectly replaces the search bar for immediate answers. But for actual projects where I need to keep the data, I use Skywork. The big difference is that it treats research as an asset, not just a chat. It saves the sources and PDFs into a Project Container that I can use for docs later.
