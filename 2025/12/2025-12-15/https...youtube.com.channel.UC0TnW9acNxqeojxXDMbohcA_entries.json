In this special year-end episode, I answer your questions\u2014from the deep stuff about purpose and motivation, to the uncomfortable realities of change, burnout, failure, and dealing with unsupportive family. I also share the behind-the-scenes chaos of building SOLVED this year, what I learned about making massive, meaningful content, and what\u2019s coming in 2026 (spoiler: boundaries, ego, and maybe some live shows).\n\nThis is part personal, part philosophical, and part therapy session disguised as a podcast. If you\u2019ve been wondering what\u2019s next\u2014or why you feel stuck\u2014this one\u2019s for you. See you in 2026.\n\nReady to stop listening to podcasts and actually start taking action?
