Every day brings a new benchmark, a new \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d model, or a new claim that yesterday\u2019s architecture is obsolete. For developers tasked with building their first AI application, particularly within a larger enterprise, the sheer volume of announcements creates a paralysis of choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rankings won\u2019t help.

Generative AI (genAI) and agentic AI tools are redefining how code is written, tested, and deployed \u2014 even as experts debate the true productivity gains they facilitate. Data management is converging around unified lakehouse architectures, the Apache Iceberg table format, and streaming technologies such as Apache Kafka, bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insight.
