At least that\u2019s what we\u2019re told over and over again: By forgiving, we can set ourselves free.\n\nBut is there a cost to forgiveness? Are we forgiving too quickly and too often?\n\nToday\u2019s guest is philosopher Myisha Cherry, whose book Failures of Forgiveness critiques our cultural obsession with forgiving those who have done us wrong. She\u2019s not against forgiveness \u2014 that would be weird \u2014 but she says we ought to be more intentional about why we do it, more aware that the expectation to practice forgiveness often lands on the most vulnerable people, and more concerned about what gets lost when we treat forgiveness as the only path to healing.  \n\nSean and Myisha discuss the 2015 Charleston church shooting",
