The idea came from wanting something lightweight and resilient that doesn&#39;t rely on heavy frameworks or constant high-speed access.</p> <p>Why I think it&#39;s useful: If you&#39;re in a spotty network area or just prefer minimal setups, it deploys quickly and is censorship-resistant since it&#39;s global via Cloudflare.
