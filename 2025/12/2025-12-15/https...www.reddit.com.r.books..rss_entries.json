Though it\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve read \u201cOranges are not the only fruit,\u201d this felt like reading a carbon copy. I thought the main character Lucy only seemed to develop in realizing that she isn\u2019t very nice as a person. I ended up getting bored at parts and angry at others. I really wanted to like it, but felt disappointed. There were parts I enjoyed and I thought the author had some beautiful descriptions, but parts of the plot and characters felt flat to me. Has anyone else read it and felt similarly? Or enjoyed it more? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BafflingBinturong\"> /u/BafflingBinturong </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pnjvf9/thoughts_on_sunburn_by_chloe_michelle_howarth/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comme",

That said, I think the book is in fact incredibly political, and I wonder if the political undertones are simply less obvious if you have no sense of Austria&#39;s history with Nazism. (FWIW, I read the book as part of an American book club, and my own &quot;sense&quot; is largely derived from Google.) To that end, I&#39;m curious if any continental Redditors (ideally Austrian) are familiar with the work and can speak to its perceived political valence, if any. Alternatively, maybe I&#39;m reading too much into the text.</p> <p>For example: <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Towards the end of the book, it&#39;s revealed that the landlord Kostja was previously a member of the Nazi party and &quot;inherited&quot; the cafe although he &quot;never did anything to earn it.&quot; (Ch.34) My understanding of this line, then, is t",
