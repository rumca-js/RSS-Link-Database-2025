The ASRock AMD BC-250 is a server-style mining board built around a cut-down PlayStation 5\u2013based APU (6C/12T Zen 2 + 24CU RDNA2) with 16GB of shared GDDR6 memory.\nIn this video, I show that SteamOS 3.9 boots, then I run Bazzite for that SteamOS-style console experience plus easier tweaking\u2014so we can overclock/undervolt the GPU, adjust the VRAM split, and squeeze more performance out of this crazy cheap \u201cblade.\u201d\nIf you pick one up, the best tutorials/files I\u2019ve found are from Old Lamer\u2014BIOS guides, overclocking, and setup walkthroughs. I\u2019ll link his channel and the downloads below.\n\nBuy An Asrock BC 250 on eBAY: https://ebay.us/UqUGek\n\nCheck Out the Old Lamer Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@OldLamer\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Black Friday Sale code for software\uff1aETA \nWindows 11 Pro Key($23):https://",
