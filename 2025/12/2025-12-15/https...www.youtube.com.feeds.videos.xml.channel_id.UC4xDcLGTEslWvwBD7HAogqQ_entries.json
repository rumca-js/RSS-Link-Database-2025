        "description": "CECOT is El Salvador\u2019s massive mega prison built to hold up to 40,000 inmates. CECOT has become one of the largest and most controversial prisons in the world. Inside, prisoners face 24/7 surveillance, overcrowded cells, no family visits, and no rehabilitation programs. Human rights groups call it a \u201cblack hole for human rights,\u201d while supporters hail it as a symbol of El Salvador\u2019s war on gangs.\n\n#shorts #youtubeshorts #darkhistory #crimedocumentary #shockingfacts",
