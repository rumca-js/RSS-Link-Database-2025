Finally, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, joined by Andy Muschietti, steps in to break down his return as Pennywise, the evolution of the character, and the challenge of balancing terror, humor, and tragedy in his most unhinged scenes yet.\n\nAbout HBO Max:\nHBO Max is the premier global streaming platform from Warner Bros.
