I was on the back foot most game because I kept being opposed whenever I tried to establish loyality in a system and my opponent successfully subjugated and removed loyality from my systems. However, I managed to move my base and trick my opponent on where the new base was giving me the win in the end. I haven&#39;t really played that many thematic big games before but this was incredible. Looking forward to playing the Galactic Empire. </p> <p>To the game day! Strike",

I could use some tips or recommendations for playing Dont Get Got with a large group. </p> <p>I am hosting a party of about 40-50 people that don&#39;t all know each other and thought a good way to get everyone mingling would be to play a big game of Dont Get Got throughout the night. I realize with a group this size I&#39;ll have to modify some rules (ex. only giving each person 5 missions with an aim to be the first to complete 3). I am worried that it will turn into people only asking &quot;is this your mission&quot; the entire night since there are so many missions in play. I&#39;m wondering if you had any tips for how to change up the game to avoid this / avoid cheating / make it more fun and inclusive. Does everyone play?

Now, a lot of games I love have dice in them (Root, 878 Vikings, Camel Up...), and my favourite game of all, Arkham Horror LCG, has a chaos bag and card draw, so it is heavily based on luck.</p> <p>Listening to a podcast about game theory (the maths strategy, not games theory), I heard a definition of (playable) games that made me understand what it is that makes me love or hate randomness in games.</p> <p>They defined a game as a setting where the player deliberately confronts themselves with a challenge and then tries to overcome it.</p> <p>And that made it clear for me: I have no issues when randomness, to a degree, is part of the challenge. What I hate with a passion is when it&#39;s an essential part of the solution. If everything a game makes me do is roll dice and see what happens, what am I going to learn from it? </p> <p",
