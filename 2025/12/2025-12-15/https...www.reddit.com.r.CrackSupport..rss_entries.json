If I back out and run the test again immediately afterwards then it completes just fine and says connection is all good.</p> <p>I can then go back into helldivers and play another couple operations til I get the same error and the cycle repeats ad infinitum.</p> <p>I&#39;ve had similar connection issues with a few other games like space marine 2 and sea of thieves so im convinced its either my console or internet provider and id love to know which if anyone can shed some light.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"http",
