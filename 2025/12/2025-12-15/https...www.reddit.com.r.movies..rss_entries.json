An example of the latter being Rorschach\u2019s \u201cYou quit.\u201d in reply to Dan\u2019s musing of what happened to the \u201cgreat times\u201d. In on version, Rorschach waits a beat, and another he sharply cuts off Dan\u2019s question. This former shows Rorschach longs for his friend to take up the mantle again, while the latter shows Dan\u2019s abandonment stills hurts. That being said, it feels like every version is sharing both sentiments. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jakepr26\"> /u/Jakepr26 </a> <br/> <s",
