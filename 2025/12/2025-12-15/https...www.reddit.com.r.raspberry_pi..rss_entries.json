In the end, I understood why people threw that away, the image is indeed bad. But.... I could use it as a monitor for weather and clock and some random beautiful pictures.</p> <p>I only want one power plug. Used the gpio power to power it. Opened the monitor and hooray! We have 5v in the power supply. Soldered wire from some old ethernet cable I had laying around from when animals ate my internet and we changed cables. Oh, now I have a raspberry pi zero 2w powered by the monitor. Yes!</p> <p>Now I want to know: what to put in the SD card? Any suggestions?

Most of these are intended to run on a Pi Zero/Zero W and I view them as more or less IoT projects. I&#39;ve been using libgpiod libraries which work for both Debian and Raspberry Pi OS (and likely other distros that run on a Pi.) One thing that challenged me was the lack of examples and tutorials available on the Internet. (*) To overcome this, I developed a project to explore the libgpiod API to gain knowledge of how to use them. I&#39;ve enshrined this at <a href=\"https://github.com/HankB/GPIOD_Debian_Raspberry_Pi\">https://github.com/HankB/GPIOD_Debian_Raspberry_Pi</a> and recently updated it to the new version of libgpiod available in Trixie.</p> <p>I&#39;m certain that there is a lot of room for improvement in this effort and if any part of it is not clear or you spot mistakes, feel free to submit an issue or comment here.</p> <p>(*) My inabi",

My Raspberry Pi and a few additional components tend to overheat, so thermal management is a key concern. At the same time, the enclosure must be splash-proof and suitable for cleaning with alcohol. In addition, the entire system needs to be EMC-compatible. My current idea is to use a 3D-printed housing combined with an EMI vent panel to allow airflow while maintaining splash protection and electromagnetic shielding.</p> <p>Do you think this is a good approach?
