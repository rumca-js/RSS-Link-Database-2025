There are separate sensors for particles and VoCs, and neither seems to do what people in <a href=\"/r/3dprinting\">r/3dprinting</a> assume. </p> <p>For particles, most 3D printer particles are too small for home sensors. Home monitors measure particles in microns, while 3D printer particles show up in nanometers (0.001 microns). </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com:5037/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132316301731\">Most particles from 3D printers are from 10nm-100nm or 0.01-0.1 microns.</a> Home monitors usually have Pm2.5 (2.5 microns and less) and Pm10 (10 microns and less) sensors, and neither of them are sensitive below 0.1 microns.
