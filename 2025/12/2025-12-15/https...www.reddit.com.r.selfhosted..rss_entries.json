For context, I installed Debian on the computer and then I followed the YAMS guide to install everything (including Jellyfin). And here are the questions:</p> <p><strong>1- Is there any Bazarr alternative?</strong></p> <p>No matter how many times I try I really can&#39;t get the subtitles to work with Jellyfin and Bazarr. More often than not they&#39;re very desynced (even after manually clicking the sync button in Bazarr) and sometimes they&#39;re not even the right subtitle for the episode. I don&#39;t care if there&#39;s a more hands on alternative, that&#39;s fine. I was used to the VLSub plugin from VLC and I didn&#39;t mind downloading a bunch of subs and trying them one by one, as long as one of them works in the end.</p> <p><strong>2- Is a VPN completel",

Years later it feels like I built my entire digital life on dependencies I do not control. Migrating away from that setup has been far harder than starting clean would have been, especially when old accounts and integrations are still pointing back to the same identifiers. </p> <p>For people here who self host parts of their email, auth, storage, or identity, what early design choice do you regret most.
