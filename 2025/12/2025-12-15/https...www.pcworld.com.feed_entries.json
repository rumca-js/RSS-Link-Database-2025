While privacy is crucial to a good VPN, speed shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Faster speeds mean quicker file downloads and website load times, higher-quality streaming, and just a better all-around experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve tested numerous VPNs and run their servers through countless speed tests to determine the fastest services based on overall network averages. My picks showcase the very best with the fastest download speeds, the fastest upload speeds, and more. Read below to see PCWorld\u2019s curated list of the fastest VPNs available now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for even more VPN options, check out my comprehensive roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.pcworld.com/artic",

(We hate it.) But DIY builders aren\u2019t the only ones taking the gut punch of staggering prices for DDR5 memory. According to a new report, laptop buyers have their own kick in the teeth coming. Think 8GB of memory in a mid-range laptop, when you once could expect 16GB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This happy outlook comes courtesy of research consultants at <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20251211-12831.html\">TrendForce</a> (h/t <a href=\"http://notebookcheck.net\">Notebookcheck.net</a>).

Mini PCs are all the rage these days, and for good reason. Take the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FX3P76CJ/\">Kamrui AM21</a>: it\u2019s tiny, powerful, and affordable. Right now, it\u2019s 29 percent off, bringing it down to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FX3P76CJ/\">$500</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, the AM21 is powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor. Pair that with a massive 32GB DDR5 RAM and a 1TB SSD, and you\u2019ve got yourself a super-fast little rocket. It can handle streaming your favorite shows, keeping hundreds of browser tabs open, and juggling all your apps with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It even has an integrated AMD Radeon 780M graphics card, so casual gaming is possible. It can\u2019t run the latest triple-A titles, of course, but it\u2019s perfect for a round of DOTA or o",

Luckily, Kindles are on sale! Pretty much every model is available at a nice discount, making it easy to snag the perfect gift for yourself or someone you love. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve had several Kindles over the years, and I use mine every chance I get, especially now with my reading nook all decorated and fluffy blankets mandatory in this chilly weather. If there\u2019s one gift I\u2019d recommend to anyone, it\u2019s a Kindle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFPJYX7P/\">Kindle Paperwhite</a> is my personal favorite, and you can get the newest model for 16 percent off\u2013that\u2019s just $135 right now. The 7-inch screen and perfect brightness make reading at any hour of the night effortless. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to go a bit fancier? The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.",
