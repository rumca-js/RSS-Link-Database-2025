        "description": "The real reason relationships feel harder than ever isn't because of a gender war - it's because we're navigating modern love with outdated relationship maps designed for function-based, rather than connection-based, partnerships. Kristal DeSantis cuts through the noise of polarizing gender wars to offer modern couples what they really need: a roadmap for building strong, lasting bridges to connection and a shared future of love. Drawing from years of clinical experience, she reveals the \u201c4 S\u2019s of Safety\u201d\u2014Self-Awareness, Stability, Self-Regulation, and Self-Expression\u2014as the essential skills for lasting relationships. Her message is clear: love isn\u2019t luck or chemistry\u2014it\u2019s a skill we can all learn to build deeper, safer, and more authentic connections.\n\nKristal DeSantis is a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist based in Austin, Texas, who specializes in helping individuals and couples build emotionally connected relationships. She is the author of STRONG: A Relationship Field Guide ",

        "description": "When I was nine years old, I lost my best friend. At twenty-one, I lost my dad. Through grief, music, and memory, I discovered the surprising power of nostalgia \u2014 not just as a longing for the past, but as a way of choosing hope and healing in the present.\n\nIn this heartfelt TEDx talk, I share stories of love and loss, the songs that carried me through, and why I believe every moment can be prepared as a future memory. Because when we live intentionally, nostalgia doesn\u2019t just look backward \u2014 it fuels joy, empathy, and optimism for what\u2019s ahead.\n\n\u2728 Nostalgia can keep you alive. And glad to be alive.\n\n? Listen to my music: [www.girlnamedtom.com]\n?

Speaking to a generation frequently told to \u201cbe leaders\u201d without being taught what leadership truly means, he reflects on how the pursuit of roles and recognition can distract from impact and meaning. Isa Zuhri\u0107 is a youth leader, entrepreneur, and student actively engaged in civic development and community empowerment. He serves as President of his local Council of Youth and as Curator of the Global Shapers Community Sarajevo, where he works on initiatives that strengthen youth participation, leadership, and local impact.

Beginning with the discomfort that often follows the word \u201cfeminist,\u201d she exposes how feminism is frequently misunderstood, dismissed, or reduced to appearance and labels. Nina Pavi\u0107evi\u0107 is a content creator and social commentator best known for Kriti\u010dki, a platform dedicated to examining socially relevant topics such as feminism, mental health, and media literacy.

It is a story of persistence, and how technology can open the doors to new experiences, education, and personal growth. Babang Deshommes is a content creator, cinematographer and certified UAS operator (EASA Specific Category), specializing in FPV drone flight and cinematic storytelling. Born in Haiti and now based in Northern Norway, Babang developed his drone practice after moving to Troms\u00f8 and discovering the stark beauty of arctic landscapes. He brings together adrenaline, precision, and artistry. His FPV work, free from camera stabilization gizmos, pushes boundaries, capturing raw motion and emotional depth at speeds and angles most cameras can\u2019t. His award-winning videos have transformed how we see mountains, fjords and skies, and his mission is to let audiences experience flight like a bird, not just observe landscapes, but feel them from within.

It is apparent that the line between what is a fair capitalist society and what is a bewildering, unjust gap between the top and the bottom has been crossed: yet, few people speak about it. The financial inequality in this world isn't often heard of, but is instead commonly accepted, as if it were merely a part of reality to come to terms with.

        "description": "In my talk, I want to offer insights into my work as a drag cow and invite the audience to question their own view of humanity as the center of the universe. In the talk, I want to use humor and sharp arguments to convince people to acknowledge that we humans inflict terrible violence on billions of non-human animals on the planet, be it through factory farming, habitat destruction, or the climate and biodiversity crisis. I want to invite people to truly feel the associated pain and then open up the possibility that things could be different: wild forests instead of monocultures, coexistence instead of conflict, caressing instead of slaughter. The talk is intended to stir emotions, move people, and call them to action. Soy the cow is an artist, musician, activist, and, full-time, a drag cow. With his artistic persona Soya the Cow, he creates plays, song recitals, art walks, music videos, and exhibitions, and he performs on stages, at festivals, street protests, and on TV shows. Soya t",

        "description": "The very nature of our bodies triggers reactions and enables experiences that can only be had in the specific body with which we traverse the world. Machines cannot have such experiences; they are disembodied. Simone worked in international cooperation for fifteen years. Her professional stations included working for a small local NGO in Kenya, for a large humanitarian mission by the United Nations for Somalia, and finally at the Swiss embassies in Azerbaijan and Ghana. Through her journey she witnessed the destructive power of poverty, hunger, discrimination and conflict. But she also met the most incredible people who displayed hope, resilience and wisdom no matter how hostile the world around them appeared.

My family comes from America, Australia and Sri Lanka so we've always been pretty international. I've lived in Monaco for nearly five years and I have 2 younger siblings and a dog called Olly. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, listening to or playing music and drawing. I play tennis and like horse riding as well, though only casually. Ive been doing Tedx for around 4 years now, i've been both an MC and a speaker, and am still loving it! Team Alicia is wonderfully fun and I find that TedX helps me be more natural, assertive and confident in my daily life. As well as this, I like having my voice heard and writing and presenting speeches makes me feel as if i have the power to make an impact, even if only a small one... for now!

From days filled with pressure and loneliness on the university campus, Linh learned how to \u201cbefriend\u201d her emotions, whether joy, sadness, or exhaustion, and came to realize that every shade of emotion deserves to be valued.\n\nAt times, in an effort to conceal loneliness amid the hurried pace of life, we hastily cloak ourselves in a radiant mask of positivity. Yet for Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Linh, it is precisely the muted tones of confusion, of fatigue, and of quiet pauses that mark the true beginning of growth. For only by daring to pass through the darker regions of our emotional landscape can we learn to understand, accept, and rediscover inner peace.\n\n#TEDxULIS 2025 #Prism Tr\u1ea7n Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Linh is a second-year student at the University of Languages and International Studies - Vietnam Nationa",

He critiques how technology has evolved from spaces of imagination to systems of passive consumption, and introduces the idea of poetic technology - using computation as a medium for emotion, reflection, and human connection. Through examples like \u201c\u0110\u1ec3 qu\u00e1 kh\u1ee9 (s\u1ebd ti\u1ebfp di\u1ec5n)\u201d - a system that lets trees \u201cwrite\u201d poems from their shadows, and the Vietnamese Syllable Keyboard that reimagines how Vietnamese words are formed, he illustrates how art and coding can merge to express empathy, identity, and cultural abundance. Ultimately, he calls for a rethinking of our relationship with machines: not as efficient, commercial tools, but as poetic instruments that slow us down, make us feel, and reconnect us with our humanity.\n\n#TEDxULIS 2025 #Prism Nh\u00e2n Phan is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice explores the human dimensions of technology.

        "description": "Autism occurs in about one to one-and-a-half percent of people worldwide. In the Netherlands, however, eight percent of boys aged 15 to 25 believe they are autistic. We also see that psychologists increasingly receive the question whether their client might be on the autism spectrum. Why is this assumption made so quickly?\n\nOne relevant development is that, in recent years, autism has increasingly been viewed through the lens of neurodiversity\u2014having a differently wired brain\u2014rather than as a disorder. For people with autism, this is a positive, respectful, and inclusive way of thinking. Yet this shift has also made autism an appealing label for other groups: for young people searching for their identity, and for adults struggling with trauma or personality-related issues.\n\nThis trend perhaps says even more about our current society\u2014one in which many people feel unseen and unheard. And within that lies the key to what we can do collectively. Let\u2019s start looking out for each other agai",

        "description": "What happens to young girls when we don\u2019t talk openly about their bodies? And what happens when commerce fills that silence with misinformation and fear?\n\nIn this talk, Marije Wielenga explores how a persistent taboo around vaginal health is passed down from generation to generation. Through a disarming anecdote about a conversation with her mother-in-law, a sexual health doctor, she shows how simple honesty can be\u2014and how powerful its impact is.\n\nShe exposes how young girls grow up with misconceptions, unrealistic ideals, and so-called personal hygiene products that often do more harm than good. Marije advocates breaking this taboo and fostering open conversations about vaginal health, so girls can understand their bodies without shame and without misleading marketing.\n\nWith her background as a presentation coach and former Dutch speech champion, Marije combines sharp insights with accessible storytelling. Her message reaches girls, parents, and anyone who wants to help build a gener",

A world where nothing and no one is treated as worthless.\n\n \n\nMinke is a product designer and social entrepreneur. Every day, she works on circular and social solutions to the major challenges we face as a society, such as resource scarcity and declining social cohesion.

Everyone can take a first step today zo that together, we can create a circular and social world for tomorrow.\" \n\n  Ik ben ervan overtuigd dat een schone wereld met eerlijke kansen voor iedereen mogelijk is.
