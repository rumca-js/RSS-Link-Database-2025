        "description": "Pioneers of Pagonia has spent almost two entire years in Early Access, and over time, the city builder has seen plenty of improvements with new features like a full-fledged campaign story, expansion of its military systems, and even some brand new buildings. \n\nAlong with this, the title has also seen improvements made to its general UI in an effort to make building and managing your city more seamless. Despite all of these improvements, however, Pioneers of Pagonia still feels like it\u2019s missing several important features that city builders should have, such as a way to upgrade housing without having to outright destroy the older house to put down the newer one. \n\nThis, combined with the fact that there\u2019s no universal demolish tool makes improving your town with upgraded buildings feel quite tedious. Things can also start feeling frustrating due to the lack of consistency in how buildings can be placed down along the in-game grid, as well as terrain and trees often getting in your way.",

        "description": "What's interesting about this update is that it feels like a send-off of sorts for  Clair Obscur that captured so many hearts and minds throughout the year. The overarching universe will no doubt continue - it wouldn't surprise anyone if Sandfall wanted to expand Clair Obscur to encompass other mediums and emotions. \n\nBut there's a celebration to all of this and, more importantly, an appreciation, which is still funny considering that the development team essentially gave away a DLC-sized update for free.",
