So our team went through and de-indexed the site&#39;s duplicated pages and cleaned up the page speed etc.</p> <p>Went through a site clean up last week. We saw some initial fluctuations in pages disappearing off of google&#39;s rank and now appearing on rank 13 to 14. How soon should I be expecting results and when is the right time to start optimizing pages. </p> <p>Should I time the optimization to after Google&#39;s Core update? </p> <p>Should I allow soak time for the rankings to pickup? </p",
