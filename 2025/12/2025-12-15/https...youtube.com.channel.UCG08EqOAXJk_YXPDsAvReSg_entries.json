        "description": "Valheim\u2019s memory scalability was limited by the default asset management in Unity. To reduce the game\u2019s memory usage, we implemented asset streaming. In this talk, I will share our insights from that project and dive deep into Unity\u2019s asset management, Asset Bundles, and Addressables. I will also cover how we developed our own abstraction layer on top of Asset Bundles, instead of using Addressables, to better meet our needs.\n\n#Unity #Unite2025 #Valheim",
