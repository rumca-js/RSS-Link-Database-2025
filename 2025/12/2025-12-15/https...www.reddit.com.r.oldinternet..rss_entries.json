The song is likely from around 2010-2014 (apologies if this does not qualify as old internet). The song appears to have been deleted at some point before 2019.</p> <p>The song is called &quot;Things that make me shit my pants&quot;, &quot;Makes me shit my pants&quot;, or possibly known as &quot;Licorice, kiwi fruit&quot; (since these are the opening words to the song). The first 20 seconds of the song has been uploaded to soundcloud (see here <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-979095442/licorice-kiwi-fruit-makes-me-shit-my-pants\">https://soundcloud.com/user-979095442/licorice-kiwi-fruit-makes-me-shit-my-pants</a> )</p> <p>The full song seems to have become lost media, and I have been unsuccessful in finding the rest of the song, or finding the full lyrics to it anywhere. I know for certain that there is more to the song - I remember that the song gets more absurd",
