        "description": "Almost 90 flights linked to Jeffrey Epstein arrived at and departed from UK airports, some with British women on board who say they were abused by the billionaire, a BBC investigation has revealed.\n\nThree British women who say they were trafficked appear in Epstein's records of flights in and out of the UK and other documents related to the convicted sex offender.\n\nUS lawyers representing hundreds of Epstein victims said it was \"shocking\" that there has never been a major UK investigation into his activities there.  One suggested the UK was a \"centrepiece\" of Epstein's operations.\n\nTestimony from one of the three British victims helped convict Epstein's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell of child sex-trafficking in the United States in 2021.  However the victim has never been contacted by UK police, according to her lawyer.  The woman, given the name Kate in the trial, was listed as having been on more than 10 flights paid for by Epstein in and out of the UK between 1999 and 2006.\n\nUS lawye",

        "description": "Today, doctors in England have decided to strike for five days this week despite a new offer from the government.\n\nThe British Medical Association said 83% of its members had voted to continue with the walkout in an online poll over the weekend, with a turnout of 65%.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"gutted\" by the result, describing it as \"irresponsible\" given the rising pressure from flu.\n\nThe BMA argues that, despite previous pay rises, resident doctors' pay is still a fifth lower than it was in 2008, once inflation is taken into account.\n\nAdam Fleming and Chris Mason are joined in the studio by BBC health editor Hugh Pym.\n\nPlus, we talk to BBC Europe editor, Katya Adler about the seemingly positive peace talks today in Berlin. With Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky meeting German chancellor, Friedrich Merz and delegates from the US.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #Ukraine #Residen",
