        "description": "The Manufacturers Cup is a competition to determine the world's fastest manufacturer for 2025. \n\nWith the drivers who clinched the 2022 title reunited, expectations were high for Team Subaru to reach the World Finals undefeated. However, a loss in Round 3 dashed those hopes, setting the stage for a highly unpredictable title showdown.\n\nSubaru currently tops the Points Ranking, but Mazda and BMW trail by just two points, with Porsche in fourth place. All three boast exceptional driver lineups and are determined to challenge Subaru and secure their first championship title.\n\nAt the start of the season, many predicted Team Subaru to struggle due to the characteristics of their car, but their form has been impressive. Can they rise to the occasion and fully utilise their talent to claim a second World Series title, or will a rival manufacturer finally secure a long-awaited first championship? Be sure to follow all the action and see who comes out on top!\n\nA separate Live Timing stream whe",

        "description": "The final race of 2025, which will decide the world\u2019s fastest driver in the GT World Series Nations Cup, is about to get underway.\n\nThe favourites for this year's title are undoubtedly Spain's Jose Serrano, who has shown superb speed this season, and young Spanish driver Pol Urra. Both drivers won the Nations Cup as part of Team Spain in 2023, but have yet to win an individual Nations Cup title. With the impressive form they've shown so far this season, it will be fascinating to see who will emerge victorious out of these talented Spanish drivers.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t overlook Italian Valerio Gallo, who trails Pol Urra by just a single point. Although he hasn\u2019t won a race at a live event this season, he has been consistently collecting points and has all the tools to challenge the Spaniards. \n\nCan the in-form Spanish drivers achieve a one-two finish on the podium at the World Finals, or will the 2021 champion, who has shown that he can run with the very best, reclaim the title?
