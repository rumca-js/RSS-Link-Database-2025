This prevents me from overspending in the first place. I always have a daily budget in mind.</p> <p>It&#39;s a bit manual, but it only takes a few seconds to input each transaction over the course of each day.

Not sure if this is the right place for this, but I would love some help with a couple of ideas around a side project that I&#39;m developing. I created an X/Twitter bot to detect NFL Octopi, which is when a player gets both a touchdown and the subsequent two point conversion, meaning they are involved in all 8 points of the play. I originally built this because I was playing fantasy football for the first time this year, and had absolutely no interest in the sport otherwise. This gave me a bit of incentive to watch. There already exists a bot for this which I wasn&#39;t aware of at the time of development, although my bot operates a bit differently. It is able to detect when the intended receiver was the same person who scored the touchdown, keeps track of statistics, and includes some community engagement aspects like donation shoutouts and tracking. I&#39;m trying to think of a couple of more things to add on, but I&#39;m running out ",
