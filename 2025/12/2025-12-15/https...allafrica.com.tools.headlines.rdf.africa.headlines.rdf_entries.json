        "description": "[This Day] Africa stands at a historic inflection point. In the next 25 years, another one billion people will be added to our continent's population, making Africa home to one in four human beings on earth. Yet the structure of most African economies today is almost exactly the same as it was at independence six decades ago: overwhelmingly primary-commodity dependent, minimally industrialised, and dangerously vulnerable. The question before us is no longer whether Africa needs structural economic transformation.",

        "description": "[African Arguments] In Lagos, a maize seller recently doubled her prices within a single year. In Morocco, pipelines stretch across barren plains, carrying desalinated water to farms that once relied on rainfall. Across much of the continent, the pattern is unmistakable: in the regions most exposed to climate shocks, the future of food security is becoming increasingly uncertain. While the severity varies from one country to another, climateflation is tightening its grip most sharply in rain-dependent and water-stressed",
