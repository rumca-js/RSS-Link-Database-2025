I love particularly how Mary Shelley writes \u2013 how it&#39;s not too complicated and easy to understand, yet describes things beautifully. I&#39;m also a big fan of the psychological aspects and how you get to sympathise with both victor and his creation. any recommendations for books of a similar nature, or just authors who are very like Shelley, would be highly appreciated!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mental_Cheesecake923\"> /u/Mental_Cheesecake923 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pnmupp/books_with_themes_similar_to_frankenstein/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pnmupp/books_with_themes_similar_to_frankenstein/\">[commen",

Some non-fiction I have enjoyed are &quot;Thunderbolt Kid&quot; by Bill Bryson, &quot;Man&#39;s Search for Meaning&quot; by Victor Frankl (though I skipped the logotherapy part as I was more interested in the first half that talks about life in a concentration camp), and these are more of special interest type books but &quot;Forensics&quot; by Val McDermid and &quot;Girls and Their Monsters&quot; by Audrey Clare Farley. I am not too picky but I like absurd fiction like Murakami&#39;s work or lighter reads like Days at the Morisaki bookshop, if there&#39;s any non-fiction that is even minutely similar to those.

I told her when she is older I&#39;d let her read it. But is there anything like it for younger readers. She reads at around a 5th grade level. </p> <p>For those that don&#39;t know Cathy&#39;s Book is about a girl whose boyfriend breaks up with her she basically stalks him for answers and discovers his family secret and now they are wanted by a secret society. (From what I remember without major spoilers) In the book there are phone numbers, websites, photos, etc. in the pocket attached to the front cover.

So now I\u2019m looking for a fantasy or sci fi version of that. The Hunt for the Red October was also great.</p> <p>An ideal example of what I want could be a story following an alchemist that describes how he makes everything. If he makes a new hand for a knight, the story explains that the alchemist bought and grew some ever-shifting flesh from a friend after his visit to the realm of madness, boiled it with opium poppies and radium fulminate in whisky until the alchohol evaporated, and then mixed it with live troll brains. He then surgically attached it to the knight\u2019s stump, and will have to prune it every once in a while to make it hand shaped. I don\u2019t want one that says \u201che made",
