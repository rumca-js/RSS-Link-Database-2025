I joined HydroX AI excited to learn and contribute. What I encountered instead was a culture that felt chaotic, an unbelievable high pressure, and deeply misaligned with how early teams should treat any humans.</p> <p>There was no real onboarding or clarity on what the company was actually building. I was assigned a project with extremely aggressive KPIs that felt disconnected from reality. In my case, I was expected to drive thousands of signups for a product that was not fully defined or ready. There was little guidance, no clear strategy, and constant pressure to perform against targets that felt far beyond impossible.</p> <p>Work hours were intense.

I am not a huge fan of GRC, as I loved being technical throughout my internships and university, but I guess its not the end of the world for me.</p> <p>At my current org, I am able to do a 3 month rotation, and will probably go to our Incident Response team. </p> <p>I am confident I would enjoy IR more, but how is the career progression? Curious about how in demand and also how one usually progresses. I know that GRC can usually go ISSO -&gt; ISSM -&gt; Director -&gt; VP/CISO (or something along those lines). But how is it for IR?
