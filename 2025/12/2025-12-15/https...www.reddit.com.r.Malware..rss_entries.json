The script then downloads an osascript that reads all that it can find really - keychains, cryptowallets, etc; and then it seems to send the data somewhere.</p> <p>Well, no idea, maybe someone might find it useful. I&#39;ll post a github gist if anyone interested.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/deenspaces\"> /u/deenspaces </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/85ssltfl6e7g1.png\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1pnbtrc/macos_malware/\">[comments]</a></span>",
