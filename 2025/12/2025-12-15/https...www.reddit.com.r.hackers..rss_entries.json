So I am going through a nasty, drawn out divorce to where my soon to be ex has me labeled as all kinds of things to the point of actually getting guardianship of my kid. I\u2019m not going to say which computer company she works for but is a specialist. She is stating that I\u2019m financially irresponsible and we couldn\u2019t figure out why, we know now what she\u2019s up to but not going to get into that. She put me on an account of hers without my knowledge. She had 11 debit cards issued and activated, 3 of them were in my name. The first two, done with my old phone number which if wasn\u2019t bad enough, there\u2019s this and my question. The third card has a date and timestamp on it along with my new phone number that was used to activate it. Problem is the date on the activation is 17 days before I got this new number and my old one was disconnected at that time. Now I know she can make calls from her laptop and make them any number she wants, ",
