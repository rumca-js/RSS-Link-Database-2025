        "description": "\u201cCareer minimalism\u201d is the newest corporate buzzword \u2014 and somehow it\u2019s already being framed as a problem.\n\nApparently, if you don\u2019t want to climb an infinite corporate ladder, take on extra work for free, or accept a \u201cpromotion\u201d without more pay\u2026 congrats. You\u2019ve been labeled a career minimalist.\n\nIn this video, I break down:\nWhat \u201ccareer minimalism\u201d actually means (and why it\u2019s not laziness)\nWhy Gen Z is rejecting unpaid responsibility and fake promotions\nHow companies moved the goalposts on \u201ccareer progression\u201d\nWhy management titles without pay are a downgrade, not a win\nThe rise of side hustles as a survival strategy \u2014 not a passion project\nHow remote work exposed how much of corporate life is unnecessary\nWhy older generations tied identity to work \u2014 and why that\u2019s changing\n\nIt\u2019s about doing exactly what you\u2019re paid for \u2014 and no more.\nCompanies optimize for profits. Workers are finally optimizing for themselves.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Need a resume/cover letter? Check out my templates!  \nhttps://www.",
