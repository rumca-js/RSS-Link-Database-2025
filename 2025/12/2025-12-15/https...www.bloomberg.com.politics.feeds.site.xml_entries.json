Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia.\n\nOn today's show, Australia is in mourning after 16 people were killed including one shooter in the country's worst terrorist attack.

It's a verdict that could fuel tensions between China and the US.\n\nToday's guests: Charu Chanana, Saxo, Chief Investment Strategist & PolyAI CEO Nikola Mrk\u0161i\u0107 (Source: Bloomberg)",
