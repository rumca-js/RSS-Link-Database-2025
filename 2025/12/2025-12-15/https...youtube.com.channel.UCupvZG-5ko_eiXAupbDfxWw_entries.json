Because he\u2019s been convicted of murder, Walshe now faces up to 20 years for misleading police - an enhancement triggered by the murder conviction. Walshe can be sentenced to another three years for pleading guilty to the illegal conveyance of a body.\n\nCNN correspondent Jean Casarez reports, and Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown speak with CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams and former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani. #CNN #News",

        "description": "At least 15 people have been killed and 27 are in hospitals after a shooting at Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach yesterday, the country\u2019s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years. The attack, declared a terrorist incident, targeted Jewish Australians. Those killed were aged between 10 and 87. One of the victims was a Holocaust survivor who died while shielding his wife from bullets. A bystander who wrestled the gun from one attacker has been identified as Ahmed al Ahmed, the son of Syrian refugees. The father-son duo were identified by Australian media as 50-year-old Sajid Akram and his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram. The younger man was born in Australia while his father, who was killed at the scene, immigrated to the country in 1998. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Australia\u2019s plans, following a Cabinet meeting earlier today, to strengthen its already tough gun laws with new measures that will restrict who gets a license.\n\nCNN producer Angus Watson and Nine Network reporter Matt Connellan",
