Iran is facing a deepening economic, fuelled by international sanctions and inflation has been rising sharply. \n\nVideos verified by BBC Persian have shown demonstrations in the cities of Karaj, Hamedan, Qeshm, Malard, Isfahan, Kermanshah, Shiraz and Yazd.  University students have joined the protests, chanting anti-government slogans including \u201cdeath to the dictator\" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power in Iran. Security forces have been using tear gas in an attempt to disperse the protesters.\n\nThe Iranian government said it \"recognises the protests\" and would listen \"with patience, even if it is confronted with harsh voices\".
