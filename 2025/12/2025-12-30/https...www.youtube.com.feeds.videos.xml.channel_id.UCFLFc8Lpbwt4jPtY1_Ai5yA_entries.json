They unpack why Valve discontinued its cheapest model, debate who deserves blame for rising prices, and zoom out into a broader conversation about tech affordability, gaming passion, and why this squeeze feels different from shortages in the past.\n\nWatch the full WAN Show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_cIhvzoKEM\n\n\u25ba GET MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners",
