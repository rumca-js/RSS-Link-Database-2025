        "description": "New York\u2019s pricing transparency law reveals how little transparency really means.\n\nNew York\u2019s new law requires retailers to notify consumers when algorithmic pricing is used for essential goods.\nHowever, it stops short of mandating disclosure of pricing logic, comparisons, or outcomes.\n\nWhile the regulation creates compliance overhead and a paper trail for regulators, it leaves consumers without meaningful insight into how prices are determined.\nThe result is awareness without accountability, proof that transparency laws can exist without true transparency.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Visit our YouTube channel for more content.",
