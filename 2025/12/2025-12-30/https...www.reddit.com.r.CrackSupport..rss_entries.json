It appears that PlayGTAV.exe will not function (as in GTA V won&#39;t start up) whenever I have the &quot;OpenIV.asi&quot; file in the directory. I have tried editing the .bat startup file to use any of the other .exe files however, all of them ask me for a license, steam account or other errors.

I unchecked the VC redist and .net framework options in the installer, and the installation ran perfectly. The launcher opened after installation, and after clicking play, the game opened. So, I quit the game and added each of the many launchers from the game/bin/ folder to Steam as non-steam games with GE-Proton 10.3 as a compatibility layer on every one. Each launcher I&#39;ve tried, though, gives me some variation of the same error: &quot;unable to start,&quot; &quot;installation is incomplete,&quot; &quot;service initialization failed,&quot; etc. I don&#39;t understand why this is happening, as the game ran perfectly out of installation. I&#39;ve uninstalled and reinstalled so many times, and I don&#39;t know what I need to do to get this game to boot at this point.
