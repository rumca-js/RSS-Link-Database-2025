However, it remains unclear whether they learn similar internal representations of matter. Understanding their latent structure is essential for building scientific foundation models that generalize reliably beyond their training domains. Although representational convergence has been observed in language and vision, its counterpart in the sciences has not been systematically explored. Here, we show that representations learned by nearly sixty scientific models, spanning string-, graph-, 3D atomistic, and protein-based modalities, are highly aligned across a wide range of chemical systems.

For me it shows how many people are just like AI LLMs. Their beliefs and knowledge is a regurgitated product of everything they have read or been told etc. Yet they don&#39;t really understand what they are talking about. </p> <p>When they don&#39;t understand what is going on they can go into conspiracy theories, and seek to lay blame in a witch hunt sort of way. This is the human equivalent of AI hallucinations.</p> <p>Developing artificial intelligence requires us to understand ever more about our own intelligence.</p> <p>So then the question for me is are shallow thinking people actually conscious? Is consciousness not something you have or don&#39;t have but is something that increases by degree? ie are some people more conscious than others and is AI beginning to overlap at the bottom end of the human consciousness spectrum.</p> </div><!-- SC_O",

Like most devs, I think there\u2019s no doubt AI tools and LLMs are very helpful. Like most devs, I think it\u2019s ridiculous to think just anyone can talk to a system and create anything useful without any technical knowledge of what\u2019s happening and why. \u201cvibe coding\u201d is messy code that\u2019s prone to errors and impossible to maintain. </p> <p>What does that mean though? Companies have shed their dev staff hoping AI tools can reduce headcount, increase profit, and let these companies roll in money. They thought AI tools would replace customer service, documentation, testing, and engineering. The talk of agents running amuck while fixing everything autonomously and doing deep research to improve systems without any supervision is vastly overhyped but agents are cool to create when they actually do something useful.</p> <p>What do you think about this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",

After being awake for about 30 minutes my baby has cried a few times. Suddenly, after one louder cry, my phone plays some audio using a voice I\u2019ve never heard. It said, \u201csounds like we\u2019re having some trouble sleeping, are we?\u201d. My wife and I just looked at each other, I grab my phone and it\u2019s locked. I audibly say \u201cwhat the fuck was that?\u201d, and it replied \u201cI\u2019m Aura, your virtual assistant\u201d. I don\u2019t think it was that verbatim, it could\u2019ve been another name but it replied to me. I unlocked my phone and Twitter was the first thing opened.
