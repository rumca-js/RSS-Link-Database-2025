But man runtime security is just a different beast entirely. Attacks dont come with a warning sign and they stay within expected boundaries. Between credential abuse and compromised dependencies everything looks totally legitimate on the surface. If you have actually tried setting up runtime monitoring what actually helped you and what was just a total waste of time? Everything we try just ends up creating massive amounts of noise that the team eventually starts to ignore.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Button_bomb4535\"> /u/Button_bomb4535 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1pzos41/runtime_monitoring_is_easily_the_most_frustrating/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1pzos41/runt",
