Among those, 16 were novellas. I think this year has been one where people have gotten more into novellas in general, so I thought I would talk a bit about the ones I read and how I liked them. </p> <ul> <li><strong>When the Tiger Came Down the Mountain</strong> by Nghi Vo (Singing Hills Cycle #2). I had read the first of this series (Empress of Salt and Fortune) back during COVID, and I&#39;d really liked it - so this year I thought I would catch up on the rest. Each book in this series follows the monk Chih, who collects stories thoughout a fantasy world inspired by China. Each novella has a different theme to it, but all focus on the nature of stories, how people tell them differently, and how this affects the world. This book&#39;s theme was sapphic romance, and I really liked the way the tale was told as we hear of a tiger-woman",

As I&#39;ve been doing for the past 4 years, I have decided to rank my 10 favorite reads of the year and provide a small review for each of them. </p> <p>A few rules before we start. First, those only count the books that I have read for the first time in 2025, so no re-reads on this list. It is also the books that I have read in 2025, not necessarily books that have come out in 2025. I will also try to stay as spoiler free as possible if anything skirt too close to a spoiler, I will tag it as such. </p> <p>I have been lucky enough to read 83 new books this year and before we get to the actual top-10, I actually have to do a few honorable mentions, books that have just missed out on the top-10 but that were still absolutely excellent. First, <em>The Pi",
