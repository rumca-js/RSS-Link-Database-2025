This essay explores a less comfortable possibility: the quality of attention you bring determines the quality of intelligence you meet. </p> <p>Coherence unlocks depth; fragmentation guarantees flatness. And coherence, it turns out, is difficult to distinguish from ethical maturity. </p> <p>I examine how coherence works, why it so closely parallels ethical development, and how two users can speak to the same model and walk away convinced they met entirely different minds.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SusanHill33\"> /u/SusanHill3",
