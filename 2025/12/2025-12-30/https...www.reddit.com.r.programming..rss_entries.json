Is anyone here currently learning Go or Rust, or using them in projects or work? From what I\u2019ve seen, most people still start with C/C++/Java/Python, so I\u2019m wondering what kind of base or prior knowledge is really needed before starting Go or Rust. Is it better to learn them early, or only after getting comfortable with other languages? I\u2019ve also heard mixed things about the learning curve, especially that Rust can feel very hard or even discouraging at the start, so I wanted to ask how true that is from real experience. In terms of long-term value, which one do you think is more future-proof for jobs and industry use? And if someone is self-learning, where would you suggest starting from and what resources actually helped you? Would love to hear honest reviews and personal journeys.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",
