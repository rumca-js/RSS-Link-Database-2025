        "description": "Environmental change doesn\u2019t affect evolution in a single, predictable way. In large-scale computer simulations, scientists discovered that some fluctuating conditions help populations evolve higher fitness, while others slow or even derail progress. Two populations facing different kinds of change can end up on completely different evolutionary paths. The findings challenge the idea that one population\u2019s response can represent a whole species.",

        "description": "A spectacular fossil trove on the Arctic island of Spitsbergen shows that marine life made a stunning comeback after Earth\u2019s greatest extinction. Tens of thousands of fossils reveal fully aquatic reptiles and complex food chains thriving just three million years later. Some predators grew over five meters long, challenging the idea of a slow, step-by-step recovery. The find rewrites the early history of ocean ecosystems.",

NIST scientists have now nailed down the difference, showing that Mars clocks tick slightly faster\u2014and fluctuate over the Martian year. These microsecond shifts could play a big role in future Mars navigation, communications, and even a solar-system-wide internet. It\u2019s a small time gap with big consequences for space exploration.",

        "description": "Scientists have uncovered an extensive underwater vent system near Milos, Greece, hidden along active fault lines beneath the seafloor. These geological fractures act as pathways for hot, gas-rich fluids to escape, forming clusters of vents with striking visual diversity. The discovery surprised researchers, who observed boiling fluids and vibrant microbial mats during deep-sea dives. Milos now stands out as one of the Mediterranean\u2019s most important sites for studying Earth\u2019s dynamic interior.",

The study found that magnesium raised vitamin D in people who were deficient while dialing it down in those with overly high levels\u2014suggesting a powerful regulating effect. This could help explain why vitamin D supplements don\u2019t work the same way for everyone and why past studies linking vitamin D to cancer and heart disease have produced mixed results.",
