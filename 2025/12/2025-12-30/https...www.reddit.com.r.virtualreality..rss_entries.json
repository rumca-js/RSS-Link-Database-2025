But there is a nice list of well optimized games with really good to great graphics that run very well in VR without reprojection of any kind. What they all have in common is age. They are older, but they are still the best looking games in VR.</p> <p>Automobilista 2</p> <p>Dirt Rally 2</p> <p>Alien Isolation</p> <p>Resident evil 2, 3, 7, 8</p> <p>Portal 2</p> <p>Star wars squadrons (not so old)</p> <p>No mans sky (runs great for me)</p> <p>GT7</p> <p>There are definitely others. But each of these prove you can have great graphics in VR while maintaining solid performance. They are all flat first games with VR add ons.

It would be reassuring to know that the Steam Frame has standalone native support, in addition to is ability to emulate less demanding steam titles (and stream the rest wirelessly from PC).</p> <p>I assume it would be easy for many developers to port over their titles from Quest 3 to Steam Frame, since the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 ARM chip is reported to be more powerful than Meta Quest 3&#39;s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2.</p> <p>Of course, Meta-owned games are likely not be on that list (eg.

I&#39;m a tech enthusiast (but the financial situation is not that good, I have the money to buy the XR but it really gonna cost me an arm and a leg \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02)</p> <p>Moreover, it is not available in my country, and in order to import it here it&#39;s gonna ad a shipping cost of about minimum of 100$ shipping fee, and the customs and taxes in my country is 15% so it&#39;s more 300$. So It&#39;ll cost me at least: 1,800$+100$+300= 2,200$ and this price even doesn&#39;t include taxes in US which is about 150$ most probably, with a total of 2,350$ at least.

I connect the headset to my PC via Virtual Desktop. When searching for optimizations for these games, people say I need to use the SteamVR versions, but bypass SteamVR by using OpenComposite and OpenXR. How do I do this? I followed the installation guides, but my games either crash with an error or just open SteamVR no matter what I try. The OpenXR Toolkit menu also appears occasionally, so it&#39;s really buggy. What&#39;s wrong? I&#39;ve tried both the OpenComposite app and manually editing the .dll files inside the folders, but nothing helps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nekropl\"> /u/Nekropl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pzbok8/steamvr_runs_over_openxr_and_opencomposite_anyway/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=",

Everything worked like a charm with a monitor and simulator\u2014most games had a dedicated cockpit view (the dashboard one), which felt like a custom optimization for sim players. I\u2019m thankful many sim racing games now support VR, but their VR adaptation is so lazy. My first VR sim racing experience involved struggling for ages just to get the VR mode running. (Ignoring the cognitive dissonance from the virtual/real steering wheel mismatch\u2014that\u2019s out of developers\u2019 hands, I get it.) And why do so many games still force mouse interaction pre-launch? It\u2019s super awkward in VR! Plus, the in-game UI is just a straight copy-paste from the flat-screen version. The mini-map might be handy on a monitor, but it\u2019s a hassle in VR. Can\u2019t we get a VR-exclusive UI? Sadly, it seems unlikely\u2014VR\u2019s player base is still too small.
