        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So here I am, doing some investigating on resizeable BAR, cause my gpu was fried and apparently some gpus perform abysmal without ReBAR. Why is this important? Because my PC is 10 years old, intel X99 platform and build way before ReBAR was ever a thing. And I needed a cheap-ish GPU that performs similar to the GTX1080 that was in there, but that was preferably not another nvidia card and good Linux driver support.</p> <p>I eventually found ReBarUEFI, which lets you basically reconfigure any UEFI BIOS with ReBAR support which could help in gpu choice.</p> <p>Fast forward a few weeks, and I got me nice Asus RX 6650XT real cheap and happy camper. Can play some games again if I want to.</p> <p>Biggest surprise though? With bios option `4G Decoding` enabled and kernel parameter `pci=realloc` there is full ReBAR support on this platform from 2016 that&#39;s never supposed to have it, on Linux. </p> <p>Whereas in Microsoft-land, you have to have bios update",
