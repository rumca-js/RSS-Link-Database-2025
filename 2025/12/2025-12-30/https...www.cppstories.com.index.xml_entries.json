In this post, we&rsquo;ll focus on practical examples like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What\u2019s the last business day of the month?</li>\n<li>When is the third Friday in June?</li>\n<li>How many days since the start of the year?</li>\n<li>What happens when I add a month to January 31?</li>\n<li>And a few more</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-which-day-of-the-year-is-that\">\n1. Which day of the year is that? \n  \n<a class=\"hash-link\" href=\"#1-which-day-of-the-year-is-that\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n<svg class=\"fill-current o-60 hover-accent-color-light\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"22\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" ",
