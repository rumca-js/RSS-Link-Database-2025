I love how clean terminals look. No distractions, just text on a screen. But I didn&#39;t want to mess around with command-line RSS readers every time I wanted to catch up on my feeds.</p> <p>Looked around for something that had that stripped-down terminal vibe but was still easy to use. Couldn&#39;t really find it, so I built SudoRSS.</p> <p>It&#39;s basically a web app that looks and feels like a terminal: <a href=\"https://termrss.crimsonstack.com\">https://termrss.crimsonstack.com</a></p> <p>It automatically finds RSS feeds from any URL you throw at it (works with YouTube channels too). Reader mode grabs the full article so you don&#39;t have to leave the app. It plays audio and video embeds right there. Has folders, OPML import/export, and you can hide stuff you&#39;ve already read. Comes with different terminal themes like Matrix and CRT. ",
