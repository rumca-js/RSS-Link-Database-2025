I like the majority of Sci fi and fantasy and I am open to other genres(just not something from tiktok, legit contemplated burning a book by a &quot;siggy shade&quot; i read), A really fluid and easy to read writing style.

The cover was red and black and I&#39;m desperate to find anyone who remembers what the title to this book was called. It was a little obscure. And before I get flooded with it, I swear it&#39;s not the fanboy and goth girl book by Barry lyga this was a different book from that.

The Fantasy genre seems overrun with BookTok-esque novels and regular releases with, quite frankly, garbage storylines. A lot of them are bestsellers with rave reviews (I mean these books are so bad I stop reading them over halfway through because I couldn\u2019t take it anymore). This is a pattern across all genres to an extent, but I\u2019m noticing it the most with fantasy.</p> <p>Just to clarify I\u2019m not saying NO good fantasy books are coming out, just significantly less than what I\u2019m used to. I\u2019ve moved away from the fantasy genre and I think I\u2019m going to take a long break from it. I\u2019m feeling disappointed.
