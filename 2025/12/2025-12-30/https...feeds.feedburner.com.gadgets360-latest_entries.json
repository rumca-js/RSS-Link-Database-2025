Using aircraft and ground measurements, scientists found that openings in sea ice boost cloud formation while pollution from oil fields alters Arctic chemistry. Together, these processes form powerful feedback loops that trap heat and speed ice loss. The findings highlight how local Arctic changes can ripple outward, shaping global climate and weather far beyond the polar regions.",
