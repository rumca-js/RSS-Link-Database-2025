I recently had a company build my website, and they were adamant that I have a bunch of pages dedicated to individual services offered as well as pages dedicated to individual towns nearby. I found it to be a bit cluttered but went along with it.</p> <p>Now I am taking it on myself to build my own website since I was paying a monthly fee to use theirs. Are these pages really as necessary as they made it seem? Pages for specific service areas, pages by town, pages for every type of possible service. It just seems like what might work for Google might not look or work best for a human visitor.
