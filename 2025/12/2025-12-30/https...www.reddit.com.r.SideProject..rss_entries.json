In Canada, there&#39;s a tax credit to help offset the insane cost of gluten-free products (we&#39;re talking 2-3x the price of regular food).</p> <p>I tried tracking everything in Excel with receipts. Absolute nightmare.</p> <p>Then I read somewhere that ~75% of Canadians with celiac disease don&#39;t claim this credit. Not because they don&#39;t qualify, but because the process is so painful that people just... don&#39;t bother.</p> <p>That pissed me off.</p> <p>9 months ago, with literally ZERO dev experience, I decided to build something better. Spent way too many evenings debugging stuff I didn&#39;t understand, Googling error messages, and rewriting the same feature three times until it finally worked.</p> <p>Today, I&#39;m genuinely proud to say Glutax is live on the App Store \ud83c\udf89</p> <p><strong>What it does:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Scan your receipt \u2192 aut",
