The Arducam came with the camera, a white ribbon plugged into it, and an alternate orange ribbon. The orange ribbon is the one that can plug into the pi, so I am assuming you have to remove the white ribbon that is plugged into the Arducam. However, it is so tightly attached that it doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;re actually supposed to. Am I not supposed to remove the white ribbon or am I missing something? It said it was compatible with Raspberry Pi 5 but I literally cannot remove this white ribbon.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Radiant_Freedom3864\"> /u/Radiant_Freedom3864 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pz4fnc/arducam_raspberry_pi_5_ribbon_connection/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pz4fnc/arducam_raspberry_pi_5_ribbon_connection/\">[",
