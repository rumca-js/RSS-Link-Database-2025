On Christmas Eve, a team of first responders used olive oil to free the animal after she became stuck in a dumpster. Because the squirrel was in poor condition, Dani Wood from All Creatures Great and Small Wildlife Rehabilitation was called in to provide care. Dani named the squirrel Holly and is now doing everything possible to help her survive. Inside Edition Digital's Andrea Swindall has more.",

        "description": "A sinkhole swallowed up a parked car in Turkey and all people could do was watch. Turkish media says it happened in a parking area not far from a stream. The soil seemed to shift open under the vehicle, creating a large enough opening to take the whole car. It was a sight to watch, especially because the car was unoccupied. Inside Edition Digital\u2019s Mara Montalbano has more.",

        "description": "In January 2025, former \"first buddy\" Elon Musk caught heat on the first day of Donald Trump's second term after he made a gesture that some thought resembled a Nazi salute. In April, Pope Francis died, ending a 12 year papacy. His replacement stunned the world. After a two-day conclave, Cardinal Robert Prevost from Chicago became the first ever American pope. He is now known as Pope Leo XIV. In the summer, Karen Read emerged victorious after a two-month trial.",
