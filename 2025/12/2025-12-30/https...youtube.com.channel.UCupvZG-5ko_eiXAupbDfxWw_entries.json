The investigation comes weeks after ICE launched operations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area to specifically target undocumented Somali immigrants, precipitated by revelations about widespread fraud against the state as well as President Donald Trump\u2019s comments that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want\u201d Somalis in the country. \n\nThe stepped-up effort also comes just days after YouTube content creator Nick Shirley, who has created anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim videos in the past, posted a viral video in which he claimed to find widespread fraud at Somali-run child care centers. The video, which includes limited evidence for the creator\u2019s allegations, has received more than 1.5 million views on YouTube as of Monday evening and was retweeted",
