Since I degoogled I decided also to avoid aurora as much as possible and use open source apps (via obtanium or f-droid) and of course Ryanair is not one of them. Recently I had to take a ryanair flight and apparently they don&#39;t allow downloading/printing a boarding pass anymore, which I used previously in order to avoid using their app. The web app (or I&#39;d better say, their web site in mobile mode) only allows to check-in, not to download the bording pass, they force you to install the app (via play store or apple app store, no sideloading). I did it with my old phone just to understand if it was a rotating/fancy qr-code, but nope, the boarding pass is just a static qr code that you can screenshot. Why do they force you to download the app then? My only hypothesis is that they harvest data and the quantity of trackers you ",
