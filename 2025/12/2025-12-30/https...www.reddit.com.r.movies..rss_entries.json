I laughingly admitted mine were Kriss Kross and Ace of Base. She had a good laugh, and tried to remember the lyrics to &quot;Jump Jump.&quot; I tried to remind her by bringing it up on Spotify and she emphatically stopped me (No! Please no! I don&#39;t need that song stuck in my head all week!). So I joked I was going to secretly make it her alarm clock music.
