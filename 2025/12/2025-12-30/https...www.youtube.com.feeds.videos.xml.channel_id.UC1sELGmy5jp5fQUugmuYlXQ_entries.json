We\u2019ve released four game drops featuring new mob variants, the happy ghast, more copper than ever, and all the mounts you\u2019ll ever need! We\u2019ve made sure people get triggered by hearing the words \u201cchicken\u201d and \u201cjockey,\u201d the Marketplace has been bubbling, and two new multiplayer adventures have been added to the Minecraft world!\n\nAnd none of this would have been possible without you \u2013 the fans, players, and block-lovers! Your passion is what fuels us (not coffee)!\nSee you in 2026, but first, check out all this fun stuff from 2025:\n\n\u2022 00:00 \u2013 00:36 \u2013 Intro time!\n\u2022 00:37 \u2013 01:00 \u2013 2025\u2019s first game drop \u2013 Spring to Life!\n\u2022 01:01 \u2013 01:15 \u2013 A look back ",
