        "description": "2025 was a great year but that isn't a reason to ignore the things that dragged it down. There were far too many occurrences that rocked the gaming world, and not in a good way, for our liking. \n\nBut if we were to take a positive outlook, perhaps these events can serve as valuable lessons for other talented studios in the future? Either way, we thought it was a good idea to remind you of what went wrong this year, with the hope that things could get better in the future. \n\nIt's a great way to move forward from failure, and appreciate all of the wins that have happened in the bargain. Join us and take a look at everything that could have gone better in this year.",

        "description": "The gaming world has come a long way on the graphical front, a facet of great games that has been made all the more relevant thanks to some serious power under the hood of modern gaming hardware. \n\nBut of course, hardware is only as good as the software that uses it. We've taken a few games that did very well in the past, and have managed to become a part of gaming's present thanks to some great remakes that made familiar experiences feel entirely new thanks to some clever graphical overhauls of everything that put them on the map in the first place.",
