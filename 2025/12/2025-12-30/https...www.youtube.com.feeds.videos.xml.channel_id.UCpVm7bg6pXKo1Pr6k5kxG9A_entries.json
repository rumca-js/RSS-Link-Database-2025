        "description": "Journey into the freezing Andes mountains of Bolivia with Eva zu Beck, and meet the Climbing Cholitas, a group of Indigenous women on a mission to reclaim their power. One climb at a time, they endure tough routes at extreme altitudes, all while wearing traditional pollera skirts as an act of resistance. Eva grabs an ice pick and crampon to join them on a challenging trek through the Condoriri Glacier with hopes to harness their confidence and overcome her fear of heights. Experience the ultimate display of female empowerment and cultural heritage as Eva learns how these mountain climbers defy the odds of gravity, challenge social norms, and change the narrative of what it means to be an Indigenous woman in a conservative society. \n\nSuperskilled with Eva zu Beck | S2, E6\n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: https://natgeo.com/ytngmagazine\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe: https://on.natgeo.com/4p5A0D6\n\u27a1 Get more Nat Geo Full Episodes: https://on.natgeo.com/3V5ZfHI\n\u27a1 Get wild with Na",
