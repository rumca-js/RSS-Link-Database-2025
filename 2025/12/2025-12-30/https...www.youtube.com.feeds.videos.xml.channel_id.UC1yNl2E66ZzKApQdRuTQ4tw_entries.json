But a new type of renewable energy is breaking on to the scene: wave power. According to industry experts, harnessing the waves off of the U.S.\u2019s coasts could generate up to 1,400 terawatt-hours of electricity each year, equalling 1/3 of the country\u2019s power consumption. Let\u2019s take a look at how wave power is progressing and where it\u2019s headed.\n\nHow CorPower Ocean Wave Energy Converters Work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qu2OIw4-p8\n\nMocean M100 Testing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSItXQ8rbdE\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs,",
