Instead of asking for solutions directly, try prompts like: \u201cExplain this topic in simple terms, then quiz me.\u201d \u201cShow the steps and explain why each step matters.\u201d \u201cPoint out common mistakes students make with this concept.\u201d This approach helps you learn faster because you\u2019re engaging with the reasoning, not just copying results. It\u2019s especially useful for subjects like math, coding, economics, and theory-heavy topics where understanding matters more than memorization. ChatGPT also works well for: Breaking down complex textbooks Creating revision summaries Practicing interview or exam questions Explaining mistakes in your own answers Used correctly, it supports learning instead of replacing it. If anyone has questions about using ChatGPT effectively for studying or specific subjects, feel free to DM me\u2014I\u2019m happy to help where ",
