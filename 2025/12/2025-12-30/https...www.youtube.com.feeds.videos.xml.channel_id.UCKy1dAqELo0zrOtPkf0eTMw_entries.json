Via the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Coogler shared that the story originally centered around T'Challa (Boseman) and his son, Toussaint. Boseman lost his battle with cancer, and both Coogler and Disney agreed they would not recast the role of T'Challa. What we got instead was Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which focused on T'Challa's sister, Shuri, as she claimed the mantle of Black Panther. In other Marvel news, the studio dropped a new teaser for next year's Avengers: Doomsday, this one centered around Thor. And James Cameron has a plan for Avatar 4 and 5 if Disney doesn't let him make them as movies.\n\n#IGN #Marvel #MCU",

To help you get stuck in, we\u2019ve listed every GTA game in chronological order so you can plot the best route through the timeline of this crime-riddled world. \n\nAs confirmed by Rockstar back in 2011, the GTA series is split into three unique timelines: the 2D timeline, the 3D timeline and the HD timeline. Although events in these timelines might be similar or even identical, Rockstar doesn\u2019t consider all of them canon to each other. As such, we\u2019ll separate the games into their respective universes. The first being where it all began, the Grand Theft Auto 2D Timeline.\n\nThis is how to play the entire Grand Theft Auto series in order.
