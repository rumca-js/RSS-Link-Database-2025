However, I feel like it&#39;s underestimated what can be done gameplay-wise by modifying the card back while keeping the card&#39;s front visually unchanged. </p> <p>So far the only game I&#39;ve seen integrate card sleeves as integral to the gameplay is the slay the spire board game. Each card has an upgrade variant to make them stronger, but it would suck to pay for twice as many cards and search through a huge pile to find the upgraded variant. The solution? Make each card double-sided: Normal on one side upgrade on the other. Then use sleeves so upgraded a card is as easy as just taking it out, flipping it and putting it back in. </p> <p>It&#39;s not just variants though, there are a lot of games where cards have different backs depending on their source. In Spirit Island, for example,",

I can\u2019t remember the name of the company. It had a big hexagonal map that was made up of wooded lands, roads and various other fantasy locations. You had armies that were square tiles. One army I remember were green tiles and represented Elves. The cool thing is that you were able to put your army tiles on boat tiles and with the roll of the dice could move your army to islands or to another part of the mainland.</p> <p>My friends and I liked it because it was easy to get into and the rules of armies fighting was straightforward. I\u2019ve tried AI to find it and I know if I see the box I would recognize it in a minute.</p> <p>I almost want to say that it was a less popular TSR game.

We\u2019ve built a small collection that currently includes Wingspan, Everdell, Splendor, and The Quacks of Quedlinburg.</p> <p>After a lot of research on websites and YouTube, we\u2019re considering investing in Ark Nova. Since Wingspan and Everdell are the two games we end up playing the most, and we\u2019ve read that Ark Nova scratches a similar strategic itch, it seems like a good next step.</p> <p>I know this subreddit isn\u2019t supposed to be a recommendation service, but we\u2019re really on the fence and undecided. If anyone has thoughts on whether Ark Nova is worth buying or if there\u2019s something else we should consider, I\u2019d really appreciate it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rdvpina5\"> /u/rdvpina5 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1pz5vq2/should_we_buy_ar",
