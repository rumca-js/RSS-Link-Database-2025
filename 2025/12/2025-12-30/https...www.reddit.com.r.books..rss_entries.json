In fact I read through it twice. Once while drunk last night, and again today while at work. Been dealing with a lot of shit this year, and I really was able to resonate with her stream of consciousness style, and appreciated the small details (esp during my second read) that spoke volumes. I heard about her from Man Carrying Thing, and am so glad I did. At first I was tempted to read her novel &quot;Near to the Wild Heart&quot; first, but tried her stories first, and am loving them so far.</p> <p>Have yall read her stuff?

My favorite genre is horror and absurdism and philosophy and my favorite book series of all time is the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett which is why I have become extremely picky about what I enjoy (iykyk), And I also believe that no one should ever be too old to read a kid&#39;s book series.

In fact, that&#39;s my first complaint - how was this thing not edited down? Did we really need another &quot;Jude cuts himself&quot; scene? Another &quot;Jude is back in the hospital&quot; scene? An Andy or Harold &quot;I&#39;m worried about you Jude&quot; scene? Another detailed description of a fancy dinner, party or trip? Is the author aware how many people &quot;he&quot; could refer to in the story as many times as she used that pronoun?</p> <p>Here&#39;s more: There were so many flashbacks that it was hard to follow the current narrative in the timeline of the book.

Page counts, yearly challenges, streaks... etc. It slowly turned reading into another productivity metric instead of something I did because <em>I loved it</em>. I also noticed I felt weird pressure to log everything, rate everything, and have an opinion ready, even when I just wanted to sit with a book and move on.</p> <p>Another big reason is that I am actively trying to de-Amazon my life. The more I thought about it, the more Goodreads just felt tied into an ecosystem I no longer want to support, especially when it was also contributing to a mindset that was not great for me. On top of that, I felt like the recommendations and trends were slowly narrowing what I picked up instead of expanding it.</p> <p>This does not mean I want to stay away",
