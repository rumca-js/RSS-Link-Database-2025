We are wondering if you can find data on where the information is being relayed to from just having the tracker. It isn&#39;t an apple air tag. It is a device with a magnet that was on the outside of the car. The question is: If turned into the authorities, can they trace who put it there, or can we? There was a recent breakoff of her engagement, so there is definitely a likely culprit, but some tangible proof would be helpful. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Shykk07\"> /u/Shykk07 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pka2no/how_do_i_find_the_origin_of_gps_tracker/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pka2no/how_do_i_find_the_origin_of_gps_tracker/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I basically stuttered a response like \u201coh I don\u2019t post my pics online for privacy concerns\u201d and that I would be ok with internal pics but nothing on LinkedIn etc. The response was so awkward and I had to do most of the talking. They said that they would check with their supervisor to see if it was ok. These are the moments I wish I lived in an age where cameras weren\u2019t a thing.
