This so-called bloatware includes pre-installed tools, trial versions, games, or optional components that enter the system without being requested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result: more entries in the Start menu, more services in the background, and sometimes even additional ads. A targeted clean-up ensures a better overview, fewer distractions, and an overall leaner, pleasantly quiet system in everyday use.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product-widget-block product-widget is-half-width is-float-right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"product-widget__block-title-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t<h4 class=\"product-widget__block-title\" id=\"get-windows-11-pro-for-cheap\">\n\t\t\t\t\tget windows 11 pro for cheap\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t",
