I run a network of beach webcam sites and saw 40-50% organic traffic loss overnight, but here&#39;s the weird part: rankings are stable (still position 1-3 for most keywords), CTRs collapsed, and video thumbnails disappeared from SERPs despite valid VideoObject schema. Meanwhile, YouTube video carousels now dominate every &quot;[location] + webcam&quot; query, and municipal/government sites suddenly outrank commercial sites for local queries. No manual actions, engagement metrics actually improved, and our B2B site is unaffected. This feels like a SERP format restructuring rather than a traditional penalty - curious if anyone else in local/video/webcam niches got hit similarly or has insights on recovery? Specifically wondering if others lost video rich snippets around this date.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/backsidefloate",
