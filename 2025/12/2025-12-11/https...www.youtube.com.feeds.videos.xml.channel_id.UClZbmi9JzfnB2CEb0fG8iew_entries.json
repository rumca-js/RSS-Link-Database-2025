In this video, we break down the innovative in-camera techniques used in classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Metropolis, Ben-Hur, The Invisible Man, and early George M\u00e9li\u00e8s films. From growing heads and floating pens to impossible camera tricks, watch through to the end to see how these early visual effects shaped modern filmmaking.\n\nThanks for watching this Primal Space video.
