I&#39;m trying to spend less time in the muck of Reddit otherwise, so I&#39;m wondering if anyone has a feed setup that lets you use your search term(s) within a specific subreddit. If so can you tell me what client your using? So far I&#39;ve tried <a href=\"http://RSS.app\">RSS.app</a> which totally gets the wrong dates, saying post are from 8hrs ago when really their 7 yrs old and Feedly but I think I need to pay to use their RSS builder and I&#39;m willing to do that if I know the integration good and not buggy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lannanh\"> /u/lannanh </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1pk5k42/rss_client_that_creates_feeds_based_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1pk5k42/rss_client_that_creates_feeds_based_on/\">[comments]</a></span>",

You define your interests, and it generates a personalized RSS feed you can subscribe to in any reader (Feedly, Inoreader, NetNewsWire, whatever you use).</p> <p>Think of it as an AI research assistant that does the discovery work for you, then delivers everything through good old RSS.</p> <p>Would love to hear what you think and happy to answer any questions!</p> <p>Since I can&#39;t post videos here, check out this quick demo on Twitter to see how it works: <a href=\"https://x.com/thuwyh/status/1998962972832706987?s=20\">https://x.com/thuwyh/status/1998962972832706987?s=20</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
