        "description": "Deep in La Paz, Bolivia, lies San Pedro Prison, a jail unlike any other. With nearly 3,000 inmates crammed into a space built for 600, this prison is entirely run by its prisoners. Inside, inmates buy and sell their own cells, run restaurants and markets, and even live with their families. Once notorious for drug trade and illegal tours, San Pedro has become infamous worldwide as a chaotic society behind bars, where criminals govern themselves.\n\n#truecrimecommunity #crimestories #prisonlife #youtubeshorts #shorts",
