        "description": "This session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm explores the latest developments in Unreal Engine to support physics-based character movement in a multi-player environment. \n\nWatch for an overview of the Chaos Mover plugin, which adds physics-based movement using the Mover plugin framework, and learn how to set up a controllable character that interacts with its physical environment. \n\nYou\u2019ll see examples of the new kinds of gameplay this unlocks and how the system can be extended to add physics-based movement to suit your game. \n\nIn addition, we look at how this works with Network Physics and how server corrections are handled smoothly with the new rewind/resimulation system.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#PhysicsBasedCharacters, #ChaosMover, #NetworkPhysics, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestStockholm",
