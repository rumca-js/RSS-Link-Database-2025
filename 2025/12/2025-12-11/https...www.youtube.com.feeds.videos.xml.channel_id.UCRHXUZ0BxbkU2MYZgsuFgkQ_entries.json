        "description": "Hello all welcome to a very special stream for a game that is very special to me. I love colony sim games like rimworld, banished, farthest frontier, minecraft with mods etc etc. The list goes on and they are some of the finest video game you can play, blending a mix of management, tycoon and simulation mechanics in with the personal stories of your settlement as it grows up to become a village or town. Now This game Songs Of Syx takes it one step further. It asks what happens if you could go from hamlet to village to town to city to empire. As yes with this game you can build effectively your own roman empire and conquer the world! It is absolutely incredible and made by just one lovely swedish man using java over the last decade. \n\nToday I, the spiffing brit will introduce you to The Best Colony Sim Game You Have Never Played!\n\nTHIS STREAM SUPPORTS CHARITY Donate Here: https://tilt.fyi/mqEgxoujDj\nDonating \u00a335  Supports the Grand Appeal in their efforts to make the outstanding Bristo",
