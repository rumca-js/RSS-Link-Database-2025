The lack of any sort of justified narrative distance of any of the narrators (except for maybe Cyrus a little bit) is absolutely jarring for me. And why does it feel like every character is plucked straight from a cookie cutter version of a person? Almost no one felt super like able to me except for maybe Zee and even he felt more just like a narrative tool than a person.

I do like how descriptive Updike makes the scenes- but he goes WAY too overboard with descriptiveness sometimes, to the point where it takes 10 pages to do what should be done in 1, and you just see these walls of text. There was a sex scene early on in the book, and it wasn&#39;t very good. It kind of feels like nihilistic historical fiction like Catcher in the Rye.
