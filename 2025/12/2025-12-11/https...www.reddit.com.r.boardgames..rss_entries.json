One set of cards, however, had a plastic wrap that was different. It had an adhesive on it and could be opened and closed. We had a small argument about whether or not that is also trash or if it is supposed to be used to store the set of cards. I&#39;ve had many games that had that same plastic wrap so I&#39;m curious as to what y&#39;all do with it.

That sounds weird but let me explain lol</p> <p>So I&#39;m visiting my dad&#39;s side of the family for part of Christmas and it will be me, my grandma, and my two uncles. They all have a genetic condition called Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (fshd) which causes progressive weakness and muscle loss. It mainly effects my grandma and one of my uncles. They&#39;re both wheelchair bound and can&#39;t use their arms/hands too well. </p> <p>Basically what I&#39;m asking for is a couple board/card games that don&#39;t involve a lot of card pulling, writing, etc. During Thanksgiving we played &quot;5 Second Rule&quot; and &quot;I Should Have Known That!&quot; and those worked well for us. My other uncle is more able bodied and I don&#39;t have fshd so we are able to navigate things like timers and stuff like that. We all love stuff ",
