I am technical enough, I use Linux Mint on my work laptop, build my own PCs and can easily download Linux and Windows onto them, and I have tried using Ubuntu for gaming about 3 years ago. Every few years I put my game saves and files on a hard drive and do a complete wipe of my pc. I am days away from upgrading from a mostly Nvidia system to AMD (before rammageddon started yay) and am due to do this.
