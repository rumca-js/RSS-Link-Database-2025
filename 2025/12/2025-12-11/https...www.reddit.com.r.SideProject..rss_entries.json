I\u2019d look at the clock at 3 PM, think \u201cplenty of time left!\u201d and say yes to way too many things. Then wonder why I felt overwhelmed. So I built My_24 - an app that shows how much time you ACTUALLY have left in YOUR day. What it does: \u2022 You set your wake/sleep times (e.g., 6 AM - 10 PM = 16 hours available) \u2022 App shows real-time countdown: \u201c7h 30m remaining until your bedtime\u201d \u2022 Not 24 hours. Not arbitrary. YOUR actual available time. Why it\u2019s useful: When you see \u201c3h 15m remaining\u201d at 7 PM, you think twice before adding another commitment. It\u2019s a reality check. Features: \u2022 Daily countdown (your personalized day) \u2022 Week/month/year countdowns \u2022 Sunset countdown (can\u2019t negotiate with nature) \u2022 Event tracking with reminders It\u2019s free for now. iOS: [<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-24/id6755808346\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-24/id6755808346</a>] Android: Coming soon - in final testing.
