I have a Claude subscription, so I asked the latest model how many egg yolks can be stacked. I started with 2, then gradually went to 10. We had a chat about it, and it thinks the max would be 7. Initially it said 3, but then I asked: how about if it&#39;s someone with a very steady hand, like a surgeon, or a pianist who can play Revolutionaey Etude. </p> <p>I then asked what&#39;s the max height a 3yo toddler can jump from before it becomes unsafe, and it said up to 1 meter should be safe.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Total_Variety_6923\"> /u/Total_Variety_6923 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

In this paper, we integrate four critical electroweak calibrations\u2014the muon anomalous magnetic moment (g 2), the W boson mass anomaly, the Higgs boson mass (m_H), and the top quark mass (m_t)\u2014into a single geometric framework. All parameters are calculated with an effective precision of 10\u207b\u2075\u2070\u2070, using high precision computing (mpmath) to demonstrate convergence. The topological correction of vacuum polarization via the geometric operator O_C completely eliminates observed discrepancies without introducing new particles.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/145368912/Geometric_Calibration_of_Anomalies_and_Mass_Parameters_in_the_GROK_Law_Unified_Analysis_with_10_Precision\">https://www.academi",
