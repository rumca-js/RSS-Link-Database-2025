The in-world fictional royal family are auburn red heads with blue eyes and they&#39;re from a race with auburn red hair but they&#39;re the only blue-eyed house in the books&#39; setting. Think Olivia Cooke (British actress) who has auburn red hair but with blue eyes. The red-haired royal family have ruled for four reigns. The Fourth Reign is so interesting. This arc follows three generations of queens and their five successive husbands, all titled \u201cPrince Regent\u201d (a new title in the books&#39; world), and every single husband is a first cousin or closer.</p> <p>In that fictional kingdom the concept of incest as a taboo literally doesn\u2019t exist, so the books treat cousin",

Give me barricades, secret meetings in basements, magic being used to print illegal pamphlets, all of that. But the more I read, the more I notice how many fictional revolutions feel strangely weightless once you step back from the cool moments. Alot of books hit the same beats - evil empire, ragtag rebels, one big battle, then we cut to &quot;and then everything got better&quot;. No one is arguing about food shortages, no one is mad that the chosen hero just replaced one monarchy with another, the city just sort of snaps into a nicer version of itself. It can still be fun, but it leaves me feeling like I watched a fireworks show instead of a real change, if that makes sense.</p> <p>What really sticks with me are the stories that slow down and show what rebellion actually costs people who arent on the front line.

I really enjoyed the unique blend of funny, body horror, traditional fantasy/sword &amp; sorcery, and really well written prose.

It&#39;s not a very good &quot;proactive&quot; label, being that a lot of authors, even those involved in it&#39;s creation, disavow it. Steph Swainston, who helped coin it, didn&#39;t want the <strong>Castle</strong> series to be called it, and Mi\u00e9ville eschewed the label once it seemed that it was be commercialized. </p> <p>Although publishers tried (insert Mean Girls <em>stop trying to make &quot;fetch&quot; happen</em> meme), it really seems like rather than becoming a subgenre of it&#39;s own, for certain authors&#39; oeuvre to be marketed as, it&#39;s better as a &quot;reactive&quot; label, applied to certain works after the fact based on community reception.
