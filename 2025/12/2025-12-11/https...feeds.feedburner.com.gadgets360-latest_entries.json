        "description": "Researchers in South Korea have developed a carbon-titanium composite that significantly enhances the performance of lithium-sulfur batteries. By embedding titanium monoxide nanoparticles into nitrogen-doped porous carbon, the team created a honeycomb electrode that improves conductivity, stabilizes sulfur, and prevents energy-sapping chemical losses. The new design delivers higher capacity and longer battery life, making lithium-sulfur cells more practical for electric vehicles, drones, and portable electronics. This breakthrough could lead to lighter batteries with faster charging and lower production costs.",

While several of these Earth-sized planets lie in the star\u2019s habitable zone, new observations from the James Webb Space Telescope suggest their atmospheres may be too thin to support life. Earlier hints of methane around TRAPPIST-1e now appear to be background noise, strengthening the case that intense stellar radiation has likely stripped these planets of the gases needed to maintain surface water.",
