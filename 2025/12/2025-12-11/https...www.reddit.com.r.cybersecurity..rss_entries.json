I need guidance as I got two projects to make for my final year and I&#39;ve got no clue on how to make projects as I was busy all my three years on doing jobs to pay for my tuition fee for college. I am mostly interested in cybersecurity and I need to create projects on what I&#39;m interested and present them but I don&#39;t know how to do them or what to do. I know this might sound lame and dumb to some people and I apologise for that but I&#39;m a 19 y old girl all alone without any parent who&#39;d support me financially for me to focus solely on studies I hope y&#39;all understand and guide me on how to begin with making projects and I only have 3 months to submit two projects.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Foreign-Goal-2101\"> /u/Foreign-Goal-2101 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/commen",

CBC-Pad handles plaintext of any length. The ciphertext is longer than the plaintext by at most the size of a single block. Padding is used to assure that the plaintext input is a multiple of the block length. It is assumed that the original plaintext is an integer number of bytes. This plaintext is padded at the end by from 1 to bb bytes, where bb equals the block size in bytes. The pad bytes are all the same and set to a byte that represents the number of bytes of padding. For example, if there are 8 bytes of padding, each byte has the bit pattern 00001000. Why not allow zero bytes of padding?

Technically they did &quot;erase&quot; the files. Though they forgot to erase the system logs during the factory reset.</p> <p>Can we really expect a factory reset to stripe and 0 all storage volumes? </p> <p>I plan to tinker more, I did read the FAQ.
