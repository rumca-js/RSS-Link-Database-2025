        "description": "Call of Duty as a franchise has been facing a lot of issues in the recent past. Its awful campaigns are failing to capture the hearts and minds of its players while the other offerings it brings to the table have faced a similarly lackluster response. \n\nWhile the developers have made an effort to set things right, their strategy for the future of the series is questionable at best. Join us as we take a look at what's wrong with Call of Duty, and explain why the series is on its way to be relegated to a forgettable past.",

        "description": "ROUTINE has been in development for over a decade. And while this time saw the start and end of an entire console generation, as well as the game itself switching from Unreal Engine 3 all the way up to Unreal Engine 5, it thankfully didn't suffer the same fate as games with massive development time tend to do. \n\nIn ROUTINE, you wake up without much of an idea of what you're supposed to be doing or how you even got to the lunar base. However, over the course of just a couple of hours, you learn your main objective: disable the automated security system that has seemingly gone haywire and has been targeting humans. \n\nThe horror experience is heightened by the fact that there's no traditional UI to speak of, and you don't really have any weaponry to deal with the threat posed by the security system. Rather, it's entirely up to you to explore and figure out a way to shut it down, and ultimately, survive.",
