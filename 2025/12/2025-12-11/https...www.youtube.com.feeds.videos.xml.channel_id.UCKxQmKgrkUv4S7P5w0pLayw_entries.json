        "description": "Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow\n\n\u25b8 Kara Zor-El has seen some epic adventures over the years, but she now finds her life without meaning or purpose. Here she is, a young woman who saw her planet destroyed and was sent to Earth to protect a baby cousin who ended up not needing her. What was it all for? Wherever she goes, people only see her through the lens of Superman\u2019s fame.\n\nJust when Supergirl thinks she\u2019s had enough, everything changes. An alien girl seeks her out for a vicious mission. Her world has been destroyed, and the bad guys responsible are still out there. She wants revenge, and if Supergirl doesn\u2019t help her, she\u2019ll do it herself, whatever the cost. Now a Kryptonian, a dog, and an angry, heartbroken child head out into space on a journey that will shake them to their very core. \n\nFOLLOW ME HERE!\n\u25b8 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/ComicsExplainedSub\n\u25b8 Twitter: http://twitter.com/Comicsexplained\n\u25b8 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/comicsexplained\n\nVideos Everyone Loves:\n\u25b8 New To Invinci",
