This talk is perfect for anyone interested in relationships, social connection, wellbeing, personal growth, and adult friendships, offering practical insights and inspiration to prioritise the people who enrich our lives every day. \n\nSheridan Voysey is an author, broadcaster, and founder of Friendship Lab, a pioneering organisation h",

        "description": "In this bold TEDx talk, poet and journalist Aditya Tiwari shares how growing up gay in a small Indian town shaped his voice and nearly silenced it. From surviving homophobia to writing for global publications and becoming a BBC producer, Aditya reveals the unexpected force behind his journey: delusion.\n\nFor him, delusion means believing in a future no one else can see and chasing it with action, persistence, and unapologetic self-belief. Through poetry, activism, and journalism, he learned to turn rejection into fuel and untold stories into power.\n\nThis talk is a reminder: your dreams don\u2019t need permission. Be delusional, just smart enough to\u00a0make\u00a0it\u00a0real. Aditya Tiwari\u2019s voice spans continents and platforms with his work featured in Times Of India, VICE, The Telegraph, Hindustan Times, and more. Whether it\u2019s reporting from the ground, writing poetry, or producing podcasts, he captures the raw, real, and often overlooked stories of our time. This talk was given at a TEDx event using t",

        "description": "Community-led sanitation shows how dignity and urban health are rebuilt from the ground up. Discover why sanitation and dignity must rise together: Sanitation and dignity rise and fall together, yet millions still navigate cities without safe toilets. This talk exposes how fragile urban life becomes when sanitation systems collapse, and how community-led infrastructure can transform that reality. Drawing on work with plumbers and residents, it reveals how simple maintenance can save millions of litres of water, prevent disease, and restore human dignity. From high-density settlements to global megacities, the lesson is universal: society cannot thrive if sanitation fails. When citizens organise, innovate, and insist on dignity, even the most neglected systems can be rebuilt from the ground up. As director of Sticky Situations, Jen van den Bussche works to improve water and sanitation services in high-density urban areas. Her projects combine technical solutions with community engageme",

She synced her hidden self with the spotlight version, filters gone.\n\nNow hungry for psychology and philosophy, she calls out \"forever careers.\" Growth blooms in grey zones, failures rewire your world, and you ignore society's script.

From a disciplined defense upbringing and excelling as a national athlete to transitioning from KPMG to becoming an award-winning emcee, Aanchal\u2019s journey is a powerful tale of breaking boundaries and embracing change.\n\nHer accolades, including the National Child Award and her profound impact in the entertainment world, showcase how courage and resilience lead to extraordinary success.

She navigates engineering confusion, IT boredom, dusty infrastructure sites, and entrepreneurship before realizing drones could solve real problems beyond wedding photoshoots.\n\nCrashing prototypes, ignored pitches, rejection after rejection. She learns entrepreneurship isn't glamorous unicorn chases or LinkedIn success stories. It's surviving the big failures, being told no a hundred times, and showing up for the 101st attempt with unwavering grit.\n\nIn 1.5 years, Akin grew organically from an idea to Forbes 40 Under 40, government partnerships, and national recognition. Her philosophy: Don't build for applause, build for impact. Ignore the noise. Trust your intuition. Let confusion become clarity, and failure\u00a0become\u00a0fuel.

Rather than diluting tradition, she preserves its sacred grammar while transforming its cinematic language. Through choreography, music, camera movement, and emotional pacing, Bharatanatyam transcends the stage and becomes pure storytelling on screen.\n\nIn her hands, classical dance isn't decoration. It's the narrative itself. Every gesture carries meaning. Every frame advances emotion. Even viewers unfamiliar with the art recognize themselves in the movement, saying, \"That's my story.\"\n\nBharatanatyam has evolved from temples to courts to concert halls. Now, standing at the digital threshold, Savitha asks a crucial question. \"Can classical art survive by staying archived, or should it evolve to breathe new truths into contemporary\u00a0life?\" Savitha Sastry has redefined the art of Bharatanatyam, blending traditional movements with contemporary narratives to create powerful, modern expressi",

Drawing from chaos theory, we will explore why embracing unpredictability and tiny changes isn\u2019t just scientifically sound, but it\u2019s essential for growth. Christos Lazaridis is a Learning & Knowledge Management Architect at ASML, an ex-CERN physicist and a computer geek for as long as he can remember. His journey from probing the fundamental particles of the universe to designing learning experiences reflects his belief that complex systems (whether in particle physics or our personal development) thrive when embracing uncertainty and iteration.\nToday, Christos designs learning experiences and knowledge management solutions that help people develop new skills and navigate complexity. His work sits at the intersection of learning innovation, scientific thinking and human development, where the principles of chaos theory offer valuable insights for cultivating a growth mindset.

        "description": "The power of culture is that it is collective\u2013\u2014and it is organized, collective power that can bring about real and revolutionary solutions to the plastic pollution crisis. In this TEDx talk, Liz Havstad relays her experience from her work at Hip Hop Caucus, challenging the petrochemical industry at the sites where they want to build new facilities in Black, Brown, Indigenous and low-income communities. Havstad says we must obliterate the industry narratives that purport plastics and petrochemicals as essential to our communities, economies, and our overall way of life. Liz Havstad is Hip Hop Caucus\u2019 Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer, leading the diverse team, grassroots leaders, and cultural influencers that make Hip Hop Caucus one of the nation\u2019s most dynamic 21st century civil and human rights organizations.
