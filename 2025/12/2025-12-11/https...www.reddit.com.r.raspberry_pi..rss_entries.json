I have gotten the Pi Zero 2 W and I want to set a static IP for it but for some reason regardless of what I do I just can not get the static IP to stick, I have tried multiple different methods and none of them seem to work. I would love to do it via ethernet cable but seem like the power isn&#39;t enough to use a Ethernet to USB(or vise versa). I am attempting to use my Z2W for Pi Hole.</p> <p>I have looked over the different methods and a lot of them are 2-4 years old, trying to find one that actually WORKS in the past year(2025) is quite difficult, before someone asks if I have tried google YES I have and that still doesn&#39;t do anything for me. If any of you have work around that works I will greatly appreciate it. </p> <p>TIA. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/silverskyhigh\"> /u/silverskyhigh </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"h",

No changes are made to the router&#39;s settings or the wi-fi&#39;s password, so I&#39;m having trouble pin-pointing the cause of this pop-up. The wi-fi on the device does disconnect, meaning it loses connection to my back-end and can&#39;t be remotely fixed (which means I have to spend some time with the staff at the restaurant and teach them how to fix it). At this point in time I have to hit cancel (connect doesn&#39;t do anything) then go select the wi-f",
