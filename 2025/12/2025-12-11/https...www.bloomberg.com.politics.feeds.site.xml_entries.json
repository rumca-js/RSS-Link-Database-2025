It follows fiscal second-quarter earnings which fell short of analysts' estimates.\n\nThe Fed delivered its third rate cut in a row, with policymakers maintaining their outlook for just one cut next year. Fed Chair Powell voiced optimism that the US economy will strengthen, as the inflationary impact from tariffs fades away.\n\nMeanwhile, US forces intercepted and seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, marking a serious escalation of tensions between the two countries.\n\nToday's guests: Aneeka Gupta, Director of Macroeconomic Research at WisdomTree.
