But a few surprises have already leaked onto the internet, including what look like the first images from the upcoming Tomb Raider remake. The remake will be a top-to-bottom retelling of the original game from 1996, but it will be set in the same continuity as the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy that began in 2011. Another major leak is the reveal of the villain in the upcoming 007 First Light game. The villain, Bawma, will be played by Lenny Kravitz. And in other news, Helldivers 2 dev Arrowhead has teased a roguelite mode, but don't get your hopes up.

While the visual style is genuinely striking, it is frequently undermined by confusing camera work, with the execution of this \"punk rock dystopia\" vision suffering from a lack of disciplined editing. The heartfelt story does eventually coalesce into something genuinely touching \u2013 but getting there requires patience, with repetitive dialogue and awkward transitions padding out that path. Rhythm fans seeking tight, focused gameplay could still find something to enjoy in the high score chase and rocking soundtrack of its arcade mode \u2013 but if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after, the story mode is probably worth skipping entirely.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
