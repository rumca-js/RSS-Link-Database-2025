I got tired of dealing with expensive/restricted official APIs for social media platforms, so I built something that might be useful for fellow self-hosters.

Instead of dealing with 5 different APIs with different auth methods, rate limits, and approval processes - you get one unified interface running on your own server. Why self-host this?</p> <p>No API approval needed - uses browser automation with your own cookies Your data stays local - no third-party services involved No rate limit BS - you control the pacing Free - official APIs can cost $$$ (looking at you, LinkedIn)</p> <p>Tech stack:</p> <p>FastAPI + Playwright Each platform runs in isolated bridge servers (if Instagram crashes, Twitter keeps working) Cookie-based auth</p> <p>Docker setup: yaml# docker-compose.yml coming soon, f",
