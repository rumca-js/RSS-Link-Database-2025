        "description": "This week, at the IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM 2025), imec, a research and innovation hub in advanced semiconductor technologies, successfully demonstrated the integration of colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) on metasurfaces developed on its 300 mm CMOS pilot line. This pioneering approach enables a scalable platform for the development of compact, miniaturized shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral sensors, setting a new standard for cost-effective and high-resolution spectral imaging solutions.",
