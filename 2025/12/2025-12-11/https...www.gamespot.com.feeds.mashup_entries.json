As frustrating as that may seem, it could mean that this OG Pass will have more skins than these usually do.</p><p>There are three skins in the part of the Season 7 OG pass that we <em>can</em> see, and judging by the ones Epic picked, it wouldn't be surprising at all if there were additional skins later. This first part of the OG pass includes three remixes of skins from the Chapter 1 Season 7 battle pass--Voidwalker Lynx is unlocked instantly with a purchase of the pass, and you can earn Lt. Winter and Wonder Onesie by leveling up. Wonder Onesie has the most customization options of any OG pass skin thus far, as you can decorate her with any of the sprays or emoticons you have in your locker.</p><p>No",
