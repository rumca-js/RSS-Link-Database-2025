More than 1,000 people were killed in Israeli strikes that ripped through homes, hospitals and even a prison during visiting hours.\n\nFault Lines travels to Iran to uncover the human cost of the conflict. We meet grieving families who lost loved ones, from 12-year-old Amir Ali and his father, to two-month-old Rayan and his parents \u2014 and follow the painful recovery of four-year-old Kian, who survived with life-altering burns. We also speak with the brother of Maryam Vahed Panah, killed in the attack on Evin Prison. The team secures a rare on-camera interview with Iran\u2019s foreign minister as the country braces for the possibility of another war.\n\nTarget Tehran examines the motives behind the attacks, which Israel and the US claim were centred on Iran\u2019s nuclear programme, and asks the pressing question: why now?\n\n#iran #iranisraelwar #donaldtrump #benjaminnet",

From basic training to senior military education, service members are extensively trained to recognize and respond to unlawful commands. Hamilton highlights the precedent set by the Nuremberg Trials, emphasising that following illegal orders is not a defence. He also discusses the legal complexities surrounding recent US administration actions, including strikes against Venezuelan drug boats, and the role of Congress in authorizing military actions.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\n Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n#USMilitary #IllegalOrders #Milita",
