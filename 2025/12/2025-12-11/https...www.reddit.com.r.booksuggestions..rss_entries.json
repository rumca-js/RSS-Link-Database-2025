What I need is a novel on a current issue around the world, especially one where it&#39;s a big component. Specifically, I would like a fiction book on one of the following subjects: sexism, racism (especially if its against Asians, as I feel I could do a better project if I relate more), human rights, homophobia, abuse/neglect, or mental health. It would also be great (but not necessary) if it weren&#39;t a book where this issue is cut and clear. I already have lots of possible book ideas, but none have really clicked with me, so I&#39;d appreciate some other suggestions!

I got super burnt out after flying through The Stormlight Archive at the end of 2024 and then rereading A Song of Ice and Fire back to back earlier this year and have not even looked at anything related to fantasy in several months. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking to expand my interests next year, but I do want to add 2-3 fantasy books to my list. I love anything that&#39;s thick, epic, covers a wide scope of characters and events, screams political intrigue, rips my heart out, feels hopeless and dark, etc. I like virtually any sub-genre of fantasy you can think of (excluding romantasy...not my vibe). I also prefer books where the MCs actually have flaws and everything doesn&#39;t always go their way due to a nonsensical magic system that just happens to go in their favor or some scapegoat tactic. Any suggestions? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by",

She honestly didnt read much before become an empty nester but she&#39;s started picking up romance books and surprisingly to me she loved Pachinko but was devastated by the bittersweet ending. From the books she has read, she seems to like complex fleshed out characters that overcome some kind of personal struggle.</p> <p>She&#39;s honestly had a difficult life and I think she wants to use reading as a bit of an escape. She is an immigrant and very dedicated to her family so I think thats why she resonated with Pachinko. That being said she&#39;s not a fan of fantasy or magic books. Pretty much everything has to be grounded in reality for her to like it. </p> <p>Any suggestions? Thanks!

I understand that my wording may not make sense (thanks to a particularly nasty concussion), so I will try to explain as best I can. I am looking for pieces from Ancient/Classical literature to Victorian literature (no later than 1901) that may depict the concept of a mother&#39;s unconditional love despite the monstrous nature/behavior of her child/children. It&#39;s specifically the unconditional motherly love and care that I am looking for. It doesn&#39;t even have to be the theme of the entire piece, just so long as it&#39;s a clearly defined moment that you can point to. I am not looking for simply reading recommendations so much as I am looking for the purpose of a personal research project. I figured that there must be someone out there who has read something akin to what I am look",
