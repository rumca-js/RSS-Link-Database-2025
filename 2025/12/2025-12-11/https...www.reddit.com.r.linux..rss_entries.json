Every time I pushed the machine \u2014 gaming, compiling, video conversion \u2014 it would shut down or throttle hard from overheating. When it did throttle in time, performance was still awful; games like Starfield, Fallout 4, No Man\u2019s Sky, and Cyberpunk were out of the question. Now those run smoothly at good-to-best settings, and that\u2019s exactly why I decided to take matters into my own hands.</p> <h1>The story in one paragraph</h1> <p>It started as a tiny bash script to keep the CPU sane. That script grew into a C application, which became a system daemon, and over several iterations evolved into a full project. Today Burn2Cool has matured into Version 4.0 with a complete control stack and multiple user interfaces \u2014 far beyond the little script it began as.</p> <h1>Announcement \u2014 Burn2Cool Version 4.0</h1> <p>Burn2Cool Version 4.0 is a major upgrade ",
