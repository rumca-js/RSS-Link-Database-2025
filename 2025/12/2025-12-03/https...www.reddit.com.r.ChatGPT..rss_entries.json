So, the plan is to make what they have already better, faster, more reliable, ect. The release if chatgpt 5 was a flop and with the competition closing in it sounds like they want to keep all the users they have as much as they can. However, will their plan of pausing new features cause people to leave anyway if that includes stopping any development that the \u201cadult mode\u201d still needs? Personally, I could care less for the erotica stuff. i use it for making stories and I just want to be able for my character to take his shirt off at the beach without chatgpt saying \u201chey bud lets take a break you&#39;re getting too horny\u201d what do you think? </p> <p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-code-red-google-gemini-00d67442c7862e6663b0f07308e2a40d\">https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-code-red-google-gemini-00d67442c7862e6663b0f07308e2a4",
