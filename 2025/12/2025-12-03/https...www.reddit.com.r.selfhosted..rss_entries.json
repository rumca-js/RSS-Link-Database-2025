But ofc I had no backup yet. I have now uploaded all my photos to the proton drive, and it automatically uploads new ones, as a backup for the photos in Immich.</p> <p>But then.. Of I have all the photos in proton drive, do I really need Immich? A Nas in general? I also run Jellyfin on it, but I could just as well just stream with Kodi.</p> <p>So that brings me to my question.. What makes it worth it for you to have a Nas and selfhost?
