On one hand, we are able to produce high-quality, realistic content at pennies of the cost (when we overcome AI slop). But it also makes it very hard (or impossible), to actually tell what is real. Youtube and Facebook have increasingly been replacing regular videos with AI generated videos, without any disclaimer that they are AI-generated. I am not referring to AI-generated movies or music; I am referring to videos we would normally watch (like rare disaster events, funny dog videos, animal videos, etc.). Now, they are almost entirely inseparable from real videos, and I am not sure if what I am looking at is real or not anymore.</p> <p>I am wondering the long-term effects of this to society.

Trustworthiness concerns whether an agent merits trust, while trustability names a prior condition: whether the entity in question is even the kind of thing to which trust can coherently apply. Focusing on Faulkner\u2019s grammar of trust and recent work by Massaguer G\u00f3mez on human\u2013robot interaction, we argue that many artificial intelligence systems today elicit trust without being trustable\u2014a category error with ethical consequences for the design, deployment, and governance of emerging technologies. We propose that trustability functions as a normative threshold for evaluating whether trust in AI is not only misplaced but also structurally incoherent, and we show how this concept allows us to differentiate between merely instrumental r",
