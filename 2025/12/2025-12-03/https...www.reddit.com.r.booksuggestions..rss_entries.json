He was obsessive and groomed me. You can figure out what he did to me on a work trip. Well, because of his manipulation it\u2019s taken me quite a long time and effort to actually start seeing it for what it actually was instead of what he fed to me. Reading about these topics really helps me in my healing journey - they make me feel seen and help to break down the protective walls. </p> <p>Maybe a list of possible themes would help: -Obsessive \u201clove\u201d -Toxic, but charismatic (ie manipulative) male -Grooming, especially in adults -TW: SA / Harassment is ideal honestly -Stockholm-Syndrome-Esque</p> <p>The closest I have found is My Dark Vanessa, but it didn\u2019t hit as hard because of the big age gap.</p> <p>Ps - I\u2019m fine with any genre except fantasy or sci-fi ",

I&#39;m looking for adult fantasy books that fit a specific Chinese inspired theme, and I have a serious preference for a woman protagonist *and* a book who&#39;s written in a 3rd person POV, except I feel like I already read most of them; The Poppy War, She Who Became the Sun, The Greenbone Saga, The Priory of the Orange Tree for one of the character... In YA I also read Iron Widow, but I&#39;m just not a fan of YA book/writing in general. </p> <p>I love grimdark, heavy politics, morally grey characters... Looking for any recommendation from less known author maybe? Otherwise my TBR list is going to be pretty empty soon, I&#39;ll precise, I did read all the Sequel/Prequel of any books mentioned and I also ordered The Grace of Kings even though it technically doesn&#39;t have a female MC. Sword of Kaigen is on my TBR. </p> <p>Thanks for any recommendation! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/us",

This is for my gay-trans Polish guy friend, he&#39;s dating an Italian guy. He&#39;s practicing law. He and I literally bonded over the band called Cigarettes after sex and we&#39;ve been best friends for five years. His favorite song is &#39;Sweet&#39;. Do you perhaps know any queer romance that could match this CAS vibes? Those who know the songs may understand what type of vibes it would give. He&#39;s also the type of dude who&#39;d read Kafka and Dostoevsky, or history about his own country as he&#39;s patriotic, I&#39;m not sure if the songs would vibe outside romantic books.

Based on the book description, the cover, etc, I thought I&#39;d love the book. Now knowing this is her first novel, makes more sense.</p> <p>Now after they finally enter Fortune&#39;s Kiss, the story picked up, I started wanted to know what happened next. Now I follow the 100 page rule, if I don&#39;t like a book by page 100, I&#39;m done. </p> <p>This very very narrowly cut it, getting my interest between page 80-90. In my opinion, when the book started the characters sort&#39;ve lacked depth, though as the story went on they gained layers and some development. </p> <p>My biggest issue with the series are the last maybe... 5 chapters.</p> <p>Spoilers:</p> <p>So, firstly, it was very rushed for an ending.

For this reason, I would like a book between 200-500 pages. She&#39;s almost 50 so not a childish book and she likes fantasy novels. When I was younger, I saw her reading series like The Spooks by Joseph Delaney, Harry Potter, Eragon by Christipher Paolini and Tunnels by Gordon/Williams. She read a lot of books by Anne Robillard, a popular writer here in Quebec. It includes the series : chevaliers d&#39;\u00e9meraude (Emerald Knights) and A.N.G.E (A.N.G.E.L) that is about reptilians hidden in the society.
