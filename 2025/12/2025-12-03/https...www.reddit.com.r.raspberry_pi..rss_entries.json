I only have an old pi 2, which is by far not good enough. But the specs of the pi 5 should be more than enough.

The NAS does have ethernet, so my goal is to make the Pi act as a network extender. I have read posts regarding using the Pi as a switch with network devices hiding behind the Pi, but I need communication from my existing network to the NAS.</p> <p>Thanks for any help! If you can help but need more information on the set-up, please let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/knouqs\"> /u/knouqs </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pcpqwt/need_help_bridging_to_nas/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pcpqwt/need_help_bridging_to_nas/\">[comments]</a></span>",
