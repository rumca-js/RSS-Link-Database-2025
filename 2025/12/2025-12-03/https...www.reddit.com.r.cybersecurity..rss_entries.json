So I decided to build a framework that runs a hacking agent against a set of 32 web app CTFs, giving each LLM 2 attempts (and 50 turns) to solve each one. For now I&#39;ve tested the main models such as GPT-5, Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok and a few others, but as time goes on I&#39;ll evaluate the open-source models and update the results to include newer releases like Gemini 3.0 and GPT-5.1 to see how they stack up. </p> <p>After burning through a large number of OpenRouter tokens I found that GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 both solved 29/32 challenges, but GPT-5 did it at 63% less cost. GPT-5 Mini also massively over-performed for its cost, solving 26/32 while being 84% cheaper than Sonnet 4.5. </p> <p>If you want the full details, read the blog post below, or if you j",

I have close to zero knowledge on cybersecurity. I am learning from scratch. The other interns are from cybersecurity background so they know what they are doing. I&#39;m worried that I might do something I&#39;m not supposed to do without knowing. The people at the internship are asking to pentest on shopping websites, etc. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s legal. I don&#39;t know up to what extent it is legal. Can I get suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/masterofno_ne\"> /u/masterofno_ne </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1pcs7qx/cybersecurity_internship/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1pcs7qx/cybersecurity_internship/\">[comments]</a></span>",
