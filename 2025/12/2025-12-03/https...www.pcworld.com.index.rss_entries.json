What\u2019s a botnet, you ask? Simply put, it\u2019s a collection of computers and other devices that have been infected with malware. From such a botnet, cybercriminals launch attacks on websites or servers. For example, DDoS attacks or they send spam and phishing emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The owners of the hijacked computers and network devices are unaware of this unless they check the traffic coming from their machines. However, this requires experience in using network analysis tools such as Wireshark or Nmap.

But VPNs also provide an excellent solution for improving accessibility to the streaming services you already subscribe to, and Norton\u2019s latest version is an effective, affordable way to augment your online streaming. There is a range of extras you can bundle in for just a few dollars more, too.\u00a0 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the streaming experience isn\u2019t consistent around the world. Different territories have access to different streaming services and different content on those services.
