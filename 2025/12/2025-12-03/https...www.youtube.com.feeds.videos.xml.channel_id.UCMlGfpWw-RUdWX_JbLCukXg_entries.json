From raw pointer manipulation to unchecked type conversions, many of C++\u2019s legacy features still leave developers dangerously exposed \u2013 even in modern codebases. \n \nThis talk begins with a candid look at how C++\u2019s bug-prone constructs and permissive design can lead to subtle, hard-to-diagnose issues, especially in high-stakes domains like automotive, aerospace, and medical systems. We\u2019ll explore how undefined behavior and other low-level pitfalls compromise software quality, reliability, and maintainability. \n \nThe second part of the session focuses on mitigation strategies. We\u2019ll introduce MISRA C++, a widely adopted set of guidelines for writing safe and robust C++ code, and walk through several of its key rules wi",
