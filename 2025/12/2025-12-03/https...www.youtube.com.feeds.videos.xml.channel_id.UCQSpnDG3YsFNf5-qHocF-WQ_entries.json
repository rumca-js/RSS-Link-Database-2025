        "description": "The free windows tool called Everything search is truly legendary.\n\nI've used a lot of programs for Windows over the years, but I think by far the most useful one is a search tool called Everything. It truly puts regular Windows search to shame, being able to instantly call up every single file on your entire computer instantly as you type.
