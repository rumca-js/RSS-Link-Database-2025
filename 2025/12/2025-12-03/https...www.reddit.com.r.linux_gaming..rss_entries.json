I found a super cool tutorial over on youtube that allowed me to get Mod Organiser 2 running through proton and launch-able through steam itself but encountered a problem: Most mods that have animations require you to run either FNIS, Nemesis or Pandora (Pandora so far is the best one) which I of course cannot do because the .NET libraries that are required for this exe are not present in my Skyrim instal. </p> <p>So my question is: Has anyone been able to get Pandora working in MO2 for Skyrim SE on Linux and if so, what is the best way to do this? Did you instal steam through bottles and import the .net framework into the bottle this way? Is the only way to create a windows VM (id rather not do this)? </p> ",

Yesterday, I decided to fire up Helldivers 2 (which has been working fine with Proton on Steam prior to this issue) and noticed that there was a 15.4GB patch. Figured it would take 15/20 minutes to complete so I just left it. Came back to it about 30 minutes later and found that instead of downloading and patching, it was now validating files.

Which is great, I love that for them and the linux community at large. </p> <p>My question is: Is there anything I&#39;m missing in bazzite that isn&#39;t in a distro intended for gaming? Seems like there is a new poster child distro every so often in the Linux community (no shade). Is that what this is? Am I missing something? Is there a feature I am missing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Funy_Bone\"> /u/Funy_Bone </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1pcsnhs/bazzite_hype/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1pcsnhs/bazzite_hype/\">[comments]<",

I have two monitors that are both 1440p but I was running them at 1080p for a while because it was just easier to see things that way. They were further away from me on my old desk setup but now they aren&#39;t, so I changed them to 1440p. </p> <p>Everything looks way better, but as soon as I try to run pretty much any game on Steam that&#39;s even a little demanding, my PC crashes and restarts. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a driver issue, a Linux issue, or if my GPU or some other piece of hardware just isn&#39;t able to handle 1440p. Any suggestions for where to start troubleshooting? </p> <p>Here&#39;s my setup: </p> <p>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7700X</p> <p>GPU: Sapphire Pulse RX 6600</p> <p>Motherboard: Asus ROG Strix B650-A</p> <p>RAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR5 32GB (2x16)</p> <p>PSU: Thermaltake Smart 700W 80+</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",
