        "description": "I colorized, restored, and created the sound design for this rare 1930s Kansas City , which offers an exceptional historical glimpse into the daily life of a well-off Black family during an era marked by segregation, economic recovery after the Great Depression, and the cultural vibrancy that defined many African American communities in Midwestern cities. This film not only preserves an intimate family moment but also highlights a rarely documented perspective of Black middle-class life in the early 20th century.\n\nVideo Restoration Process:\n\u2714 FPS boosted to 60 frames per second \n\u2714 Image resolution boosted up to HD \n\u2714 Improved video sharpness and brightness \n\u2714 Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)\n\u2714added sound only for the ambiance\n\u2714restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) \n\nPlease, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.\n\n\nJoin this channel to benefit ",
