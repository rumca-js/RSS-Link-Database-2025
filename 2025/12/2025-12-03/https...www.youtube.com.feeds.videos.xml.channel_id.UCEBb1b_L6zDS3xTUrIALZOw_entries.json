It discusses the derivation of the least squares estimator, the interpretation of the Hat matrix as a projection, the distributional assumptions under the normal linear model, inference using t- and F-tests, and model diagnostics including residual analysis and influence measures, concluding with extensions to generalized least squares for correlated errors.\n\nLicense: Creative Commons BY-NC-SA\nMore information at https://ocw.mit.edu/terms\nMore courses at https://ocw.mit.edu\nSupport OCW at ",
