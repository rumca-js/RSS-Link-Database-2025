While I did some research, I kind of just went with an initial deal on a recommendation from someone else I know. </p> <p>Anyways, currently I use nzbgeek and have EasyNews and UsenetExpress. Looking at my logs, EasyNews seems to handle 90-95% of my requests over the last 6 months. I&#39;m wondering if maybe it&#39;s redundant to have both, and would I be better served by adding another indexer like nzbplanet or something similar?</p> <p>Filling out my media, I&#39;ve noticed some failures with some &quot;missing items,&quot; but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s wholly an indexer issue or server issue. Just looking to cover my bases as best as I can.</p> <p>Any help or disclosure of everyone else&#39;s setup would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/West-Ticket5411\"> /u/West-Ticket5411 </a>",
