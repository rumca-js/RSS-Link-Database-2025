Since large language models are often trained to produce the response that seems to be desired, they can become increasingly likely to provide sycophancy or state hallucinations with total confidence. The new training model tries to encourage a secondary response from the model about what it did to arrive at the main answer it provides. Confessions are only judged on honesty, as opposed to the multiple factors that are used to judge main replies, such as helpfulness, accuracy and compliance.

Its &quot;write with AI&quot; feature, which you could previously activate when drafting an email, now works across your inbox, calendar, and the web. This means it can now pull in information from other emails or research a topic online. The AI will think for as long as it needs before responding to a prompt and will open its Ask AI tool if it needs clarification.</p>\n<p>Ask AI now lives in a left sidebar when you\u2019re on desktop, so it\u2019s always accessible should you need to draft a note, ask a question or quickly schedule a meeting without digging around in your emails. You can also now check your Ask AI history on iOS and desktop for previous conversations. Write with AI is also now available on Android, which will soon gain the other new features too.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f1eeabc0-cf96-11f0-",
