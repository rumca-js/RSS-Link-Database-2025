What impact is it doing to the environment and other people? </p> <p>I&#39;ve always wanted to cancel Prime subscription but I couldn&#39;t. It was so convenient... I did reduced my purchase frequency and tried to google search better deal before buying but I couldn&#39;t get to the end of the cancellation screen. I forgave myself that this problem is with the government for allowing monopoly. </p> <p>To be fair, my subscription continues until the end of the billing cycle. So maybe I need to reread this book to brace the inconvenience. </p> <p>What other books do you recommend that make you feel uncomfortable (but in a good way)? I want to feel uncomfortable. It&#39;s not right to take these comforts for granted.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",
