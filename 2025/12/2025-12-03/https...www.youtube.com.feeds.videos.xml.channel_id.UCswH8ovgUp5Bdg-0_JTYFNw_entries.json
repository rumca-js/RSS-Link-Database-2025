        "description": "The COVID inquiry\u2019s claim that Britain acted \u201ctoo slowly\u201d now reads less like hindsight and more like ideological groundwork: a justification for future lockdowns, expanded emergency powers, and a population conditioned to accept instant suspension of ordinary life. When that narrative is paired with secret national crisis drills, a Campbell\u2019s executive mocking the public while pushing bioengineered food, and Klaus Schwab launching an academy to shape the next generation of managerial elites, the pattern becomes unmistakable. These aren\u2019t isolated stories \u2014 they\u2019re components of a managed reality in which safety is the pretext and control is the destination.\n[UNPACKED]\n\nGo to https://rumble.com/premium/BRAND and join the movement.\n\nRead this essay first at russellbrand.substack.com\n\nWATCH me LIVE Monday, Wednesday, Friday - on Rumble: https://bit.ly/russellbrand-rumble\n\nAll links: https://linktr.ee/RussellBrand",

        "description": "\u23f0 BE HERE AT 12PM PT / 3PM EST / 8PM GMT \u23f0\n \nJoin us here for a PREVIEW of our daily one-hour RUMBLE show. \nTo continue watching the show in full, join me exclusively over on RUMBLE: https://bit.ly/SF658-live\n\n\nIn today\u2019s show, I sit down with Dr Peter McCullough for a deep, revelatory conversation about the ideology of vaccination, the collapse of institutional trust, and the spiritual dimension behind our culture\u2019s faith in technocratic authority. We talk through the history he uncovers in his new book, the religious motifs baked into modern public-health messaging, the psychological and political mechanisms that kept dissent suppressed, and the new evidence forcing major institutions to quietly revise long-held claims. It\u2019s a discussion about truth, power, and awakening \u2014 and how ordinary people can reclaim moral and intellectual sovereignty in an age of manufactured consensus.\n\nBuy Dr Peter McCullough\u2019s excellent new book \u2018Vaccines: Mythology, Ideology, and Reality\u2019 - https://bit.",
