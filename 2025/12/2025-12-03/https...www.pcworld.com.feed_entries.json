That was followed by articles on who died in 2025 (#2), serial killer Ed Gein (#3), US President Donald Trump (#4), and the new Pope Leo XIV (#5). Other political figures such as Elon Musk (#6), Zohran Mamdani (#7), and JD Vance (#16) also appear on the list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several pop culture entities also took spots on the top 20 list. Ed Gein probably trended so high because of the latest season of Netflix\u2019s <em>Monster</em> anthology series.

Many smart bulbs can be screwed into existing light sockets, and they can be controlled remotely, put on schedules, change colors, and more.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re feeling more ambitious, you can venture into smart string lights, light strips, wall and ceiling fixtures, smart lamps, and even smart lighting for the yard or other outdoor areas.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our guide to the best smart lighting can help you navigate the thicket of options, from the various smart light manufacturers (like Philips Hue, LIFX, Nanoleaf, and Wyze) to the connectivity standards (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Matter). We\u2019ll also let you know which voice assistants (like Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, and Google Assistant) work with which lights.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-headin",
