Back then and up until about 2008 all search engines worked great. Starting from about 2008-2010, there&#39;s been a slow but progressive suppression of many web pages, turning up instead those fake algorithmically created pages, or commercial crap websites like <a href=\"http://howto.com\">howto.com</a> or medium.com. I&#39;m specifically asking older people because newer generations never even had a chance to see how the internet was like, so they have no means of comparison.</p> <p>The censorship greatly increased after the deployment of the first AI engines, and it happears to be global. Yandex, the russian SE, was one of the very few which up until a year ago seemed to KINDA work, now even that has turned to shit.</p> <p>Even more disturbing is the fact that this massive censorship and suppression of information is not only political but pertains to all kinds",
