My friend had seen 100+ shows and couldn&#39;t remember half of them. There was no way to look back and see their favorite shows of the year or to see fans highest-rated show for an artist.</p> <p>With apps like Goodreads, Letterboxd, and Beli blowing up, I kept thinking - <em>why doesn&#39;t this exist for live shows?</em></p> <p>So I built <em>Encore - concert collection</em>!</p> <p>I spent the last 6 months building it solo - no co-founder, funding, or technical experience, just grinding through development from scratch. It&#39;s basically Letterboxd but for live music - rate/review every concert",

On the positive side, it gives you way more data than a normal scale \u2014 body fat, muscle mass, water levels, visceral fat, metabolic rate, all of it. When it works, the trend tracking is actually useful. Seeing changes over weeks instead of obsessing over a single weigh-in helps make sense of training and diet, especially if you&#39;re lifting and bodyweight alone doesn\u2019t tell the full story.</p> <p>The downside is consistency. The readings can jump around if you weigh in at different times or if your hydration is off, and sometimes the app connection is flaky. I\u2019ve also seen a lot of people complain about customer support being slow or unhelpful, which tracks with some of the hiccups I\u2019ve had getting the device synced. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d treat as medically accurate \u2014 it\u2019s more of a directional tool than a precise measurement device.</p> <p>Overall, Hume Health i",

Commenting under such posts often doesn&#39;t get you any of that. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve built a platform where you can upload your app (simple link is enough) and other people will use it and give you feedback in exchange for credits that they can then use to get their own apps tested (more on how it works later). The platform has almost <strong>600 users</strong> and <strong>366 tests</strong> were already done so the idea is more then validated and the system works.</p> <p>Here is how it works:</p> <ul> <li>You can <strong>earn credits</strong> by testing indie apps (fun + you help other makers)</li> <li>You can <strong>use credits to get your own app tested by real people</strong></li> <li>No fake accounts -&gt; all testers are <strong>real users</strong></li> <li>Test ",

It&#39;s got tools for emails, professional writing, career stuff, legal documents \u2013 basically anything where you need help writing something important. The whole thing works great on mobile too, which was actually harder than I thought it&#39;d be. I set up different subscription tiers, added some gamification stuff to keep users engaged, and got all the backend infrastructure running smoothly. Here&#39;s the thing though \u2013 I&#39;ve been working on another project idea that I&#39;m way more passionate about, and I just don&#39;t have the bandwidth to run both. So instead of letting this collect dust, I figured I&#39;d see if anyone here wants to take it over. Everything&#39;s ready to go. All the code, the backend setup, payment processing \u2013 it&#39;s literally ready to launch or rebrand however you want. ",
