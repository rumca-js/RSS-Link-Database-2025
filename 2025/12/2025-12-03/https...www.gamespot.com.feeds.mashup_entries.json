Its appeal lies in the loop of building a deck, upgrading it while ascending the spire, reacting to relics and events, and seeing how far you can climb. Slay the Spire wasn't the first game of its kind, but it is the one that set the genre on fire, inspiring dozens of other games to replicate its mechanics and structure in their own unique ways.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">If you\u2019re looking for more games like Slay the Spire that replicate that feel--drawing cards, constructing synergies, riding the tension of a run--this list will get you started. Below are 15 excellent games that channel that deckbuilding and roguelike spirit, each with its own twist or flavor on the formula.</p><p> </p></p><br/>     <p><h2>Balatro<",
