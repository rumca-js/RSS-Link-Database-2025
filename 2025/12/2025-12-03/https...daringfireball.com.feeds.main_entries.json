        "description": "<p>Back in July, I was lucky enough to have my friend Louie Mantia <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/07/31/ep-428\">on The Talk Show</a> to talk about Liquid Glass and (as I wrote in the show notes) \u201cthe worrisome state of Apple\u2019s UI design overall\u201d. This was probably my favorite episode of the show all year, and I think it holds up extremely well now that we\u2019re all using Liquid Glass, across Apple\u2019s platforms, in release versions.</p>\n\n<p>Included in the show notes was a link to Mantia\u2019s essay making his case against Dye\u2019s decade-long stint leading Apple\u2019s UI design teams, \u201c<a href=\"https://lmnt.me/blog/a-responsibility-to-the-industry.html\">A Responsibility to the Industry</a>\u201d, which began thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Firstly, I maintain that it makes absolutely no sense that Alan\nDye has the power he has, because he simply has no taste. But\nwhat\u2019s worse is that he wields that power so clumsily, so\ncarelessly. And because it goes unchallenged, unchecked by someone",

Somehow,\nthis episode (along with many others) do not include all the\ndigital visual effects that were in the original broadcasts and\nhome video releases. It\u2019s a bizarro mistake for Lionsgate and HBO\nMax to make and not discover until after the show was streaming to\ncustomers.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/tvaziri.com/post/3m6zcqcrzsc2a\">I decided to help illustrate the changes</a> by diving in and\ncreating images that might do better than words. The first thing I\nnoticed is that, at least for season one, the episode titles and\norder were totally jumbled. The puke episode is \u201cRed in the Face\u201d,\nnot \u201cBabylon\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So HBO Max not only ruined several episodes by \u201cremastering\u201d the wron",
