It&#39;s tedious, especially when you add or remove nodes.</p> <p><strong>The solution:</strong> syncthing4swarm handles all of this automatically. It deploys Syncthing as a global service, manages device discovery between nodes, and keeps everything in sync without manual intervention.</p> <p><strong>Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>One-command deployment across all Swarm nodes</li> <li>Automatic device discovery and pairing</li> <li>Works with your existing Swarm setup</li> <li>No manual configuration needed per node</li> </ul> <p><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/sammonsempes/syncthing4swarm\">https://github.com/sa",
