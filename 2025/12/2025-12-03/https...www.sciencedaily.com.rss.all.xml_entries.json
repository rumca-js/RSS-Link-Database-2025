The protective effect held steady across multiple analyses and was even stronger in women. Evidence also suggests benefits for people who already have dementia, hinting at a therapeutic effect.",

With sweeping spiral arms, rapid star formation, and an orderly disk resembling our Milky Way, it defies long-held theories about how slowly galaxies should assemble. Thanks to JWST and gravitational lensing, researchers could examine the galaxy in remarkable detail, revealing that the early Universe was far more capable and dynamic than expected.",
