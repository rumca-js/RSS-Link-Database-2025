To preface, I drive a newer model Mazda that has keyless start and the button on the door to unlock the door if the keyfob is within range. I was parked in a walmart parking lot, car on, talking to my mom for a moment before we went in. A lady ran up to my passenger door and\u2026 just stood there with her hand on the door handle. Didn\u2019t try to open it. Mom and I figured okay, maybe she\u2019s got the wrong car? She looked high maybe. But after I honked and she didn\u2019t move, we were extra weirded out. She could see we were in the car, didn\u2019t try to talk to us or open it. After maybe 30-45 seconds she walked away to HER car in front of us. Opened the back door. Then ran back and did it AGAIN, hand on the handle, staring at us, we could hear something maybe metal tap agai",
