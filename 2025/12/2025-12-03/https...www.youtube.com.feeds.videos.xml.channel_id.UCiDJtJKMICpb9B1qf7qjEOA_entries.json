        "description": "It's been a few years since Adam built his sci-fi blaster prop storage trunk, and it's one of Adam's favorite things to let visitors to the cave touch and explore. But since that build, the lights have stopped working and it needs aesthetic upkeeping. So it's time to remove all the props from it and give it a much needed build refresh!\n\nThe making of this blaster storage trunk: https://youtu.be/jxDSEulomCg\n\nShot by Adam Savage and edited by Josh Self\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nSavage Merchandising: https://adamsavage.com/\nAbout Tested: https://www.tested.com/about\nMeet Adam in Person: https://www.tested.com/events\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@testedc",
