I genuinely love that unapologetic challenge, but an equal number of things about it are obnoxious, janky, or just plain scuffed to an unacceptable degree \u2013 that includes its subpar performance and bugginess, its absolutely atrocious UI, and its unmitigated plague of cheaters. There is still a stellar, tense, and realistic FPS with one of the best progression treadmills ever made buried underneath all that, feeding you interesting things to do for hundreds of hours. But if the jankiness doesn\u2019t entirely smother its promise, the absurd pay-to-win options that completely undermine much of Tarkov\u2019s difficulty come very close. There are still plenty of good times to be found for those with the gumption to push past a who",
