        "description": "PC gamers are facing a situation that many of them are unlikely to have seen before. With soaring prices on important components like RAM, SSDs, and HDDs, getting a PC capable of running the best of today's gaming experiences is becoming a challenge. \n\nFor those of you looking to upgrade your setup, there are solid reasons to wait if you can manage to pull it off.

Do these prices affect you if you're a console owner? \n\nAre there ways to manage a solid gaming PC without stretching your budget too far? Join us as we take a look at all of these questions and more, and take a look at how and why it's more expensive to get a solid DDR5 RAM kit than it is to buy a base PS5.",

        "description": "Sleep Awake gets a lot of things right, but a few important things wrong which hold it back from true greatness. It's still a great game with a unique premise and a story that's sure to tug at your heartstrings, a rarity in a horror title. \n\nIts presentation is its biggest draw, reeling you into a world in which the horror has come and gone, leaving you to deal with the aftermath. Does that translate to a gameplay loop that's fun enough, however? \n\nWe dive into what makes this one tick, and help you decide if it's going to work for you if you decide to pick it up. Join us as we break down the best and the worst of this unique eye-popper from Eyes Out.",
