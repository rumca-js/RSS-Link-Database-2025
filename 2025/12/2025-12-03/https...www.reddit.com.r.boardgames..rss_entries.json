I liked the design/balance while reading the rules, but in practice, it fell a little flat and lacked big or exciting moments. Could be worth revisiting, but I also don&#39;t have a big urge to bring it out when there&#39;s other great games to be played.</p> <p><strong>15. *Tacta</strong> (1 play; 5.5/10) - Play cards onto the table and overlay them onto other",

One day there were five of us, and we decided to play Lords of Waterdeep with the expansion. Lords of Waterdeep was a real letdown after so many rounds of Dune. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll play it again. It\u2019s strange, because we really enjoyed Lords of Waterdeep just about half a year ago.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/QuoteEconomy1526\"> /u/QuoteEconomy1526 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1pd6k7n/time_to_sell_lords_of_waterdeep/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1pd6k7n/time_to_sell_lords_of_waterdeep/\">[comments]</a></span>",

From a new creator like me so I felt like I was connected. Read the campaign description and really liked the idea of a Euro game mixed with a more skirmish or war kinda game. Guys, truly, it was more than I expected.</p> <p>Opening the box, and what a box this is. Lots of components and with a high quality also. Loved the gems and relics. Miniatures also are in high detail and immerse you immediately in this torn world. Mostly the lost souls. Many many many player components beside the miniatures for each player. Deck of cards, a lot of flags to mark your conquests, I guess, wooden tokens that represent roads and a useful bundh of tokens to track various things during the game.</p> <p>Reading the rules, was a really immersive almost cinematic experience. A lot of flavor text that enriches the theme and gives you hints ",
