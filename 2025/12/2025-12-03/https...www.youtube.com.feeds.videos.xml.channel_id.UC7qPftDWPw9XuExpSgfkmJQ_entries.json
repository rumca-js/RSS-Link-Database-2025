        "description": "Alexandra Palace has miles of hidden basements and tunnels beneath it; and they\u2019re filled with decades of lost BBC history. This was the birthplace of British television in 1936; and the remnants are still down there if you know where to look.\n\nI found abandoned studio gear; a Ferguson Reflections TV; a full bowls alley with a 1985 scoring system; dusty archive records; and even a wall made from thousands of broken bottle shards for reasons nobody can explain.\n\nA strange; eerie; fascinating time capsule hiding right under one of London\u2019s most famous landmarks.\n\n#AlexandraPalace #BBC #RetroTech #UrbanExploration #BroadcastHistory",
