So, while I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, I couldn&#39;t help but wonder, why aren&#39;t all movies converted to the same quality? Was this movie in particular produced with a professionally created 3d version? Were they creating the effects with 3d in mind? Are a lot of 3d movies converted to 3d after the fact? </p> <p>I don&#39;t have a lot of 3d movies under my belt yet, but I can&#39;t imagine too many movies were made with effects as good as ghost in the shell. </p> <p>It blew me away.

I got a vr headset years ago; you put the phone in the front compartment and bam, you\u2019re on a roller coaster or in the jungle. My nephew recently found it (I forgot about it) and wants to play some games. I found a roller coaster app he likes. But I remember a game where you were sitting cockpit in a jet, flying around and going through rings/dodging buildings/I think it was timed? I don\u2019t need that specific game but do you have any suggestions? I don\u2019t want him in battle, just a fun jet racing game where you move your head to steer. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/One_Cod_9397\"> /u/One_Cod_9397 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pctc1y/jet_obstacle_course_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pctc1y/jet_obstacle_course_game/\">[comments]</a></span>",
