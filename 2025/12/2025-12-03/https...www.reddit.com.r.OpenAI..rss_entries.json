Now, they are almost entirely inseparable from real videos, and I am not sure if what I am looking at is real or not anymore. </p> <p>I am wondering the long-term effects of this to society.

Will it be possible for the advertisers to see which clicks from chat gpt lead to sales on their shopify stores etc? If they can only monitor clicks from chat gpt, but not clicks leading to purchases, then the ads will be less valuable. The tracking restrictions in the EU might also be a problem.
