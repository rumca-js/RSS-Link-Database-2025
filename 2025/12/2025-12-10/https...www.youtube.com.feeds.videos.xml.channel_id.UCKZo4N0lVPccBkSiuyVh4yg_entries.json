Today, we\u2019re diving deep into a massive Wizarding World theory that connects the Founders of Hogwarts, the Deathly Hallows, the Peverell Brothers, and the final duel of the series in a way you have NEVER heard before.\n\nFor years, fans have debated whether the Deathly Hallows were created by the Peverells\u2026 or given to them by Death. But what if the bigger twist is that the Peverells didn\u2019t exist at all?
