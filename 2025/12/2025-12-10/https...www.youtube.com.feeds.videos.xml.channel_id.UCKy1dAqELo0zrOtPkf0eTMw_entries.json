        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe Call of Duty dev team has issued a statement basically acknowledging Black Ops 7's shortcomings and promising to move off the back-to-back yearly release of mainline Call of Duty games. This comes as Black Ops 7 was met with middling reviews and apparently worse sales numbers in the face of stiff competition this year. EA's Battlefield 6 and Embark Studios' ARC Raiders both launched around the same time and were met with widespread acclaim. Black Ops 6 was released only last year, and Modern Warfares 2 and 3 were also released in back-to-back years, leading many fans to complain each entry did not feel or play substantially different from the previous year's. In other news, two new games are being added to December's PlayStation Plus lineup: Assassin's Creed Mirage and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. They join the recently-released skating game Skate Story.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
