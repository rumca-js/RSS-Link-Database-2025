I\u2019m looking for simulations or games where I can practice dealing with social conflict or aggressive behavior. </p> <p>About 10 years ago, I had a really uncomfortable situation at work, so bad that it genuinely traumatized me. This guy (I work in the legal field) humiliated me during a negotiation. I was 23 at the time, just starting out, and I didn\u2019t have much experience in my field. It was so awful that I\u2019ve been avoiding him ever since. He is 20 years older than me btw. </p> <p>Luckily he left my company and went to a competitor, but my bosses told me this week that in 2026 I\u2019ll have to deal with this jerk again. No excuses allowed, because of my specialty, I\u2019m the one who has to handle the negotiation.</p> <p>Yesterday I had a huge anxiety attack just thinking about what\u2019s coming, and today I realized that maybe I can use VR to train my mind and work through some of these fears.

However, trying to run VR games now causes my PC to emit loud usage noise and go into complete death freeze (VR disconnects, keyboard doesnt respond, etc). Confirmed to occur on Half Life Alyx and Half Life 2 VR (For comparison to how it used to run on GTX 1070, Alyx was playable on low settings and HL2VR was very laggy, but at least it didnt totally freeze). And to be more specific on when the death freeze occurs, I am able to launch the game, load the level, play for a few seconds and then it freezes completely.</p> <p>Can you guys help me find the cause?

I&#39;ve been through a metaquest 3 which I ended up selling for personal reasons... And now I have the quest 3s which worked perfectly with steamvr and virtual desktop to do. Beat saber, fruit, Ninja and even duck season. Worked phenomenal with it. But now all of a sudden. My vision is severely pixelated in the headset and I can&#39;t figure out why. And before you mention the network thing, I&#39;ve checked my network passes all of the things with flying colors... I have literally some of the best of the best Wi-Fi and for some reason the visuals are horrendous on both virtual desktop and steam link. I am genuinely confused here and I don&#39;t know what to do. </p> <p>Is there a setting that I should enable on the 3s to get higher video performance off of it or was there an update that made it all go completely out the window!?
