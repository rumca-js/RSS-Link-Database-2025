        "description": "Video games are fantastic and I love playing them but after a decade of professionally breaking them I must say they have gotten very easy. It does not help that certain publishers like ubisoft and EA seem obsessed with turning the default difficulty into a frictionless experience with incredible hand holding that removes the suspense and purpose of the game. That brings me to the focus today. A game that on the normal difficulty is an absolute walk in the park but thanks to some modifications I have made the game is now a proper stealth action fps with an experience that no other game can compete with! \n\nSo today I am setting up an impossible challenge in a game with the most extreme permadeath difficulty I have dealt with when failure is inevitable and incredibly easy. So Can the spiffing brit beat this challenge or is it truly an impossible game!\n\nChapters:\n02:00 - What is Going On\n38:00 - The Meat and Potatos\n39:40 - Outro\n\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.yo",
