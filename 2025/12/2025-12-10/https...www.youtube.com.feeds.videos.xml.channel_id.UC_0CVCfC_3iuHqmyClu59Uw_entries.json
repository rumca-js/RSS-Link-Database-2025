        "description": "2025 has been absolutely wild for x86 handheld gaming PCs.\nWe\u2019ve got Ryzen AI Max+, Z1/Z2 Extreme, Lunar Lake, OLED screens, 80Wh batteries, and more handheld power than ever\u2026 but which ones are actually worth your money?\nIn this video I go over my top x86 handhelds of 2025, breaking down raw performance, ergonomics, screen quality, battery life, pricing, and overall fun factor. From monsters like the GPD Win 5 and MSI Claw 8 to value champs like the Steam Deck OLED and feature-packed beasts like the Legion Go 2, I\u2019ll let you know which devices still make sense going into early 2026.\nBy the end, I\u2019ll tell you which handheld is my personal favorite\u2026 and I\u2019d love to know which one is yours in the comments!\n\u26a0\ufe0f Note: This video only covers x86 handheld gaming PCs \u2013 no ARM/Android-only handhelds here. Windows or SteamOS out of the box doesn\u2019t matter, as long as it\u2019s x86.\n\nROG Xbox ally X: https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/DyEaj2\nLegion Go 2: https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/554vmn\nLegion Go",
