On December 17, <em>Rayman 2: The Great Escape </em>and <em>Tonic Trouble</em> are joining the Switch\u2019s Nintendo Classics library. As a reminder, N64 games are exclusive to Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, along with the emulators for the Game Boy Advance, Sega Genesis and GameCube.</p>\n<p>For retro gaming completionsists, <em>Tonic Trouble </em>might actually be the more interesting get for NSO, despite being far less well known than the Rayman series. It was Ubisoft\u2019s first 3D platformer, but a number of delays meant it ended up releasing in the same year as <em>Rayman 2</em>, and therefore has become a bit lost to time. The game stars an alien janitor named Ed, who accidentally drops a powerful green tonic out of his spaceship and all over Earth, making a mutated mess of the planet that he has to clean up.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-conte",

If you\u2019ve ever had a video call freeze in one room or watched a stream buffer in another, a mesh Wi-Fi system can fix those frustrations.

They keep dozens of devices connected at once, manage traffic intelligently and often include helpful app features that make troubleshooting or adjusting settings much easier. Many support the latest Wi-Fi standards and faster internet plans too, so you can upgrade your network without replacing everything else.<br><br>We\u2019ve tested a range of mesh Wi-Fi systems to find the ones that deliver the best mix of speed, coverage and reliability.
