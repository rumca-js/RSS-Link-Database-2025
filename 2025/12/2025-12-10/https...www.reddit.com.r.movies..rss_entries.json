Just watched this movie for the first time actually and was immediately hooked by the concept and world building. Theres some cool parallels to draw with our world, and commentary to be made about capitalism and wealth inequality.</p> <p>Everyone in their world stops aging at 25 and uses their lifespan as currency. The poor struggle to even stay alive while the rich gamble and waste away decades. At the same time, people are still vulnerable to random acts of violence, so violence and robbery becomes rampant.</p> <p>The movie starts off pretty strong and has a lot of positives I think, but it starts to fall apart later on. Lots of interesting concepts get brought up (a wealthy man at the beginning talks about being old enough to crave death, the poor do everything as quick as possible to make the most of time, and there are &quot;timekeeper&quot; cops to enforce rigid structure to the society).</p> <p>",
