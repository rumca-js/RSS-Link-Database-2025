Other times it actually finishes generating but the UI is frozen, so I am staring at an empty screen wondering if my laptop decided to quit its job.</p> <p>I cannot believe this is some massive, unsolvable issue. It really feels like a simple optimization thing that just has not been given love yet. Does OpenAI know this is happening? Are they planning to fix it? Because long chats turn into sludge and it is getting ridiculous.</p> <p>And if there is some magic workaround, please tell me. Do people just start new chats every so often? Clear cookies?
