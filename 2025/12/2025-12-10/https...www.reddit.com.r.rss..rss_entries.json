It&#39;s not a full RSS reader, but I&#39;ve found it useful for finding content that I would never have otherwise stumbled across.</p> <p>I&#39;ve made some updates to the site since my original post and would love to get some feedback from you folks. As in the previous version, the site sorts posts by inverse frequency, with the hope that time between posts will serve as a good proxy for quality. The crawler discovers feeds on its own rather than relying on submissions, so there&#39;s a bit of serendipity as to what shows up. However, the site now also supports user accounts, voting, and the ability to subscribe to feeds you like.</p> <p>Again, I would love to hear what you guys think! Currently trying to decide where to go from here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",
