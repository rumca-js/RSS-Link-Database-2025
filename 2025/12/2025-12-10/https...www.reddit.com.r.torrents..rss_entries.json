Some little times it just works normally.</p> <p>I started troubleshooting this and i became clear that it&#39;s connected to the transmission package on the synology. So i started to troubleshoot there. The strange thing is that whenever i change a setting in transmission, the internet works perfectly for 15-45min, and then it starts acting up again.</p> <p>I tried: * Changen the port forwarding to tcp only * Overall allowed torrents to 20 instead of 300 * Allowed torrents for 1 torrent to 1 instead of 50 * Allowed download and upload speed tot 1kbps * Allowed si",
