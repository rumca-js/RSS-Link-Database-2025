The pace of AI development has gotten so fast that it\u2019s hard to keep track, so I figured having a single hub would help me (and maybe others) make more sense of it.</p> <p>I also noticed how Western media tends to dominate the conversation and often overlooks what\u2019s happening in the East. So I\u2019ve been collecting AI news from around the world to keep things balanced.</p> <p>After just a week of gathering updates, I was honestly surprised by how many companies are building AI or doing work that connects to it. I even built a subsystem to spot patterns and group related stories.</p> <p>I\u2019d love for you to check it out and let me know what you think. It\u2019s a small project, but I\u2019m curious to hear your honest opinions. <a href=\"https://www.racetoagi.org\">https://www.racetoagi.org</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Di",
