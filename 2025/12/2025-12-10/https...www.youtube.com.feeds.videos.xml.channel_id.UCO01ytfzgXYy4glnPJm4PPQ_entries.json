        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Hollywood has been on a mission over the past several years to convince our children that evil doesn't exist and bad people and criminals are all really just misunderstood. Today we'll look at the lates example of this kind of slop, and I'll explain why it really matters. Also, horrendous hag Jennifer Welch launches yet another attack on Erika Kirk. I am really fed up with the way Erika has been treated. We'll discuss. Plus the the guy who owns ChatGPT says that he doesn't know how parents could raise their own children without it. Well, I think I can answer that question for him.\n\nEp.1705\n\n-- -- --\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos daily. https://www.youtube.com/@mattwalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\nClick here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\n-- -- --\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:32 Opening\n00:57 - 31:24 The Real Reason Hollywood Keeps Turning Villains Into Heroes\n33:40 - 50:19 The Attacks On Erika Kirk Need To Stop\n50:20 - 52",
