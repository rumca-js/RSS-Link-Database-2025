        "description": "We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Forty-Eight! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\n\nWhen a leviathan of truly Lovecraftian proportions washes up on a nameless medieval shore, the folk around it descend into cult and eldritch madness. This diceless Diorama #28 Skirmish game lets you recreate the battles between the various cults that spring up in a Folk Horror arthouse game. Let's dive in!\n\nCheck out the Rulebook HERE: https://www.patreon.com/posts/132177380",
