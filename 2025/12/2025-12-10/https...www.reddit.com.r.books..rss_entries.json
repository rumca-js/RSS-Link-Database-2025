Learned so much about how the society and the systems were created to make poor stay poor. Then last week I picked up this one.</p> <p>It&#39;s about an American editor in 1990 who was middle-class but went undercover, pretending to be poor. She spent three month working various low-wage jobs\u2014in fast food, hotels, and nursing homes. Basically, her experience perfectly matched the reasons why the poor find it so hard to escape poverty, just like it&#39;s explained in the book Poor Economics. </p> <p>1) The Catch-22 of Housing</p> <p>First, the housing situation is a total trap. A poor person can&#39;t afford a huge upfront cost, right? So, staying in an apartment would be cheaper in the long run, but she can&#39;t scrape together the money for the two months&#39; r",

I was really excited to read this book. It seemed interesting, and I was curious about the conditions and personalities that lead to atrocities. I quit in the third chapter because NONE OF IT IS PROPERLY RESEARCHED. O\u2019Reilly made an accusation against king Henry VIII that didn\u2019t seem right, and was in fact disproved by the shallowest google search possible. I then went to the book\u2019s reference section. Of the 11 chapters most have less than 5 sources, and all these sources seem to be for things like newspaper articles and population data, not biographical information. His chapter on New Orleans slaver has ONE SOURCE. This could have been a really cool book, and it is instead a massive waste of time. The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the library instead of paying good",
