        "description": "Five million years ago, Earth accidentally handed whales the ultimate power-up. Ocean currents shifted, nutrients exploded to the surface, and suddenly rorqual whales found themselves in an all-you-can-eat buffet stretching across the planet. Their secret weapon? Lunge-feeding \u2014 a move so absurdly effective it turned them from \u201cpretty big\u201d to \u201crecord-breaking giants.\u201d No myths, no legends, no secret tournament of sea monsters \u2014 just physics, plankton, and one evolutionary jackpot.",
