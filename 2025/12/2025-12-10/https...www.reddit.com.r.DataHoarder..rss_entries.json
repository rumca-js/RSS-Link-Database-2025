Okay, with all this madness about SSDs, RAM, and HDDs, I want to grab something while I still can... I want to get a WD Passport 5TB ($140) or My Book 6TB ($160). Portability is not as important to me as data transfer speed. But maybe someone knows about using a power supply for an HDD, if it&#39;s safe to buy one in terms of voltage and all that, or if it&#39;s better to use additional stabilizers.

My understanding is that USB is almost always a bottleneck (presumably especially so in my case where I don&#39;t have any USB 3.0+ slots available), so why do I see so many USB-based DAS units?
