This is with any and every movie/TV show I click to watch. It&#39;s getting annoying and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s fixable.

Do I need to get a better torrent add on because this one doesn\u2019t seem to have it anymore, I remember checking on my laptop and it had 4k and then I checked on my phone and it doesn\u2019t idk if I\u2019m bugging or not but I checked others on my phone and they had 4k, which sucks because I was really excited to rewatch it tonight </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitte",
