I, ever since i was a young child have been fascinated with holocaust history, more specifically, stories of jewish survivors from concentration camps, or beautifully wrote fictions about holocaust stories. i have read so many novels on the holocaust and im looking for new reads. my favorite author is ruta sepetys who wrote \u201cbetween the shades of grey\u201d and \u201csalt to the sea\u201d, both books made me sob and i was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for more holocaust books like those. other reads i enjoyed were the MAUS books, prisoner b-3087, out of hiding, and number the stars. anything helps, thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/miss_spence\"> /u/miss_spence </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pip32a/looking_for_new_holo",

I&#39;m looking for a book that&#39;s filled with angst, heartbreak, death, betrayal, fateful bad luck - literally anything that can make me cry. Ideally, romance + emotional pain is my favorite but I&#39;ll definitely take non-romance recommendations too of course. </p> <p>I haven&#39;t cried in a bit and the books I&#39;ve been reading haven&#39;t allowed me to emotionally connect with the characters well enough to actually be properly upset on behalf of them. For example: Heartless absolutely destroyed my emotionally because of the <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">self-sacrifice at</span> the end so I am 100% up for books that don&#39;t have a happy ending too.</p> <p>I&#39;d really appreciate anything at all because I&#39;m craving a cathartic crying session and nothing has been ripping my heart to shreds the way I need which is getting frustrating. </p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",
