Easy to set up, good reporting. </p> <p>Today, I see on my Wordpress admin dashboard that a plugin update (from 0.10.10 to 0.10.13) is available. After a successful update, the site immediately crashes and is inaccessible with Wordpress error message on white screen that website encountered a critical error. Backing up brings me back to the Wordpress Admin dashboard. Deactivated / reactivated to no avail. Deleted and reinstalled resulted in the same error. </p> <p>So for now, I\u201dm keeping it deactivated until I get some more time to troubleshoot. Anyone else seeing this and/or have ideas on how to fix? I may have to open a ticket with Microsoft, but I\u2019m dreading this path. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u",
