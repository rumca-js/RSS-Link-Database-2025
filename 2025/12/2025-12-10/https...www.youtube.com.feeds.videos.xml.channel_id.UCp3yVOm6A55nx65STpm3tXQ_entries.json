Go to http://meter.com/craftcomputing to book a demo today.\n\nGrab yourself a Pint Glass or Insulated Coffee Tumbler at https://craftcomputing.store\n\nI have a growing problem, in that I'm constantly running out of space in my server rack. With two 64-Core AMD Epyc virtualization hosts, a Supermicro Microcloud X79 8-Node chassis, and a pair of 45Drives Storinators, it's no wonder I'm out of room. Today, I'm consolidating my NAS servers down into a single server, and also dramatically expanding my storage to a full 328TB!\n\n*Links to items below may be affiliate links for which I may be compensated*\n\n- Name Suggestions Welcome for the new NAS -\nAMD Threadripper 9970X: https://amzn.to/45ftroj\nASUS Pro WS TRX50 -SAGE WiFi CEB: https://amzn.to/4lhF9oD\nG.Skill G5 Neo 4x32GB 6400 ECC: https://amzn.to/3Jj2h8H\nIntel 3D XPoint 16GB Optane Boot Drive: https://ebay.us/XMuv2c\nSupermicro 846 24-Bay Chassis: https://ebay.us/rCA4eb\nMellanox MCX455A-ECAT Conn",
