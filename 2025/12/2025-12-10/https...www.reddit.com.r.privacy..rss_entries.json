Unfortunately his account got deleted because his mom deleted it, and i decided to try export the chat we had in my data export chat history, but for some reason the chat is gone and the pictures. Does saved chats get removed with users that have deleted their account? I tried contacting snapchat suppport but theyre kinda useless. They only said something in the line with saved chats cant be recoverable after account deletion but my account is still active so im wondering would our chat still be included in my data export?.
