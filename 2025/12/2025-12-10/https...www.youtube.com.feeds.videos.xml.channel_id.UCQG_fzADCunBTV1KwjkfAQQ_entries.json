I am Dianxi Xiaoge, a Yunnan native. If you enjoy my videos, please keep subscribing to my channel. I'll continue to share my life and Yunnan-styled food in my uploads. Wish you have a happy life and enjoy tasty food every day\n\nYouTube\u3010\u6ec7\u897f\u5c0f\u54e5 Dianxi Xiaoge\u3011\u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2MH1T5N\nFacebook\u3010\u6ec7\u897f\u5c0f\u54e5 Dianxi Xiaoge\u3011 \u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2TsGflr\nInstagram\u3010dianxixiaoge_apenjie\u3011\u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2Wagkze  \nTikTok\u3010dian",
