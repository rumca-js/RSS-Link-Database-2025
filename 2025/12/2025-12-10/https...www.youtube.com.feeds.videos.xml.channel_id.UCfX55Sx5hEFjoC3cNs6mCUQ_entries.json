In this conversation, Frank Nagle, Chief Economist at The Linux Foundation, breaks down his new working paper and explains why open models could radically reshape the AI economy.\n\n We talk about performance gaps, switching costs, misconceptions about data exposure, and the emerging economics behind open vs closed AI models.
