One of the issues I had when releasing it was the absurd difficulty of handling all package managers and all the different quirks in god knows how many different linux distros. For the most part of the program I simply built a GitHub actions workflow that used python scripts to generate PKGBUILDS and commit them with git to the AUR. Since the AUR didn&#39;t require any other manual processes it was the only one I could easily automate. The remaining users used shell scripts,</p> <p>I also tried Open Build Service from OpenSuse and it was so hard to implement with so few documentation that I basically gave up halfway.<",

I just bought a Mac mini 2012 2.3Ghz quad-core intel core i7, and already ordered ram to max at 16gb and an ssd to make things smooth. </p> <p>I\u2019m doing this, because I never used Linux and wanted to experience it on my own before applying it to a future gaming desktop. </p> <p>I was thinking of using this Mac for browsing and light emulation like gba. Is there any recommendation for other uses and OS\u2019s I should try for it? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/O_Adamast0r\"> /u/O_Adamast0r </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1pioxi0/mac_mini_2012_switch_to_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1pioxi0/mac_mini_2012_switch_to_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>",

There is no proper linux alternative for memtest pro (aka hci memtest) or testmem5 (1usmus5 profile being particularly efficient). </p> <p>Linux does have stressapptest which is very good for stressing the memory controller (on the CPU) but it it will miss other types of instability issues. Same is try for y-cruncher VT3 and VST. </p> <p>You can try to run other y-cruncher stresstests (different versions have different tests available) but all those are incomplete so not sufficient by itself even if they can be useful for fixing specific instability problems (same hols true for memtest86+). </p> <p>Another problem i noticed is that linux prevents 1.2 GiB of ram from being utilized after booting while windows and memtest86+ only has 0.2 GiB being unavailable. </p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6u2g0200n96g1.png?width=270&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b92b1a3b9a6fbbd1f94a2f6caade7a2bc2332b2\">ht",
