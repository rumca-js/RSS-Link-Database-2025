        "description": "The Roblox CEO got angry when asked about child safety and that\u2019s the whole problem.\n\nRoblox CEO Dave Baszucki went on the Hard Fork podcast to promote a new age verification feature and talk about the platform\u2019s future.\n\nInstead, the hosts pressed him on Roblox\u2019s long history of child safety issues and the interview got tense fast.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, Baszucki became audibly frustrated and insisted the topic was \u201cold.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s exactly the issue:\n\nRoblox wants to be seen as a metaverse for everyone, yet many still don\u2019t trust it with kids today.\nYou can\u2019t sell the world on your future if parents don\u2019t feel safe in the present.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Visit our YouTube channel for more content.",
