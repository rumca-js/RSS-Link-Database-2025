For the first time, Unreal Engine will be used for all graphics required, from virtual 3D to 2D overlays. \n\nThis talk sees Erizos Studio demonstrate a proven workflow that enables TV2 Fyn to standardize on a single render platform: a vanilla instance of Unreal Engine. \n\nWatch to find out how this is a strategic move for TV2 Fyn, both to enhance their current broadcast quality and also enable future opportunities where the content is delivered to a multi-platform audience.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#BroadcastGraphics, #MotionDesign, #2DOverlays, #TV2Fyn, #ErizosStudio, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestStockholm",
