At first it sounded simple enough, but the deeper I go, the more it feels like every layer of the Android ecosystem quietly pulls you back into Google infrastructure whether you want it or not. Things like push notifications, location providers, captcha checks, app compatibility, and even basic background tasks often lean on components that expect Google Play Services to be present.</p> <p>I am trying to figure out if anyone here has built a setup that avoids all of that while still being usable for daily life. Not a lab experiment or a phone that breaks every second day, but something that lets you text, navigate, message people, use banking apps, and handle basic tasks without spending the whole week troubleshooting.</p> <p>The more research I do, the more it feels like going Google free turns into a long list of patch",
