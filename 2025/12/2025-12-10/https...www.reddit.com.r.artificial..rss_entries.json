In simple terms, AI hallucination is when a model produces information that sounds confident and well-structured, but is actually incorrect, fabricated, or impossible to verify. This includes things like made-up academic papers, fake book references, invented historical facts, or technical explanations that look right on the surface but fall apart under real checking. The real danger is not that it gets things wrong \u2014 it\u2019s that it often gets them wrong in a way that sounds extremely convincing.</p> <p>Most people assume hallucination is just a bug that engineers haven\u2019t fully fixed yet. In reality, it\u2019s a natural side effect of how large language models work at a fundamental level. These systems don\u2019t decide what is true. They predict what is most statistically likely to come next in a sequence of words. When the underlying information is missing",

No hype here, just honest things that actually made my results better:</p> <p><strong>1. Stop asking AI \u201cWhat should I do?\u201d, ask \u201cWhat options do I have?\u201d</strong></p> <p>AI\u2019s not great at picking the perfect answer right away.

This is especially true in real-world areas where we seek to answer complex questions based on hypothetical evidence to determine actions for intervention. However, determining the graphical structure of a BN remains a major challenge, especially when modelling a problem under causal assumptions. Solutions to this problem include the automated discovery of BN graphs from data, constructing them based on expert knowledge, or a combination of the two. This paper provides a comprehensive review of combinatoric algorithms proposed for learning BN structure from data, describing 74 algorithms including prototypical, well-established and state",

I\u2019m more interested in whether an AI can talk the way people actually do jokes, sarcasm, late night overthinking, that kind of natural flow. While working on this, I realized most AI companions still feel either too emotional or too clinical, nothing in between. So I\u2019m curious: What makes an AI feel human to you? Is it tone? Memory? Imperfections? Something else? I\u2019m collecting insights for my project and would love to hear your thoughts or examples of AI that feel genuinely real (or ones that failed).\ud83e\udd0c\u2764\ufe0f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/One-Ice7086\"> /u/One-Ice7086 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pix178/why_do_ai_friends_feel_scripted_has_anyone_tried/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1pix178/why_d",
