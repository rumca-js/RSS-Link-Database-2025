During which we&#39;ll have a megathread up that&#39;ll be updated with relevant game reveals, award winners, and anything else newsworthy.</p> <p>Community members are encouraged to submit trailers and other newsworthy topics as they normally would. We&#39;ve enabled the &quot;TGA 2025&quot; post flair for all the event reveals.</p> <p>We have no plans to a live update thread (they haven&#39;t been popular in the past and are often just redundant, less efficient sources of information), but comments will be open on the megathread - and set up so the newest comments will always be at the top. </p> <p>You can also join us <a href=\"https://discor",
