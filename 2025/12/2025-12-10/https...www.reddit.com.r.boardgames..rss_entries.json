I enjoy Wingspan (base game), and I&#39;m thinking about getting Expeditions, as I like Scythe as well. A lot of gripes I hear about Expeditions (&quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot;) seem like things I don&#39;t necessarily hate about Wingspan, so maybe I will enjoy it just fine.</p> <p>For more context, my wife and I get a good amount of gameplay from games that let us both do our thing, with maybe some interaction. I enjoy direct conflict, but her not so much. We also enjoy games like Ark Nova, Everdell, and Cascadia. If we got Expeditions we would hope to get both 2 player and 4 player use out of it, which we do with Wingspan.</p> <p>What else do you like/not like about Expeditions, and how does it compare to the low-interaction engine-building mechanics of Wingspan?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/crossscoff\"> ",

Run the best vineyard. Build the best industry. Make the most money trading. Whatever.

Even more so if it hampers your game play or is logically inconsistent. </p> <p>A great example of this is Agricola. I know this is probably heretical, but I hate it. Why do I want children? Victory points. Why is it better to have a pig and a sheep instead of two sheep?
