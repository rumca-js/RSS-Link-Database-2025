To try to see how to get help I installed gnome screenshots, and tried to take a screenshot of the message saying that there wasn&#39;t a host. So it worked, but when I pressed the screenshot button, be it for full screen or whatnot. It says that all methods failed</p> <p>I did run sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade to see if it could do anything, but it still didn&#39;t work. Also tried turning",

I think the file system is corrupted and I want to send a new sd card with a new os installed. Whats the easiest way to do this? I want my parents to only plug the new sd card in to the pi. Also is there anyway to get around the 6 hours raspberry pi connect, if not can I pre install teamviewer and configure it so I can log in right away after it gets plugged in?</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ajc1616\"> /u/ajc1616 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1piqmc8/send_a_new_sd_card_to_my_remote_pi/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1piqmc8/send_a_new_sd_card_to_my_remote_pi/\">[comments]</a></span>",
