We use LT, which I believe is strictly 2D only, so no need for 3D. I believe the biggest thing we&#39;d like are simplicity and similarity moving from AutoCAD LT in terms of UI layout and workflows. DXF and DWG support would be nice but I don&#39;t think it would be a deal breaker. I&#39;m willing to pay for a perpetual license, but I&#39;d like to stay away from adding subscriptions if possible.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen people recommend FreeCAD, QCAD, LibreCAD, and nanoCAD. FreeCAD seems to have a focus on 3D which I don&#39;t believe we would need. I like the idea of QCAD having a one-time purchase perpetual license and having DXF/DWG support. LibreCAD seems to have a closer UI to AutoCAD LT? nanoCAD seems to mimic commands but it&#39;s subscription based. I k",
