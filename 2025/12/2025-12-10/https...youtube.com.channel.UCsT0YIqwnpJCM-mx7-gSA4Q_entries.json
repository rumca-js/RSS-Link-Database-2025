His talk examines when we should trust our senses, our sources, and the claims we encounter, and when we should withhold that trust. He invites the audience to think more carefully about how truth is formed and how we decide what to believe. Jim is an Assistant Professor at Nazarbayev University.  His work mostly centers around the values and norms connected with truth, and the history of 19th and 20th century philosophy.  He grew up in Dundas, Ontario.  He did his undergraduate degree in philosophy at Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of Toronto.  He finished his Ph.D in 2018 at the University of California, Berkeley, with a dissertation about Gottlob Frege.  He has held visiting positions at the University of Indiana, Bloomington, Simon Fraser University, and the University of Toronto Mississauga. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED",

And while healthy eating certainly can play a role in disease prevention, most people are unaware that plastic food packaging, processing equipment, kitchen utensils, and tableware leach hazardous chemicals into foodstuffs, contributing to chronic disease. In this TEDx talk, Jane Muncke explains the principle of chemical migration from plastic food contact materials and discusses the gaps in regulation that lead to harmful exposures to hazardous chemicals from everyday food packaging. A healthier option is the use of inert materials, such as glass and stainless steel. Dr. Jane Muncke is the Managing Director and Chief Scientific Officer of the Food Packaging Forum (FPF), a charitable foundation based in Zurich, Switzerland. She co-founded FPF in 2012 to share high-quality scientific information about health and environmental impacts",

He challenges the traditional, content-heavy model of education and proposes a shift toward learning that is lived, felt, and practiced. Dr. Paulo highlights how today\u2019s fast-paced, digital environment often disconnects students from genuine engagement. He argues that to truly understand, create, and grow, learners must reconnect with real-world interactions, emotional awareness, and active participation.

Across the world, we already know the science, yet we fail to act. South African artist Johan Thom shows how\u00a0the arts\u00a0can change what water, soil, and survival actually mean to us. Drawing on personal history, Darwin\u2019s ideas, and years of artistic experimentation, he reveals how beauty, choice, and imagination shape the\u00a0core\u00a0decisions that determine our collective future. While the sciences\u00a0may\u00a0diagnose the problem, the arts help us feel\u00a0and experience our changing\u00a0world in different ways, reminding us that meaning, not data, drives human action |  South African artist Johan Thom works across performance, video, and installation to probe the human condition in a c",
