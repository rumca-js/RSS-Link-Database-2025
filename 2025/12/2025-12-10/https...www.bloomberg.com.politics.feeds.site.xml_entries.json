Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. \n\nOn today's show, Federal Reserve officials are primed to deliver a third consecutive interest rate cut later today.\nKevin Hassett, who is seen as the frontrunner to replace Chair Jerome Powell, believes there's room for the central bank to cut more than 25 basis points. Bloomberg has learned that SpaceX is moving ahead with plans for an IPO next year.\n\nSources say it aims to raise significantly more than 30 billion dollars, with the company seeking a valuation of about 1.5 trillion dollars. It would be the biggest IPO in history. And in a world first, Australians under 16 are now barred from accessing social media services like TikTok, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nToday's guest: Carmen Palacios-Berraquero, Nu Quantum CEO (Source: Bloomberg)",
