In simple terms, AI hallucination is when a model produces information that sounds confident and well-structured, but is actually incorrect, fabricated, or impossible to verify. This includes things like made-up academic papers, fake book references, invented historical facts, or technical explanations that look right on the surface but fall apart under real checking. The real danger is not that it gets things wrong \u2014 it\u2019s that it often gets them wrong in a way that sounds extremely convincing.</p> <p>Most people assume hallucination is just a bug that engineers haven\u2019t fully fixed yet. In reality, it\u2019s a natural side effect of how large language models work at a fundamental level. These systems don\u2019t decide what is true. They predict what is most statistically likely to come next in a sequence of words. When the underlying information is missing",

But emotional attachment is not the threat. What actually puts people at risk is more subtle: the slow erosion of agency, the habit of letting a system think for you, the tendency to confuse fluent language with anthropomorphic personhood. This essay separates the real psychological hazards from the panic-driven ones. Millions of people are building these relationships whether critics approve or not, so we need to understand what harms are plausible and which fears are invented.

This is especially true in real-world areas where we seek to answer complex questions based on hypothetical evidence to determine actions for intervention. However, determining the graphical structure of a BN remains a major challenge, especially when modelling a problem under causal assumptions. Solutions to this problem include the automated discovery of BN graphs from data, constructing them based on expert knowledge, or a combination of the two. This paper provides a comprehensive review of combinatoric algorithms proposed for learning BN structure from data, describing 74 algorithms including prototypical, well-established and state",
