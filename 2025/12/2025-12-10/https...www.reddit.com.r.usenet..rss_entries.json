But since Im automating with prowlarr and e.g. NZBGeek anyways, the web search of a provider should be irrelevant for me right?</p> <p>Third: In my setup prowlarr is managing indexers and its working perfectly fine with torrents. I already started a testtrial at nzbgeek and added it to the provider, i searched something manually and it was Queued correctly, but NZBGet couldnt download yet, because i have no server added yet. Once i subscribe to a provider and add my server credentials in nzbget, everything should work, right?</p> <p>Thank yall a lot</p> </div",
