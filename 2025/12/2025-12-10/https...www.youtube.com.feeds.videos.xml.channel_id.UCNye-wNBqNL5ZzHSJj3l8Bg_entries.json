        "description": "Amjad Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs network, has said Gaza is unequipped to deal with the approaching storm as Israel continues to restrict the entry of humanitarian aid.\n\nShawa told Al Jazeera from Gaza City that only 40,000 tents out of a needed 300,000 were allowed in. Tools to repair the sewage system and the water networks were also restricted, raising concerns that the wastewater lagoon might be flooded.\n\nHe added that sewage and solid waste were at risk of contaminating drinking water as well as people\u2019s food supplies, raising the risk of diseases at a time when 2.2 million people are crammed into 43 percent of the Gaza Strip, while the remaining 57 percent lies beyond Israel\u2019s so-called yellow line.\n\n\u201cIf Israel were to allow the entrance of supplies, things would be different. But for now, it has done all it can to make life more complicated for Palestinians,\u201d Shawa said.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/",

Locals and tourists in Cairo continue to line up for an authentic taste. \nUNESCO approved the listing without objections, while Italian cuisine, including pizza and cannoli, also received similar recognition this year. \nEgyptian officials hope the accolade will encourage more visitors to explore the country\u2019s culinary traditions.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Rylee Carlson reports.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/a",

She is a Professor of Information Sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne.\nShe says under-16s are already signing up to social media platforms that are not included in the ban.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http:",
