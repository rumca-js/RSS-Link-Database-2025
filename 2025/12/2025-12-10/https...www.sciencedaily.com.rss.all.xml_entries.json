Long-term imaging and plasma data show that obese individuals experience much faster increases in proteins linked to neurodegeneration and amyloid buildup. Surprisingly, blood tests detected these changes earlier than PET scans. The results point to obesity as a major, modifiable contributor to Alzheimer\u2019s progression.",

While ammonia-oxidizing archaea were thought to dominate carbon fixation in the sunless depths, experiments show that other microbes\u2014especially heterotrophs\u2014are doing far more of the work than expected. This discovery reshapes our understanding of how carbon moves through the deep ocean and stabilizes Earth\u2019s climate.",
