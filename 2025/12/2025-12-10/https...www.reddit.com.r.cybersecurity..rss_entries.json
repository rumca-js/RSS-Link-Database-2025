What surprised me is that even a fresh Next.js app created with the default setup is impacted, so this is not one of those niche edge case bugs that only hits unusual configs. It affects a huge portion of modern React based stacks.</p> <p>What makes it more concerning is how quickly attackers started poking at it once the details became public. Wiz\u2019s breakdown shows how little effort it takes to weaponize and how many production apps were exposed without realizing it.

CBC-Pad handles plaintext of any length. The ciphertext is longer than the plaintext by at most the size of a single block. Padding is used to assure that the plaintext input is a multiple of the block length. It is assumed that the original plaintext is an integer number of bytes. This plaintext is padded at the end by from 1 to bb bytes, where bb equals the block size in bytes. The pad bytes are all the same and set to a byte that represents the number of bytes of padding. For example, if there are 8 bytes of padding, each byte has the bit pattern 00001000. Why not allow zero bytes of padding?
