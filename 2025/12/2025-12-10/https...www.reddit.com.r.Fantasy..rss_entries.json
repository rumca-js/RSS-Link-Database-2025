Feel free to scroll down to my ranking if that\u2019s all you care about bc I just feel like blabbering a bit first. Two of my top 3 IP ever are Naruto and Dragon Ball so given the heavy influence of them (and shonens overall) it\u2019s fitting that I\u2019m loving Cradle.</p> <p>Ofc I love the progression fantasy aspect of it, but something I\u2019ve realized I really enjoy is the overall tone of the story. It can get dark an violent to a degree but there\u2019s always a feeling of hope and joy for lack of a better word. Especially coming off of reading Stormlight and Red Rising which feel so dreary and sad sometimes it\u2019s really nice how Cradles manages to still have stakes and scary things happening while maintaining a nice vibe throughout.</p> <p>I\u2019ve read non-spoiler rankings of the books and my biggest surprise is that it seems that many don\u2019t like Skysworn very much. This is shocking to me as I enjoy it so much more than the first two ",

I&#39;ve never seen an author so good at the banter and plot while apart being so committed to long combat scenes.</p> <p>No spoilers ple",

However one of the books I read recently, An Ember in the Ashes, has reviews that it can be a bit brutal, though I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s by YA standards or not. It has me wondering whether I may be able to handle more violent depictions.</p> <p>I read The Cloud Roads and liked it and recently started Assassins Apprentice but it\u2019s a bit slow for me (I\u2019m sorry! I know it\u2019s a beloved story!). A lot of the recommendations I see on here for more fast paced stories like the Powder Mage series seem like they could be too graphic but I\u2019m not sure.</p> <p>So! I was wondering if anyone here has any recommendations for books or series that are medium to fast paced and aren\u2019t too gory?
