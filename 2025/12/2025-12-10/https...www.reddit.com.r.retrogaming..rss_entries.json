I remember a specific static cutscene where the Prince and Princess finally meet: \u2022 The scene was set in a forest (simple brown tree trunks and green grass). \u2022 The Princess was positioned on the left side of the screen. \u2022 The Prince was entering the scene from the right side of the screen. \u2022 I believe there were Apples on the ground near the Prince or Princess. This game is NOT Mixed-Up Fairy Tales, The Legend of Kyrandia, or any of the King&#39;s Quest titles. it is driving me crazy at this point and i have googled for hours and can\u2019t find anything! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sweet-Pressure9038\"> /u/Sweet-Pressure9038 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1pjff9t/help_me_find_this_game_pls/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre",

I gave him my old Xbox One since it was just gathering dust, and I had a bunch of games for it. Turns out, analog sticks and bumper/trigger buttons are just too much for him to process, never mind his inability to navigate the the Xbox Home screen.</p> <p>After further discussion, he really wanted one of the retro consoles from my childhood with a simplistic controller like the NES or SNES. Now, I really don&#39;t want to source or buy an original version of either console and each individual game.</p> <p>As retro gaming is really not something that interests me, I&#39;ve been hesitant ",
