        "description": "With over 3,000 units in service, the Stryker armored infantry carrier vehicle has become one of the most ubiquitous vehicles in the Army. Able to transport nine dismounted infantry soldiers along with the driver and vehicle commander, the Stryker features a variety of powerful weapons systems. Atop the Dragoon variant sits a 30 mm autocannon as well as a .50-caliber machine gun.\n\nWith a base unit price of $5 million, the Dragoon variant requires another $5 million upgrade for its high-tech weapons system.\n\nChief video correspondent Graham Flanagan embedded with the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment during a training exercise in southern Germany, where he got an in-depth tour of the vehicle from crew members and rode in the vehicle during a combat simulation where Strykers transported soldiers to the fight before firing on an enemy stronghold.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:44 Weapons\n01:47 The Crew\n03:06 History of the Stryker\n04:02 Convoy on the Autobahn\n05:43 Stryker Gets Stuck\n07:08 Stryker's F",
