        "description": "Blackbeard was the most feared pirate of the 18th century. From commanding the mighty Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge to blockading Charleston and terrorizing the seas, Edward Teach became a legend of fear. His terrifying image, complete with smoking fuses in his beard, struck dread into sailors, and how his reign ended in a bloody battle off Ocracoke Island in 1718. \n\n#Blackbeard #PirateHistory #HistoryShorts #YouTubeShorts #MysteryAtSea",
