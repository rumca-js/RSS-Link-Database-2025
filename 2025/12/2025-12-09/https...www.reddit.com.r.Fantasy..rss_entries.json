The heartbreaking story of a marriage between a mortal man and an elf princess is a masterful tapestry of the fairy tale following the &quot;happily ever after.&quot;</em></p> <p><strong>Review</strong></p> <p>I think this is the first classic of pre-Tolkien fantasy that I\u2019ve read, and I understand why it is considered a seminal work now! Dunsany writes about magic in a way that I would describe as truly, incredibly enchanting, numinous, and strange. His writing is full of gorgeous descriptions and charming, evocative details that bring you to the secret corners of the woods, the gloaming light, the fields of flowers, and all the other wonders of Elfland.</p> <p>I think it could be helpful for readers to know that this is the main mag",

The main viewpoints we see are those of a group of half-orcs. Orcs in this setting are a buncha seemingly non verbal peeps who come from a southern nation every once in awhile to well, loot, pillage, and noncon with human women. This had led to the creation of half-orcs. While barely tolerated, to one degree or another, by the Spanish based human kingdom, overall, I like their vibe. They&#39;re on the whole pretty decent folk, and also they&#39;re basically bikers who ride around on boars with crossbows. </p> <p>While some bits I feel were hit or miss across the trilogy, I honestly liked how it explored what it would mean to be a halfbreed in a society that distrusts them, and the half-orc culture is pretty cool.

I\u2019ve read or tried many of the ones that are commonly recommended on the sub, and was hoping to find some new ones to try based on what I\u2019ve liked and disliked so far. I hadn\u2019t touched urban fantasy in 5+years since I tried and dropped Dresden Files and Heartstrikers a couple of years ago, but dipped back into it last year with a few Rivers of London books. The real start of my recent binge was Drew Hayes finishing his Fred the Vampire Accountant series a month or so ago, upon which I blasted through the whole series from start to finish in four days. From there I went to An Inheritance of Magic and then Alex Verus, enjoying all 3 of those series (Fred, Inheritance of Magic, Alex Verus).</p> <p>What I want:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Urban fantasy</strong></li> <li><strong>Set on earth / primary world</strong> (I know there\u2019s a ton of great secondary w",
