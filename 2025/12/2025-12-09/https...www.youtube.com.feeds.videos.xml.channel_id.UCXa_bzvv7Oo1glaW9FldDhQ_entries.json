        "description": "After nearly 20 years since the last Prime game, a lot has happened in the world of game design, but Metroid Prime 4 Beyond barely seems to acknowledge that. Even that would have been okay with me, just more Metroid Prime would be great! I love Metroid Prime, I would gladly take more of it. \n\nBut it has to be good, and Prime 4 very often misses the mark, at least when it comes to things that matter most, such as the level design and traversal. My hope is that this game is what it is due to the unique circumstances of its development. \n\nHopefully, Retro will be allowed to put out a follow up, and hopefully, that follow up will be a lot less confused and conflicted, and a lot more cohesive with its overall vision and design. Until then, Prime 4 is what we have, the worst of the four mainline Prime games.",

        "description": "There are a lot of video game franchises coming back in the coming couple years. Rayman is reportedly on the horizon with a remake and new AAA entry, while Assassin\u2019s Creed, Ghost Recon, and The Division are nearing an announcement. But there are two projects that remain elusive, perhaps for the wrong reasons. \n\nBut a remake of the first Splinter Cell feels more promising. Not only does the remake have its original director back on the project, it also has a rumored release date within the next two years. Though what we know is mostly speculative and limited to small breadcrumbs, the little we\u2019ve heard so far should still be encouraging for fans of the series. Still, why is the Splinter Cell Remake taking so long?",
