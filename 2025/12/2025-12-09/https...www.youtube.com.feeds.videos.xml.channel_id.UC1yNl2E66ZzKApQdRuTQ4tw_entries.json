Stay fully informed on events around the world with Ground News.\n\nIn quantum physics, a wave function is a mathematical way to describe everything in the universe. But since quantum physics emerged, physicists have argued about whether or not the wave function is real. A group of physicists recently conducted a test of a theorem that describes the mechanics of the wave function, and they\u2019ve told the press that they\u2019ve settled the question: Yes, the wave-function is real. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11213\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/ne",
