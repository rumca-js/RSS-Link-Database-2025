Synology has a built in torrent client called \u2018download station\u2019; I\u2019ve set it up to automatically load torrents from a specific folder. That folder is mapped in my Windows pc, so when I search for torrents on my pc I save them in that folder and the Nas starts downloading them.<br/> I then use Infuse on the Apple TV to play the files.<br/> Is there anything that I am missing or I could do better?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/More-Crew4331\"> /u/More-Crew4331 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1pikgp7/best_setup_with_apple_tv/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1pikgp7/best_setup_with_apple_tv/\">[comments]</a></span>",
