I&#39;ve read biographies of Washington, Adams, and Jefferson by Joseph Ellis; I&#39;ve read Man of Iron for Grover Cleveland, and No Ordinary Time for FDR. That one was just on WW2, though, so I may look for something else. I intend for next year&#39;s set to be all new-to-me presidents. I anticipate finding anything for modern presidents will be more difficult since they&#39;re still living and not enough water has run under the bridge for a &#39;definitive&#39; biography to arrive like LBJ&#39;s &quot;power&quot; trilogy. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/peaveyftw\"> /u/peaveyftw </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/",

Considering the difficulties I faced when reading &quot;The Lady with the Dog&quot;, I&#39;d say this story was a breeze. And not for the writing, which doesn&#39;t seem to be easier in any way, but perhaps because the setting is simpler to follow. The crux of the story too, is relatable enough, that even modern day stand-ups exist on this topic.</p> <p>The theme of the story is timeless, infinite, and captures the very nature of life - it&#39;s duality. From the title you may guess that it is a story about chameleon-like behavior of a person with questionable morals. The story excellently captures the ordinary, making it a classic and setting it apart. You might as well be reminded of an\u200b occurrence just earlier this week or month in your life, while reading about this two-toned opportunist and the makeshift conference formed of people crowding about a sudden activity.</p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-tex",

Are you able to visualize, in your mind&#39;s eye, the setting the author describes? <strong>If you do not picture anything</strong>, how does that affect your reading, if at all? </p></li> <li><p>Are you able to read aloud <em>and</em> comprehend the sentences? Especially if you were handed a text you weren&#39;t very familiar with at all?

I can get almost vague shapes sometimes. But in general, I&#39;m not &quot;seeing&quot; anything when I&#39;m reading.
