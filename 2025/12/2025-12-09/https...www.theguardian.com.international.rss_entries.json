Most footballers would simply have walked on by but the 6ft 6in Newcastle forward is a little different from the rest and he duly stopped and tucked them all back into position beneath a long desk.</p><p>Out on the pitch Woltemade\u2019s highly-technical approach is nothing if not similarly neat and he has returned to his home country on a Champions League mission. Namely to show his compatriots that Eddie Howe has imbued his game with a dangerous new dimension. While the adhesive touches, deft flicks and clever link play that have always distinguished Woltemade\u2019s performances remain, the Newcastle manager\u2019s \u201cphysics\u201d have enhanced the mix.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/09/nick-woltemad",

League commissioner Don Garber made the announcement on Tuesday, capping a season in which Messi scored 29 goals with 19 assists in 28 appearances, one short of Carlos Vela\u2019s record for goal contributions in a single season (though Vela\u2019s was done in 31 games).</p><p>Messi joins Kansas City Wizards legend Preki as the only players to win the MVP award twice, with Messi being the first to win two such awards consecutively.

First released in the US in 2015, it\u2019s an ultra-low-budget debut from first-time director Charles Poekel, set almost entirely on a 24-hour pop-up Christmas tree stall. Poekel\u2019s style is far too authentic-indie and unaffected to get slushy or sentimental about Christmas; through his lens Christmas tree lights blink like police lights. But in its own low-key way, he pitches his film just right for a little squeeze of festive warmth.</p><p>Kentucker Audley stars as Noel (it took someone in the film to joke about his name before I twigged).

Then he insisted he was clean. You hear such oaths and affirmations all the time. But, uniquely, Sawe recently backed up those words by asking the Athletics Integrity Unit to test him as much as possible.</p><p>You see, Sawe believed he could break the world record in Berlin in September. And he also understood that Kenya\u2019s abysmal doping record meant that success would be met with more raised eyebrows than a plastic surgeon\u2019s clinic in Hollywood. So the call went into the AIU. Test me. Repeatedly. Throw everything at it. My sponsors, Adidas, will pick up the bill.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/09/sebastian-sawe-marathon-runner-on-mission-drug-tested-as-much-as-possible\">Con",

Jaspert, who was in his late 30s, had recently been appointed governor by Queen Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of the Foreign Office in London. The BVI is an overseas territory of Britain, with only partial independence, and the governor effectively acts as a backstop to the locally elected legislature. For Jaspert, a career civil servant, it would be his first hands-on experience of governing \u2013 and his first time in the British Virgin Islands. Any trepidation was outweighed by the prospect of moving to the Caribbean. \u201cIf you\u2019re sitting in an office in London and someone says, \u2018Go to Tortola,\u2019 you look it up on a screen and think, \u2018OK, I can do that,\u2019\u201d Jaspert told me.<",
