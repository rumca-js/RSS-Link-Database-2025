What can we do to reduce this barrier to entry? In this talk we'll discuss the design of a refactoring paradigm that makes C++ refactoring tooling accessible to the general C++ developer. Rather than needing to learn bespoke APIs, or gain familiarity with the idiosyncrasies of Clang's AST, developers can simply write examples of the code patterns they wish to detect and the replacements they wish to generate in everyday C++. This enables a background task to generate, test and apply refactorings, freeing developers to work on more complex and business-critical tasks. \n \n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2025/blob/main/Presentations/https://brontosource.dev/presentations/2025/cppcon/declarative-refactoring-for-the-masses/\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: h",
