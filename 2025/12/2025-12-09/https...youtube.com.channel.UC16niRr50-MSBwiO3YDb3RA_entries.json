He also criticised European leaders, calling them weak and saying they were not handling the war well.   \n\nTrump called on Ukraine to hold presidential elections, suggesting that without them its government was not democratic. Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky suggested he was considering changing the  constitution to allow an election to take place while the country is under martial law. \n\nIn Moscow, the Russian President Vladimir Putin has been awarding medals to soldiers who\u2019ve been fighting in Ukraine. \n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sarah Smith in Washington, Jonathan Beale in Kyiv and Steve Rosenberg in Moscow. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBC",
