        "description": "Official California Schemin' Movie Teaser Trailer 2026 | More \u27a4 https://KinoCheck.com/App | James McAvoy Movie Trailer | Cinema UK: 10 Apr 2026 | Details \u27a4 https://KinoCheck.com/movie/51v/california-schemin-2025?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=description\nIn the late '90s, Gavin Bain and Billy Boyd had their musical ambitions consistently ridiculed for having the 'wrong' accents, so they went for broke and reinvented themselves as Californian rappers. The duo re-recorded their own tracks with fake accents and turned up in London claiming to be an established duo on the Cali scene as well as childhood friends with Eminem. They quickly bagged themselves a record deal, a hefty sum in advances, and an appearance on MTV... until it all came crashing down.\n\nCalifornia Schemin' (2026) is the new comedy movie by James McAvoy, starring James McAvoy, S\u00e9amus McLean Ross and Samuel Bottomley.\n\nNote | #CaliforniaSchemin #Teaser Trailer courtesy of StudioCanal. | All Rights Reserved. #KinoCheck\u00ae",
