        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Agent systems change shape as you adjust tools, add reasoning steps, or rewrite planners. One challenge I ran into is that the JSON output shifts while the evaluation script expects a fixed structure. A small structural drift in the output can make an entire evaluation run unusable. For example A field that used to contain the answer moves into a different object A list becomes a single value A nested block appears only for one sample Even when the reasoning is correct, the scoring script cannot interpret it Adding a strict structure and schema check before scoring helped us separate structural failures from semantic failures. It also gave us clearer insight into how often the agent breaks format during tool use or multi step reasoning. I am curious how others in this community handle evaluation for agent systems that evolve week to week. Do you rely on strict schemas? Do you allow soft validation? Do you track structural drift separately from quality",
