        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Basically, my Reddit suddenly started working really badly out of nowhere (it\u2019s not the first time this happens) and I have a good PC and internet connection. I tried looking for the cause and I realized in the console that I was getting hundreds of failed requests and counting. When I checked which file those failed requests were coming from, I noticed they were coming from a Chrome extension called \u201cJam,\u201d which is a website/service used for screen recordings. </p> <p>In this Jam file I found some lines that mentioned something about \u201ccryptos,\u201d but Jam has absolutely nothing to do with crypto\u2026 Do you think it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re using users\u2019 browsers to mine without their consent? I\u2019m attaching a picture of the line in question. I deleted the extension before thinking about making a post, so I\u2019m going to reinstall it to copy the code in case someone wants to take a look at the full script.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/vhmhcgxs386g1.png",
