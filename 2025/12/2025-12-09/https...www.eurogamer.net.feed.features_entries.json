It is, admittedly, a bit of a weird one to get to grips with at first: an online multiplayer Soulslike with players racing around a map as preset characters preparing to defeat Nightlord bosses in grand, operatic fashion. But now, players have learned the map, the character movesets, they've collected powerful Relics to buff abilities, and are familiar with the weakness of each boss. Coordination with others is less of an immediate issue than it was, so even playing with random players is no longer a chore.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hallows-dlc-review\">Read more</a></p>",

This seems to be the best tactic for quietly silencing a problem that could potentially see you and then stab you in <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow\">Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow</a> but, like all good sandbox games, it&rsquo;s by far your only option.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow-now-playing\">Read more</a></p>",
