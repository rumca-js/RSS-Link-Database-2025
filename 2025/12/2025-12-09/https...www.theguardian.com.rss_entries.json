Their identity of always taking the aggressive option, of relentlessly putting pressure on their opponents, isn\u2019t holding up to scrutiny. So far in this series they haven\u2019t had the strength needed to achieve it, and they haven\u2019t had the skills either.</p><p>I was confident that they could win the Ashes this time, mainly because I thought there was quality in the squad and that they had adapted their game to add intelligence and adaptability to their armoury. It\u2019s becoming clear that neither of those beliefs were completely true. And meanwhile I\u2019m seeing things at home that make me worry that this team aren\u2019t just messing up this series, they\u2019re messing up a whole generation of young cricketers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.c",
