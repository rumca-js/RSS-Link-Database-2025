Following the less-than-stellar response to Black Ops 7, the franchise will no longer get back-to-back entries in the same sub-series. This applies not only to Black Ops, but also to Modern Warfare.</p><p>\"We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games,\" Activision said in the <a href=\"https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team\">official announcement</a>. \"The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.\"</p><p>Alongside this announcement, Activision promised \"meaningful, not incremental\" innovation for the series' future. It didn't specify exactly what this would mean, instead stressing it would share more \"when the time is right.\"</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-",

Below, we examine how it carried the torch of the classic films to create the best new piece of Indy fiction in decades.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Indiana Jones is one of the most revered blockbuster stories of the 1980s. Spielberg and Lucas' work on the original trilogy stands alongside Jaws and Star Wars as timeless classics that are worth revisiting regularly. The more recent entries--the Crystal Skull and the Dial of Destiny--do little to live up to the standard that the first three set. But the game Indiana Jones and The Great Circle brings everything about that original trilogy back, like a careful archaeological dig. It's the true successor to one of the original blockbuster trilogies.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As we hit The Great Circle's first anniversary, it is clearer than ever that MachineGames accomplished something the film series has struggled to for the last 20 years.
