They&#39;d just ask the support team directly instead.</p> <p>So I built a simple tool to solve it: take their existing FAQ and turn it into an interactive chat. Now customers ask questions in a conversational way, get instant answers 24/7, and the support team focuses on harder issues.</p> <p>**What it does:**</p> <p>- Copy and paste your FAQ</p> <p>- It becomes an interactive chat your customers can use</p> <p>- Answers questions based only on your FAQ content</p> <p>- Works 24/7, no live agent needed</p> <p>**Why this matters:**</p> <p>- Many companies already have FAQ content - it just doesn&#39;t get used</p> <p>- Customers prefer asking",

It\u2019s basically a drop-in replacement for CAPTCHA, but instead of you paying me I PAY YOU.</p> <p>Yea yea I know I made the worlds first negative-margin CAPTCHA.</p> <p>It started as a data-collection experiment but a couple people I showed it to said it might actually help small sites make a bit of extra cash. Integration is literally just dropping in a line of code where your CAPTCHA normally goes.</p> <p>If you want to try it out: <a href=\"http://capycap.ai\">capycap.ai</a></p> <p><strong>For website owners</strong>, this is basically a passive side income source:</p> <p>Add one line of code (integration takes ~30 seconds)</p> <p>Works anywhere you\u2019re using reCAPTCHA/hCaptcha today</p> <p>You get paid per successful completion</p> <p>If you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m paying my friends are researching human-generated data and could use the extra samples, so I figured I\u2019d build something cleaner",

Stuff like grooming tools, cleaning gadgets, and random \u201cproblem-solver\u201d items. Honestly, it\u2019s hit or miss, but when it hits, it actually works pretty well for the price.</p> <p>The biggest upside is convenience. Their products are usually simple, no learning curve, and do exactly one specific job. Some items feel surprisingly solid, while others definitely feel more \u201cas-seen-on-TV\u201d quality. Shipping has been fine for me, though it\u2019s slower than Amazon. Customer service is decent, but returns can be annoying depending on the product.</p> <p>Overall, BulbHead is more about impulse convenience than premium quality. You\u2019re not getting top-tier materials, but for quick fixes, gifts, or niche problems, it can be worth it if you manage expectations.</p> <p>You can use the link below to get a 20% off discount as well.

I made the service as easy to use as possible - you upload your photo, select the document you plan to make, and receive a passport-size photo with complete confidentiality - nothing is uploaded.</p> <p>I created this side project so that people don&#39;t have to think about the requirements and search for the right photo size. <",
