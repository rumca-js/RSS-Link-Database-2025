This is not a Strandbeest - it has four independent legs which can move to different heights, and a sliding section so it can take steps.  There will be more development in the future including compliant feet, and the missing sliding section designed to keep my mass over the feet on the ground.\n\nYou can support me on Patreon, join my Discord, or buy my Merchandise:\n***************************\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/fc6MedG7eW\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/xrobots\nMerch Store: https://james-bruton.teemill.com/collection/all-products/\n***************************\n\nOther socials:\n***************************\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/xrobotsuk\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/xrobotsuk \nFacebook: https://ww",
