I&#39;ve been trying out a bunch of different tools for AI and getting stuff done, but one in particular really stands out. It\u2019s been incredibly helpful in streamlining my workflow. I used to juggle so many different apps, but this one seems to integrate a lot of what I need. It&#39;s made my daily tasks feel much more manageable. I&#39;ve noticed a significant boost in my productivity since I started using it. If you&#39;re looking for something similar, I&#39;d definitely recommend checking it out.

For example let&#39;s start with Grok.</p> <p>It is less restricted and can talk about anything and even can be toxic. Probably it can say something like &quot;you should consider salads, fat fuck&quot;. So, I think it can be really honest with you. And here is the disadvantage. From my experience, Grok has a weak image recognition tool. I don&#39;t know how it works, but Grok kinda sees only some details sometimes, or hallucinates.</p> <p>At the same time, ChatGPT has a situation that is exactly the opposite. He understands all the images well, down to the details, but he has limitations.
