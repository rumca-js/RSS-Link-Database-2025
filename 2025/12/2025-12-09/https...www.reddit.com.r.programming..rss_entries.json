        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted my text editor to be able to load - and edit - huge files (&gt;&gt;1GB) instantly. It started from an idea to support editing files hosted on slow media like S3 which is a similar but different problem (RAM is not the issue unless also those files are huge). </p> <p>I went back to the source code of Microsoft Word 1.1 (1990) to learn a bit more on how this was used back in the days when RAM was so scarce that the program itself consumed significant amounts of your entire system&#39;s RAM (programs employed hot swapping of its own modules in those days!) Also discovered that one of the people who came up with the piece table - J Strother Moore - previously worked on the Apollo guidance computer.<br/> The blog includes links to some historically interesting resources and explains how the piece tree helps for laziness as well as failure recovery, diffing large buffers, etc. </p> <p><a href=\"https://noamlewis.com/blog/2025/12/09/how-fresh-loads-h",
