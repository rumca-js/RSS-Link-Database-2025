It will then turn on your server once AC is restored.</p> <p>The community response was awesome, and after some suggestions I have now implemented an IP check, which will trigger the emergency shutdown if a ping to your chosen IP fails. This IP can be whatever you want, from your router&#39;s local IP to Cloudflare&#39;s IP or a friend&#39;s IP, whatever you want!</p> <p>Hope you enjoy this update and please let me know if it can be improved in any way :D</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/pablogila/WakeMyPotato\">https://github.com/pablogila/WakeMyPotato</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pgilah\"> /u/pgilah </a> <br/> <span><a hr",

I am looking at doing this with Caddy serving as the reverse proxy internally, tailscale allowing someone to connect to caddy, and a public domain being used with an A record pointing to the tailscale DNS. </p> <p>If i understand this correctly and have not missed anything, only someone whom is authorized through tailscale would get past the public domain.

HandBrake Web hopes to solve this by providing a native, modern, and responsive web interface for you to interact with HandBrake via your favorite web browser.
