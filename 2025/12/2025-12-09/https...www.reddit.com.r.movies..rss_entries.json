She&#39;s confident, strong, such a stealth personality that being a woman isn&#39;t a problem, the guys respect her and play around with her as she is able to show she&#39;s better than any guy around. And she never shows fear or vulnerability, she&#39;s always shooting them guns and taking the risks. To the end, she&#39;s a hero. I love that character, probably more so than Ripley whom Vasquez teasingly calls Snow White.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LaserDiscCurious\"> /u/LaserDiscCurious </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1pimsca/jenette_goldsteins_vasquez_from_aliens_the_most/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",
