        "description": "Welcome to the Depths of Perdition, where the sci-fi bunker is fully stocked with scatter terrain\u2026 and is somehow giving The Office.\n\nWe\u2019ve recreated the Annex, the Warehouse/Break Room, and the Conference Room\u2014basically every place you\u2019d hide during a mandatory team-building exercise or desperately flee from during a totally legitimate fire drill.\n\nMatthew, Dave, Josh, Skari, and Luka make cameo appearances in miniature form, posing atop crates, bunks, and other modular pieces while fighting Mini Wargs aiming at them.\n\nAnd yes, this whole short is set to The Office theme\u2014because even in a grim sci-fi bunker, the real threat is still an unexpected meeting invite.\n\nFind out more about this amazing scatter terrain at MiniWarGaming.com/perdition",
