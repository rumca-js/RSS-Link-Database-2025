I&#39;ve been in a Star Wars mood lately, been thinking of rewatching the clone wars animated show again because it has my favorite character in all of Star Wars, Ahsoka Tano, really hoping for a season two of the live action show. Anyway, at 33 years old I&#39;m going to see how Jedi Knight one holds up.

Mostly NES, some SMS. Lots of old favorites of course but this time I decided I would focus on games I had never played back in the day. Found a lot of junk, few good ones and one or two great ones. I decided it was time to &quot;move on&quot; to the 16 bit era soon and had my randomizer pick a random game for me- one last one before I moved on. </p> <p>And it spits out Journey to Silius.

I don&#39;t really remember the name of this game and I&#39;ve been searching for months because of nostalgia. It&#39;s an old game that was on the early versions of Windows, maybe XP or Vista. It had a top view, it was really pixelated, no 3D and all I remember is that I needed to conquer a map. I could create buildings with troops and the thing that really marked myself a lot was that I could summon dragons after a really long time. I thought at first it was Warcraft 1 or Command &amp; Conquer but none of those games really have the capacity to summon dragons with some kinda of portal. If it&#39;s some kind of multiplayer game I would not have played against anyone because I was too young, so I would always play the campaign. The UI looks like the Command &amp; Conquer&#39;s but that&#39;s all I found so far.</p> <p>If anyone have anything that could really help me in my searc",

Top-down shooter on an island full of mutated insects \u2014 you either control a vehicle that auto-shoots while you drive, or the vehicle auto-drives while you do the shooting. Random <strong>\u201cantidote\u201d</strong> pickups appear; if you collect enough an airstrike happens and a <strong><em>huge slipper</em></strong> squashes the island (I remember this bizarre ending). If you don\u2019t get enough antidote one of the main characters becomes infected and their head turns insect-like. I think it was a .jar Java game. No luck so far in archives \u2014 any ideas? Screenshots, filenames, or alternate titles would be amazing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Reserve7\"> /u/Competitive_Reserve7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments",
