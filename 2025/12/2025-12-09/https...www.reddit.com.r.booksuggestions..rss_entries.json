I recently read House on the Cerulean Sea (TJ Klune) and even though the major plotpline was not about romance, I still liked they way they portrayed love.

It could be fantasy, sci-fi, etc. All I want is a book where the protagonist navigates the world and situations alone. I recently started reading &quot;The Wheel of Time,&quot; and the characters are pursued, which I really enjoyed. But something that would be really good for me is the idea of \u200b\u200bjust one character going through what the main group went through. It doesn&#39;t have to be that specific setting either. I just want a protagonist who deals with all the problems alone. For some reason, that&#39;s extremely interesting to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Global_Rhubarb6943\"> /u/Global_Rhubarb6943 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pi8eee/solo_journey/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pi8eee/solo_journey/\">[com",

I am very very afraid of watching the days slip past just to realize a year has passed. I feel like the past 7 years went by that way. </p> <p>Whenever I get into something, I like Immersing myself in all media related to that thing, like novels, fan fictions, movies &amp; yt skits. I do tend to hyperfixate on my hobbies a bit. But consuming media relating to whatever I&#39;m undertaking really helps me get into the zone &amp; stick with it. </p> <p>I was wondering if you could give me suggestions for books that inspire you. I don&#39;t care about the genre. It just has to have someone consciously or unconsciously making small &amp; big changes in their life to become who they want to be or accomplish a goal.

I&#39;m agnostic but I find that kind of take extremely reductive. </p> <p>The closest thing I&#39;ve read is Dominion by Tom Holland.
