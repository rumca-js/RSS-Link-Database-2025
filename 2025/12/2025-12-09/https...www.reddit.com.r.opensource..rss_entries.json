There are actually many more pains than those, but those were enough to get me started on this idea.</p> <p>It supports bi-directional conversion of JSONs, if you need it. It automatically detects types but also accepts generics. It can aggregate files from within the file syntax, supports fetching, deep cloning, freezing and I recently added a $find method to help traverse very complex files. </p> <p>I made (co-made, with AI, of course) a website that explains it all (and links to the repo) -- <a href=\"https://www.slimgym.dev\">https://www.slimgym.dev</a></p> <p>I would love to know what you guys think.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
