This company never did any SEO before, so I\u2019m building everything from zero.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the part that confuses me. GSC shows improvement after the revamp. Impressions and clicks are going up, and my blogs are actually generating traffic based on GSC data. But Semrush shows none of this. In my past projects, GSC and Semrush always moved in the same direction. If GSC went up, Semrush usually reflected that growth. Pretty consistent.</p> <p>But now, Semrush still shows no US traffic at all. Zero. Not even the blog traffic shows up. Like nothing has happened in the last few months.</p> <p>So I\u2019m wondering if this is a website issue. Is Semrush just slow to pick things up because of",
