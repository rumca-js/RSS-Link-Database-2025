So I reset the device to factory settings and repeated the setup without connecting to Wi-Fi.</p> <p>After completing the setup, I turned on Wi-Fi \u2014 and the phone, without any prompts or confirmation from me, started downloading bloatware totaling 1.89 GB. There are no obvious options to cancel or stop these installations.</p> <p>The responsible app is &quot;Recommended Apps&quot;, which cannot be stopped or disabled. It also has permission to install unknown apps, and this permission cannot be revoked",
