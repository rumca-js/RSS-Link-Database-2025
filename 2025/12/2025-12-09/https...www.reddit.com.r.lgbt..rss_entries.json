Since I am in a less supportive state, we have fewer protections, and my school does not have many rules regarding homophobic speech. I have tried to state disapproval in hopes that some might notice the hatefulness, but so far, unless I explicitly tell someone I&#39;m homosexual, they&#39;ll just say I&#39;m gay (in a negative way).
