Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced appeared on the PEGI ratings website, but has since been pulled, lending credence to the title's legitimacy. Ubisoft has yet to confirm its existence, but a previous financial results presentation teased an unannounced game for March 31, 2026. In other gaming leaks news, the PlayStation store may have revealed a major franchise character returning to Resident Evil. Art for Resident Evil Requiem features Leon S. Kennedy prominently along with new character Grace Ashcroft. Kennedy has not been featured in a mainline Resident Evil game since Resident Evil 6 back in 2012. Expect a proper reveal at The Game Awards later this week. And finally, take a peek into a four-park family vacation at Universal Orlando Resort.\n\nPresented by Universal Orlando Resort.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #AssassinsCreed",

But the music, the humor, the characters are all so strong that it compelled me to stick with it. Most of all, I loved the way Rhythm Doctor embraced being a game and using that to tell its story in a way no other medium could. These songs aren\u2019t just something you play along with; you feel them. You experience them and the emotions they convey because of how they\u2019re presented. It\u2019s a remarkable achievement. And all it takes is one button.",

        "description": "Skate Story reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Switch 2. \n\n\"Learning to skate can be hell, and Skate Story proves this by taking us to what\u2019s probably the weirdest vision of the underworld you\u2019ll see without a belly full of Guatemalan Insanity Peppers. Fusing a solid foundation of satisfyingly grounded skate tricks with a bizarre, abstract world bathed in neon and starlight, Skate Story is a wild trip. I question its replayability and the limited nature of some of its objectives (and I did lose focus occasionally while tapping through its regular text-based conversations) but there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s one of the most distinctive skateboarding games of the decade.\"",
