One time i downloaded it with an adblocker active on SteamRIP. Malwarebytes, ESET, Windows defender, didn&#39;t find any viruses inside the zip file once installed. When i started the game, online-fix64.dll crashed it, saying theres missing libraries. For safety i open task manager and i see my CPU and GPU at 100% then it goes down after 1 seconds to idle. This didn&#39;t happened before and that day i&#39;ve discovered that i&#39;ve got a crypto miner so i re-installed back windows. There&#39;s probably a chance that the mirror link in the SteamRIP page got hacked and someone put a virus inside of it but i doubt it entirely if that is the case. I know steamRIP is safe but i really dont want to get a virus again, if you know anything that could help me, Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

It&#39;s only until recently that I decided to update it all. I managed to fix my cc and mods and most of my DLCs but one, Lovestruck. I can&#39;t open my other load games unless I click play without the required dlc. I tried clearing the cache, uninstalling and reinstalling the DLC, I tried everything that google told me to and yet still nothing. Though I don&#39;t use the DLC gameplay that much, most of my recent builds before going hiatus had lovestruck items in it and I don&#39;t want to lose it.
