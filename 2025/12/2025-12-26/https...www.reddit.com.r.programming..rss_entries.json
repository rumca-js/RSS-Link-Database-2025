For the teacher they can create a Classroom and it will give the teacher the class code that they can give to thier students so they can join. I also added where a teacher can post a lesson and attach a link to it. they can also track thier students grades like who&#39;s exceling and who got low grade so the teacher can help that student. the teacher can also export thier student grade in csv type file or in excel. you can try the app now by going to this website and test my application.

Luckily, I probably have the only solution for this battle right now.</p> <p>Normal adblockers on YouTube work by filtering the main player using a filter list, but this is really unreliable and constantly detected.

Then, sync the main player with the embedded player to ensure that watch history works correctly, and inject all the missing features that the native player includes and the embedded player normally doesn\u2019t have.</p> <p>This can be done as the iframes are same-origin.

And now I want to try (find out data, MLops e.t.c) or are there ready models?</li> <li>Will LLMs mess up and provide syntax from other SQL frameworks? (Things in PgSQL will not be the same in MySQL; is this case also covered nowadays in GPT, Gemini?) And I am interested in benchmarks.</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Weak_Technology3454\"> /u/Weak_Technology3454 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MLQuestions/comments/1pvwbly/are_there_ai_models_finetuned_for_sql/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1pvwf1u/are_there_ai_models_finetuned_for_sql/\">[comments]</a></span>",
