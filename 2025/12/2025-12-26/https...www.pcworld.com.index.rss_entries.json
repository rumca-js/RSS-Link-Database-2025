Thanks to them, once ponderous boot times now border on instantaneous, programs and games are far more responsive, and the frustratingly long waits to load large files are largely a thing of a past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\u2026 if you\u2019re not yet using an SSD, what are you waiting for? If you already have an older SSD, you might consider upgrading it for the even headier performance offered by cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 designs. If your PC sports those technologies, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, a premium drive may not deliver any more real-world performance than a bargain drive. Mainstream software, including Windows Explorer has yet to implement the numerous performance tricks, such as multiple queues, that NVMe SSDs offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"ppl_wrap\"><div cl",

Nowadays? I\u2019m far worse at identifying them. And thanks to the fine folks over at NPR, I have the quiz results to prove it. (Oof.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short, four-question test asks you <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/30/nx-s1-5610951/fake-ai-videos-slop-quiz\">to identify AI versus human-made video</a>. The scenarios vary between serious, unexpected, and cute. All the kinds of entertaining or surprising clips that spread fast in group chats and social media. I expected to get at least one wrong, given the improvements in AI-generated video. I failed more times than that. (But thankfully not at all four.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not convinced most people will do better.
