Your friends don&#39;t want to clone a repo. Hacker News doesn&#39;t care about your weird 3D flight simulator unless you&#39;re already famous.</p> <p>So I built a place where code-based creations are the content.</p> <p>On Vibecodr, you publish a &quot;vibe&quot; - an interactive app that runs directly in the browser. People discover it in a feed, run it instantly, and can remix (fork) it into their own version in an IDE studio environment. Think SoundCloud, but the tracks are runnable code.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the flight sim that inspired the platform if you just want to play instead of reading about the project: <a href=\"https://vibecodr.space/player/04ef1473-b0da-4c79-a34f-3ea40",
