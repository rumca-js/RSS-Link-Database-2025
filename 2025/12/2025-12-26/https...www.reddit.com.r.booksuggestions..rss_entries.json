I was never much of a reader growing up, could barely find any interest in the books my school would make me read, so do bear with me and my lack of knowledge.</p> <p>I&#39;m quite into fantasy-related media, specifically ones that have a focus or a subplot to romance. My favourite piece of media is Berserk, and I thoroughly enjoyed Game of Thrones, Kingdom Come Deliverance and The Witcher game series. Before anyone suggest *reading* Game of Thrones or The Witcher, I&#39;m not much of a fan of re-visit a piece of media in a different form, nevermind re-watching it (will be reading GoT ending though, if you know what I mean). Same rule applies to Berserk, as I&#39;ve read the manga entirely and don&#39;t plan on watching the animated movies/series.</p> <p>Anyway, if you couldn&#39;t tell, I&#39;m very much into kingdom-like, dark fantasy themes.

But this genre is flooded with women fiction which I did love early on. After reading some fantasy , some contemporary and some historical, I went to search for some books where I don&#39;t need to only learn how to satisfy my partner. But, there also I found very little of romance(few exceptions) except every damm hot women throwing themselves at the guy with infinite sex drive aka harem books . The other types have romance in name only aka action/fantasy magic shows. They are great but not for romance. Then I found chinese translated cultivations books. They are great but still not for good romance.. SO I came back wagging my tail to women fiction romance again. I am normal joe. I can accept few open door romance books with 7/8/9 inch books. But when every single closed door romance have rods instead of a penis, it gets annoying.</p> <p>So , I woul",
