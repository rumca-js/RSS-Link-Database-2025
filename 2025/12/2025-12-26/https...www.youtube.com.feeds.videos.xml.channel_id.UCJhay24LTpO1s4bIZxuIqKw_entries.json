In this ACCU 2025 lightning talk, Lucian Radu Teodorescu challenges our assumptions around software performance and code optimization. Through humor, thought experiments, and algorithmic insight, he explores why we obsess over performance in programming\u2014and what happens when we pretend it doesn't matter.\n\nDo you reach for quicksort because it's faster? Would you ever seriously consider bubble sort or even \u201cbogus sort\u201d? What if performance truly wasn\u2019t a concern\u2014what kind of systems would we build? Lucian dives into these questions with a satirical yet thought-provoking lens, proposing a universal algorithm that guarantees correctness\u2026 given infinite time and zero performance constraints.\n\nThe talk touches on core concepts like algorithm performance, computational complexity, bac",
