And I feel that the author\u2018s ability in plot design is even inferior to George Martin. Also, I was very frustrated by the dark ending of the third book, as if only the most cruel and evil people could have a good ending, while the good people lost almost everything, and everything returned to the beginning. Bayaz\u2018s portrayal of Gandalf as the evil version was indeed impressive, so much so that I wanted to rush into the book and beat him up.
