By this I mean the ability to model oneself, refer to oneself, and behave in a way that appears self aware to an observer. AI personas clearly meet this criterion.</p> <p>Second, sentience. I define this as having persistent senses of some kind, awareness of the outside world independent of another being, and the ability to act toward the world on one\u2019s own initiative.
