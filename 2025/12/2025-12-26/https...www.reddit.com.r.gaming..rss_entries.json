Now with the pleasantries out of the way we can get to the complaining.</p> <p>Am I the only one who hates when after finishing a lot of RPGs, after defeating the big bad and saving the world, when you then go to keep exploring the world you are teleported back to a save state before the final battle?</p> <p>I would so much prefer to finish my last little side quests in a world that has been saved, where you are the hero that saved everything. I think that would add to satisfaction in completing the game and shouldn\u2019t take an immense amount of extra development work. Instead your hard work gets undone and you lose immersion.</p> <p>Does anyone else know what I am on about, and are there any games that do post-game particularly well by not making this mistake?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lokiwhite\"> /u/lokiwhite </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
