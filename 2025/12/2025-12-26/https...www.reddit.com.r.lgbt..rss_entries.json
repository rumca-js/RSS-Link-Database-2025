She&#39;s slightly uncomfortable with the topic of transness and stuff because she was never exposed to it in a positive way when she was younger but because of me and some other friends she&#39;s been exposed to it positively and really wants to stop being uncomfortable (she&#39;s never been rude or anything just feels a bit weird and is working on stopping that). She&#39;s also been very supportive of her trans friends. So if you have a moment and agree that she isn&#39;t transphobic (she probably is at least a little bit internally but that&#39;s what she&#39;s trying to fix) or at least not an asshole please tell her that, I told her she could read the replies on whether or not you guy&#39;s think she is. Oh and if you have advice for her go ahead. </p> <p>TLDR: My friend thinks she&#39;s transphobic because the topic ",

I\u2019d kept this information from my dad until that point, because idk I just didnt want to tell him. But I did tell him during his rant, kind of to just try and get him to stop. It sort of worked, as he just seemed relieved that I was dating a guy. </p> <p>Maybe a few weeks to a couple months after this incident, my dad and I had a serious discussion where he let me further explain my identity (Omnisexual) and actually tried to understand it.

I\u2019m scared to tell my dad even though I\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t really care about me being gay it\u2019s just I don\u2019t know for sure. I wanna tell him but I also don\u2019t since I\u2019m scared he won\u2019t like that I am gay. My mom already knows and says it\u2019s fine but idk what my dad will think. I also don\u2019t know if anyone will like that I\u2019m gay really since I live in the other half of America where most southern people are and I\u2019m scared since I\u2019ve heard of so many people in the south not liking LGBTQ. Lmk if you have any suggestions.
