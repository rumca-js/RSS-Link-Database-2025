But the scene with Streicher absolutely broke my heart. Watching this grown man break down and cry at the prospect of his death made my heart hurt. The end was undignified for him in just the same way as the end was for all the victims of the camps but that didn\u2019t make me feel better. For the first time, in any media I have watched, I didn\u2019t feel cathartic release at the bad guy getting what they deserved.</p> <p>And what made it worse was Triest couldn\u2019t bring himself to say what he always thought he would say at that moment - and god knows he had more reaso",
