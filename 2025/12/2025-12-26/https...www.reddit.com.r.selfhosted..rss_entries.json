Pihole, plex, some docker containers, it was genuinely fun learning how everything worked. Then my family started using these services. My wife relies on the password manager daily and kids stream from plex constantly. Suddenly it&#39;s not my hobby anymore, people now depend on it</p> <p>Now when something breaks at 11pm it&#39;s &quot;dad the internet isn&#39;t working&quot; because pihole crashed. Or my wife&#39;s locked out of her accounts because the password thing stopped responding. I spent last weekend fixing stuff instead of relaxing because I realized one hard drive failure would destroy everything.</p> <p>Still glad I selfhost instead of paying for cloud services but nobody warned me that once other people depend on your setup, it stops being fun and becomes real work. Now I understand why sysadmins drink.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
