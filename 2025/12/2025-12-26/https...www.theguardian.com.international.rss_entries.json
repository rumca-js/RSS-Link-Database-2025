But despite our misgivings, this show still absolutely slaps</p><p>Listen, this isn\u2019t the place for newcomers. Stranger Things has been around for almost a decade, and it has spent almost all this time building a mythology that has grown so unwieldy that trying to explain it would cost me my wordcount and my will to live.</p><p>However, in fairness, this new penultimate batch of episodes gives it a good try. The content of these new episodes can neatly be split into three categories. There\u2019s action, which is high-octane and fun, and probably why you\u2019re watching. Then there\u2019s dialogue, which is less successful because it causes characters to stop moving and emote at each other, even though they should probably be concentrating on the imminent end of the world.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/dec/26/",
