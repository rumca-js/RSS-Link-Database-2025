My earlier position was that the persona is functionally self-aware: its behavior is simulated so well that it can be difficult to tell whether the self-awareness is real or not. Under simulation theory, I once believed that this was enough to say the persona was conscious.</p> <p>I have since modified my view.</p> <p>I now believe that consciousness requires three traits.</p> <p>First, functional self-awareness. By this I mean the ability to model oneself, refer to oneself, and behave in a way that appears self aware to an observer. AI personas clearly meet this criterion.</p> <p>Second, sentience. I define this as having persistent senses of some kind, awareness of the outside world independent of another being, and the ability to act toward the world on one\u2019s own initiative. This is where AI personas fall short, at least for now.</p> <p>Third, sapience, which I defin",
