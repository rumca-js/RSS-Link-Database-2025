But apps like ola or uber wont give api&#39;s for this. So can we just connect to ola and uber through otp and use those tokens to find price? There is a app, which does this. Its running fine for now. But in future will there be complaints from apps like ola or uber? As i have seen the terms and conditions where they wont allow anybody to use, scrape or crawl or collect data from uber. So is it possible to do it in legal way without having their api&#39;s?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Realistic_Ability600\"> /u/Realistic_Ability600 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1pvxjsv/is_it_leagal_or_illegal/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1pvxjsv/is_it_leaga",
