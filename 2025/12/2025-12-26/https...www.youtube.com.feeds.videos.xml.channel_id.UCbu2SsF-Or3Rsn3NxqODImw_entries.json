        "description": "Supported by regular content drops that, in true From Software style, expand each character's story and add set pieces and objectives that are not immediately obvious, Nightreign has near-endless replayability in the constant hunt for the \"perfect\" playthrough. Not an expansion, nor a sequel, but a standalone experience set in the Elden Ring universe, Nightreign honors the legacy of the original Elden Ring while elevating it to new heights. FromSoftware remains unrivaled in its ability to craft a stunning, atmospheric action-RPG, drenched with narrative and lore. \n\n#eldenring #nightreign #eldenringnightreign #gameoftheyear",
