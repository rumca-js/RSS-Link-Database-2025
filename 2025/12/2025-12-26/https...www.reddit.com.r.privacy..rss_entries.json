I heard abt them being implemented in some places but to actually see one in real life was startling. Luckily they don\u2019t seem to be in any other shops yet (or at least, they\u2019re better hidden) but with the current landscape of the world, in 20 years time this will probably be the norm.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t this insane?

I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s on difficult to access forms and that kind of thing to get the lists but I know it 100% must of been leaked so it has to be somewhere to recover my old accounts? Any help is super appreciated thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bigred468\"> /u/bigred468 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pvtd2e/how_do_people_see_data_leaks/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pvtd2e/how_do_people_see_data_leaks/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The other day he was watching a video on how to spy on people through wifi router. He has tampered/messed with the router before but none of us knew what he was doing. He brags that he can see peoples activities and know what his friends are doing because of chargers he leaves around and wifi. </p> <p>Could someone be looking at activities from this?
