I\u2019ve been looking for a VR headset for myself, but have had a very hard time deciding. </p> <p>The main purpose of my VR headset will be gaming.</p> <p>Originally the choice was between the Quest 3 and the PSVR 2, both have features that I like and dislike. I\u2019ve heard good things about the PSVR2 performance wise, but the cable + non-replaceable controllers is a pretty big drawback despite having some amazing games. Biggest drawback of the Quest 3 for me would be that it\u2019s Meta, and from what I\u2019ve heard both the Meta software and Meta support team sucks.</p> <p>Today i searched around further and came across news that Valve will be launching their VR headset possibly Q1 of 2026, so should I just wait and save a little extra for that instead? It\u2019s important to note that i don\u2019t own a PC of any kind and probably won\u2019t anytime soon. </p> <p>Really hoping to get some opinions, thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",

I only use the headset for PCVR. Specifically for sim racing and flight sims. Im not particularly wealthy, so will have to save up for whatever is next, but I do use VR everyday, so am happy to spend more for my next headset, possibly buy lighthouses etc.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the conundrum - Ive been using the Quest 3 almost exclusively for the last year, only for PCVR simming. But since I got it its left me a bit cold - Clarity is great, I really don&#39;t need anything sharper than this, but the headset doesn&#39;t feel particularly immersive to me. I really enjoy dramatic lighting, so enjoy racing at dawn, dusk, and flying at night, during sunset, sunrise etc, and I think I&#39;m disappointed with the contrast and the blacks on the Quest 3....</p> <p>....So I bought a PSVR2 with PC adaptor.

At first I thought my PC is not good enough, as I have RTX 4060 + i7 14700, but everytime I look at FPS on steam it&#39;s high, 1% low is in 55-60, and the game looks as smooth as my brain in the spectator mode.

No way it&#39;s supposed to be that bad, right? While my PC is nowhere top of the line, it&#39;s running most modern games at medium-high 2k without stutters or lags, while Half Life Alyx on low is extremely choppy and I swear I saw a combine ship rubberbend a bit.

Generally the method I use is to click on the download link chose the quality and instead of downloading, deo would just open the video in that quality. In the past week it doesn\u2019t open the video anymore just shows the circle trying to so it\u2019s thing. Any fixes?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Smurfmuppet\"> /u/Smurfmuppet </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pw7cbe/deovr_issue_with_opening_videos/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pw7cbe/deovr_issue_with_opening_videos/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I bought my PS VR2 about a year ago, but I&#39;ve rarely used it (same story with my original PS VR). This is mainly because I wear glasses for nearsightedness and I prefer not to wear my headset with my glasses. I have contact lenses that I wear for special occasions, so I would put those on whenever I would play, or try to play at times when I was already wearing them. But that extra step has been a real deterrent for me.</p> <p>I am considering ordering a pair of prescription lenses from VR-Rock since there is currently a sale. This should solve my problem because I would simply leave them inserted in the headset at all times. I see a lot of comments from glasses wearers claiming that they&#39;re a game changer, but I haven&#39;t seen much from people who made the switch from contact lenses. My concern is that it will be a downgrade visually due to either the added distance between my eyes and the built in lenses, or potential glare or other effect",

I care a lot about the creative side: world\u2011building, atmosphere, virtual photography, that kind of thing. Eventually I want people to be able to create inside these worlds too, maybe with AI helping them.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the problem:<br/> Whenever I try to learn the hardcore graphics stuff (NeRFs, Gaussian Splatting, rendering math, coding, etc.), I just\u2026 don\u2019t enjoy it. I <em>can</em> force myself to learn it if it\u2019s necessary, but it doesn\u2019t feel natural to me. I\u2019m much more drawn to the experience side than the algorithm side.</p> <p>But at the same time, I know real\u2011time neural rendering is becoming a big deal, and part of me worries that if I don\u2019t go deep into graphics, I won\u2019t be able to build the kind of worlds",

I upgraded my pc recently the biggest upgrade was the rtx 2070 to rx 9070xt. The first thing I noticed was how low the recommended resolution was for my system in the meta app, I played 90hz and noticed small stutters/very small but noticeable fps drops. With a lil bit of research I realized that apparently AMD cards aren\u2019t as fast as nvidias card when it especially comes to quest 3 link. So should I try to optimize settings/wait for better software for the 9070xt till it gets better or should I get another headset and which one, I have heard that PSVR2 has a great oled display and it uses a DisplayPort adapter which I assume is faster then quest link, but also in my country I can get a used index for like 350 dolla",
