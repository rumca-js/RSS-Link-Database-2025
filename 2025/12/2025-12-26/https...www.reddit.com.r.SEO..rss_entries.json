Until recently I just exported Ahrefs data once a month and ran a quick Screaming Frog crawl, but by the time I spotted a missing paid link the chargeback window was long gone. And most bloggers don&#39;t exactly send you a heads-up when they let their hosting lapse. Right now I&#39;m on the free plan at LinkWatcher.io \u2014 capped at 50 links. It pings me whenever a link drops or gets deindexed, which is nice, but I can&#39;t decide if upgrading to a paid plan is actually worth it as my backlink count keeps growing. For anyone who&#39;s paid for LinkWatcher, Linkody, MonitorBacklinks, or something similar: did the real-time alerts actually save you enough time (or rankings) to justify the cost?
