        "description": "Joe Rogan\u2019s suggestion that Christ could return as artificial intelligence is examined through theology, scripture, and the idea of idolatry. The discussion contrasts divine incarnation with human-made systems, drawing on biblical warnings about graven images, modern technology\u2019s quasi-spiritual role, and the risk of AI becoming a counterfeit source of meaning or authority.
