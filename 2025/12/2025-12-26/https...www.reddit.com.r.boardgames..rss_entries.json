So yeah, it&#39;s a thing between us</p> <p>2 questions; </p> <p>1; is this a bad idea? Am I corny? Am I stupid?</p> <p>2; if the answer to the first question is &quot;no&quot; what boardgame would you say? I&#39;m thinking of a two person game.

They also enjoy playing Cryptid, Command of Nature, Casting Shadows, Wrong Party, and Azul. My daughter owns Flamecraft and they love the theme and art, but don&#39;t love the gameplay and don&#39;t play it very often. For Christmas they are receieving Silverfrost, A Place for All my Books, Wyrmspan, Harvest, and Evergreen. I would love reccomendations for other games they might enjoy! Also, my daughter has been eyeing Tend because she loves the art. Do you think it would be too complex based on the other games she has played?</p> <p>Editing to add: games that play well with two players are preferred as they mostly only play together!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/glassfro",
