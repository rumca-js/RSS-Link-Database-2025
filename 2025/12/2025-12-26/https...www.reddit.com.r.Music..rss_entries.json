Her sole existence ended just a couple of minutes after she gave me life. I have never known her voice, her touch, or her smell. She has always been a ghost to me... an absence rather than a person.</p> <p>But today, I listened to &quot;Whose name is written on water (Pt. 1-4)&quot; by Max Richter.</p> <p>I don&#39;t know how to explain this without sounding crazy, but this music didn&#39;t just move me. It teleported me. I closed my eyes and I wasn&#39;t a 35 year old man anymore. I was back in the womb. The vibrations of the strings felt like the vibrations of her body. The rhythm felt like a heartbeat I haven\u2019t heard since I took my first breath. For the duration of this track, I felt her love surrounding me physically. It is surreal, terrifying, and beautiful.</p> <p>This music is the only thing in this entire world that has ever reminded me of her. I finally found her.</p",
