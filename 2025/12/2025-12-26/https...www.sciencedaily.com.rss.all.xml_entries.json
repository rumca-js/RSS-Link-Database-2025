Scientists discovered that vitamin C from food travels through the bloodstream into every layer of the skin, boosting collagen and skin renewal. People who ate two vitamin C\u2013packed kiwifruit daily showed thicker, healthier skin. The findings suggest glowing skin really does start from within.",

It controls laser frequencies with extreme precision while using far less power than today\u2019s bulky systems.
