But here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019ve never been a fan of random websites or heavy software like Photoshop or GIMP. Not only do I worry about whether the sites are safe, but the process itself just felt like too much work. My usual workflow? Download the image, fire up Gimp on Fedora, resize it, and then painstakingly use the magic tool to remove the background. It\u2019s effective, but let&#39;s be real\u2014it&#39;s a <em>lot</em> of effort.</p> <p>Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all about AI, but I don\u2019t fully trust online tools. I started thinking over the holidays: <em>\u201cThere has to be a better way to do this, right? Something effortless?\u201d</em> After some digging, I found <strong>rembg</strong>\u2014it\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. It uses local AI to remove backgrounds, which is <em>perfect</em>, but there\u2019s one catch: it\u2019s command-line only. That means every time I wanted to use",
