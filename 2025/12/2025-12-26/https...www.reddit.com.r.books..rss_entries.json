Herbert is clearly playing a long game here, and even when I was confused or mildly annoyed, I was still impressed.</p> <p>This is the point in the series where Dune stops being about politics and war and fully commits to being about time, stagnation, control, and humanity\u2019s self-destructive tendencies.

It&#39;s old, it&#39;s dense, and while I love gothic fiction, romance is not a genre I gravitate to. Having said that, I&#39;ve found reading it an incredibly rewarding experience. This has happened to me with a lot of books, especially classics or well-regarded but difficult books. I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;ve always enjoyed the experience, but more often than not, by the end of a well-regarded book I&#39;ve at least been able to understand why it has such praise.</p> <p>Now I went on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/\">r/books</a> to see a discussion about jane eyre and saw so many people say If you&#39;re not enjoying it, stop reading.&quot; And I found myself getting a little frustrated. Like, is art just for enjoyment? If all we did was read page turners full of subject matter we gravitate towards, how many excellent books",

The stories in the first two books don\u2018t really tell much, the transitional nature is strong, and the real plot explosion is concentrated in the third book. And I feel that the author\u2018s ability in plot design is even inferior to George Martin. Also, I was very frustrated by the dark ending of the third book, as if only the most cruel and evil people could have a good ending, while the good people lost almost everything, and everything returned to the beginning. Bayaz\u2018s portrayal of Gandalf as the evil version was indeed impressive, so much so that I wanted to rush into the book and beat him up. Except for him, everyone else lost miserably (except perhaps that evil Inquisitor).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OriginalCause5799\"> /u/Orig",
