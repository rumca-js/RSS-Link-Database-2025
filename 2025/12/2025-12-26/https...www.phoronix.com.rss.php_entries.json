        "description": "As part of the various end-of-year benchmarking comparisons on Phoronix and with Linux 6.19 switching older AMD GCN 1.0/1.1 graphics cards to the AMDGPU driver by default, I planned for a very large AMD Radeon graphics card comparison on the latest open-source Linux driver for ending out 2025. In the end though I was thwarted by newer AMD RDNA3 / RDNA4 graphics cards regressing hard on Linux 6.19 that led to ending this testing prematurely due to a show-stopping bug. In any case in this article offers a fresh look at older GCN and RDNA graphics cards on Linux 6.19 + Mesa 26.0-devel.",
