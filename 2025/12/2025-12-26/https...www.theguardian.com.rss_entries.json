To gain the upper hand, he hosted a grand party the night before the match at which he served his guests Patiala pegs, famously generous four-finger whisky pours traditionally measured from pinky to index finger. Unsurprisingly, the English players overindulged, leaving them very hungover and, inevitably, defeated the next day, and the legend of the Patiala peg was born. This Punjabi kind-of old fashioned is inspired by Singh\u2019s drink. At the restaurant, we serve it from a bespoke five-litre bottle, but we\u2019ve adapted the recipe to make it more suitable for a domestic environment.</p><p>James Stevenson, beverage director, <a href=\"https://ambassadorsclubhouse.com/\">Ambassadors Clubhouse</a>, London W1</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/26/cocktail-of-the-week-ambassadors-",

At the heart of the plot: why did an innocent-looking kid called Jamie (Owen Cooper) commit such a brutal murder? The third episode lifted the lid. As Jamie is interviewed by psychologist Briony (Erin Doherty), we see him slowly reveal that he\u2019s not an innocent kid, but warped by misogyny and a twisted sense of entitlement. The episode was captivating in its acting, but it stayed with you: from Jamie\u2019s sudden switch from vulnerability to manipulation, to the moment the camera zooms in on Briony\u2019s face as she registers who Jamie really is. Horrifying.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-a",
