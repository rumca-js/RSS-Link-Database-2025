        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a lot of people have noticed that basically everything seems to suck now. The quality of everything has gone. But is that actually true? And if it is, why is it happening? And what do we do about it it? We will begin that conversation today. Also, the media circles the wagons around the Somalians of Minnesota. But their attempts to defend Somalians have only had the opposite of the intended effect. And Travis Kelce claims he's never been in an argument with his fiancee Taylor Swift. This is not the kind of story I would usually comment on, but I think it\u2019s important to launch a defense of arguing in a marriage.\n\nEp.1702\n\n-- -- --\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos daily. https://www.youtube.com/@mattwalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\nClick here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\n-- -- --\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:35 Opening\n03:07 - 31:06 The Quality Of Literally Everything Is Declining.
