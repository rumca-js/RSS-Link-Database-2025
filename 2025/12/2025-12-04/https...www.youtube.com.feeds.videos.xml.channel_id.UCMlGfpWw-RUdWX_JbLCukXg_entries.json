Unfortunately, some embedded toolchains like AVR-GCC omit portions of the C++ Standard Library, including headers like \uff1catomic\uff1e .This makes it much harder to program concurrent software on these platforms, since many tutorials and open-source libraries assume Standard Library support. For example, these talks from past CppCons present lock-free data structures and algorithms that rely strongly on lock-free instantiations of std::atomic\uff1cT\uff1e: \n \n -  Single Producer Single Consumer Lock-free FIFO From the Ground Up \u2013 Charles Frasch \u2013 CppCon 2023 \n-  Introduction to Wait-free Algorithms in C++ Programming \u2013 Daniel Anderson \u2013 CppCon 2024 \n-  User API & C++ Implementation of a Multi Producer, Multi Consumer, Lock Free, Atomic Queue \u2013 Erez Strauss \u2013 CppCon 2024\n \nThis session will show you how to implement your own atomic types in the absence of ",
