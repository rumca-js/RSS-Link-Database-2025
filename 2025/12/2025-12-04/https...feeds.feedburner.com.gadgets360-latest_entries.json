        "description": "Astronomers using NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope have observed a massive helium cloud escaping from the super-puff exoplanet WASP-107b, marking the first direct detection of such atmospheric loss. Webb\u2019s infrared data reveal an enormous exosphere nearly ten times the planet\u2019s radius, with helium streaming both ahead of and behind the planet in its orbit. The findings show how extreme stellar radiation strips away WASP-107b\u2019s outer layers, offering new insight into how low-density gas giants evolve under intense heat.",
