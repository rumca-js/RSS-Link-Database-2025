        "description": "This is easily the most insane Mini PC I\u2019ve ever had on the channel. The new Minisforum M02 Ultra can take up to 256GB of RAM, has USB4 v2, dual 25GbE, built-in PSU, and even a PCIe 5.0 x16 slot for a desktop GPU.\nIn this video I turn it into a compact gaming rig with an RTX 5060 low profile, then push the Intel Core Ultra 9 285 with benchmarks and real-world games like Cyberpunk 2077, Spider-Man 2, Red Dead 2 and more. And in a future video, I\u2019ll be dropping in an Intel Arc Pro B50 to turn this into a full AI workstation / LLM box, so definitely keep an eye out for that.\nIf you\u2019ve been looking for a do-it-all mini PC for gaming, content creation, homelab or AI, this thing is wild.\nLearn More Here: https://tidd.ly/4rHGtpk\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Black Friday Sale code for software\uff1aETA \nWindows 11 Pro Key($23):https://biitt.ly/RUZiX \nWindows 11 Home Key($22):https://biitt.ly/SQKq",
