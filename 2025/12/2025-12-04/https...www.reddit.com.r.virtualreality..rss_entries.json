I want to get him the game for Christmas and I know he&#39;ll need a headset too. He has a desktop but it is a little older, so I wasn&#39;t sure if it would work on there. He also has a PS5 but I saw some posts saying it was discontinued on there? If anyone has any advice for how I can make this work and what equipment to get, I&#39;d really appreciate it.

I was wondering why when I play VRChat in worlds with over 20 people the game starts to lag. The UI menu becomes laggy and scratchy when I scroll down. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my PC specs, which are: RTX 5070, i7-14700, 32 GB of DDR5, and 150 GB of free space on my SSD. I read somewhere that this issue might happen because the Quest 3 can\u2019t decode all the streaming data my PC sends to it. If you have any suggestions on how to fix this or any upgrades I could add to my PC to solve the problem, please let me know! I also plan to upgrade to the Steam frame and I\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s worth it along with if it could fix this issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Burrious16\"> /u/Burrious16 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pe37m8/quest_3_pcvr_lagging_in_vrc_20_people/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span",

The 2 offers I&#39;m considering right now are Q3S with head strap (we plan to buy one anyway) for 1000 PLN and Q3 512GB with travel case for 1600 PLN, so Q3 cost 60% more (85% more in reality, because we want to buy the headstrap). </p> <p>Sorry for chaotic writing style, I&#39;ve been writing this post over 2 days and 5 different places. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",
