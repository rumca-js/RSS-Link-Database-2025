I have a gsync 175hz monitor with gsync enabled in the hyprland config. I have the frame limiter set to 170. </p> <p>The problem I\u2019m having is with the mangohud frame limiter. In most games it works great, no issues, but for some reason in the finals the frame limiter works perfectly in the shooting range, but if I actually get in a game the limiter works sometimes, but other times my fps will go above the limiter, often by a significant margin. When this happens I get bad stuttering. I have tried almost all goverlay options, late/early method, different vsync options, all different launch options, gsync on and off, I am at my wits end. I have a workaround using vkd3d framerate limiter, but the mangohud limiter feels better when it is working properly (could be just in my head, but feels smoother) Also it seems like the future of that frame limiting method is uncertain?

I\u2019ve successfully forced the launcher to start with the dedicated GPU, and <em>nvidia-smi</em> even shows the process running on it. However, the performance is extremely poor \u2014 I\u2019m getting around 20 FPS on average, making the game almost unplayable.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already tried several common fixes: forcing the NVIDIA GPU globally, adjusting permissions with Flatseal, modifying launch arguments, and various suggestions I found online. None of these have made any difference.</p> <p>I\u2019m facing a similar situation with Waydroid, but from what I\u2019ve seen, almost nobody has managed to run it smoothly on NVIDIA hardware anyway.</p> <p>Has anyone dealt with this issue or found a reliable workaround? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- S",

However, if the game lets me enable V-Sync, like Final Fantasy XVI where I can have V-Sync with frame generation enabled, the game runs incredibly smoothly. But in Cronos: The New Dawn, for example, where I can&#39;t have V-Sync with frame generation enabled, there&#39;s a lot of stuttering and an unstable frametime, causing the game to have very high latency, more so than on Windows, at least as far as I can remember.
