        "description": "\"Prediction Markets\" (in a rather meteoric rise) are breaking into the world of public consciousness. Interestingly, these markets aren't new, or unique, but rather resurging after decades of dormancy, displacing experts and showcasing just how flawed much of our authoritative \"sources\" really are. \n\nWhen a crowd sourced market can predict things days, or weeks in advance with better accuracy than any of the major news networks, and when those same markets can scrape data to reveal competition results before they are even made public, they need to be considered and kept track of in a world that thrives on information. \n\nIts not just \"memes and degen betting\"... its more like the Internets Crystal Ball. \n\n\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7d",
