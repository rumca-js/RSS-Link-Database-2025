It\u2019s sharp, vivid, weirdly elegant, and it pulled me in way faster than I was prepared for. I ended up burning through the chapters like I was possessed or something. And the villains, Smh, I absolutely hated them. Like, viscerally. Which is exactly how you know they were written well. Meanwhile, I kept feeling myself pulled toward the protagonists, especially Abitha and, yes, even Samson. And I\u2019ll be honest\u2026",

I&#39;d like a likeable protagonist(s) and want to watch them succeed.<br/></li> <li>I&#39;m fine with traditional fantasy, just not <em>completely</em> traditional.

I also used to really enjoy dystopian, but whenever I look for recs I&#39;m getting a lot of booktok books promoted. A friend suggested fourth wing, and I absolutely did not enjoy that. I&#39;d like something smart, logical, which is well written. I was recommend stormlight archive, and I started way of kings but that might be too hard-core as even after a persevering through 200 pages I still wasn&#39;t really hooked. Any and all recommendations will be greatly appreciated :D thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Worried_Goal6246\"> /u/Worried_Goal6246 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1pdq1jw/hi_folks_of_reddit_im_new_to_fantasy_and_i_really/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantas",

It hit all the same notes for me, and for the exact same reasons.</p> <p>This isn&#39;t strictly a review of these two books, because they&#39;re very short, and some of those books where the actual plots are both rather simple and not the point. They are, much like <em>Time War</em>, books where character relationships are what matter. They&#39;re light on plot, <em>Sorcerer</em> following a band of mercenary brothers acting as caravan guards for a merchant company on its journey, and <em>A Taste of Honey</em> following the main characters conflict between famil",
