        "description": "*An edited, illustrated and narrated playthrough of the game Dwarf Fortress*\n\n Welcome back to Dwarf Fortress, my good bearded bastards! It looks like theres been a big update to the game that will add a lot more siege-related challenges to fortress life. But of course, there's also a great many new ways to defend ourselves as well! Today we're going to dip our toes in, see the new weaponry and get a brief look at what this update has to offer (despite me being the stupidest bastard to ever strike the earth..you'll see.)\n\nMusic by Ivan Duch: https://ivanduch.com/\n\nIntro & End tunes by Topher Anselmo: https://topheranselmo.com/\n\nIllustration Coloring by Mrs K\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/c/Kruggsmash",
