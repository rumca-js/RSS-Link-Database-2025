The idea of separating embedding generation from the matching stage sounds clean in theory, but I am unsure how people usually divide these tasks across containers. If you have worked on projects that involve repeated image operations or anything compute heavy, how do you design your containers Do you keep everything in a single image or split stages into separate services for easier scaling I would love to hear real world approaches before I overcomplicate something simple.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LockEastern4342\"> /u/LockEastern4342 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1pdzufm/curious_about_organizing_image_processing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddi",
