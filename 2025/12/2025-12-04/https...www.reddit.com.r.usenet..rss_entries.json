I&#39;ve had this account for six years at that speed and never had a major problem. While learning the ropes of usenet, I managed to hit my &quot;fair use&quot; data limit of 4 TB and they knocked me down to 10 Mbps for the remaining two weeks in this billing cycle. Moral of the story: Check the fine print of your ISP contract and know their fair use policy. Now I have to figure out how to limit usenet usage to 2TB/month so I leave enough bandwidth for everything else in our household. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy_Orange_8426\"> /u/Icy_Orange_8426 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1pe9c42/isp_data_limit/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1pe9c42/isp_data_limit/\">[comments]</a></span>",
