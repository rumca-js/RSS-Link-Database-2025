        "description": "Are you burnt out from constantly striving for more? Executive coach Nina Blackshear flips the script with a counterintuitive idea: the path to a richer, more intentional life may lie not in adding more, but in saying \u201cno\u201d and eliminating what no longer serves you. With warmth and clarity, she reveals how thoughtful elimination can create space for true fulfillment. \n\nNina Blackshear is an engaging speaker and executive coach who leverages her wide-ranging background to spark innovative thinking and cultivate growth-oriented mindsets. With warmth and directness, she empowers individuals and organizations to identify \"What's Next,\" embrace change, and achieve authentic success through fresh perspectives. Nina's dynamic keynotes blend expertise, humor, and actionable insights to drive forward-thinking solutions and lasting transformation. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The project comes from her worries about pollution, climate change, and especially deforestation, which she sees as destroying the green spaces and wildlife she loves. Her main message is that even a tiny green corner can be a first step: when students plant trees, care for plants, and talk about environmental problems, they raise awareness and inspire others to protect the planet.

In this video, the speaker reveals the quantum trick that scammers fear the most: a powerful concept called Quantum Position Verification (QPV). This technique uses the laws of quantum physics to prove exactly the position or location of the server of the website, making it almost impossible for scammers to fake identities, locations, or access your accounts from across the world. Use of Quantum entanglement leads multi-node quantum networks, which can offer ultra-secure unhackable communication enabling quantum position verification.\nIn this talk, you\u2019ll discover:\n\n(i) How scammers operate and impersonate trusted sources\n\n(ii) Why online scams are so hard to stop using classical technology\n\n(iii) What Quantum Position Verification is \u2014 explained simply\n\n(iv) What Quantum entanglement is and why it is ultra-secure\n\n(v) How quantum netw",

For others, it means dying on a construction site. Speaking from her experience witnessing climate disasters devastate her home state, Manipur, and communities across India, she shows how the poorest communities are paying the highest price for a crisis they didn't cause.\nShe asks: Is this fair? And more importantly, will we help fix it? \nThis is a call to build systems that protect everyone equally, not just those who can afford it.\n\n S Bituila is a PhD researcher at IIT Delhi specializing in climate change mitigation and net-zero emissions in land-use systems. She integrates indigenous knowledge with modern science to design context-specific climate solutions for vulnerable communities. Beyond her technical expertise, she is deeply committed to democratizing climate science and amplifying the voices of marginalized communities with",

        "description": "In this TEDx talk, Siddharth Sagar talks about his journey of recovering from mental health issues, \u201cHow he found spirituality to recover from mental health\u201d. In his school days, he found himself more inclined to acting and mimicry and got exposed to the acting industry. Mimicking the personalities in front of personalities themselves. Light Camera Action, it was fascinating but had bad effect on his mental health. He talks about his existence, and at young age, he found himself into addiction and diagnosed with several mental health issues.\n\nHis recovery emerged not through lifelong medication, but through spirituality, inner awareness, and reclaiming his authentic self. He now advocates extensively for addiction awareness, a crisis recognized globally by WHO. His message is simple yet powerful: the real pursuit is not external success, but discovering the answer to the question, \u201cWho am I?\u201d\nWith silence, spirituality, and the question that finally shook him awake: Who am I beyond my",

        "description": "Khanh An's talk is an emotional story about growing up in a family where her dad has to work far away, and how distance doesn\u2019t stop them from loving each other. She shares the sadness of missing her father in everyday moments, but also describes the creative ways her family stays close, like regular video call, and planned activities when he comes home. The main message is that even when families are apart, effort, communication, and small rituals can keep their connection strong. Runner-up of the Oxford Speakers 2025 competition and a student from class 5Q3, Oxford International Curriculum, Doan Thi Diem Hanoi Primary School This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

She shows that positive words like encouragement, support, and praise can lift someone up, while negative words such as insults or harsh criticism can deeply hurt and stay in a person\u2019s mind for a long time. The main message is a simple reminder: choose your words carefully, because even small comments can create big impacts in someone\u2019s life.

From wound healing and reconstruction to liver patches and, one day, full organ replacements, this technology points to a future where access to life-saving organs is no longer left to chance.\n\nAlexander invites us to imagine a world where organ scarcity is eliminated\u2014and giving life becomes possible on demand through scientific innovation.

        "description": "What if the mental health crisis among young people could be solved by meeting them where they truly are? In this powerful talk, Melanie Eckert, founder of krisenchat, shares the story of Marie\u2014a 12-year-old struggling with anxiety, depression, and loneliness\u2014and reveals the invisible battles millions of young people face every day.\n\nThrough her work building a digital, peer-informed crisis chat, Melanie demonstrates how support can be immediate, anonymous, and accessible in the spaces where young people actually spend their time. Drawing from real stories, personal experience, and the lessons learned from thousands of conversations, she challenges us to rethink youth mental health\u2014not as a distant system problem, but as a collective responsibility.\n\nThis talk is a call to action: to listen to young voices, empower them with tools and communities, and transform the way society responds to their struggles\u2014because the future depends on the care we provide today. Melanie Eckert is a psyc",

        "description": "In this thought-provoking talk, digital futurist Max Penk explores a startling reality: in 2025, non-human agents online outnumber humans. From AI bots that convincingly debate on Reddit to algorithmic systems shaping what we see, like, and even believe, Max reveals how the digital world is no longer just a reflection of us\u2014it\u2019s reshaping who we are.\n\nThrough vivid examples, he shows how bots influence language, manipulate engagement, and even affect democracy, challenging us to rethink authenticity, trust, and identity in the age of intelligent machines. Max argues that the next frontier isn\u2019t teaching machines to be human\u2014it\u2019s proving that we, humans, can still act in ways machines cannot.\n\nThis talk is a call to awareness and action: understand the invisible systems shaping your digital life, protect authenticity, and reclaim the human presence in a world increasingly shared with bots. Max Penk is a creative technologist passionate about using innovation and storytelling to inspire",

Social media and the creator economy amplified noise, leaving democracy vulnerable to misinformation.\n\nNow, AI offers a new opportunity: to curate knowledge, prioritize trustworthy sources, and act as a modern gatekeeper for truth.

        "description": "In 1945, Germany was rubble; by 1960, it was an economic leader. The essential variable wasn\u2019t luck, it was speed. This talk argues that velocity is a moral and practical lever for progress, yet the most undervalued variable in progress. The talk diagnoses medicine\u2019s bradycardia: layers of well-meant bureaucracy that turn years into funerals, and introduces a practical \u201cdigital pacemaker\u201d to compress discovery-to-delivery from 12 years to 5. Anchored in a simple creative rhythm: Try. Learn. Build. The talk shows how faster iteration saves lives, lowers cost, and multiplies possibility. This is a manifesto for urgency. Zina Sarif is a scientist and entrepreneur, founder and CEO of Yendou, a platform that helps speed up how new medicines move from idea to patient. As former cancer researcher, she turned her lab experience into a mission: to make clinical trials faster, smarter, and more human, so progress in medicine keeps pace with discovery.

From wild bees that fly in bad weather to bats that pollinate agave for tequila, she highlights the intricate networks that sustain our diets and our planet.\n\nMore than science, this talk is a call to action: plant bell flowers, grow your own food, create habitats for pollinators, and understand the hidden connections between biodiversity, nutrition, and justice.
