When I got the system it had the red blinking light whenever I turned it on and saw that that meant the 72 pin connector needed to be either fixed or swapped so I got a new connector. While swapping it out I tested the new connector with one of the games (that I know for certain work) and it was perfectly fine, unplugged and replugged a few times as well as reset and turned of the NES and it was working perfectly. So then once I had it fully put back together I repeated the previous steps before deciding I wanted to play a different game, and then I got the grey screen. Tried a different game, grey screen. Tried the original test game, grey screen. I saw people saying to boil the 72 pin connector, and figured I&#39;d ask before doing so if that was recommended or if there were any other possible fixes. I have cleaned all the connectors multiple times as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

I&#39;ve played a couple of the home console ports, but I&#39;ve never seen one that had a twin-stick controller setup, with the exception of the Atari 5200 release, which IIRC required the use of a dual controller holder that was sold with the Space Dungeon cartridge.</p> <p>Decent ports of Robotron were available in the 16-bit console era, but none of those (AFAIK) made use of a twin-stick setup, which is essential to replicate the action of the arcade game.</p> <p>Eventually, twin analog sticks became a standard feature of home consoles, and then a common accessory for PC gaming. As far as I know, though, there is still no PC compatible port of Robotron that makes use of the dual sticks that are now standard.
