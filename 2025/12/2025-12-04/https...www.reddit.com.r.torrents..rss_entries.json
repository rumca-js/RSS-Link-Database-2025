I wasn&#39;t sure where to look so I just opened the downloads thing and I saw movies, but between those there were also a few of porn titled files, and some of those had the names of animals. The files had the typical stupid spectacle porn titles and I don&#39;t remember the file type but it also had a bunch of random letters &amp; such like spam mails do sometimes. I was scared and asked my dad about it, and he said sometimes when he downloads movies it comes with junk or malware. I was 10 years old so I just wanted to hear it wasn&#39;t him &amp; I moved on, but now that I&#39;m in my 20s and I just remembered it I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s ",
