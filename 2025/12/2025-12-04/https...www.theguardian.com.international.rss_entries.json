The organisers\u2019 headquarters were in Dublin and between 2006 and 2012 either Munster or Leinster lifted the trophy five times in seven seasons. Everyone else was forced to scrabble around for the last few uneaten Tayto crisps in the bag.</p><p>And now? The tournament, officially known these days as the Investec Champions Cup, has tilted so far towards France you can practically smell the garlic. Admittedly its HQ is now in Switzerland for tax reasons but, financially and on the field, the balance of power lies squarely with <em>les grands chefs</em> of the Top 14. Since 2021, there have been five successive French winners and on three occasions in that time, the Challenge Cup has also disappeared across the Channel.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguard",

Their game with Daejeon Hana, however, turned out to be the most controversial and divisive of the season.
