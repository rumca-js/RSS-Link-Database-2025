Its only job is to surface proof-of-concept exploit links for a given CVE. It isn\u2019t a vulnerability database; it\u2019s a direct discovery layer that points straight to the underlying code. Anyone can test it, examine it, or drop it into their own workflow.</p> <p>A small rate limit is in place to prevent automated scraping.
