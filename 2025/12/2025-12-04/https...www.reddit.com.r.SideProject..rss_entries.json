The effects are subtle but noticeable \u2014 it doesn\u2019t knock you out or make you feel drugged, but it does help you unwind and fall asleep a little easier. I also like that the formula is USDA-organic and made from hemp flower only, which feels cleaner compared to a lot of budget CBD brands.</p> <p>The downside is that it\u2019s full-spectrum, so there\u2019s trace THC. It\u2019s mild, but if you want something guaranteed THC-free, this isn\u2019t it. The results also vary depending on the day \u2014 some nights it works great, others it feels lighter, and the price is definitely on the higher side for the dosage.</p> <p>Overall, Cornbread Hemp is solid if you\u2019re looking for a clean, organic CBD option that actually takes the edge off without heavy side effects.
