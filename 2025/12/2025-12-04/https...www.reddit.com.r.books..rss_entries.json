I&#39;ve recommended Killers of a Certain Age to so many friends, and will start recommending Kills Well with Others too. I raced through this book in under 3 days and was sad to finish it. </p> <p>I&#39;m not aware of many books where the main characters are the most invisible people in the world - namely middle aged to senior citizen Women. I also think these books would make a great movie or series for the insatiable market that is Apple +, Disney+ and Netflix. Casting would be awesome, bring back Lynda Carter from Wonder Woman for example. Bring me your casting thoughts and let&#39;s hope someone in streaming is looking for a book to make a series or movie from.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DebiDebbyDebbie\"> /u/DebiDebbyDebbie </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comm",

And then I find out the main character\u2019s name is Abitha, and I should have known it\u2019d be witchy vibes lol. I was honestly a little standoffish at first because that vibe usually isn\u2019t my thing\u2026 but, I did not expect this book to grab me the way it did.</p> <p>Brom\u2019s prose really surprised me. It\u2019s sharp, vivid, weirdly elegant, and it pulled me in way faster than I was prepared for. I ended up burning through the chapters like I was possessed or something. And the villains, Smh, I absolutely hated them. Like, viscerally. Which is exactly how you know they were written well. Meanwhile, I kept feeling myself pulled toward the protagonists, especially Abitha and, yes, even Samson. And I\u2019ll be honest\u2026",

And it takes an immense toll on her but she goes looking for answers.</p> <p>But the answers were not what she was looking for. Rita, overwhelmed by her role of caring for her mother, did in fact kill herself.</p> <p>This was not an easy read. The paragraphs are pages long and the first 50 pages or so seemed to drag on and on. Neither Elena nor Rita seemed to be likeable characters; both have their share of sins under their belt, and very few redeeming qualities. But what made this book so hard to process was the topic of ageing and ailing. I disliked Elena from the start; she seems to be the kind of old woman who seems to think her children owe her all the respect in the world, ",

The immense amount of information about cameras, the history of the medium, photographers like Diane Arbus and Walker Evans, the technical evolution from daguerreotypes to modern photography. She even gets into how the camera changed the way we perceive beauty itself, that we now judge things by how they&#39;d look in a photograph rather than how they look to our naked eyes.</p> <p>The best parts for me were ofcourse the philosophical bits. She uses Plato&#39;s cave allegory to argue that photographs are like shadows. They look like reality but they&#39;re not. They appropriate reality, but like they don&#39;t capture it. The first chapter &quot;In Plato&#39;s Cave&quot; was particularly mind-bending. Also loved her take on how photography has this voyeuristic el",

The novel follows their friendship, their crew and the people whose lives intersect with theirs. Exploring love, loss, violence and the harsh realities of frontier life. Its sweeping, emotional, funny and tragic, often described as a \u201cgreat American novel\u201d in a cowboy setting.</p> <p><em>McMurtry</em> writes with such warmth, humor and unflinching honesty that the story feels less like a Western and more like a profound study of friendship, aging and the cost of a life fully lived. Every character is written with nuance and emotional depth, revealing layers that unfold naturally as the story widens. Gus and Call are unforgettable and their cattle drive becomes a grand portrait of a frontier that is both beautiful and brutal.<",
