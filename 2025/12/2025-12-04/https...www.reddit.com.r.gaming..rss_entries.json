I have heard many good things about certain shooters, specifically call of duty, having very well made single player modes. For reference I have played Doom Eternal and Doom 2016 but didn&#39;t really like them because there weren&#39;t really any characters or proper story segments it just felt like an endless arcade mode where i just shoot. </p> <p>Are there any shooters with good, well made and self-contained stories with characters i can care about and one that lets you develop strategies to win gunfights instead of just aiming and shooting behind a cover for 10 minutes that you personally recommend? I am open to older games or console exclusives </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Admirable-War-7594\"> /u/Ad",

Games like The Sims have THOUSANDS of dollars worth of DLC. Anno 1800 has over 30 dlcs and skin packs. Every genre of online game has year-after-year of season passes.
