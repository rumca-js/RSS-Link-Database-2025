Go to https://www.jmp.com/scishow  to see the benefits of visual statistics for yourself. \n\nIn 1939, 835 sheep were killed by a single bolt of lightning during a thunderstorm in Pine Canyon, Utah. This was far from the last time literally hundreds of animals suffered a similar fate, but how could such a fate befall them? Well, it has to do with the fact that there are more ways you can get struck by lightning than just the classic thunder god-smiting-you type.\n\nHosted by: Savannah Geary (they/them)\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon supporters for helping us keep SciShow free for everyone forever: Jp Lynch, J.V.
