My main goal is to use an older version of CapCut \u2014 this old version is actually the one that consumes a lot of internet data. I already tried several ways to reduce its data usage on my PC but nothing worked.</p> <p>My question: Will I be allowed to install that old CapCut version on a shared RDP? And is there a reliable way to transfer the app from my PC to the shared RDP (for example copying program files, using portable builds, or uploading an installer) so I can run it there without issues?</p> <p>If anyone has experience with 99RDP, shared RDPs, or running older app versions on remote desktops, I\u2019d appreciate any advice or tips.
