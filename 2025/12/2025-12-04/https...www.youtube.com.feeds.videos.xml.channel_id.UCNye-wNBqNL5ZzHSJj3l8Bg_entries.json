        "description": "Thousands of people have fled the Sudanese city of el-Fasher since the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces took control of it in late October. But the fate of even more people who\u2019ve been left behind remains unknown since (as) satellite imagery shows no signs of civilian life in the city. Those who\u2019ve fled el-Fasher say they\u2019re afraid their loved ones may have been killed, with reports of mass graves and burning of bodies around the city. \n\nA warning: Some viewers may find the details in this report disturbing.
