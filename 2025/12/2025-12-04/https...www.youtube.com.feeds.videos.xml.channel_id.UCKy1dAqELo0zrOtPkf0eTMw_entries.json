While PlayStation's multiplayer-centric offerings have not hit as of late (except Helldivers 2), there is hope that this game will find an audience considering it's being helmed by Left 4 Dead's Mike Booth. In other news, Amazon's Tomb Raider series is not only rebooting the live-action Lara Croft adventures, but will \"reinvent the franchise on a massive scale\" by connecting the show to the games in a \"unified storytelling universe.\" Fleabag's Phoebe Waller-Bridge is showrunning, and the series is expected to go into production early next year. And finally, Creative Assembly hosted a 25th Anniversary showcase, featuring new Total War projects, including the next mainline historical game: Total War: Medieval 3. A new game engine, Warcore, will also power new entries on console for the first time.",

In other news, voice actor Jennifer Hale will not be voicing Samus Aran in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Hale has voiced the character in the previous three Metroid Prime games. Nintendo has not given a reason for the change, but it has recently switched up the voice talents for other properties, such as Mario and Donkey Kong.
