This has been perfect for the last year and now my drive is full. I did some research about adding a second drive and many people recommended Drivepool. I cannot change my setup at the moment; I&#39;ll eventually move everything to unraid, but for for now I can&#39;t change it. I set up drivepool thinking it would work well, but then I found out it does not support WSL2 backend, and Qbittorrent cannot detect the folder contents.

I want to set up tasks to automatically back up my various external SSDs to my Synology NAS via Chronosync. Currently, I have it set up so that Chronosync mirrors a particular SSD to a designated folder on my NAS, and I use Snapshots in DSM for proper backup versioning.</p> <p>However, my Mac will connect to the NAS over Wi-Fi and Ethernet. Sometimes I like to work at various places throughout my house and will be connected to the NAS via Wi-Fi at those times. But having the Chronosync task over Wi-Fi just doesn&#39;t seem ideal. Is there a way to set up Chronosync so that it only runs when it accesses the NAS via Ethernet (when I&#39;m at my desk)? Maybe some sort of script?</p> <p>Any input here would be greatly appreciated.
