        "description": "Matthew Perry's grieving parents wrote heartfelt letters made public Wednesday accusing Dr. Salvador Plasencia of being \"among the most culpable of all\" of the people who supplied drugs to Perry. The letters came as Dr. Plasencia pled guilty to four counts of distributing 20 vials of ketamine for $55,000. Perry was found dead in his hot tub in October 2023. He became addicted to ketamine, which he used to treat his depression.",

Luigi Mangione was arrested in Pennsylvania five days later and brought to New York City to face trial. Thompson was a husband and father of two teenaged sons.

It's the same hand that has been seen bruised and covered with makeup. There has not been a comment from the White House about the band-aids and the president laughed off concerns about his health. Trump appeared to fall asleep as administration officials were filling him in on their accomplishments.",
