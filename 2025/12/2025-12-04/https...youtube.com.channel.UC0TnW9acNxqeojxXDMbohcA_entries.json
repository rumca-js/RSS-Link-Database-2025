Purpose has been at the core of everything I\u2019ve written and done for over a decade\u2014and in this episode, we go all the way down the rabbit hole. From Viktor Frankl surviving Auschwitz to the myth of \u201cfinding your one true purpose,\u201d we break down what purpose really is, why you feel lost without it, and how you can build it into your life\u2014no inspirational fluff, just psychological, philosophical, and practical depth.\n\nWe also get uncomfortable (in the best way) and talk about the dark side of purpose\u2014how it can burn you out, trap you in toxic ambition, or become an excuse to ruin your life. I even open up about launching a second company this year, what it cost me, and why it still mattered. If you\u2019ve ever felt aimless, stuck, or like something important is missing\u2026 this one\u2019s for you.\n\n\nWe also put together a free companion guide for this episode with all the takeaways, references, and tools to help you get your sh*t together once and for ",
