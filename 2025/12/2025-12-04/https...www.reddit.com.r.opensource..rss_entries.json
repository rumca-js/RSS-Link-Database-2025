No setup, no manual writing.</p> <p>GitHub repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/qodex-ai/apimesh\">https://github.com/qodex-ai/apimesh</a></p> <p>It works across Python, Node.js, Go, Rails, Java and more.

It has a fairly robust API if you want to interact with it that way. It also has a easy to use theming system for user customization.
