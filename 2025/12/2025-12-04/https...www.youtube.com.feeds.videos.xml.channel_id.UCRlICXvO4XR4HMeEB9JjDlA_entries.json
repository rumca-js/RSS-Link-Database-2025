        "description": "The blue whale didn\u2019t become the biggest animal in Earth\u2019s history by accident. It did it by picking the most overpowered diet in the ocean: krill. Tiny, thumb-sized, absurdly energy-dense krill \u2014 packed into swarms so massive they could fill millions of Olympic pools \u2014 turned lunge-feeding into a cheat code. One gulp, half a ton straight to the stomach. But the real plot twist? Those krill disappear for half the year, forcing blue whales into a hardcore feast-or-famine lifestyle. So evolution handed them the only upgrade that solves every problem at once: get massive, store fat, and keep moving. No legends, no tall tales \u2014 just brutal biology and the world\u2019s biggest animal grinding its way to greatness.",
