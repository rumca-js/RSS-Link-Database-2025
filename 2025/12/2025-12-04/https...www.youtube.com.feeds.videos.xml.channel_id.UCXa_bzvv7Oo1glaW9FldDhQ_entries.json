        "description": "We've dived back into Red Dead Redemption - yet again - as it makes its current-gen debut. But is this version of the game worthy of the effort it took to make it a reality, and is it worth your hard-earned time and money? \n\nWe put in the hours, and while there are improvements that make this version of the game the one to beat, there are issues that underline its age. Could those issues have been avoided in an enhanced port? Probably not. \n\nWhat about a remake? That's a different story. Join us as we take a look at what works, and what doesn't, as we dive into an adventure that's high on nostalgia while also being a great take on the Wild West to boot.",

        "description": "Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, while technically ambitious with its weather systems, aircraft physics, and global photogrammetry, can be both intimidating for newcomers and liberating for veterans migrating over from PC. \n\nFor the former, it means jumping into a cockpit that feels like an unsolvable puzzle; for the latter, it\u2019s breaking old habits by re-learning workflows and interfaces. \n\nThe good news for both is that once you get your bearings, the PS5 version is the same aviation sandbox PC players have enjoyed for decades.",
