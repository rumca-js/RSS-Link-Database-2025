I can not find a full schematic. I mean it is product which is so widely used. Millions of diy projects run on these boards. But they do not publish the schematic? It would be so easy to be able to look things up. For example I wanted to know is the USB Otg port directly connected I have to dig through several webpages. And still do not have real answer. There is a reversed engineered schematic. Which shows a direct connection. But why do you have to reverse engineer a board that is meant to be for diy projects? Second I want to know how much power can the 5v or 3v3 output deliver. It is a common problem for when you want to power external HW without creating a new supply for it. You could imagine they would publish this data? No way of course it has to be reverse engineered. And you still do not have a reliable answer. It might deliver 50",

It uses a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W running RetroPie inside a fully custom 3D-printed case. The case screws together and includes mounts for the PCBs, button mounts, and some wire management. It charges over USB-C and has audio output through either the built-in speakers or the headphone jack. This is the first Pi project I\u2019d consider <em>truly</em> finished, and I\u2019m super happy with how it turned out!</p> </div><!",
