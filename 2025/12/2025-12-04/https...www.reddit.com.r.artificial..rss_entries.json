I want to upload a pdf of a completed work order and I want Ai to take information from that work order and populate it onto an invoice template.

Measure the total time that I spend with manual plan creation VS. The time that an Ai needs 2. the implementation time of an Ai agent (prompting, programming, api, data etc) 3. Create a cost-benefit-calculation with the information from 1 and 2 4.

A lot of companies have turned to using AI as customer service help but it has many issues that can render it completely useless like being unable to grasp complex issues, questions, simply sending you a link to solve issues, or not understanding what you are communicating. Often times when you have issues with the AI customer service you are almost completely unable to get in contact with an actual person who can help and or are told to do the same things over and over again by the bot.
