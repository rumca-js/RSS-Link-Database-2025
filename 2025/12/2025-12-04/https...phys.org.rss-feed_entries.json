        "description": "Weed control is essential in apple orchards because weeds compete with trees for nutrients, water and sunlight, which can reduce fruit yields. However, physically removing weeds is not only labor-intensive, but it also can damage soil structure and tree roots. Using chemical sprays to kill weeds can lead to other problems, such as pollution, herbicide resistance and excess chemical residues on apples.",

The switch operates by forming and breaking silver atomic filaments when a voltage is applied and reversed, corresponding to the \"on\" and \"off\" states. This method enables the scalable integration of molecular components, paving the way for ultra-compact and energy-efficient circuits built from single molecules.",

One of the most well-studied cellular responses is how they react during times of stress, such as when the temperature gets too high or there aren't enough nutrients around to sustain activity. When this happens, cells gather strands of RNA and proteins into stress granules, dense clumps of material generally known as biomolecular condensates.",

One way to enhance the sensitivity of MRI is dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), where target molecules for imaging are modified so they form clearer images when scanned with an MRI machine. But this technique requires special crystalline materials mixed with polarizing agents that are difficult to create.",
