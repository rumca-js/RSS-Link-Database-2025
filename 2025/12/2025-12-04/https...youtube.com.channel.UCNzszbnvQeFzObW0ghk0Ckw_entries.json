        "description": "This is the hunt for the only known 1969 Pontiac 2+2 convertible to leave the factory with a Corvette-spec 427 and a four-speed\u2014born in Canada, hiding Chevy bones under Pontiac skin, and scattered across an Alberta farm in coffee cans. We follow the trail from my dad\u2019s bubble-top Parisienne to a barn-find basket case, through mirrored Protect-O-Plate forensics, lost-and-found VIN tags, and an eight-year, concours-level resurrection that dyno-verifies 390 honest horsepower.\n\nIf you love deep cuts\u2014Canadian tariffs, Wide-Track myths, Chevy chassis in Pontiac clothing, NOS treasure hunting, and the moment a ghost car rolls back into the light\u2014this one pays off. Stick around to the end to see the \u201cHoly Grail Pontiac\u201d reborn and the paper trail that proves it existed at all.\n\nFree Sample of my Book on the Spectrum: https://amzn.to/3zBinWM\n\nCode: https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/retropad\n\nBlack Friday Affiliate Links!!
