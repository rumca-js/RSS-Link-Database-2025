No one asked beforehand, and there was zero training. I did my best and was able to use them with the students, but with mixed results. I encouraged original creations and not just downloading .stl files. A few years later, at a different school, 2 Formlabs 3+ machines showed up. Again, no one asked. I imagine a salesperson just reached out and said they could put together a great deal as the printers were being discontinued. Did my best to figure them out, and used them with the students as well.</p> <p>Now a couple of years into this, I still have the Formlabs printers, and there are some FDM printers in a storage closet that no one is using. I don&#39;t even know if they work. I find it difficult to work 3D printing into my classes, even though my classes are design heavy and we work with a number of different solid modelling",
