We both like books that explain in an age appropriate way what&#39;s normal for your body and mind to go through while developing into an adult. Recently she has expressed to me that she holds a lot of anger towards peers at school. Without divulging too much, I explained anger is a normal feeling and especially for her age group with puberty. Is there any book that addresses teenage anger and what&#39;s normal emotional development and warning signs of needing help? Google is only showing recommendations when there IS an issue. I just want to help her navigate emotions and how to develop good coping skills.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Is there any books that have a similar vibe to the Disney movie \u201cBrother Bear\u201d? Im needing to write a novel for my English degree and i really want to base it around my character (Caveman-like, animalistic), and he lives in post ice-age Canada. The setting and timeframe is the same as Brother Bear. I need to read a book and base my novel around it, but jt also needs to be university-grade writing.</p> <p>He follows the popular trope of being raised by wolves and defending himself against other creatures, very animalistic. Preferably books with detail and gore scenes, but its okay if not :) So any book following that sorta stuff would be appreciated!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/guppyinspaceship\"> /u/guppyinspaceship </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pdkzyu/i_need_inspiration/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksugges",

I\u2019m looking for something set in a fantasy or medieval world with a male lead and the female character in a position of power like a knight or something.
