Combat looks crunchy and visceral, and it sounds like Liquid Swords is going for an oppressive atmosphere. &quot;Samson is built on a simple, brutal truth: every day costs you,&quot; writes the studio in a press release. &quot;Debt grows with interest, and time works against you. Each job burns a limited pool of Action Points and every decision shifts how the city treats you\u2014there are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></sp",

Spinning out as its own brand, Antigravity\u2019s debut drone is a big swing: a three-piece set with a drone that captures 8K 360-degree video, FPV goggles and a motion controller.</p> \n<p>Challenging the dominance of DJI\u2019s (many!) consumer drones is a big ask. Antigravity\u2019s approach is to play to its strengths in 360-degree video and smartphone-first editing. A lot of the appeal comes from how the A1 captures 8K video in all directions, meaning you can edit, cut and swap around your footage \u2014 and hopefully rarely miss a moment you\u2019re trying to document. It\u2019s a lot of fun, too, if you can get through the early teething issues, updates and the learning curve.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n <core-commerce id=\"fee4f635795",
