Basically, it&#39;s an IR system that indexes all the files on your PC and then you can search for key terms and stuff like that (like a search engine but for your files). The good thing is that it doesn&#39;t just search file names but the actual content. I think it&#39;s more for companies but definitely recommend checking it out.<br/> (Dev said he&#39;s happy to let people test it for feedback)</p> <p><a href=\"https://hirmes.webflow.io/\">https://hirmes.webflow.io/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/itsafoxi\"> /u/itsafoxi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1phmhlj/search_the_content_of_your_files/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1phmhlj/search_the_content_of_your_files/\">[comments]</a></span>",
