So I wrote a script called <strong>ZenExport</strong>.</p> <p>It basically acts like a &quot;Super Save&quot; button:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Time Machine:</strong> It saves your source files (<code>.f3d</code> &amp; <code>.step</code>) into versioned folders (<code>v01</code>, <code>v02</code>...) so you never lose history.</li> <li><strong>Auto-STL:</strong> It exports every body in your design as an individual <code>.stl</code> automatically (great for slicing).</li> <li><strong>Visuals:</strong> It takes a snapshot of your viewport so the folder has a thumbnail.</li> </ol> <p>It&#39;s free and open source. Just wanted to share it with the community in case it saves someone else a headache! \ud83e\uddd8</p> <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/EsKay-Labs/ZenExport\">https://github.com/EsKay-Labs/ZenExport</a></p> </d",
