I have been using the site for the past two weeks to download just about a terabyte of media. I have not had any problems thus far and decided to look up on Reddit what others thought of the site as far as specific file types go. I ended up coming across a post on this subreddit like ~66 fays ago that said how the site wasn\u2019t good anymore but again I\u2019ve downloaded about like a terabyte of videos and have not had any problems. What am I missing? The site seems to work fine for me. Someone else mentioned how it was bought out but again I haven\u2019t had any problems so I don\u2019t see what the issue is.
