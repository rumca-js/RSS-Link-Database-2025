        "description": "Skate Story is worth checking out if you want a skateboarding experience with an excellent trick system and responsive controls, but also incredibly out there with its narrative and atmosphere. \n\nYou wouldn't think a trash bag could serve as a complex labyrinth of perpetual blazes or that the path to Bagelworld could be so treacherous, but if you leap, these and many other wondrous sights await.",

        "description": "We all have that moment watching a game trailer that makes us gasp in awe. Some of the most memorable of these moments are with franchises we\u2019re already familiar with. Seeing a sequel that you had lost all hope in seeing finally getting a trailer is electrifying, and it\u2019s that feeling that inspired our list. \n\nThese are the games that stir up nostalgia, or simply the promise of unrealized potential. Whether it\u2019s Sony ignoring the cries for Bloodborne 2, EA refusing to budge on Titanfall 3, or Dino Crisis sitting dormant while fans beg for a revival, each of these titles represents a \u201cwhat if\u201d that could instantly dominate the gaming conversation.",
