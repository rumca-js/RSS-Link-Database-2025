It was a light-hearted co-operative party game where you draw cards and based on those you determine various categories by which you have to rank or describe some objects, as far as I can remember. So for example, you would have to describe a given thing by its weight, monetary value, top speed etc. If the guesser gets it right I think you proceed along some kind of scoring track. Anyone know what I&#39;m talking about?

I&#39;ve started to get really into board games past &quot;monopoly/game of life&quot; arc and started researching and hunting down games with more substance (I&#39;ll always love you GOL). That being said I have SPLURGED on some games and now have a fair catalog. My newfound issue is my family LOVES the games I get and some of them have some size to them such as Marvel Champions, hot streak, Cascadia and not including some upcoming wants (looking at you wingspan) </p> <p>I&#39;ve done the Amazon &quot;board game bags&quot; and saw the $60 Allplay bags that had high reviews but are they really the best? Obviously it depends on what games and box size, but from my understanding is there&#39;s usually an objective top 3 of a product. So excited to see what everyone proposes, is allplay the GOAT, or is there some hidden gem I don&#39;t know about? Thank you all!</p> </div><",

And i simply love the game story and aestetics. I am person who generally loves rpgs and coop story telling games. I play Gloomheaven, Mansions of Madness, Arkham Horror, i pledged Lands of Evershade etc. I would love to have Mice and Mystics in my collection but i just can get past the fact that everything depends on dice. I am okay with some amount of rng but i also want strategy and control. For example in Gloomhaven you choose your attacks but then there is attack modifier which can be good bad or nothing or in rare occasion totally cancel your attack, and that&#39;s okay, but mostly it will be somewhere around what i planned. In Mansions of madness, you roll the dice, but then you can spend your earned clue tokens to do some dice mitigation. In Arkham Horror, you can use some items to reroll, but in general you need to roll only one 5 or 6 ",

You enjoyed the decisions and gameplay however it takes three to four hours. Turns took too long. Analysis Paralysis everywhere. You vow to never play it again because of total game time, but you think about the game from time to time because something interesting was there. </p> <p>About a year ago I played a game and rated it pretty low. Then I played it again and it was a complete different experience. Since that day, I&#39;ve tried really hard to not fairly rate a game unless I play it at least twice. Same goes for me when I think about first time game length &amp; how that impacts my experience. </p> <p>Also, I know there are people out there that have played what I&#39;d call a heavy game 10+ times and have game times down to around an hour for awesome games like Feast for Odin or Ark Nova. Both games I&#39;ve heard sometimes take 3-4+ hours. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",
