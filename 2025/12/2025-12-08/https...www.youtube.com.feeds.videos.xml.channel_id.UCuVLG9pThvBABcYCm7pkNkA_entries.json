        "description": "#sponsored With holiday food shopping ramping up, here\u2019s a cozy little reminder that the 'expiration dates' on your groceries are not actually indicators for when your food goes bad. They're legally required to be on food, and it's causing our nation's moms to throw out perfectly good food.

Plus, it keeps a bunch of dangerous gases out of our atmosphere.
