I have a large set of keywords and exceptions I need to filter out to reduce the amount of noise. </p> <p>But it&#39;s hard to get a good grasp of just how exactly various reader apps implement this. Would anyone be willing to share a screenshot here of how the UI and functionality works? </p> <p>For example, this is Inoreader:</p> <p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/27vnFFcL\">https://ibb.co/27vnFFcL</a></p> <p>I have a filtering rule here to remove (really, &quot;mark as read&quot;) articles where the title matches any of my regex. In others, I have it remove articles that do <em>not</em> match a regex list <em>OR</em> do match a second regex list. </p> <p>But simply by reading official documentation, I&#39;m not clear on if this type of filtering is possible on other apps. Some apps suggest you can filter &quot;searches&quot",
