It involves editing the DNA of donor immune cells to make them resistant to chemotherapy and able to target cancer cells. \n\nThe same technology has been used to treat other illnesses, including sickle cell disease and may have potential to reverse other forms of cancer.  \n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a series of recent breakthroughs using new forms of gene therapy to modify DNA.   Recent successes have lead to new treatments for Huntingdon\u2019s disease and Hunter syndrome. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
