The caption, \u201ctokyo times on tour and more\u201d, was vague in the way bold announcements often are. The emoji selection \u2014 hearts, flowers, soft smiles \u2014 did the rest of the heavy lifting. Trudeau, for his part, had already warmed the public to the idea by sharing a photo of the two with Japan\u2019s former prime minister and his wife. It was the sort of diplomatic cameo that would have looked routine if not for the unmistakable sense that something more was happening beyond the frame.",
