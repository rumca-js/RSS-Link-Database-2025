It was slow, repetitive, and honestly burned me out.</p> <p>Out of that frustration, I built an AI tool to automate the whole thing. You open the job posting tabs you are considering, the system reads each one, uses your background as the anchor, and creates a tailored resume for every tab. If you have ten tabs open, you get ten tailored resumes without doing all the manual copying.</p> <p>Overall happy with the use of Gemini, but curious of others experience with generation costs. Seems cheaper and quicker than ChatGPT thus far.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wahoos-1\"> /u/wahoos-1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ph0ksq/using_ai_to_turn_my_background_into",
