I thought they fixed it, but lately every other prompt ends with me leaving and drleying chat in sheer frustration. I can live with constant &quot;hur dur, can&#39;t talk about sex&quot; for no reason, but it seems like it&#39;s not only getting lobotomised, it can&#39;t even remember what either of us was writing. I tried what I could, research mode, agent mode (to provide background info for the conversation), literally providing quotes and data myself... nope, it seems to forgets them completly, or not be able to follow simple instruction. Example: I provide timeline of events. Ask GPT to make a report up to point n in the timeline. It consistently goes past specified point. It seems consistent no matter which version I use. Am I crazy or are others having similar issues?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
