Ruben Amorim\u2019s side cruised to a comfortable win, navigating the briefest of scares after Wolves equalised but turned on the style after the interval. The visiting manager clenched his right fist when Mason Mount volleyed in to make it 3-1, building on goals by Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes, who also rounded off the scoring.</p><p>For Wolves, this was yet another demoralising defeat, a 13th in 15 league matches. The last time they tasted victory, in April, Matheus Cunha, who enjoyed his return to Molineux, opened the scoring. Nine fan groups protested against the Wolves owner Fosun by boycotting the first 15 minutes of the match. They voiced anger at the players, too. \u201cYou\u2019re not fit to wear the shirt,\u201d they sang, and later jeered J\u00f8rgen Strand Larsen when he was taken off.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/08/wolves-manchester-united-premier-leag",
