Maybe it&#39;s the adult me is more used to the size of a Steam Deck or Switch, but the small body of the original GBA isn&#39;t very comfortable to play with anymore. I 3D printed a shell at that scale and it&#39;s crazy how natural it feels. I&#39;m either doing a strict Gameboy compatibility, or adding 2 face buttons to include up to SNES. I think a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W will be just fine for what I&#39;m doing, right?</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for either a 3:2 or 4:3 display, roughly 5&quot; or 6&quot; diagonal.
