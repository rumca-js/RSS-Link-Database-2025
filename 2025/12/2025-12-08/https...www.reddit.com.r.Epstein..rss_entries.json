Nobody believed him at first but then he kept revealing crazier and crazier stuff. Some of the stuff he said makes sense with what has come to light. For example, he said that he was responsible for picking up the girls (as a driver) and that some of them were underage strippers (who probably did occasional sexual favors). It would make sense that Epstein would target girls with a checkered background to then turn it around on them (calling them prostitutes) should he ever be arrested. </p> <p>One thing from the 4Chan post which is giving me absolute chills was the story of the OP witnessing Epstein&#39;s chef preparing to cook something that looked like a baby pig. OP made a joke &quot;What is that, a child&quot;? and the chef gave him a glaring look back. He sai",
