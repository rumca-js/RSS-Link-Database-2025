        "description": "Every great sitcom has that one chaotic wildcard character, the kind of unpredictable scene-stealer who elevates every moment they\u2019re in. From Kramer in Seinfeld to Urkel in Family Matters to Charlie in It's Always Sunny, these larger-than-life personalities deliver the kind of comedic energy that keeps audiences coming back. But when it comes to perfecting this archetype, few characters do it better than Scrubs\u2019 legendary Janitor.\n\nWhether an episode was heartfelt, hilarious, or completely unhinged, The Janitor was always lurking somewhere in the halls of Sacred Heart, ready to derail JD\u2019s day with another unforgettable prank or bizarre conspiracy. But how exactly did this iconic character come to be? Would Scrubs have been the same without him? And the question fans have debated for years: did JD actually stick that penny in the door?\n\nOnly The Janitor knows for sure.\n\n#scrubs #shrinking #thejanitor #sitcom #nerdstalgic",
