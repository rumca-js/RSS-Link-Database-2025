        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>One of the biggest problems preventing some games - and professional software - from running on Linux is their requirements for extremely invasive DRM that refuses to be emulated on Linux. Since games and such communicate with the GPU directly could future GPUs have some sort of protected memory that contains a decryption or authentication key that can be used to run the software? It would allow for an approach that is OS agnostic. It would suck because it would make cracking the DRM harder and requires a new GPU with the TPM or whatever, but it would allow the software to run on Linux perfectly, remove the barrier preventing professional software like AutoCAD from being ported to Linux, and I guess improves the experience on Windows because they no longer need the invasive rootkit.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MaruThePug\"> /u/MaruThePug </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_",

I used linux mint for a very long time, but I switched to to latest Kubuntu because I couldn&#39;t get my AMD gpu working on mint. It&#39;s a fresh install with no NVIDIA residue, running Mesa 25.2.3 and manually installed ROCm 7 for blender support, kernel 6.17. Based on everything I&#39;ve read, that should be more than enough to meet the software requirements for the rx 9000 series.</p> <p>I booted up Hogwarts Legacy to test it out since I happened to still have it installed, and to my shock having ray tracing enabled even on the lowest settings made the game totally crawl to an unplayable degree (while totally fine on ultra settings without ray tracing), whereas my 3080-ti had no trouble ray tracing on linux even at maximum.</",
