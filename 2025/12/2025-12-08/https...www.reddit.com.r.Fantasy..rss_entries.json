All these books appeal to me and I genuinely want to read or reread them.

Last week, I completed my third read, and it genuinely hurts me that this novel still doesn\u2019t receive the recognition it deserves.</p> <p>Things I Liked the Most</p> <ul> <li><p>A true progressive fantasy. Zorian (protoganist) doesn\u2019t level up magically overnight. He studies, fails, repeats, refines, and improves. It\u2019s character progression that actually makes sense.</p></li> <li><p>The protagonist is not the chosen one.</p></li> <li><p>Time-loop mechanics is explained properly. Unlike most time-loop stories that rely on mystery or convenience, this one spells out its mechanics in a way that is coherent, structured, and believable.</p></li> <li><p>No romance. Personal preference, don&#39;t like half baked romance in my fan",

I only read first-person books, my brain just doesn\u2019t process anything else (maybe because I\u2019m dyslexic, idk). I love dual POV, but the FMC\u2019s POV is always my fave. I\u2019m obsessed with dark fantasy romance, heavily vampire-focused. Like\u2026 I LOVE the blood drinking, the intensity, all of it. I don\u2019t like reverse harem, monogamous dynamics are more my thing. I want something super spicy, but with a slow burn. If the characters are immediately hooking up in chapter one, I usually DNF. I NEED good world-building, a badass powerful FMC, and a morally grey/black MMC. Vampire romance is basically the only genre I\u2019ll touch at this point.</p> <p>Some of my favorites for reference: \u2022 Blood Orange + Black Sunshine by Karina Halle \u2022 Vampire Academy (I\u2019m a sucker for university settings) \u2022 Bound and Barbed by Samantha Goode (top-tier favorite) \u2022 Dark Fae and Zodiac Academy by Caroline Peckham \u2022 The Soo",
