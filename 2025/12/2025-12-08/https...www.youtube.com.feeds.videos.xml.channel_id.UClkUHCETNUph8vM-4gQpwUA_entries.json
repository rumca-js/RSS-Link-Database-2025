        "description": "Nightreign Forsaken Hollows All Classes Ranked - Best & Worst You NEED To Know! Classes Tier List\nIn this Elden Ring Nightreign video, we're going to be bringing you a tier list for the 10 Nightfarers currently in the game. It's going to be a bit different than the tier list we did before. The first tier list we did was mostly focused on how beginner-friendly each class was, as well as how effective it was. But as time has passed and new meters have become a thing, as you know, patches to the game have happened. There's quite a lot to unpack in terms of how good each class actually is at the moment.\n\nElden Ring Nightreign Wiki: https://eldenringnightreign.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Nightreign+Wiki\n\nTimestamp:\n0:00 The Forsaken Hollows Classes Tier List\n0:37 C Tier\n3:48 B Tier\n7:07 A Tier\n11:11 S Tier\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Fextralife/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Fextralif",
