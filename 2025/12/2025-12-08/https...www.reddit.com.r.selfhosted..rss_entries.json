I think there are programs out there for Windows/Mac to restore bitrot easily if it is on two different places but is it relatively easy and functional? Actually I would have to make two copys so the program could differentiate if one is of, otherwise it couldn&#39;t tell wich one has bitrot right?</p> <p>So is this possible?

How well does it integrate with Woodpecker CI? Do I want to rewrite my workflow?</p> <p>Furthermore, Is Fogejo&#39;s community activity trustworthy? I don&#39;t currently have many repositories in my self-hosted Gitea instance, if it&#39;s difficult to migrate to the latest version, is it recommended to reinstall Fogejo?
