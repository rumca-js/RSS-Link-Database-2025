        "description": "Paramount Skydance launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. at $30 a share in cash on Monday, just days after the company agreed to a deal with Netflix Inc. The offer values Warner Bros. at $108.4 billion, including debt, compared with Netflix\u2019s offer of $27.75 in cash and stock. Both bids raise significant antitrust concerns, however, underscored by multibillion-dollar breakup fees the parties have offered, and both companies have been laying the groundwork to win over the White House. Both bidders are also likely to face an extended review by regulators all over the globe. Bloomberg's Felix Gilette and Geetha Ranganathan joined Matt Miller and Carol Massar on 'Bloomberg Businessweek Daily' to break it down. (Source: Bloomberg)",

While a cut is all but certain, traders are growing anxious about next year\u2019s interest-rate path.\nThe S&P 500 dipped Monday after the equities benchmark closed within spitting distance of an all-time high. Uncertainty over the pace of easing in 2026 and wariness about the sustainability of an AI-driven rally tempered sentiment. US stocks had rebounded in recent weeks after some Fed officials signaled they intend to cut rates for a third straight time on Wednesday.

Live from London, we set the agenda for your day, catching you up with overnight markets news from the US and Asia. And we'll tell you what matters for investors in Europe, giving you insight before trading begins.\n\nOn today's show, President Donald Trump says he\u2019s disappointed in Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s handling of a US proposal to end the war that began with Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Investors begin to focus on the Federal Reserve, with Chair Jerome Powell expected to push through another quarter-point interest-rate cut this week, despite growing unease among some policymakers that inflation remains too high. And JPMorgan CEO, Jamie Dimon, says Europe is facing a real problem as slow bureaucracy drives out business and innovation.\n\nToday's guest: Pilar Gomez-Bravo, Co-CIO of fixed income at MFA Investment Management.
