So far, Lenovo isn\u2019t notifying customers of how much it plans to raise prices, but reportedly will do so in January.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The na",

Except for a few years in Omaha, I\u2019ve lived in small rural communities almost all my life. It\u2019s actually not uncommon in my community to leave your car\u2014or home\u2014unlocked and to know all your neighbors by name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But things are different from the way they used to be. We\u2019ve had some close calls in the area with home break-ins and jail breakouts (which can be frightening if you\u2019re home alone at night). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I knew I needed to get serious about securing my home, I\u2019d been reluctant to go high-tech. After all, I live in an area that frequently loses power during bad weather and struggles to maintain good internet connectivity, which means app-based solutions can sometimes leave me in limbo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading toc\" id=\"giving-smart",
