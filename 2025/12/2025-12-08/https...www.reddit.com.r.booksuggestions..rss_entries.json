Like if they all grew up on the same street or in the same apartment building, or went to the same school, and how the formative experience of being in this place stays with them throughout their lives.

Try to suggest some books that are easily available in hard copy, since we don\u2019t get much books where I live except for the popular ones, otherwise soft copy is also fine.</p> <ol> <li><p>A psychological suspense thriller \u2013 a book that builds the suspense from first page and with plot twists that keep me hooked to it and cannot put it down for one sec.</p></li> <li><p>I need an erotica but with a proper storyline. I don\u2019t need the sexual element to be there just for the sake of making it erotica. I should have a proper story around it. It does not have to have a happy ending I am fine with a sad ending as well. Also, if it is story based on revenge and regency era that would be great. Something along the lines of phantom of the opera is also acceptable.</p></l",
