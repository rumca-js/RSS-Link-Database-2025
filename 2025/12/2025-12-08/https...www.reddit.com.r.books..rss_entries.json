O Henry has written a variety of short stories, many of which I&#39;ve had the pleasure of reading since childhood. This one, The Cop and The Anthem, is as humorous as it is satirical, a touch poignant, and a touch allegorical. I find the use of language extremely easy to read and follow, there isn&#39;t really any particularly deep setting to get lost in, but still enough of it to build a stage, a scene, where a theatrical act, perhaps a mime, is carried out in written words by the author. Adding to that, the imagery and the personification and other literary devices used to describe the house of All Outdoors is such a treat - fun and marvelous at the same time. </p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">The story follows a man planning his survival strategy for the harsh winter, and how he cops out of a responsible way of living.

Hill has finally followed in his dad&#39;s footsteps and produced his own magnum opus. This 850-pager sprawls over decades and follows a group of friends who, through some arcane processes, bring a dragon into the world...that demands regular sacrifices.</p> <p>Overall, I really enjoyed it. When the storytelling seems like it slows down WHOMP we&#39;re put right into the middle of a car chase. When there&#39;s not enough mystery, suddenly we introduce more elements in a bit of a magic quest. King-like heartbreak? Yep, that&#39;s in there too. Although I put a spoiler tag on this, that&#39;s more for the comments - I don&#39;t enjoy spoiling it for anyone. I will say that there are a few Stephen King Easter eggs in here, but that Hill stands on his own.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; ",
