Here's our list of Nominees for Game of the Year 2025.\nThis was the year when the wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong finally ended, and proved that good things really do come to those who wait. But 2025 was just as much about fresh faces as it was long-awaited sequels, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from new studio Sandfall Interactive being the topic of at least half of all gaming conversation for most of the year. \n\nMake sure to check back throughout the week starting on Monday, December 15. Throughout the week, we will announce the winners of our Best Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo game awards. This week of awards will culminate on Friday, December 19, when we will reveal IGN\u2019s Game of the Year.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #GameOfTheYear2025",

Thanks to emerging technology such as Meta Human Generator and Unreal Engine 5, Tarantino was able to not only create the missing chapter of Kill Bill, Yukis Revenge, but also take the first step in the future of film making. \nWe sat down with Epic\u2019s CTO, Kim Libreri, Josh Wassung, Founder The Third Floor, and Pat Tubach, VFX Supervisor at Epic Games where they told us all about how they convinced Quentin Tarantino to make a movie in Fortnite, his directing style, and why this new technology opens doors for filmmakers of all budgets.",
