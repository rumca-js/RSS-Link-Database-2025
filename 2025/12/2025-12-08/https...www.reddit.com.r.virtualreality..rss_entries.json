I do SteamVR, UEVR, sims, other mods, 2D-&gt;3D conversions etc using either Quest 3 or Pico 4 Ultra. I understand Pimax headsets must still use 566.36 but if the wireless ones (via Virtual Desktop, which I believe recently fixed an update bug) are actually now ok...or maybe one of the summer releases?</p> <p>Please post your experiences and recommendations, cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/slowcando\"> /u/slowcando </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1phrxwf/are_nvidia_drivers_past_56636_now_safe/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1phrxwf/are_nvidia_drivers_past_56636_now_safe/\">[comments]</a></span>",

May have seen me around, and with the steam frame launch I\u2019ll be posting some informative stuff every so often. This is a guide to how to use SteamVR meant for PCVR headsets like the index, vive pro, and vive, but much of it applies to other headsets too. I just wanted to post this before the steam frame comes out and I have to remake it from scratch.</p> <p>I made this guide to help people feel more comfortable and reduce friction in VR. It\u2019s also supposed to make you fully acquainted with SteamVR settings, how to use things like Desktop view so you don&#39;t have to take off your headset, how to get into VR quickly, and some ",

My guess is that it was the foveated rendering that made such a huge difference. Interestingly enough, I&#39;m not noticing much blurriness compared to a year ago. I suspect Steam Link increased the field of hi-res rendering a bit. Or maybe the periphery is rendered at a higher resolution nowadays. Or maybe my eyesight got worse and I&#39;m used to the blurriness...</p> <p>Anyway, I thought I would leave it here in case anyone is still struggling with poor performance in NMS.

Owl3D has more noticeable wrapping, while iw3 is a bit of a pain to set up.</p> <p>Once I got iw3 set up though, it looks amazing. I almost can\u2019t tell it\u2019s not native 3D, and the fact that it is being converted in real time is surreal to me. It works great with pictures, but most of all in videos and movies. To skip the iw3 web server I used a second screen in Virtual Desktop, full screened the local iw3 window, made the virtual display the middle one and enabled 3D. I still had the 2D movie playing on one side, but I made it small enough to the point it didn\u2019t bother me. Then I changed the environment to the dark cinema one and it was like having a private 3D movie theater.
