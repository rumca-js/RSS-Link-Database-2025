By rotating the environment, the boundaries of existence shift. What comes into view becomes real, and what slips away from sight fades into nothingness.\n\nTo solve puzzles you\u2019ll need to twist and turn the map, revealing hidden paths or making obstacles disappear simply by shifting your perspective. Anything concealed from your view is erased from reality. A wall that blocks your way can vanish, while a secret passage can suddenly emerge.\n\n#ps5 #ps5games #ps4 #ps4games",
