Despite the rise of modern tools like Playwright and Cypress, Selenium remains widely used across enterprises because of its flexibility, language support, and strong ecosystem.</p> <p>As a result, Selenium interview questions are asked at almost every automation testing interview, from entry-level to senior roles. Many candidates fail not because they lack experience, but because they memorize answers instead of understanding concepts.</p> <p>This article covers frequently asked Selenium interview questions with detailed explanations, along with practical interview tips to help you answer confidently and clearly.</p> <h1>\ud83d\udca1 Selenium Interview Tips (Read This First)</h1> <p>Before jumping into the questions:</p> <p>\u2705 Focus on concepts, not just syntax<br/> ",
