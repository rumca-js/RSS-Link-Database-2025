What\u2019s interesting is that the typical SEO performance indicators such as keyword rankings, impressions, AI visibility, and overall search presence continue to show improvement.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been able to explain the drop in traffic: Google AI Overviews and other AI-driven SERP features are absorbing a lot of top and mid funnel queries. That part makes sense.</p> <p>What I\u2019m struggling with is why bottom funnel conversions are dropping at a similar, and sometimes worse, rate.</p> <p>For example, one client is a university experiencing year-over-year declines in both site traffic and leads. Their primary CTAs are highly bottom funnel (\u201cTalk to Admissions,\u201d \u201cBook a Tour,\u201d etc.), and these actions require a user to actually visit the website.
