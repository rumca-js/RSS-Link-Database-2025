        "description": "Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa marked one year since the fall of al-Assad regime, praising those who fought, suffered, and rebuilt hope. \nHe framed the uprising as a historic liberation that restored Syria\u2019s dignity after decades of tyranny. He portrayed Damascus as the cradle of civilisation, now reclaiming its place after years of darkness. The President condemned the former regime for corruption, oppression, and dividing society through fear. He pledged a new era of justice, accountability, and national unity, with economic reforms and renewed international partnerships. He emphasised raising living standards, restoring state institutions, and committing to transitional justice for victims and the missing. Concluding, he urged Syrians to turn victory into responsibility through hard work to build a strong, leading nation.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck",
