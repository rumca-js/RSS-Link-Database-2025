        "description": "In the 20th century, we began to die slowly\u2014from our own biology, rather than predators or infections. Fast deaths are now the exception, not the rule. Today, some 45 million deaths a year owe to biological aging, and we treat these deaths as mostly inevitable. But what if they are not? What if preventing our newly slow deaths is a moral and economic imperative? \n\nDrawing on interviews with 102 scientists and original economic modeling, Dr. Romanni-Klein reveals why advancing the young science of aging may offer the highest social return of all possible investments in the life sciences. New advancements that redesign how we age and die as a species could soon make for the most impactful breakthrough in human history. If we could truly reverse biological aging, we\u2019d add trillions to GDP\u2014and more meaning to life.
