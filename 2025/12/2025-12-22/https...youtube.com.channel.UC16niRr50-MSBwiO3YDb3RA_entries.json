        "description": "The suspected gunmen in the Bondi Beach attack threw explosives at the start of the deadly incident and had practised shooting weeks before, according to new court documents.\n \nThey allege the pair \"meticulously\" planned the attack for several months and, two days prior to the shooting, visited Bondi for reconnaissance.\n \nFifteen people were killed and dozens more injured when two gunmen opened fire on a Hanukkah celebration on 14 December. Explosives, including a \"tennis ball bomb\", failed to detonate, according to the documents.\n \nNaveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of terror. A second gunman - his father, Sajid Akram - was shot dead by police at the scene.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Bondi #Australia #BBCNews",
