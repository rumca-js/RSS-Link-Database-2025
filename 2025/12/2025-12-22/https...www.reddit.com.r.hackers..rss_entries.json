        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all, just curious if this was a potential attack/scam. Things have been sorted, but I am curious how this might work. Recently went skiing and my cousin bought a locker with apple pay. There was a QR code that she scanned on a poster at the front to activate the locker. Anyways later that day the card was charged $900 at the mountain. We confirmed it\u2019s not a holding fee, no other purchases were made with the card, and the physical copy of the card is in a different state.</p> <p>I am very curious about what happened and would like to know more. It was my understanding that apple pay is very secure, and i\u2019m thinking hosting something malicious at the qr destination wouldn\u2019t be able to activate the locker. I didn\u2019t see the payment process so maybe it has a fake payment that goes to a failed screen to prompt the user to pay again? Seems risky at a nice resort. Any insight would be appreciated :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",
