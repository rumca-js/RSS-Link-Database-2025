After digging into the logs, the reason is clear: NetworkManager 1.52.1 is forcing periodic background scans that crash the supplicant.</p> <p>The Problem: Even if I try to disable background scanning, NetworkManager ignores the configuration and re-injects a default value: simple:30:-70:86400. Because my signal strength often sits around -71 dBm, this triggers a scan every 30 seconds.</p> <p>On the Raspberry Pi Broadcom hardware, these frequent scans eventually cause a firmware halt. The logs show: error: device (wlan0): Couldn&#39;t initialize supplicant interface: Name owner lost</p> <p>This indicates that wpa_supplicant has physically crashed. Once this happens, the device transitions to an unavailable state and stays there until the service is manually restarted.</p> <p>What I\u2019ve tried (ugly work-arounds that didn&#39;t work):</p> <p>Unsett",
