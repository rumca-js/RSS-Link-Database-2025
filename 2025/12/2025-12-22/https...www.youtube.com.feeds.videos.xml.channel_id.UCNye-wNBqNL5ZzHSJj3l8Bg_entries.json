        "description": "Nuked is a powerful film that examines the hidden legacy of United States nuclear weapons testing on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific - and its people. Through moving testimonies, rare archive and expert insight, it reveals how these Marshall Islanders were uprooted from their home under the false promise they\u2019d return, only to face radiation exposure, displacement and the loss of a centuries-old culture.\n\nFrom the devastation of the US military's Operation Crossroads in 1946 to the islanders\u2019 ongoing fight for recognition and justice, the film exposes government deception, biomedical experiments and a global pattern of Indigenous communities sacrificed in the cause of military ambition. Beyond the Pacific, the film traces parallel histories of nuclear testing across the world, its fallout crossing borders and generations. With climate change now threatening radioactive waste sites, this is a haunting history and a stark warning, a story the world cannot afford to forget.\n\n#nuclearweapons ",

Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov died when his vehicle exploded in the capital\u2019s Yasenevo district.\nSpeaking to Al Jazeera, military analyst Marina Miron said the killing appears to be an assassination rather than a battlefield death.\nShe said Ukrainian security services would be capable of targeting senior Russian figures inside Russia.\nMiron described Sarvarov as a key figure in training and preparing troops for the war in Ukraine.\nShe said eliminating such figures can weaken Russia at a strategic level and disrupt military planning.\nMiron added that replacing an experienced general during an active war would be difficult.\nShe said the attack also sends a psychological message to Russia\u2019s military leadership, creating fear among senior commanders.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https:",
