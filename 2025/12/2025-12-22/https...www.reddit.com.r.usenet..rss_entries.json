Anyways, before my trial expired I had mailed them regarding payment issues and they did respond. Now I have gotten the hold of payment and want to proceed but no one is responding to emails for the past week. In meantime the account got disabled and I cannot login. If anyone from ninjacentral is here and can help me it will be great as no one is responding to my emails for the past week.
