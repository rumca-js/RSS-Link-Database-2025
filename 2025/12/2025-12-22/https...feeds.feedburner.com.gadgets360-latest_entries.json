The compound stabilises crystal growth and buried interfaces, dramatically slowing heat- and light-driven degradation. Solar cells treated with the additive retained about 90% of their efficiency after 1,500 hours at 90\u00b0C, outperforming previous records. The approach is compatible with scalable manufacturing, bringing durable, low-cost perovskite photovoltaics closer to real-world use.",
