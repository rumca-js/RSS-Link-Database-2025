That was when Cricket Australia announced the schedule for the series: Perth first, Brisbane second. Starting the series on the bounciest, most Kryptonicious pitches in Australia \u2013 and the only major venues where England haven\u2019t won a Test since 1986-87 \u2013 was a masterstroke, especially as Australia also had a day-night advantage at the Gabba.
