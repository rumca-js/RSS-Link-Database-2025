I was thinking if it&#39;s the case of using the SIM Card lock feature and protect my two physical SIM cards with a passcode. Or it&#39;s not worth it? I am currently using an Android device running MagicOS 9.</p> <p>I get it, you receive extra protection and safety on SIM swapping attacks, but what if your phone gets stolen and the theft accidentally restarts the phone, well, the phone would require the PIN of the SIM card and cellular service won&#39;t turn on anymore without the code, so you cannot locate the phone anymore.</p> <p>So essentially, should I enable it or not? Thanks in advance!</p> <p>Edit 1: Forgot to mention but in my country at least, I can just immediately call the customer service of my network provider and cancel both numbers if anything.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/YetTooCurious\"> /u/YetTooCurious </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privac",

This is raising serious privacy and surveillance concerns. Digital communication in India isn\u2019t just casual it\u2019s where people discuss politics, religion, personal life, and dissent. Granting such broad access without strong, transparent safeguards feels like a dangerous expansion of state power. Tax enforcement matters, but mass access to private digital lives sets a worrying precedent especially in a country with weak data-protection enforcement. Curious to hear perspectives from the global privacy community: Is this normal enforcement, or a step toward normalized surveillance?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sahabaz\"> /u/sahabaz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1psys56/india_tax_",
