        "description": "Metal Gear Solid 3 was an already brilliant story thanks to the way Hideo Kojima used the art of cinema to present his characters and narrative beats in ways that made it classy.\n\nKonami's recent remake has done well to preserve all of the legendary storyteller's tricks from back in the day while also managing to modernize it, making it hit all the more harder and faster as a result. \n\nThe remake is thus the definitive way to enjoy the game, and does well to use modern hardware to improve on crucial aspects of the experience that make it shine as a beacon for future remakes. \n\nMetal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is pure cinema, and we're here to tell you how and why. Join us and relive a few memorable moments from the game, and see how the remake made them even better.",
