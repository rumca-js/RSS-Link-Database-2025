They are instead defaulting to sleep mode.</p> <p>I tried looking for a &quot;shut down&quot; option in the onscreen menu settings and was shocked to see that there doesn&#39;t seem to be one. Instead there is a &quot;restart&quot; option which is of course not what I want.</p> <p>What&#39;s the deal with this? This is clearly a deliberate decision on Meta&#39;s part, but what possible benefit is there to Meta or to anyone in making it more difficult/less intuitive to completely shut down Quest headsets?

My dad is never really been on a VR, but I\u2019m planning to give him the quest 2 so then me and him can play can I use the same account so I don\u2019t have to buy other games and can i use the same quest account on both vr headsets while playing at the same time also what are some good games me and my dad can play that I can show him the VR world and completely blow him away because I want him to be blown away so he uses it more and also is the quest 3 a big upgrade because I have no idea. I haven\u2019t done my research at all. This is my first time really asking this properly I saw it\u2019s the better VR headset but is it that much of an upgrade? And has anyone else done the step up from quest 2 and quest 3 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",

Im using iVRy to make it work and it works fine, no problems about that.</p> <p>The thing is that I never bought the PS Move controllers and I dont really want to buy them second hand, I tried using Wiimotes or smartphones with driver4VR but the fact that they are 3DoF and not 6DoF (position) makes games impossible to play for me. And I dont really know if is there any VR controller that can track its position by itself (If not, what do I need?)</p> <p>So, what good (on a reasonable budget) controllers can/should I get on Amazon that are compatible with SteamVR on PC?
