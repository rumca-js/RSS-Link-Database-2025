Looking for good recommendations in both those categories.</p> <p>Preference for strong female leads or not-totally-sexist male leads. Strong worldbuilding is a huge plus, and inherently flawed worlds and characters are a must.</p> <p>So far my list looks a little like Book of the Ancestor trilogy, Magician&#39;s Guild trilogy, Realm of the elderlings series, earthsea cycle, three body problem, ready player one andthe end of eternity.

I did every possible thing to get here but now i just do not put everything in any activity. I have done debates, moots, ADR competitions and it was humbling did not win any of the competitions but the experience was great. And I have been trying to write some articles this winter but I keep losing focus and have absolutely no motivation to do anythign, I love to put things off and simply go to sleep. All of this is affecting me because I was never like this. I have been a disciplined person and I think major role in it was of anxiety, parental and school pressure and expectations from teachers, peers etc",

I&#39;m looking for a book that my friend might like. </p> <p>I know she likes vampires and gothic atmospheres, she&#39;s a very big fan of Dracula (the film that came out last year), Frankenstein (yep the new film) and Twilight. Those are her vibes. The issue is that every time that she has recently tried to read something, she ended up DNFing it because the writing and story were too juvenile for her, she&#39;s looking for a more mature approach of things, a book written by adults for adults. Not necessarily explicit, more like mature. I put the &quot;horror&quot; tag because of the themes mentioned, but anything would work.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GhostInTheRiver\"> /u/GhostInTheRiver </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pt1pv0/looking_for_a_book_for_my_friend/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/b",

I always remember the bookshelf being an important part of my growing up and in general literacy and reading is an essential part of a child&#39;s development, so once my nephew is born I want to have something that he&#39;ll have when he gets to that age where he&#39;s reading more which will become more accessible as his reading grade increases. </p> <p>My favourites were the Horrible History books and a box set seems great. However as I&#39;ve grown up and read more, and as academia has updated and corrected, the Horrible Histories series is terribly inaccurate and apocryphal - to the point it&#39;s affected me because a lot of facts I memorized from childhood are no longer true. </p> <p>Has anyone heard of a series which is for children that is more current? I would be really grateful if any suggestions, even if they don&#39;t fit exactly into what I&#39;m lookin",

I am trying to find a novel similar to Pasternak\u2019s work Doctor Zhivago, however although the book was brilliant, I do wish there was more of an emphasis on Zhivago and Lara\u2019s romance. Any books with a romantic setting set in this wintery world/timeline?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/VariousObject6284\"> /u/VariousObject6284 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1psmnl5/trying_to_find_a_book_like_drzhivago/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1psmnl5/trying_to_find_a_book_like_drzhivago/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019m trying to find him some reads but kinda struggling lol so hoping you\u2019ll help!</p> <p>He wants mature stories that have simple language that\u2019s easy to comprehend. I was thinking if there are some teen or YA books that don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re for younger audiences? He\u2019ll def be self conscious about that </p> <p>I\u2019m thinking something along the lines of Red Rising or Eregon?
