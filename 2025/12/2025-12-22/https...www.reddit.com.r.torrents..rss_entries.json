I\u2019ve tried looking up stuff about this issue, and read that it\u2019s possible that my internet bandwidth is being used up. I don\u2019t think that this is the case because I\u2019ve downloaded 100GB+ torrents in the past and haven\u2019t had this issue and also my download speeds aren\u2019t super fast, typically averaging about 2MiB per second. I tried limiting my download speeds on the client but it didn\u2019t seem to change anything. Could this be an issue with my qBitTorrent settings or is it likely a greater issue with my PC/internet?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi",
