Before Proton, Linux usage was 2% or even less. When Proton appeared, at the end of 2025, which is where we are today, Linux already has almost 4% global usage, myself included. Proton was a game-changer for those who weren&#39;t switching to Linux because of gaming. Now imagine if Canva created an Affinity Runtime, the percentage would jump from 5% to 10%, if not more. in my case, Affinity with Wine works wonderfully, with the sole exception that the stylus doesn&#39;t work. But Wine is already solid enough, 90% usable. If they don&#39;t want to make an Affinity for Linux, someone from the Affinity team could easily develop an official Wine customized for Affinity, so they don&#39;t have to update three ecosystems. It&#39;s cheaper, and that&#39;s what Steam misunderstood: &quot;I can&#39;t force developers to develop for Linux, but I can invite them",

It&#39;s a low end laptop HP Pavilion dv6. I set it up with Linux Mint because its easy to use and I set it with XFCE to keep it light. It is kinda a good thing I set this puppy with Linux because my class requires that I need virtualization for Linux, but I already have one now, so that&#39;s a good thing. Most applications I can manage with the GUI Software Store, but if I ever need to delve deeper, I can always use the terminal to get what I need. Only thing now is what file and file extension I need to use to submit work in </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

I also tested auto-cpufreq, which is supposed to be better for battery optimization. Result: 46% \u2192 36% in 18 minutes \u2014 same issue, ~2 minutes \u2248 1% drain.</p> <p>On Windows:</p> <p>\u00b7 Setup: Light tasks + occasional idle, \u201cBest Performance\u201d power mode \u00b7 Result: 77% \u2192 72% in 20 minu",
