This is not science fiction \u2014 it\u2019s a looming reality. One-third of all shark and ray species are threatened with extinction, and their loss could have catastrophic consequences for marine ecosystems, ocean health, and human survival.\n\nIn this compelling TEDx talk, Louisa Graf, a graduate researcher at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, explains why these often misunderstood creatures are critical for keeping oceans alive. From apex predators to overlooked mesopredators like fiddler rays, Louisa shares her research tracking these species and reveals how their disappearance could unravel the marine food web, affecting fisheries, recreation, and the balance of ocean life.\nIf you care about marine conservation, biodiversity, and a healthy planet, this talk is essential viewing. \n\nWatch now to understand why protecting sharks and rays isn\u2019t just about saving wildlife",

She explains how punitive drug policies fuel mass incarceration, unsafe drug use, and overdoses, while also damaging ecosystems through practices like aerial forest spraying in Colombia.\n\nThis talk reframes drug policy as both a human rights issue and an environmental issue \u2014 showing why moving toward harm reduction and regulated drug markets is essential for people and the planet.\nProfessor Seear challenges us to think differentl",

        "description": "Ever sat at a red light at 2 am on an empty street and wondered: What am I waiting for? Our cities were built like machines \u2014 rigid, inefficient, and disconnected. They consume 80% of the world\u2019s resources and produce 70% of emissions. But what if cities could behave more like living systems, adaptive and interconnected like organisms?\n\nIn this visionary TEDx talk, Professor Tuba Kocaturk from Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia, explores how nature-inspired urban design and circular city principles can transform our cities into thriving, sustainable hubs. From sharing solar energy in one city to turning coffee waste into mushrooms in Paris, Professor Kocaturk demonstrates how urban environments can become circular, adaptive, and alive \u2014 turning waste into resources and energy flows into life-giving networks.\n\nThis talk shows why urban sustainability, adaptive city planning, and circular design are essential for the future of our communities. Watch now to discover how cities can",

        "description": "The climate crisis doesn\u2019t affect everyone equally. In this TEDx talk, Alessia Boni examines how climate impacts intersect with gender, privilege, and inequality. While most global data still treats gender as binary, it\u2019s essential to recognize that non-binary and gender-diverse people face climate risks that remain largely undocumented. Within these limits, the talk highlights how women and girls are disproportionately affected \u2014 from rising poverty and displacement to increased exposure to gender-based violence \u2014 and why inclusive, gender-responsive climate action is crucial for a more just, resilient future. Alessia, laureata in Relazioni Internazionali e Studi Europei, lavora al Consolato Generale Britannico in Italia. Ha partecipato a forum ONU su diritti umani e parit\u00e0 di genere, con esperienza nella cooperazione internazionale e nella tutela delle donne in comunit\u00e0 vulnerabili.

This might be due to various reasons, such as socioeconomic concerns, complacency in our ability to explore space, or a perceived lack of effort to push our boundaries. As humanity innovates to delve deeper into the mysteries of the Universe and prepares to work and eventually live beyond Earth's immediate vicinity, this talk examines the return on investment and the tangible benefits of our endeavors, especially as the costs of exploration grow beyond that of a simple \"collective cup\" of coffee.

Introducing his lineage, he spoke about the Kalakbindan Lucknow Gharana, sharing its unique nuances, discipline, and aesthetic depth.\n\nWhat made the talk especially engaging was its interactive nature\u2014from rhythmic counting exercises to demonstrating playful elements like Snakes and ladder, allowing students to experience Kathak not just as spectators but as participants.
