They were all just regular people and i didn\u2019t really understand what was \u201cwrong\u201d about them. I recently came across this trend again but this time the comments were FILLED with screenshots of queer people, shaming them for their looks. This was pretty disturbing to me, but I also noticed that most of the pictures were of alt queer people. They were basically being shamed for having piercings and dyed hair. Is this just another way to influence kids into being conservative through hateful humour?

My parents do not know im trans, and they aren&#39;t the most open people. I was thinking if she messed up to say my preferred name was just a nickname but have no idea how I can make up a story for that since my deadname is very different from it \ud83d\ude2d so does anyone have any suggestions of what I could say to my parents if she does mess up?
