My URL tags seem fine and the URL path mapped to this template is also correct. My initial guess was that the view function I am using to render this template did not have anything related to how it would handle forms with the POST method as one is used in this template. However, the view function does handle forms with the POST method yet the template still does not render. The URL name I have used in the url tags is correct, the view function used to render this template has the correct logic (I think) and the URL path defined is also correct. What else could be the issue here causing this error? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Formal_Engineer_6901\"> /u/Formal_Engineer_6901 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ptcy3l\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/c",
