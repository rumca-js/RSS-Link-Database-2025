But I never really cared about any of that, I just dig his writing. His stories float somewhere between hard and soft sci-fi, depending on when you catch him in his career... his earliest books feature sentient machines, convincing holograms, exotic bio-implants. The latest have a sort of time-travel and nanotech. In between, we have nothing more magical than VR heatsets and drones.</p> <p>He&#39;ll casually mention things, in a seemingly throwaway sentence, that makes you imagine whole alternate realities, structures that ",

To each their own, if you didn&#39;t like it, you didn&#39;t like it. And if you loved it you loved it. And ofc you have people who are kinda in the middle. I wondered why people disliked something that someone else enjoyed? What affected which books were enjoyable.</p> <p>I dont think book taste is just what you like reading. I think it is caused by a lot of things. For example, what books you read as a child/ beginner reader. Specifically the ones you enjoyed. The ones that caught your attention immediately. You might gravitate towards that genre. </p> <p>As we read more and come across more books I think our book taste change based on what&#39;s important to us. Do you enjoy the plot more than the cha",

And now I have a third best favorite in &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot;.</p> <p>In this one follows a group of people on the Lunar penal colony starting a revolution with the help of a self aware super computer. Again Heinlein touches on the familiar theme of personal responsibility and political freedom, and a constant one also, even including themes of the ever changing definitions of humanity and technology. And is where the phrase TANSTAAFL, &quot;There ain&#39;t no such thing as a free lunch&quot;.</p> <p>How Heinlein wrote the book is particularly interesting to me. The story is told through the perspective of Manuel, who works as a computer tech and lives in the lunar penal colony. He sounds Russian when he speaks, even though his name doesn&#39;t sound Russian at all.</p> <p>Sometimes",

Because this amused me but doesn&#39;t fall into a proper category so standalone post it is. </p> <p>So picture me a few weeks ago, a virtuous book lover getting ready for bed Saturday night. I had had a nice lazy day lounging around with whatever book I was reading or rereading at the time and I&#39;d visited the library sale in the afternoon where of course I intended to pick up just a book or two but wound up with like twenty. It was a good deal and I like supporting my local library, it&#39;s fine. </p> <p>So I&#39;ve turned out the lights in my bedroom and am just about to hop into bed when I notice a strange glow coming from the side table next to my reading chair. Issue with the blackout curtains being drawn? Don&#39;t want a gap to get me in the morning. </p> <p>So I go over to investigate and it turns out to be my newly acquired hardcover copy of <em>Mr. Penumbra&#3",

K\u2019Wan in particular is a favorite of mine due to the Western influence his works tend to have, with triggermen being referred to as \u201cgunslingers\u201d and plenty of references towards cowboys and Western movies. I believe K\u2019wan excels at analyzing the American Old West mythology to help readers understand the American reality (namely, the experience of Black Americans in the ghetto).</p> <p>This isn\u2019t exactly \u201chighbrow\u201d fiction, but it\u2019s extremely fun and I don\u2019t see much discourse here about this genre of literature. Granted, the audience that reads these books may not be the majority on Reddit, but I know a lot of people would appreciate gangster stories from the less organized side of things. </p> <p>Eve was another excellent novel by K\u2019wan.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",
