Lagident.</p> <p>The idea is, to run lagident on one (or better multiple) computers in your network to identify weak and poor quality connections. By taking measurements from multiple points, it is easier to identify if you are dealing with a bad network card, a broken switch or router.</p> <p>In my case I had issues while online gaming with my desktop PC, but I wasn&#39;t sure about the root cause. So i created lagident to find the issue in my network (it was a bad driver for my network card).</p> <p>Today i have all my network devices monitored by Lagident. For example if i move my Router, i can see if this decreases the Wifi quality for my Smart-TV. </p> <p>Please see the GitHub repo for screenshots.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/nook24/lagident\">https://github.com/nook24/lagident</a></p> <p>Happy holidays!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitte",
