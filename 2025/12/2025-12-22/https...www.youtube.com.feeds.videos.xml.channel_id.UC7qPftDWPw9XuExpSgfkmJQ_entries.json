        "description": "A 90s CD-ROM based on The Snowman sounds wholesome; until you remember the story ends with a melted corpse in a garden. This PC edition came with a beanie toy; ran on a 486; and hit you with a MIDI version of \u201cWalking in the Air\u201d before letting you replay every emotional beat in 320\u00d7240 AVI. Dress James; build a snowman; play mini-games; and then watch him melt all over again. A perfect slice of festive nostalgia for anyone who grew up both loving and fearing this Christmas classic.\n\n#90s #RetroTech #PCGaming #TheSnowman #ChristmasNostalgia #CDROM #VintageComputing #WalkingInTheAir #OldPCGames",
