So far, I&#39;ve compared the two, and to get a pretty comparable style (table with topper, box for topper, a few cupholders and tray bits, shipping to Canada), the Jasper 3.0 Long comes out to about $2750 USD and the Kingswood 4x6 $2250 USD. I&#39;m open to other tables too, but most tables either don&#39;t have the size that I want (4x6-ish ideally), don&#39;t double as a dining table well, or are prohibitively expensive.</p> <p>For those experienced with either of these tables or any gaming tables in general, I&#39;d love to know your thoughts on a couple questions:</p> <ol> <li><p>Sturdiness of the table: I&#39;ve read that the Jasper isn&#39;t super sturdy while Kingswood is.</p></li> <li><p>Quality of components: It sounds lik",

Everytime i put Detective City of Angels on the table, no matter if with non-gamers or more experienced boardgamers, people get deeply invested and i absolutely love that. For a euro type game i would need more experienced players. City of Angels is able to get players very invested and speculate without demanding much understanding of mechanics or rules. It creates an atmosphere very quickly. And there is enough depth for nothing to be obvious. Its also harder in german because the translation can be a bit misleading at times.</p> <p>Anyways i wanted to ask if you guys could suggest me games that are similar in immersion, low weight and relatively high depth compared to that low weight. It does not matter if its a detective game, or a narrative game, as long as the immersion is this strong.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fieser_Factsack\"> /u/Fieser_Factsa",
