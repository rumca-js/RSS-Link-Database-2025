I recently set my eyes on 3.5&quot; 4TB WD Red /Red Plus Drives, and am thinking about buying two in the future for a medium-long term solution to my storage needs.</p> <p>I have a laptop so, to my understanding, I either need an enclosure or a docking station in order to use the HDD.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am running Macs across multiple locations, I do not have internet at one and poor connections at another. I use my DAS units to sync data between the locations as my backup. I invested in these units initially as I thought they would be perfect, then I found out they appear to use software to lock out most hard drives. These units are technically owned by western digital and that is what they require, I tested out a few drives, found a few off brand drives that worked, but I had already invested in a bunch of used drives that won&#39;t show up in the software (G-Raid software utility). I have experimented a bit, but I am not really familiar with the insides. I was told that the software is based on the Promise Pegasus, but not sure about that either. I would love to just build my own setups, but there don&#39;t seem to be much for Thunderbolt 3 interfaces, most are SAS. Anyone ever mod or build their own DAS from a proprietary case?</p> </div><!-- S",

So I\u2019m willing to pay someone for their time to jump and a quick call and see what I\u2019m doing wrong</p> <p>For a bit of backstory, I\u2019ve been using the GV-USB2 capture device along with VirtualDub2 and OBS. Despite following all the correct settings, I\u2019m not getting any picture on the software. I originally thought it was the capture card, so I returned it and got a new one, however still no luck. The VCR is working fine when connected to a TV (has also been cleaned internally), and even home videos aren\u2019t showing up properly. Usually just a blue screen or extremely corrupt playback. I\u2019m not using any TBC, but as I\u2019m aware, you shouldn\u2019t need one to get some form of stable footage? (Might be wrong). My PC is fairly decent so I don\u2019t think that would be the issue",
