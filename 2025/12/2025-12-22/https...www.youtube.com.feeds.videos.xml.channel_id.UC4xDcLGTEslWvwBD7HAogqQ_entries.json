        "description": "The Most Terrifying Planets Ever Discovered explores some of the most extreme worlds ever found beyond our solar system. The journey begins with Gliese 436b, a \u201chot ice\u201d world where water exists as superheated, compressed ice beneath a scorching hydrogen atmosphere, defying everything we associate with frozen planets. Next is HD 80606 b, a planet with one of the most violent orbits ever observed, experiencing sudden temperature spikes of over 1,000\u00b0F as it swings dangerously close to its star. COROT-7b raises the stakes with its lava-covered surface, where entire oceans of molten rock may flow under a blazing sky. The fear escalates with WASP-127b, a gas giant with winds reaching record-breaking speeds of over 20,000 mph, fast enough to tear apart any structure imaginable. WASP-76b pushes planetary horror further, as its dayside is so hot that iron vaporizes and rains down as molten metal on the nightside. Even more extreme is WASP-12b, a planet being actively torn apart by its star, ",
