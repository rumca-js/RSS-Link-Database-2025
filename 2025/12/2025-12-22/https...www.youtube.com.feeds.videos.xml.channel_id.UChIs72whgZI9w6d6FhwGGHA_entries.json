In this video, we break-down how the enterprise and data center \"AI\" companies are, we think, working together to keep GPUs out of the hands of consumers while raking-in tax breaks and government subsidies funded by those very consumers. We also talk about HBM wafer allocation and consumption as compared to consumer memory solutions.\n\nWatch our @GNCAInvestigates video about NVIDIA x Palantir: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lYsO4k7OIY\nWatch our video about Micron, favored NVIDIA partner, screwing consumers in a similar way: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A-eeJP0J7c\n\nLearn about the special backer tiers with bonus videos and digital content: https://store.gamersnexus.net/ai-dystopia\nOr grab our new \"RETRO I/O\" Co",
