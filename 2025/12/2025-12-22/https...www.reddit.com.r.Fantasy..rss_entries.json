The plan is to use these short stories to write the larger text, whilst also pulling them together as a kind of teaser anthology set in the world.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for further inspiration as I continue to write and plan, and wanted to ask if anyone has any recommendations for dark fantasy books, short stories, podcasts or any other media that might give me some more ideas? Preferably standalone rather than a series!</p> <p>Any recommendations",
