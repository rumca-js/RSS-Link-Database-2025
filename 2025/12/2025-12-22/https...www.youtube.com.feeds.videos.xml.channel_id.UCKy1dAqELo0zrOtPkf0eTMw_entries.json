        "description": "Octopath Traveler 0 reviewed by Michael Higham on Nintendo Switch 2. Also available on PlayStation 4/5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.\n\nIn this long review process, I was afforded the space to really reflect on my time with Octopath Traveler 0, and perhaps cool down from the adrenaline rush of finishing a massive RPG with a super tough final boss and multifaceted conclusion. What I realized in that time is that despite the bumps and low points across its 100-plus hour runtime, all its moving parts really mattered in some way or another. The more I examine the final hours in particular, the more impressed I am by how daring and poetic this game is \u2013 it's an affecting journey that you won't really feel until you're at the end of the road. In many ways, it's a quintessential RPG with a dynamic turn-based combat system, slick HD-2D style, powerful messages tucked in battles against gods, and magnificent music to match each moment. I don't expect everyone to give it the time it ",
