Technically, the DAS is larger than the backup, but at the moment the 8 TB backup is only around 50% full. Ultimately, may need to upgrade some disks in the future, but for now this works with some headroom for growth.

It provides additional functionality such as configuration through environment variables and directory/permissions fixes. The full release cycle is automated with GitHub actions so you can be sure that the image is continuously updated when new releases of OS Server become available.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/lemker/unifi-os-server\">GitHub</a></p> <p><strong>Why run in Docker instead of using UniFi\u2019s binary?</strong></p> <p>UniFi OS Server is shipped as a single binary from UniFi which requires Podman. Managing the installation is done with their own <code>uosserver</code> commands which is not very portable and you will most likely require a dedicated machine or VM. Running in Docker, you can also integrate with your existing reverse proxy for SSL termination and networking.</p>",

The thing is that setting up the proxy won&#39;t stop the services from still being accessible via the IP:port. That leads me to these questions:</p> <ol> <li>How can I stop the IP:port access? It&#39;s easy in case of Docker services by simply not publishing the port but what about the rest (e.g. a NAS web gui)? Is there a way to disable it altogether or is it only possible via firewall rules (by only allowing clients access to the proxy rather than the services directly) meaning the IP:port access will still work but only for devices on the same VLAN?</li> <li>Is it even advisable to block the IP:port access in case there is an issue with the reverse proxy?</li> </ol> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Red_Con_\"> /u/R",
