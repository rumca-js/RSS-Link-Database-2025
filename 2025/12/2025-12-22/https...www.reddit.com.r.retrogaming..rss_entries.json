(A similar approach solved issues with running my dumped ROMs on Analogue Pocket properly.)<br/> Apparently a rather &quot;small&quot; SD card always seems to do the trick. I was struggling with invalid checksums and all these hurdles quite a bit using a 128GB one, while using a 16GB one works flawlessly.<br/> I even tried partitioning a 128GB one to 32GB, but the problems prevailed.</p> <p>The final hint that the card size really matters was my recent test when I tried dumping an SNES cart onto a 128GB card (-&gt; invalid checksum) and then, keeping the game in place, switching to a 16GB one... no checksum issue at all.<br/> After quite the marathon of trials and error this finally convinced me that using a small SD card really seems to play a crucial part for the OSCR to working successfully.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://",
