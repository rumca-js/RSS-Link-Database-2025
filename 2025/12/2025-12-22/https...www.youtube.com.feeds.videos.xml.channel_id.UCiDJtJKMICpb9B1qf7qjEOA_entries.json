        "description": "Two of the most recognizable hand props from JAWS (1975) were recently uncovered: Quint's harpoon rifle and large fishing rod that he used aboard the Orca in the hunt for the film's shark! Adam visits Propstore to take a look at these film artifacts and learn how everything from the woodgrain of the rifle stock to the scratches on its green carrying case match what was seen on screen and in production photos. The story of where and how these props were found is quite a doozy!\n\nFind out more about these props and the upcoming auction at https://propstoreauction.com/auctions/info/id/496\n\nShot by Joey Fameli and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\nAdditional media courtesy of Propstore\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) meri",
