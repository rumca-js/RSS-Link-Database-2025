        "description": "Can you become a millionaire in Fallout 4 without ever leaving sanctuary hills (the starting area)?  Today in this video I will video explore the possibility, showcasing in-game mechanics and how to make money. I will be showcasing the requirements for certain items and how to become a millionaire, emphasizing of course the challenges that come with survival mode but mostly to how to get rich by absolutely any means including video game glitches and exploits. \n\nWith the release of season 2 of the fallout tv show now felt like an appropriately fitting time to jump back into the world of fallout 4. A glorious bethesda bug fest of an RPG with more overpowered weapons than an anime. So the goal is simple, 1 million bottle caps without leaving sanctuary all whilst dealing with maximum difficulty, survival mode and permadeath. \n\nChapters:\n00:00 (Intro)\n00:38 (Getting Started)\n02:23 (Exiting the Vault)\n05:30 - Clearing out Sanctuary\n10:38 - Establishing our Colony!\n13:05 - Powerlevelling!\n16",
