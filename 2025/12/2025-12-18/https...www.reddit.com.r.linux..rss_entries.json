Another reason I\u2019m curious about Linux is the growing popularity of Linux gaming, especially with SteamOS and the Steam Deck making it more accessible.</p> <p>The main thing drawing me to Linux is the customizability.

I also prematurely blamed the CachyOS kernel before I tried the a diffenernt distro altogether. This happened on 3 different distros on this laptop. The fix was to install thermald and make it the daemon. This allowed my cpu to clock up and hold steady. No more fps dips. The whole system is much smoother all around.</p> <p>I want to find the real issue but as or right now this is my workaround. I hope others can try this and see what they&#39;re results are. It seems the power-profiles-daemon (no clue is this is the right thinking) is not allowing the cpu to boost up smoothly. It was almost acting like the cpu was smacking into a hard ceiling of power or thermals even though temps werent high. </p> <p>I&#39;m going to continue my work on this but I&#39;d like more input. This maybe a laptop only issue and maybe a Lenovo only issue. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",
