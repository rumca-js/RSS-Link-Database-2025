The interview was with two senior cybersecurity leaders, and they mentioned that results would be released before the holidays. I wanted to ask: Has anyone gone through this internship interview before? How competitive is the hiring process? Does HMH typically hire international students on OPT for internships? What is the work culture like in their cybersecurity team? Is the IoMT work hands-on, or more documentation/analysis-focused? I\u2019d really appreciate any insights, experiences, or general advice from people who\u2019ve worked at HMH or in healthcare cybersecurity.
