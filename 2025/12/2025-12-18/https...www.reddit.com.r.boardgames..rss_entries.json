From what I&#39;ve read, it seems to be pretty good, but of course it&#39;s another big box and the competition is fierce.</p> <p>I was wondering how Grimcoven compares to other established boss battlers like KDM, ATO, Oathsworn and Primal. Categories I can think of are difficulty, story, replay value, actual gameplay mechanics and engine etc..

Symbols grant you actions like climbing, jumping, melee attack, ranged attack, etc. Giant`s body consists of multiple zones at different heights, so to reach them you will need to climb, following chosen routes.
