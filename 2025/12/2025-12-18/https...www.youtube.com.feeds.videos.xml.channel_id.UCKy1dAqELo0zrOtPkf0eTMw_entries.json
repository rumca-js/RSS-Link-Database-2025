The latest sales data from Circana shows a massive 70% drop in Xbox hardware sales year-over-year in the U.S. To be fair, hardware sales for the PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch 1 and 2 were also down from November of 2024, but these numbers are especially damaging to Xbox. This year alone saw two significant price hikes on Xbox hardware. In other news, Sony and Tencent have agreed to a 'confidential settlement' with the Light of Motiram lawsuit. The game has now seemingly been pulled from Steam and the Epic Game Store. No cancellation has been announced. And finally, FIFA is back as the organization has announced a new game in partnership with...Netflix?",

In that hour alone, I wandered around a beautiful beachside alien town, met a semi-depressed new gun named Travis and got completely wasted with him, impressed some alien teenagers with my skateboarding skills, circumcised a giant alien phallus with a laser, stole the fedora from the 1996 movie Dunston Checks In, tried (unsuccessfully) to solve a murder mystery, and bounty-hunted a billionaire who, yes, met his demise.

It might just get them killed...\n\nAnaconda is produced by Brad Fuller, Andrew Form, Kevin Etten, and Tom Gormican. Samson M\u00fccke serves as executive producer.

We\u2019ve been waiting 4+ years for any news on Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\u2019s remake and Star Wars: Eclipse, and in that time have heard about several Star Wars projects, video game or otherwise that are either in development or in development hell. It\u2019s a frustrating time to be a fan of video games set in this universe, so hopefully Arcanaut Studios can prove us all wrong sometime this decade.\n\nCheck out the full episode of Beyond here! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x9qCfQiUq8&t=34s\n\nThis weeks show is Hosted by Max Scoville, Brian Altano, Jada Griffin, Nick Maillet, and is produced by Nick Maillet. \n\n#KOTOR #StarWars",

Also available on PlayStation 4 & 5, Xbox One & Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.\n\n\"Terminator 2D: No Fate is totally committed to being an unflinching homage to the 16-bit era. This brings with it an extremely brief runtime \u2013 and I\u2019m unconvinced the supplementary modes developer Bitmap Bureau has injected are going to be enough to have me guarantee I\u2019ll be back \u2013 but it can\u2019t be understated just how much it succeeds as a wonderfully realised tribute to one of the single greatest movies ever made. It arguably under-utilises its supreme asset in the titular Terminator itself, but it\u2019s otherwise a consistently entertaining and rewarding time capsule punctuated with pitch-perfect music, exquisite pixel art, and brilliant Easter eggs. Terminator 2D: No Fate isn\u2019t just the best Terminator 2 game ever \u2013 it may just be the best way to revisit the \u201990s this side of hitching a ride to the past in a ball of electricity with your junk out.
