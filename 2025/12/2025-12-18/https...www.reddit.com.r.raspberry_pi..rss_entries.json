Since the 4/5 only support Bluetooth 5.0, and 5.2 is required for LE Audio, I&#39;m looking to purchase a USB Bluetooth dongle to get up to 5.2. I&#39;m having a hard time telling if this is as easy as it sounds - if I find a USB dongle that claims to support Bluetooth 5.2, will that work with my Pi?</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something like the <a href=\"https://www.asus.com/networking-iot-servers/adapters/all-series/usb-bt540/\">Asus BT540 </a>which is mysteriously hard to find for purchase. Any recommendations or tips?
