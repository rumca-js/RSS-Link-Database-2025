K-2SO feels larger than life when it gets up close and personal, and Darren shows us how he has refined his puppet to give it the same distinct character and personality as the on-screen droid!\n\nFind Darren's other builds and projects: http://www.drscifi.com/ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEmlBCbLwocSEWNi3oZ6WGw and https://www.instagram.com/drscifi/\n\nShot and edited by Josh Self\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nSavage Merchandis",
