We\u2019ll show our advancements in conformance, performance, productivity and more, across real-world codebases. Find out how C++ Dynamic Debugging can give you the experience of debug builds with the speed of optimized builds, how you can leverage context-aware code suggestions to tune GitHub Copilot for your projects, and about a host of other features. We\u2019ll also walk through which C++23 features you can use today, such as std::generator\u2019s standard library support for coroutines. We\u2019ll demo some of these features live, so you can see how to make the most of them in your own codebases. \n \n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2025/blob/main/Presentations/What's_New_in_Visual_Studio_for_Cpp_Developers_in_2025.pdf\n\nWork at Hudson River Trading (HRT): https",
