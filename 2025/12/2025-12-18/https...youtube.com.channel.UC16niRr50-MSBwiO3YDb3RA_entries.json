Their lawyers are claiming the company \"knew of safety features that would prevent sextortion\" prior to his death and instead \"prioritised profit\".\n \nMeta previously said it had made real changes to Instagram, and said it supports law enforcement to prosecute the criminals behind sextortion, adding \"we continue to fight them on our apps on multiple fronts\".\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Scotland #Meta #BBCNews",

        "description": "European Union leaders are gathering for a Brussels summit where a momentous decision will be taken on whether to loan Ukraine tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to fund its military and economic needs.\n \nMost of Russia's \u20ac210bn (\u00a3185bn; $245bn) worth of assets in the EU are held by Belgium-based organisation Euroclear, and so far Belgium and some other members of the bloc have said they are opposed to using the cash.\n \nWithout a boost in funding, Ukraine's finances are set to run dry in a matter of months.\n \nRussia has warned the EU against using its money, and has filed a lawsuit against Euroclear in a Moscow court in a bid to get its money back.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
