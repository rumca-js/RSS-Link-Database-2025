Stardew Valley is too adictive to me, so I&#39;m giving a goooood break (i would go to sleep waaay past mid night playing that game hehehe).</p> <p>I usually like games like the Kingdom Hearts franchise, DMC franchise, Soulsborne games, Uncharted, SW Jedi games, and i also like some retro games, like Chrono Trigger, Duck Tales, some Metroidvanias and some single player shooters too, but all those are either mentally demanding on the story aspect, or mechanically demanding. Lately i&#39;ve been playing those and dieing a lot or getting completely lost in the story.

This did not seem to fix the issue. So I tried installing a different distro. This time I tried Fedora and installed the akmod nvidia drivers. But still no fix.

The thing is that I\u2019m currently debating whether I should have installed Linux or not, it seems really interesting and powerful but I don\u2019t know if it can run all the games that I want, I mainly get my games from GOG or any other website that would allow me to possess the game without DRM and not only have a key to use it, I think GOG already supports Linux but I don\u2019t know about games that I got from other places (like Halo CE that I got from internet archive for example). So my question is : Is there a version of Linux that could allow me to play all my games or not ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Anthanael_\"> /u/Anthanael_ </a> <br/> ",

I&#39;m checking the logs and frequently seeing error: Pageflip timed out.</p> <p>I tried everything: disabling lact, reverting back to regular mesa, and some other things that I don&#39;t remember. </p> <p>It&#39;s kind of annoying and problematic.

After my switch to Linux, I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s only picked up as a &quot;Generic Xbox Pad&quot; instead of an 8BitDo controller. Meaning I am unable to use certain features like the share button. Even when connecting over USB.</p> <p>Doing some research, I tried installing xpad, xone, and xpadneo (separately, of course).
