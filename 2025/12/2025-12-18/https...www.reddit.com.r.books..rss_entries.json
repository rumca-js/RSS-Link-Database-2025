Such a phenomenal book, especially if you\u2019re a millennial woman who had their preteen and teen years in the late 90s/early 00s. </p> <p>The book is a coming of age story following three girls, Shaz, Kel and Rach, in Doncaster; the nights out and boys and school dramas. It shines in the writing - I felt every emotion they did (and of course, there were a lot being teenage girls!). My diaphragm felt frozen the whole time reading it, like I couldn\u2019t take a full breath, because it was hitting me so hard. It\u2019s written entirely in the Doncaster Yorkshire dialect, which almost put me off reading it but I\u2019m glad I went for it. I think the dialect actually made it more impactful because it was like they were talking directly to me.</p> <p>If you enjoyed Shuggie Bain, I think you\u2019ll like this. Best book I\u2019ve read this year (and I\u2019ve read over 100!) it\u2019s so so so so good</p> </",

How much did you guys really understand of the harder sci-fi and physics parts??? I can\u2019t help but feel frustrated that I didn\u2019t grasp some of these concepts more to better understand the workings of the story.

The book and the author sort of faded into the background but, over the last year or so, this book seems to have found a new lease of life and I see people recommending it all the time. As far as I know, it&#39;s not been adapted into a film or tv series so I&#39;m really curious how a 20 year old book that was considered almost mediocre at the time of its release suddenly gets a resurgence and what about it appeals to newer readers? This is by no means a &#39;hate&#39; post, I am genuinely interested in what I can only describe as the psychology of it. Given that the genre this was slotted into in 2005 had some much &#39;better&#39; books, I am am curious as to whether those who enjoyed The Historian have read books that would have been considered similar at the time and if they also enjoyed those?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",
