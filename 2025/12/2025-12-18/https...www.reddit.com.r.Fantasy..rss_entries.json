The original anime adaptation is one of my favorite pieces of any media ever, and although it used to be streaming in its entirety on HIDIVE it seems to no longer be there - so unfortunately there&#39;s no way to watch it legally in English anymore unless you&#39;re willing to pay an expensive markup to a scalper for one of the limited blu-ray sets of the complete series that were produced. </p> <p>Anyways, I just found out that the 10 novels most of the original anime adaptation was based on were translated into English last decade - albeit with inconsistencies across the series due to licenser using three different translators over the course of the series, one of which seems to have been pretty bad with his translation riddled with errors. And of course, they didn&#39;t sell well enough for any of the other novels (the four prequels and handful of short stories) to get translated and released over here",

I figured I&#39;d stop in and share our teams top reads of the year. We each picked one indie and one trad published book, and you can find the list below, but mine are:</p> <p>Indie: Shadow Bane by Cal Logan - I really loved this; was the first time I was back in a Japanese-inspired story in quite a bit. The trifecta of main characters were all fully fleshed out with multiple POVs that got us into their minds and explained their actions perfectly. The story is full of demons, betrayals, backroom politics, and everything else that makes a story so vivid and engaging. I think I read the last 250 pages in 2 hours, and I only stopped to sleep. Jin is also one of my favorite characters of the year!</p> <p>Trad: The Pariah by Anthony Ryan - Jumping back into Anthony\u2019s books was one of those \u201coh yeah, he\u2019s ACTUALLY a genius\u201d moments.

Don&#39;t really care if he tells the truth or not, everyone who tells their life story likes to embellish things but oh my god I CANNOT stand Denna and his obsession over her. Love Fela and seems like a more interesting character... Denna though is portrayed as this mysterious girl, but her constant coming and going makes me not interested in her at all. I started to skip their dialogues at the Eolian since it&#39;s always the same thing. Anyway just needed to rant about her and wondered if other people felt that way too. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/missherefortay12345\"> /u/missherefortay12345 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1pplyxb/name_of_the_wind/\">[link",
