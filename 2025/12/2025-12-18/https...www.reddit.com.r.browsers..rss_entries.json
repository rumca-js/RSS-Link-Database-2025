I noticed some work better than others depending on the site, while a few seem to be hit-or-miss. i\u2019m curious to hear from the community: which browser extensions do you rely on for coupon or discount code comparison, and what has your experience been like? Are there any that consistently save you time or money without being intrusive? would love a discussion based on personal experiences rather than promotional links looking for honest user feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Current-Picture-1572\"> /u/Current-Picture-1572 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1ppobgf/comparing_coupon_browser_extensions_which_ones/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1ppobgf/comparing_coupon_br",
