        "description": "Black holes are not just the strangest objects in the universe, they're the sharpest test we have of how reality actually works. This episode explores how these extreme cosmic laboratories force general relativity and quantum physics into direct confrontation. We look back through a decade of content to understand their formation and the theoretical diagrams that describe them, offering a journey through the profound implications of these celestial objects for our understanding of space time and astrophysics.\n\nSign Up on Patreon to get access to the Space Time Discord!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/pbsspacetime\n\nCheck out the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!\nhttps://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetime\n\n\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Matt O'Dowd \nPost Production by Leonardo Scholzer\nDirected by Andrew Kornhaber\nAssociate Producer: Bahar Gholipour\nExecutive Producer: Andrew Kor",
