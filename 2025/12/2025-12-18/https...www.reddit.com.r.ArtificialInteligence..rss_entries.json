This is something that I deeply regret and am incredibly ashamed of. Whenever I have an extremely specific question I need answered that Google likely would not accurately have displayed to me without clicking through other websites, I rely on AI. I want to break this habit and learn to think for myself, and avoid the negatively moral and environmental impacts that generative AI comes with. Where else should I go/how should I go about navigating through websites/other sources to find the answer to a very specific question in a way that is efficient. For example, creating a post on a website like Reddit for one answer to my homework is not very timely if it is due the following morning.

Answers to this question should be based not on intuition, dogma or speculation but on solid scientific evidence. However, I argue such evidence is hard to come by and that the only justifiable stance is agnosticism. The main division in the contemporary literature is between biological views that are sceptical of artificial consciousness and functional views that are sympathetic to it. I show that both camps make the same mistake of overstating what the available evidence tells us. I then consider what agnosticism means for the ethical problems surrounding the creation of artificial consciousness.&quot;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AngleAccomplished865\"> /u/AngleAccomplished865 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

The company estimates that photographers saved 13 million hours as a result. It also calculates a combined AU$117 million in savings for its 200,000 users, based on 11 cents cost per edited photo, thanks to AI.</p> <p>Zenfolio\u2019s latest survey (2024) also shows that only 12.9% of photographers said they did not use AI. Another 32.2% said it was a regular part of their workflow, while 53.1% used it as needed. Just 11.6% viewed AI as negative, compared with 31.8% who viewed it as positive and 56.6% who were neutral.</p> <",

Z3 is a module in Python specifically for analyzing math theorems so it\u2019s perfect to verify all of the functional axioms.

Z3 will end and return differing sets of variables at different points, but the test will complete. It will randomly choose to end the program. But, this is only a partial axiom test containing only logic packaging and I can only get the test to loop until I stop it.</p> <p>So I\u2019ve now successfully tested the first 8 logic mechanisms. They run correctly however there is no decision engine to move the system to a truth. So while running, the system stays in \u201cmaybe. The axioms clear but the program does not end.
