        "description": "The FBI is warning about a scary new scam that will probably trick a lot of people.\n\nThere's a new strategy that scammers have started using that will be truly scary to people who don't know this scam exists, or is even possible. It involves the scammer using the new AI image generators that are able to take a sample image from a person and create a realistic but fake photo of them being supposedly kidnapped. At the moment there are usually clear signs of it being AI, but that won't be for long. So it's important to be aware of what these scammers are doing and warn your friends and family.\n\nTime Stamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n1:59 - Real Examples\n3:54 - How Do They They Get the Info?\n5:09 - Not Always Easy To Tell\n5:58 - AI Image Detection (For Google AI Images)\n6:54 - Voice Clone Scams Already A Thing\n7:38 - How To Protect Yourself",
