And she is always casting the guy who plays master chief in the halo show. Safe to say, she likes chiseled bad boys with a soft spot for creative and free women.

To get an idea of my taste, I\u2019m going to briefly go over a few of my favorite things in horror + the books I\u2019ve read so far and what I rated them.</p> <p>My favorite subgenres in horror tend to be slasher and paranormal, and a lot of my favorite movies and books have a very similar vibe. Southern/rural horror, small/abandoned towns, creepy hillbillies, murder families and things like that. (Think Brother). Recommendations absolutely don\u2019t need to fit this, I\u2019m pretty much willing to try anything if it seems interesting enough, but I wanted to mention it because I\u2019m always looking for some Texas Chainsaw-esque books but haven\u2019t found many so far.</p> <p>(Note: I am not comfortable with extreme horror/splatterpunk and will not read it.
