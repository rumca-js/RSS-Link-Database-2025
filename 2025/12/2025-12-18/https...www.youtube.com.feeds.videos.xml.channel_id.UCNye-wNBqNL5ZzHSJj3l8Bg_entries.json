Today, the site suffers from severe neglect, lacking state support for proper maintenance. For decades under Gaddafi, the Amazigh people faced oppression, including a ban on their language and culture. Although there is now a renewed pride in their heritage since the 2011 revolution, their crucial historical sites remain overlooked compared to Libya's more famous Roman and Greek ruins. The community hopes these places can be preserved as a testament to their enduring legacy.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Malik Traina reports from Nalut, in the Nafusa Mountains.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDownload AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/A",
