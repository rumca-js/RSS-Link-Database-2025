After that, I reviewed the MuseBook and the Muse Pi Pro, focusing on what works, what feels immature, and where the ecosystem still clearly needs improvement.</p> <p>This is very much a critical exploration, not hype driven content. I try to be honest about limitations, software pain points, performance expectations, and where RISC-V still does not make sense compared to ARM or x86.</p> <p>A quick note on language, the first video in the playlist uses AI dubbing for English, but on the more recent videos on my channel I am doing the English dubbing myself. The original content is recorded in Portuguese and",
