As a result, the pathogen can grow up to a hundred times faster.",

        "description": "Overexploitation (harvesting at a rate that exceeds the ability of populations to recover) is a major driver of biodiversity loss. Globally, tens of thousands of animal, plant and fungi species are used and traded at different scales for purposes including food, fashion, medicine, pets, and building materials, among many others. Some of this use and trade is legal and sustainable and some not. Research I have led demonstrates that thousands of species are likely threatened by exploitation for international trade and preventing overexploitation of such species is therefore key to conserving life on Earth.",
