You could fit 23 Earth\u2019s across it!! This planet is less dense than marshmallows.\n\nBut if you\u2019re good with a little more scientific uncertainty, our second contender looks like it\u2019s even bigger\u2026\n\nThen there\u2019s the last contender\u2026 \n\nIf you think there should be more optimistic science and tech stories, subscribe!\n\n#science #shorts #planet #biggest #space #universe",
