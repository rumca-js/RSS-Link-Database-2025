Spent 2 hours yesterday trying to buy replacement hotend parts and found maybe 20 different sellers with similar items but theres no way to check if they are legit. I had to click into each listing one by one, try to remember the specs and prices then go back and repeat. Ended up just closing the app so now I&#39;m thinking about switching to ebay for sourcing parts, at least the shipping is way faster and the search actually works better also buyer protection seems better. For those of you who source from ebay instead of aliexpress, is it worth switching or no?
