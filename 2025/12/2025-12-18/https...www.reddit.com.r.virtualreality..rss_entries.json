There&#39;s a lot of tech demo-ish stuff, sure, but some of these are the only high-fidelity PC games we got before the switch over to mobile hardware.</p> <p>Tons of these games will just never be played by the vast majority of VR audiences, classics like Edge of Nowhere, The Climb, Robo Recall, Stormland, Asgard&#39;s Wrath- or even some of the more janky titles like Chronos, From Other Suns, Wilson&#39;s Heart, and Defector are just collecting dust on the Oculus storefront. I&#39;m sure in a couple years, Meta will finally shut it down, and you&#39;ll just have to pirate everything, further limiting their audience.</p> <p>It&#39;s not just a Meta problem though, I mean look at PlayStation- we have incredible titles like Blood and Truth and Astro Bot",

(if i can please let me know.) but if the meta quest can be hooked up with just a usb cable it would make sense i could use my lap top right? just wanted to get a second opinion before i actually commit to buying a headset.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ebonywolf777\"> /u/Ebonywolf777 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ppwgl6/so_ive_got_a_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ppwgl6/so_ive_got_a_question/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My graphics card is a 4070ti super. Also, I only want inside tracking, so that&#39;s why I chose these two headsets.</p> <p>I like the crystal super or dream, but I&#39;d need a 5090 for those. Not looking to buy a new gaming pc anytime soon (or am I...? Idk, buying a new alienware pc with a 5090 is like 4600 rn...).</p> <p>Games I&#39;m gonna play: Fallout 4, Skyrim, NMS, Halflife, Metro, Subnautica.</p> <p>If someone has both the VFV and crystal light, I&#39;d love your feedback.</p> <p>It sounds like they both have issues with software. I wanna think that since the crystal light has been around for a moment now, that the kinks have been kinda ironed out. I&#39;m honestly leaning towards pimax atm. But the whole lenses quality issue worries me a bit. Anyway, thanks for reading, and I look forward to your suggestions.</p> </d",

The router shoulden&#39;t matter in the slightest since packets aren&#39;t being routed, they are all destined for the local network (unless your a crazy person trying to stream vr over the WAN, if so, you do you). Packets destined for the local network should just get switched by the ethernet switch built into your standard all in one router.</p> <p>You may need a WAP mostly if you don&#39;t have an access point that supports wifi 6e, if your home routers built in WAP supports wifi 6E though, then setting up dedicated bands and putting in place QoS tags should be more then enough.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sol33t303\"> /u/Sol33t303 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ppee05/why_is_g",
