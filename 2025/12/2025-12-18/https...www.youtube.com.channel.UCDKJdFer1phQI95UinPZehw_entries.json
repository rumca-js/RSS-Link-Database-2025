Thank you.\n\n\u201cMewing.\u201d \u201cMogging.\u201d \u201cLooksmaxxing.\u201d These are all terms we take for granted as part of popular i lexicon, but not too long ago they were reserved for a few niche boards on websites that the general public had no knowledge of. And these ideas have only become more popular with the rise of a new figure - Clavicular.
