        "description": "This session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm offers actionable insights and learnings on how to get the most out of UEFN\u2014whether you're making the switch from Unreal Engine or looking to deepen your skills as a UEFN developer. Learn how to work smarter, push creative boundaries, and unlock more of what\u2019s possible within Fortnite's toolset.\n\nThe session explores how to bring proven Unreal Engine workflows into UEFN: clean folder structures, proper asset types, the use of modular design, and custom editor layouts that support efficiency and clarity. Along the way, gain a better understanding of UEFN\u2019s asset editors and how to organize projects for long-term scalability.\n\nThe session also takes a look at the limits of UEFN and how to work around them. Many powerful tools from Unreal Engine\u2014like Material Functions, Textures, Particle Effects, Control Rigs, Animations, and post-processing tricks\u2014can still be used, giving you an edge when creating more advanced experiences.\n\nThe last part",
