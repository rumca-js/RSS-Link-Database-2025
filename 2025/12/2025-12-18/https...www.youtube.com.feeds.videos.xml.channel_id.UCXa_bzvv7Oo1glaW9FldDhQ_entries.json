        "description": "Where were you on Dragon Age Day? Were you sitting at home, enjoying Dragon Age: Inquisition or Dragon Age 2? Were you embroiled, unlike those sickos, in the masterpiece that is Dragon Age: Origins? Did you celebrate the franchise, whether it was at its peak or at the level of \u201cgreat, but could've been better?\u201d\n\nWell, don't worry if you didn't, because Dragon Age Day \u2013 December 4th, for those keeping track - came and went without so much as a muster from BioWare. Why? You can thank a little game called Dragon Age: The Veilguard.",

        "description": "While 2025 has been a great year for some studios, others have found this to be a disappointing year thanks to a bunch of releases that didn't really go as well as their developers might have hoped. While some of these titles might still be viable options for people who like what they offer, the gaming world at large has already left them behind as new, better games have taken the stage. \n\nJoin us as we take a look at the year's worst games, and the reasons that got them to where they are now. Perhaps you might find something to like in one or two of them, but we wouldn't recommend holding your breath. It's a task we must undertake, with the hope of other titles learning from the mistakes of these ones.",
