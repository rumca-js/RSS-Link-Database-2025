Together with tailscale im now able to connect with it also outside my home network. But for the CalDAV integration on my mobile devices (especally iOS) I need to use the tailnet ip adress, which means i also need to connect to vpn when im at home and connected to wifi. Is it possible to retoute to the internal IPs so i could use them and let tailscale only connect when im on mobile data? How you guys do that?</p> <p>And another question, (sorry I\u2019m new to all of that and try to understand how it works) when I\u2019m connect to vpn, is a normal connection to the internet also rerouted through my home server first?
