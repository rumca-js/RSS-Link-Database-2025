I wanted to share some of the technical hurdles I encountered when trying to bridge the gap between a high-level TUI (Bubble Tea) and low-level shell persistence.</p> <p><strong>1. The PTY Multiplexing Challenge</strong> One of the biggest hurdles was managing multiple shell instances within a single TUI process. Unlike a standard CLI tool, this required spawning <code>os/exec</code> commands attached to a PTY so that interactive commands (like a Python REPL or <code>input()</code> calls) would behave correctly. I had to implement a layer to pipe <code>io.Writer</code> and <code>io.Reader</code> from the shell into the TUI\u2019s internal buffer while preserving ANSI escape codes for color and cursor positioning.</p> <p><strong>2.
