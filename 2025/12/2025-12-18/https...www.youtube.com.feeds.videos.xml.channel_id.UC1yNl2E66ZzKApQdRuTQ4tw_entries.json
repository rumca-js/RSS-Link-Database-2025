Thorium is common and easy to mine, its waste is safer to handle, and the material also can\u2019t be used as easily in weapons. Recently, a team of scientists from China announced a breakthrough in their thorium reactor project \u2013 let\u2019s take a look at just what they\u2019ve done and what the rest of the world is doing for developing thorium nuclear reactors.\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n\ud83d\udd17 Join this cha",
