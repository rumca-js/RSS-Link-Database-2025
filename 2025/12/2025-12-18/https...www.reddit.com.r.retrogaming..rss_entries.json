Many NES cables are stiff by now, and I wanted something that:</p> <ul> <li>keeps a <strong>large bending radius</strong></li> <li>puts <strong>no stress on the connector</strong></li> <li>works <strong>without screws or additional hardware</strong></li> </ul> <p>The design is <strong>two parts that slide together</strong>, completely tool-free.<br/> No clips, no screws, no glue \u2013 just form-fit geometry.</p> <p>I also added an optional version where the <strong>top layer of the inlay is printed in red</strong>, so the engraved NES controller graphic is easier to see (purely visual difference).</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested, you can find the model here:<br/> <a href=\"https://makerworld.com/de/models/2129761-nintendo-ne",
