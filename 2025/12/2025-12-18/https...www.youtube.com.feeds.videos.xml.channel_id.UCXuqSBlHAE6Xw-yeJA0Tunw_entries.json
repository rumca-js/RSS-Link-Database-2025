        "description": "Thanks to AMD as always for being a great partner, sponsoring this video, and supporting us to bring you cool content like this! Show them some love and check them out at https://lmg.gg/f6PMg and stay tuned for the AMD Gaming Room!\n\nBefore we start loading gear into our Ultimate Tech House, we\u2019re going to need a house! But not just ANY house. We need a house with room for all our crazy renovation ideas, old enough that we won\u2019t feel bad about ripping up some drywall and new enough that it doesn\u2019t need a bunch of costly repairs. The perfect house will be close to the office so we\u2019re not wasting a lot of time commuting, and won\u2019t cost so much that we can\u2019t afford to make all the upgrades we\u2019ve got planned. But does that perfect house exist? Can we really make it \u2018Just Work\u2019 for whoever ends up making our Tech House their Tech Home?\n\nA big thanks to our Realtor, Emma Stewart.
