The only reason I want to expose jellyfin to the public, is because when I want to access my media, I dont want to have to install tailscale on the device, I can simply use the browser.</p> <p>Hopefully you understand my scenario and the problem Im facing.

Or at least some guides that help separate the order of operations? Any guidance would help.

Warning that I&#39;m pretty new to all this, so I am trying my best. </p> <p>Basically, I want only my Linux-Ubuntu PC&#39;s personal user to have rwx permissions to the full directory of a network-mount, we&#39;ll call it mnt/NAS, (which it does upon mounting with fstab), but I also want a specific docker container, launched with a docker compose file, to have only rw access to a specific folder in the mount, we&#39;ll call it mnt/NAS/Folder1, and its subdirectories.</p> <p>What&#39;s the best way to go about doing that?
