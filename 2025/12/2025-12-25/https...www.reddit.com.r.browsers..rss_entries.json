I&#39;m currently using the Floorp browser with extensions, and while the performance is generally good, I feel that no Gecko browser compares to the speed of Google Chrome. I also don&#39;t want to use alternatives like Brave, as I find it unbearable that a \u201cprivate\u201d browser comes with a crypto wallet and VPN.

But I am really not satisfied with any of them. I originally came from Chrome \u2192 Edge \u2192 Brave \u2192 Opera, and now I have come back to Chrome. If I am to be honest, I&#39;m most satisfied with opera, but when they changed their quick copy and paste board, I changed my browser (I&#39;m also a fan of drag and dropping from tab to tab, but as far as I remember, that is not an option in opera). So I wanted to ask, what is, in your opinion, the best browser?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/seromina\"> /u/seromina </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1pvb862/what_is_the_best_browser/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1pvb862/what_is_the_best_browser/\">[comments]</a></span>",
