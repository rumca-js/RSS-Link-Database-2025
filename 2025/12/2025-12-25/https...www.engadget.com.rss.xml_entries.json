Sony made its parental control tools more comprehensive in recent years and they allow families to manage screen time, block unsuitable content, guide online interactions and approve purchases. The process is straightforward once the right menus are in view, but it helps to understand how each feature works before handing over the controller.</p>\n<p>The system uses individual accounts for each family member, and these accounts determine what a child can access. A parent or guardian assigns restrictions to the child\u2019s profile and the console enforces them more consistently than earlier PlayStation systems. The process begins with creating a child account, then linking it to the Family Management section of the adult account, and finally adjusting controls on the console itself.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2 id=\"jump-link-create-a-child-account-through-family-manage",
