I know there are other methods like PortProton, but I found this one more efficient because it gives me more control. Everything works correctly: my Wine is Wine Staging on the latest version, and both Steam and SteamTools open normally.</p> <p>The problem is that the drag-and-drop method in SteamTools doesn\u2019t seem to be working. The files do get copied into the \u201cdepotcache\u201d and \u201cstplug-in\u201d folders, but the game simply doesn\u2019t appear to be installed. I know Steam recently had an update, and SteamTools did as well \u2014 both are on the latest version here.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure what could be causing this. I\u2019m considering downloading an older version of both to see if it works, but before doing that I\u2019d like to confirm whether this is a general issue or something happening only on my end.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ozaimori\"> /u/ozaimori </a> <b",
