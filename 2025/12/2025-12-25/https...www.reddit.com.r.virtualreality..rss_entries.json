With that in mind, does anyone have any recommendations? Everyone swears by the Quest 3, but I&#39;d rather not support Meta if I can avoid it. I&#39;d prefer to game at a stable 60FPS+ at 1080p.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Structure5637\"> /u/Ok-Structure5637 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pvn0tv/best_vr_headset_for_pc_gaming_in_2025/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtual",
