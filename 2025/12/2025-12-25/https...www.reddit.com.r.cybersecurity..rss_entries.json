Het ISMS staat en de meeste onderdelen werken ook daadwerkelijk in de praktijk, maar ik ben benieuwd naar ervaringen van anderen.</p> <p>Ik heb een paar vragen en hoop dat jullie die kunnen beantwoorden vanuit eigen audits:</p> <p>Hoe verloopt zo\u2019n audit in de praktijk? Is het vooral een gesprek of meer een verhoor? Wordt er diep technisch doorgevraagd of blijft het vooral procesmatig? Gaan auditors echt elk document nalopen of werken ze steekproefsgewijs?</p> <p>Toegangsbeheer / IAM</p> <p>Wij gebruiken IAM als centrale bron: Rollen en rechten zijn inzichtelijk per gebruiker We werken met RBAC (groepen) We houden bij wie en wanneer een periodieke toegangsreview is uitgevoerd</p> <p>Is dit in jullie ervaring voldoende voor toegangsbeheer, of verwachten auditors alsnog een apart overzicht met alle individuele accounts?</p>",

We have a fair share of incidents but the thing is that a majority of it happens during the EST timezone. As I work in the UTC timezone, we get work handed over which I work on. But most of the times the initial investigation &amp; analysis is already done in the shift before it gets handed over to us. It&#39;s rare that there&#39;s an incident that I get to work from start to end owning the entire incident response cycle.</p> <p>I often feel under utilized because of this so I have to work on something else like documentation, playbooks/runbooks &amp; and some automation. One thing I do often when I don&#39;t have any incident to work on is I take the IOCs from a previous incident and try to perform adversary infrastructure hunting (hunting for C2 IPs/domains that are not yet weaponized)",
