Every POV they have, there is always a line along the lines of, &quot;Glanced at Reyna and held his stare for longer than he should&quot;, &quot;She ached for Nathaniel and his square jaw and stubble&quot; and this is only at Chapter 26. Not to mention I find it hard to believe a Greycoat is afforded such unfettered access to Reyna EVEN at her insistence.</p> <p>My questions are: does this weirdness alleviate further along?
