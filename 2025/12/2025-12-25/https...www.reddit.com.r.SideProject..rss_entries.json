So I thought it would be good to have a skincare tool that scans your face and tells you what you need. </p> <p>Many people would just listen to what those influencers recommend. In fact, most of the products gone viral on TikTok are not suitable for every skin type, so my skin tool kind of helps them find the one they need without spending too much on guesswork. Kind of cool, right, haha.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how I use it: I scan my face and get the skin report, in which I can see all my skin issues, including dark circles, acne and so on. Then the tool will give me skincare essentials I need. The products recommended ranges from the lowest price to the highest for better user experience. </p> <p>Also added other sections looking for addressing your specific issue, like it has an acne SOS section in which you can find products not only suit",

A lot of freelancers miss good opportunities by minutes \u2014 not because of skill, but timing. I also tried a couple of paid bots, and a few times they went down, which is frustrating when you\u2019re paying a high subscription just for alerts. So a friend and I, who felt the same pain, decided to build a job alert bot with two clear priorities: reliability and fair pricing. The idea was to keep it simple, notify freelancers when a job matching their filters is posted, without unnecessary complexity.</p> <p>Now, we\u2019re preparing to launch it publicly as Pinglance in the start of Feb 2026.

It&#39;s basically a pomodoro timer but flipped - it is a stopwatch that runs all day and at different times of the day you can categorise your work eg distractions/and specific categories. It has helped me to see how much time I am wasting, and it helps me be more intentional with switching between distraction/work or tasks, as you have to categorise how you will spend your time. Definitely worth a try for anyone struggling with procrastination. <a href=\"https://trycontinuum.live\">https://trycontinuum.live</a></p> <p>Some screenshots:</p> <p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/Rpn4y11p\">https://ibb.co/Rpn4y11p</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://ibb.co/7tyHK1GM\">https://ibb.co/7tyHK1GM</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON -->",
