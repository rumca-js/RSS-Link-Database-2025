It&#39;s works right out the box no issue buuuut there is something that is driving me nuts. I am playing ghost of tsushima and some button prompts are wrong. Fast travel/standoff, the on screen prompt tells me to press X but I actually have to press Y (which corresponds to triangle and which is the correct button). R2 for picking up items shows up as a question mark and so does the menu button for privacy settings. Now I know the question mark means there is no mapped button, but in the R2 instance, when I press R2 it actually works. The fast travel thing is also not a remap settings since in combat, the X button actually works as intended. </p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/psnbuser\"> /u/psnbuser </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

I decided a few days ago that I didn\u2019t want to play casual rocket league through steam share from my brothers rocket league game. So, after installing heroic and running into controller problems (dual shock and steam deck controllers not working), I finally fixed it by installing the newest wine version, GEproton10.27. It was working fairly well, and pretty consistently (for a day and a half ish). Now, here I am, again, repeatedly launching rocket league in desktop mode hoping that it will let my controller through. For those who run rocket league this way, I would appreciate any help or advice and experience in this kind of problem! I\u2019m open to using others ways of running rocket league that are known to be better also. Thank you!</p> <p>Not sure if this means anything, but I know something recognizes the DualShock input in the start screen because I hear the sound that usually occurs when a start button is activated. Still, nothing happen",

I also use hyprland. and I used to get 300-400 fps in an empty map in cs2 but now I only get ~250. my GPU usage only ever gets to about 60%. I used to only see a small difference in framerate between linux and windows but its massive now, I also used to get at least 80% gpu usage, now it only ever gets to 60-70%. has anyone else noticed the performance getting worse on CS2 linux?
