And of course, the opposite: uncanny back-rooms kinda spaces that seem alien, or at least inhuman.</p> <p>Because it&#39;s Christmas, I am kinda craving examples of cozy, thick, &#39;thigmotaxic&#39; places in literature (although of course I&#39;d love to hear fun examples of the opposite as well!).
