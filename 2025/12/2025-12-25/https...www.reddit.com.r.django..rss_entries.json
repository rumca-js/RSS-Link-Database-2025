This year I won 2 hackathons building full-stack apps with DRF backends:</p> <ul> <li>1st Place at Sui Hackathon - Built TrustChain, an AI skill verification platform. DRF backend handles resume parsing, GitHub profile analysis, and stores verification reports on decentralized storage.</li> <li>2nd Runner Up at Code for Change (Nepal&#39;s biggest hackathon) - Built AutiSahara, an early autism screening platform. DRF API serves an M-CHAT-R/F questionnaire system and video analysis pipeline for doctors.</li> </ul> <p>My stack: Python, Django, DRF, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker. Also comfortable with React/TypeScript on the frontend when needed.</p> <p>Currently finishing my CS degree and looking ",
