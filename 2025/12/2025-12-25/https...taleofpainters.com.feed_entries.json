I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed sharing my thoughts on the hobby here on Tale of Painters, along with the models I\u2019ve completed throughout the year. Before I go any further, I\u2019d like to raise a glass to my good friends Garfy and Stahly, who have been so positive and encouraging. I can\u2019t thank you both enough for your friendship and guidance as I continue to develop as a painter. And another cheeky toast to all our readers who have been painting along with us. Cheers to you all!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/12/best-of-dunks-recap-of-2025-and-hobby-resolutions-for-2026/\">Best of: Dunk&#8217;s recap of 2025 and hobby resolutions for 2026</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
