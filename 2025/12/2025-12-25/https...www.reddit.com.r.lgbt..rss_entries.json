The one problem with this revelation as of late is the fact that everyone I know in real life and online knows me as <em>very</em> adamantly a lesbian. It\u2019s to the point that it\u2019s a major part of who I am as a person\u2014 and a section of my mind doesn\u2019t want to let go of that. But at the same time, I just don\u2019t like the labels of female or nonbinary. I\u2019m confused, and need some advice\u2014 firstly, have any other people gone through something similar? also, how do I even explain myself to any of my acquaintances in this situation??</p> <p>sorry if formatting is messed up and/or this sounds poorly phrased, it\u2019s 3am and im writing this on my phone </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EmpatheticOpossum\"> /u/EmpatheticOpossum </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1pv8x90/i_mi",
