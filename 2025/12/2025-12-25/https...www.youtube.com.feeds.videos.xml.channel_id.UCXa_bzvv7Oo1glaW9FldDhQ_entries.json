        "description": "In a generation of gaming hardware that has brought mind-blowing experiences to the table, it can be strange to think longingly of a game that was released on the last generation of systems. That's exactly what Deus Ex: Mankind Divided has us doing. \n\nIt's a title that's so unique, it's a long shot to hope that something like it comes along in the future, even as our games get all the more immersive. But what makes this addition to a popular franchise as memorable as it is to us? \n\nJoin us as we examine a title that's so well put together that it could be a beacon to other studios hoping to create the next best video game that captures the hearts and minds of gamers around the world.",

        "description": "Another year of some great shooter titles has gone by, and this one's been especially busy thanks to the release of some truly unique titles. From Battlefield 6 to the return of a few classics in the form of some excellent remasters, players who prefer to let their guns do the talking have been spoilt for choice when it comes to games that put said guns in their hands. \n\nHowever, only some of them have managed to rise above their competitors and among them, there can only be one winner. Join us as we take a look at the best shooters of the year, and pick a favorite from among them.",
