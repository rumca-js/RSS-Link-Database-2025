R.F. Kuang, ingenious as she is, has truly wrung the genre of almost of all of its potential in its current form. I get that the setting allows for highly stylized exposition and a commentary on hierarchical institutions, so I don&#39;t imagine we&#39;ll see an end to the cottage industry of Dark Academia franchise book series anytime soon.

I&#39;m reading a 9-book series right now centered around a spy named Bernard Sampson. Sampson is faithful. But so many of the people around him are regularly sleeping around behind their spouse&#39;s backs.</p> <p>I was prompted to write this post when one of the heroes of the book starts an affair, and the author writes [redacted to avoid major spoil",
