I wrote a short article about a pattern that\u2019s helped my team avoid cache-related bugs during rolling deployments:</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 <strong>Version your cache keys</strong> \u2014 by baking a version identifier into your cache keys, you can ensure that newly deployed code always reads/writes fresh keys while old code continues to use the existing ones. This simple practice can prevent subtle bugs and hard-to-debug inconsistencies when you\u2019re running different versions of your service side-by-side.</p> <p>I explain <strong>why cache invalidation during rolling deploys is tricky</strong> and walk through a clear versioning strategy with examples.</p> <p>Check it out here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://medium.com/dev-genius/version-your-cache-keys-to-survive-rolling-deployments-a62545326220\">https://medium.com/dev-genius/version-your-cache-keys-to-survive-rolling-deployments-a62545326220</a></p> <p>Would love to hear thoughts or experiences you\u2019ve had with cac",

A few findings that catch my eyes are :</p> <p>- AI-generated PRs had ~1.7\u00d7 more issues overall</p> <p>- Logic and correctness problems were significantly higher</p> <p>- Security and error-handling issues showed noticeable spikes</p> <p>- Readability and naming issues were much more common than I expected</p> <p>The report also points out some limitations (e.g detecting whether a PR was AI-authored isn&#39;t perfect), so it is not a &quot;AI is bad&quot; conclusion. It is more about where AI tends to struggle when it is used without strong guardrails.</p> <p>How I do is mostly UI related PR which has huge changes I test locally first to get glance whether really as per expectation or not.</p> <p>Curious abo",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted to create short programming animations consistently, but manual video editing was killing my motivation.</p> <p>So... I built a Python-based pipeline that generates an entire animated video (layout, animation timing, sound, voice, rendering) from a simple script-like input.</p> <p>The core idea is a very small domain-specific syntax embedded in comments. For example:</p> <pre><code>print(&quot;Hello World&quot;) ## type 20 wait 12 # This is a comment ## type 15 voice wait 10 </code></pre> <p>The program parses the file, extracts timing and animation instructions, and generates the full animation automatically.</p> <p>I also added a controllable terminal animation:</p> <pre><code>## wait 5 terminal open 15 wait 15 terminal write |&gt; Hello World| 10 yellow wait 5 </code></pre> <p>This allows me to script terminal interactions without using a traditional timeline or editor.</p> <p>The whole video renders in under a minute depending on length (",
