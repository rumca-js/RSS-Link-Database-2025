I found back to this hobby about 1 1/2 years ago and would like to play some rounds with her in the evening. Problem is, she can&#39;t stand &quot;longer&quot; boardgames. She says she had to play a lot of games like monopoly or Mensch \u00e4rgere dich nicht (we are from Germany) when she was a kid and those games were frustrating, therefore she has a general dislike for longer board games. I can totally understand that, these games are awful. </p> <p>We play games like uno, yatzi or other things together and with the kids and she does like them. Short rounds, easy gameplay. Now she wants to give longer, little more complex games another chance.</p> <p>I have games like 7 wonders duel or castles of burgundy at home already, but I can imagine that the rules and game time could mess with my chance of making her excited for better boa",

He has loved playing Pips (NYT Games) on his mom and my phone (and has gotten quite good). Now he has a set and doesn\u2019t really know what to do with it. Anybody have any suggestions of any sort of puzzle/strategy games he can play by himself for the times we can\u2019t play with him?
