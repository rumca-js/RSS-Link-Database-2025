It served me well even if this method was a bit archaic. Streaming sites for both live tv/sports and TV/movies could get cast to the Chromecast and watched on TV with basically no issue.</p> <p>But I&#39;m now running into the limitations of a 10+ year old device and wondering where I should pivot to. Since most stuff is now ripped in 1080p or better, the Chromecast 2nd gen is losing its functionality for me because it can&#39;t handle anything over 720p. I can&#39;t stream most new movies via Stremio for instance because the Chromecast just cant do it. </p> <p>I have an Android TV box, its an XPro88 Android 13 box but I don&#39;t really like it... it feels unwieldy compared to just &quot;go to website or fire up VLC and hit cast&quot;. I&#39;m ideally looking for simplicity and functionality over anything else. </p> <p>What&#39;s you",

After looking for any fan translation turns out that the developer was not interested in finding ways to let fans translate the game, even a remastered version was released but no other language rather than English was avaliable.
