        "description": "If you like this video and would like to see more like it, make sure to subscribe to Eurogamer on YouTube. \n\nBetween No Man's Sky, Starfield, and countless others, the space-sim genre has arguably never been in ruder health. But games that focus on space exploration have a fundamental problem: space is boring. \n\nIt's mostly empty, impossibly, unimaginable stretches of nothing, full of empty, rocky planets of no interest to anyone except NASA geologists and associated nerds. One of Starfield's designers, Bruce Nesmith, recently said as much in a rare podcast appearance, admitting that Starfield's biggest problem is that space is inherently boring.\n\nSo, how do you fix the space sim genre? How can Starfield 2 be better? Well, hear us out: by looking to games that are adjacent to the genre: space-based action RPGs, like Mass Effect or its Xbox Studios stablemate, The Outer Worlds 2. This is what What Starfield 2 Needs to learn from The Outer Worlds 2.\n\nThis video was created by Jim Trinca",
