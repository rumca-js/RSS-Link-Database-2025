Then the screen goes black and cuts to No Signal. I\u2019ve looked up the problem and looked at the config.txt file, which only tells me not to edit the file and that the file has been moved to /boot/firmware. This directory is empty (yes i checked for hidden files.) I also tried opening it in the terminal and using nano; blank document, does not exist. Trying to run the current Pi OS, 64-bit. Is there a way i can fix this, or should i try running another distro on here?</p> <p>I\u2019m running Arch Linux on my other computer trying to set this up, if that\u2019s relevant.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EffectiveTear7799\"> /u/EffectiveTear7799 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pvq9c6/no_h",

I\u2019ve got 3GB RAM allocated to the server, a handful of lightweight plugins (EssentialsX, LuckPerms, etc.), and usually only a few players online at a time, but I still see TPS drops and pretty high ping spikes (up to ~120ms) even when nobody is doing heavy exploration or big farms. The Pi is actively cooled, but CPU still seems to be the bottleneck. For anyone who\u2019s run a Minecraft server on a Pi 5, what specific config tweaks (view distance, simulation distance, Paper optimizations), overclock settings, or OS-level optimizations actually made a noticeable difference to performance and ping stability?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Patient_Attorney2830\"> /u/Patient_Attorney2830 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pv3rz3/how_should_i_speed_up_my_raspberry_pi_minecraf",
