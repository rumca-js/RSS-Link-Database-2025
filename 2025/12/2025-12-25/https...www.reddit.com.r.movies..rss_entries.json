There\u2019s wind, movement and atmosphere in almost every scene, which makes the world feel real and immersive.

The scene after he corners Dre in the alleyway is especially brutal. Dude <em>literally</em> beats the shit out of the kid (yes, you can see the poop stain afterward), and the entire time he\u2019s giving him a mafia style beatdown with his fist sinking into Dre\u2019s gut harder and harder each time, you can see the absolute sadistic glee on his face.</p> <p>Didn\u2019t stop at Dre either. This kid wanted the smoke with Jackie Chan (Mr. Han), a grown man, and treated a tournament with twelve year olds like this was his audition for the next",

I always watch The Ice Harvest followed by another movie. Last year, the second movie was Seven Psychopaths, not a Christmas movie but does have a message of &quot;love&quot; and &quot;peace,&quot; some what. This year, my second movie is Eyes Wide Shut, Criterion 4k which is amazing, which is set around Christmas. So is there any specific movies you watch on Christmas Eve in the late hours? Also, what are you drinking?
