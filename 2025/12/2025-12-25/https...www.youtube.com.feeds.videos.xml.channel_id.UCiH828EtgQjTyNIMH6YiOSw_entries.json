        "description": "Merry Christmas! Let's take a look at an obscure film that focuses on the misery of being together rather than the joy. Fa-la-la-la-la... DisneyCember continues with The Ref.\n\nWatch all DisneyCember here - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0AQIMR-tpomecW19RN2LNrdoqd5wFu4R\n\nWatch the new NC - https://youtu.be/QwaqimDaVws\n\nThe Ref (Hostile Hostages in some countries) is a 1994 American Christmas black comedy crime film directed by Ted Demme, written by Richard LaGravenese and Marie Weiss, and starring Denis Leary, Judy Davis, and Kevin Spacey. The plot centers on a burglar who, while evading capture from the police, is forced to take a bickering, dysfunctional family hostage on Christmas Eve. The burglar finds himself having to act as a de facto marriage counselor, or \"referee\", between the squabbling husband and wife, a situation that becomes more complicated when the husband's relatives drop by for Christmas dinner. \n\nTwitch - https://twitch.tv/channelawesome\nFacebook: https://w",
