I\u2019m sure I can learn much of this myself including a lot of other computer security things I need to understand better given adequate time and the right resources but time is something I don\u2019t have with this issue. I can explain the rest of the situation further in a different post or private message. And certain parts of this are better left unsaid given the sensitivity of my situation currently. No illegal activity going on whatsoever.. simply need relative certainty of private communications instead of going to town every day to play dead drop games with these idiots. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/billshermanburner\"> /u/billshermanburner </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pv4xjy/how_difficult_is_it_for_some",
