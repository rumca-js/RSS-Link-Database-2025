These numbers are used throughout math and physics, notably in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is the key to quantum physics. In 2021, physicists published a paper claiming that you can\u2019t entirely get rid of complex numbers in quantum physics, but two teams of physicists recently published papers disputing that claim. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper 1: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04160-4\nPaper 2: https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02808\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter",
