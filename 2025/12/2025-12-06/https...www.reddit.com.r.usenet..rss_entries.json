I have been trying over and over again to update my payment plan or re-sign up for an annual account. I know the card is good as I use it daily. Tried contacting support via email and phone, no response to either. Apparently they don&#39;t want my money. lol. Anyways just wanted to vent a bit while I research new providers. Anyone else have a similar issue with Astra? Or suggestions on a new provider? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Evolintent13\"> /u/Evolintent13 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1pg0lnf/astraweb_wont_take_my_money/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1pg0lnf/astraweb_wont_take_my_money/\">[comments]</a></span>",
