Trying to see how relevant they still are. The issue is that I actually do want to read several of them, and I&#39;m not trying to spoil them via reading through wikipedia summaries lol. SO, feel free to jump in and score the stuff you&#39;ve read or disagree with what I&#39;ve scored already. Total + which specific traits, like: <strong>3/8: 2, 3, 7</strong></p> <p><strong>LDR Score system</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Worldly Morality</strong>: Large-scale identified Wrongness that demands Healing. Any kind of story where a \u201ccorruption,\u201d \u201cscourge,\u201d or especially \u201cdarkness\u201d is realized as an existing threat and must be prevented/countered. Healing drives Quest. This applies even if the vindication to Heal this Wrongness is no",

However, I&#39;ve found literally zero evidence that he indeed is writing or at least has plans to write more stuff in this series. </p> <p>I&#39;m aware he&#39;s published another trilogy, which is in an entirely different world.

I like this last 1 in the series much more than the 2nd (Shortfall). RJB seems to be a prolific writer but I&#39;m running out of material.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I would love a book series that really excels at immersing the reader in a vivid world and characters. Sometimes, I feel like I am just told that a character is smart or kind, rather than the book putting effort into making me feel a part of the world. A book that allows the reader to understand the world and characters for themselves.</p> <p>I have very much enjoyed Realm of the elderlings, and Kingkiller Chronicles! They both hit the nail on the head for me, both from a story perspective(a good mystery and fascinating magic system is always a winner), but also in regards to how I felt a part of the world they created! I also loved the Hierarchy series, but did not get this level of &quot;immersion&quot;. I often see Sanderson recommended, but I have not been able to get into his books, unfortunately!</p> <p>I would love any suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TypicalTord\"> /u/TypicalTor",
