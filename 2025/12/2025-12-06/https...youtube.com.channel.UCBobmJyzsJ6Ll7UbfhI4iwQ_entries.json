        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, Epic\u2019s Cody Albert provides a deep dive into the current features of SlateIM and offers some examples of how you can use it to accelerate your debug tool development.\n\nIntroduced in Unreal Engine 5.6, the SlateIM plugin leverages the existing Slate UI framework to allow for quick debug tool development and iteration in a style that tools programmers should find much more familiar than traditional Slate syntax. \n\nThis talk covers everything from SlateIM features and usage to best practices and the SlateIM roadmap.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#SlateIM, #DebugTools, #UE5.6, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestStockholm",
