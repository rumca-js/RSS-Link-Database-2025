        "description": "It was an ordinary Saturday morning in February as Joe Lozito was on his way to work at Lincoln Center when he came face to face with a man who was on the run after killing 4 people. Now, nearly 15 years later, Lozito recounts to Inside Edition Digital how he took down New York City's most wanted man, \"Mad\" Max Gelman, and was hailed a hero afterward. However, after being stabbed in his face, head and body, Lozito still had to fight as he sued the city claiming police, who were on the subway car, hid, and did not protect him. The city denied his claims and his case was thrown out as a judge said police \"had no duty to protect\" him.",

        "description": "Five decades after its release, \"Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer\" just landed on USA Today's list of \"The Worst Christmas Songs Of All Time.\" It was recorded in 1979 by Dr. Elmo Shropshire and his wife Patsy who sold their veterinary hospital to pay for the music video. Jessica and Ashlee Simpson's rendition of \"The Little Drummer Boy\" also made the list. First on the list was \"The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)\" by Alvin and the Chipmunks.",
