But why?\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nYou can read more on this and other subjects here: https://9qq0.short.gy/m0b8dK\n\n\u201cFor some of us, today like every day, will mean another case of immersing ourselves, from the moment we wake up, in a by-now very familiar set of painful thoughts. We will dwell \u2013 once again \u2013 on how awful we look and more particularly, on how our nose is repulsively proportioned relative to the rest of our face. We will think \u2013 once again \u2013 of a website we inadvertently visited twelve years ago and how the police might be preparing to close in on, and arrest, us. We will think \u2013 once again \u2013 of how several of our neighbours (especially the people upstairs) might be colluding to ruin and disgrace us. Or we will think \u2013 once again \u2013 of something we said to a colleague which we fear they misconstrued and which may well lead them to seek disciplinary action",
