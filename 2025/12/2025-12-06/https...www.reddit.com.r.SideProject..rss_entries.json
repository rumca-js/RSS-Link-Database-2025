I didn&#39;t spent an penny to gain users , It&#39;s Completely organic. I&#39;ve developed NOOK - Shopping list. An Simple App to track and manage your shopping List just by scanning the Product&#39;s Barcode and that&#39;s all , The app is inspired by my recent visit to Japan where stores has an device which shows you the real time budget before Checkout. So, I found it good and built an App within 4 weeks. the App is live on play store and Now I&#39;m gonna add more such features in the Upcoming Update to help users and Mee. </p> <p>Check out NOOK : <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quarkstudio.nook\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quarkstudio.nook</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SarfirAman\"> /u/SarfirAman </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comme",
