I\u2019ve tried DFS channels and other channels as well. I also tried both 802ac and mixed modes. The channel width is set to 80MHz, but I still can\u2019t get past 866. My modem model is TP-Link Archer VR2100. Is there anyone who can help?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Crystallo07\"> /u/Crystallo07 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pfxbmx/tplink_archer_vr2100_ac2100_wifi_link_speed_is/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pfxbmx/tplink_archer_vr2100_ac2100_wifi_link_speed_is/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I have a quest 2 and enjoy that, but that doesn\u2019t have eye tracking, nor does it have any eye tracking related rendering tech.</p> <p>Does anyone know if I should be concerned? I tried emailing Gabe to no avail.

So far it plays well (I play the q3 standalone version) and I am okay for the surprisingly cheap price.</p> <p>But the game seems to be unfinished. It is rather short with only a handful levels. Of course you can replay them, but one replay is enough for me. Combat is kind of ridiculous, you wait for the enemy to hit you and block and only after exactly three blocks you can fight back. This is really poor. Lockpicking is also oversimplified.</p> <p>I am okay what I get for the price and will squeeze out 10-15 hours from this.

I spent 20 bucks for the headset, controllers, and a storage case. </p> <p>I recommend getting an older set if you wanna try out if VR is for you before making a big investment! </p> <p>Would also like to ask if anyone has any game reccs? I personally really like puzzle games but i\u2019m also a fan of psychological horror and base building games. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bowandteasing\"> /u/bowandteasing </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pfi1rx/",

For some reason, they started acting up out of nowhere. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: When I turn on one tracker, it connects perfectly (solid green light) and the base stations are fine too. But the moment I turn on a second tracker, it never pairs. It just stays on a blue light and eventually shuts off unless I turn the first tracker off. At first I thought it was just that one tracker, but I tested multiple others and they all do the exact same thing. As long as one tracker is on, none of the others will pair.
