Someone mentioned King\u2019s Dilemma recently and I jumped at the opportunity to play it again. The only issue is that we now have seven players. I vaguely remember the rulebook saying it only goes up to five. I think we stretched it to six during Covid but my memory is foggy.</p> <p>Has anyone played with seven. Did it still work well.

Questions are:</p> <p>1- When selecting our characters we chose 2 red classes characters (Barbarian and Warlord). When setting up our starting hands, both characters had listed the Haldberg as a weapon. But there is only 1 copy of that weapon in the weapons deck. What you do here? because in the rules book I was not able to find a definite answer. Should we just NOT choose 2 players from the same color class? does only one of us get the weapon? (this means 1 player will have 1 less card in the starting hand of the game). I ended up changing my character to a Crusader (white class character) so there were no conflict with our starting hand.</p> <p>2- At the end of the game we did the Character Advancement process: - From each market deck we only reveal 1 card? or one per character? - If one player buy",

The calculation is quick but a bit of a chore to do many times, and with many bases in play remembering them is hard too.</p> <p>I felt like this could be improved if we can have a power counter above bases and update any time the power changes, so calculation can be skipped later. I made some counters with numbers on a track and an arrow pointing to where the power is, but a slight bump would make the arrow slides around. I want to see if there&#39;s a better solution out there.</p> <p>I have heard about spindown dice but they seem to not work great if you",
