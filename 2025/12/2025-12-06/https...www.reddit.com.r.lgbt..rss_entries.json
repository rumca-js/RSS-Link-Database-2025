I know she\u2019s wrong and I don\u2019t understand her position, but I want to make this better for both of them. I feel annoyed that my mom is that upset about it, but that\u2019s the thinking that she was raised with.

But this is something I really wish to get off my chest because I got a little heated about the reactions people here had to a certain post involving Biden last night where he basically made a message to American queer youth saying that they are loved. I feel like everyone can agree that this is a nice little message, at least in a vacuum, but it&#39;s pretty clear that a very vocal minority did not really care about the message. Namely, it feels like there were a lot of people who basically used the post to vent about their problems with the Biden administration.</p> <p>Now, look, I am a progressive; I phonebanked for Mamdani during the primary (despite being an upstater) back when everyone thought Cuomo was guaranteed to win,",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I\u2019m really scared and need advice. I really regret what happened. On Thursday, I had oral sex with someone. He ejaculated in my mouth. At first, he told me he had no STDs, but now he says he does. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s being truthful or joking.</p> <p>I don\u2019t have any symptoms yet, but I have gum problems, though there was no bleeding at the time. I\u2019m terrified I could have been exposed to HIV or other STDs.</p> <p>I cannot afford much as I&#39;m student and I don\u2019t want to ask my parents for money for obvious reasons. I\u2019ve heard about PEP for HIV, but I\u2019m not sure what to do, where to go, or how urgent it is. Can someone guide me on what to do next, especially in Bhubaneswar? Are there PEP clinics or NGOs that can help students like me? I\u2019m really anxious and just want to make the right decisions to protect myself. Please help me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bigdickfluid\"> /u/bigd",
