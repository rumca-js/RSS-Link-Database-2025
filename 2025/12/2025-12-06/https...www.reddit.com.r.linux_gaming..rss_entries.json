I am quite new to Linux, and am dual-booting (separate SSD partitions) from Windows the latest Ubuntu (unfortunately some programs I need aren&#39;t supported so I&#39;ve yet to move completely). I&#39;ve been installing my Steam games and running them through the latest Proton, but despite them getting platinum rating on ProtonDB and not having any issues in the reviews, I&#39;ve been having input issues with multiple games.</p> <p>When I hold a key input (such as W) for some length of time, when releasing it stays held down for longer, and the extra time seems to increase the longer I initially held the input. This makes playing some games very difficult, as in FPS games (i.e. Ravenfield) I can&#39;t stop walking forwards or anything. It&#39;s also been an issue in other 3d games like KSP, however I haven&#39;t noticed it in Celeste, so it may be an issue with 3d stuff or Unity. I tried to find online solutions, but it all seems to e",

(It&#39;s an FPS game with dinosaurs). I&#39;ll get to the point quickly: The game does NOT run well. In certain areas, it&#39;s under 30FPS on the lowest possible settings and resolution. </p> <p>I felt that wasn&#39;t right, so I booted into Windows and tried running the game there. And the game runs absolutely fine on Windows. I&#39;d even say it runs decently well on Windows, from what I tested. </p> <p>I&#39;ve seen some performance degradation when running Windows games on Linux occasionally, but I can&#39;t remember the last time it was this bad. So I figured I&#39;d ask here if someone perhaps knew of a way to fix the issue, or if it&#39;s something the developer has to fix. (I know I could just play it on Windows, but I&#39;d rather not unless I truly have to, especially if it&#39;s a simple fix that I&#39;m just un",

What are the other options i have?</p> <p>Edit: Whenever i try to use gaemmoderun %command% as a launch command, something weird happens, as soon as the startup screen gets stuck, i have to press alt tab, and as long as i keep pressing the button the game resumes as normal.

The things I find useful from it are the multiple channel audio mixer with a virtual sound card for each channel. This is so useful for me because I use my Bose QC Ultra headphones for gaming along with a blue yeti mic. Only problem is that because the headphones are BT when I use them in a game with voice chat without doing this, they always seem to get forced into headset mode rather than headphones. Which makes the game audio come out mono, making it sound terrible. With Sonar it always kept audio devices no matter what I was doing, like it would auto switch if I turned my headphones on or off, and I could even do things like send voice chat output from games to the chat virtual sound card rather than the gaming one, so it got processed differently.</p> <p>On top of this there were the nice to haves, parametric EQ, virtual surround, per game audio profiles e",

My initial plan was to dual boot Bazzite or CachyOS with Windows 10 till I get better acquainted with Linux. I&#39;d like to avoid compatibility issues on the Linux side. </p> <p>I was leaning toward getting one of the MSI MAG Tomahawk motherboards, the B850 or X870E. But I&#39;ve read that WIFI 7 isn&#39;t supported on Windows 10 on the latest boards and that intel network chips are better supported on Linux vs Realtek and others. The B650 version is an option but they still use Realtek for networking. I could also just use 11 over 10 on the Windows side of things but was hoping to avoid 11.</p> <p>While I won&#39;t rely on WIFI 100% of the time, there are times I move my PC somewhere I can&#39;t use a wired connection.</p> <p>So wondering if I am overthinking things and should go with one of the three MSI MAG Tomahawks or if there is something that work",
