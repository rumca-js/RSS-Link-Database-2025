But with regulators and rivals still waiting in the wings, it might just be the start of the saga.\n\nAnd one of the biggest controversies in Eurovision history has been in the news. Four countries (Spain, Netherlands, Slovenia and Ireland) have pulled out over Israel's continued participation in the competition. Remaining countries have until next week to confirm whether they will participate but it raises some difficult questions for the BBC amidst petitions for the them to boycott too.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

        "description": "Driving instructors are being offered kickbacks of up to \u00a3250 a month to sell their official test-booking login details to touts, a BBC investigation has found.\n \nTouts use these login details to book driving tests in bulk and sell them to learners on WhatsApp and Facebook, charging as much as \u00a3500 for tests that should cost no more than \u00a375. \n \nThis makes it harder for learners to book through legitimate routes and adds to already lengthy waiting times.\n \nThe BBC confronted Anil Ahmed, who buys driving instructors' login details and then sells tests online at a mark-up. He says the claims we put to him are a \"complete fabrication\".\n \nTransport Secretary Heidi Alexander recently announced plans to change driving test rules, which it is hoped will stop touts and reduce the backlog. Only learners - not instructors - will be able to book test slots from spring 2026. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#DrivingTest #UK #B",
