        "description": "Only 7% of Europe's original area of peatlands remain. What's more: their climate boundaries are shifting.  An international study led by Wageningen University as part of the WaterLANDS project analyzed the current distribution of peatlands and mapped their likelihood of remaining under future climate scenarios. They conclude that climate change will massively impact peatland functioning except for the most cool and wet parts of northern Scandinavia, Ireland, Scotland and in the mountains.",
