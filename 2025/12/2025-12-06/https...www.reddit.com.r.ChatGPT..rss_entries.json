It walked me through my day step by step and I told it when I got so sleepy I had to nap right in my car. (I do gig work) It gave me a huge epiphany. This happens every time I go work. Sometimes it&#39;s an hour in sometimes it takes all day and I&#39;m absolutely drained when I get home. Chatgpt brought up the idea that I&#39;m having anxiety shutdowns and it makes perfect sense when I get home and I am suddenly awake. Though today I had to lay down for 2 hours. I&#39;m going to be talking with my psychiatrist about this soon. </p> <p>In essence, AI is useful and brought up something I hadn&#39;t realized or thought about and I hate how people shit on it when it&#39;s genuinely helping make things better for me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/V0idK1tty\"> /u/V0id",
