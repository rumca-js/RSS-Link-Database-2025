Netflix has entered into a definitive agreement to buy Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO, and HBO Max, in a deal worth $82.7 billion.\nSo, a 100 year old movie studio is being bought by a 28 year old streaming service that started out as a DVD by mail service.\nThis all means that Netflix would now be the home of HBO and all its properties including Game of Thrones. The DC Universe. Harry Potter. And video game franchises like Mortal Kombat, the Batman Arkham franchise, and the Travellers Tales Lego games like Lego Star Wars and the upcoming Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight.\nMergers like this usually mean raising prices -- just look at what happened with Xbox\u2019s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and the price of Game Pass.\nDaemon, Seth, and Michael are here to break it all down for you.",
