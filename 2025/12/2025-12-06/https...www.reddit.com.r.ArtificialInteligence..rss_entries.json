Such agents would be available to individuals at low cost\u2014perhaps a few hundred dollars per month for access to a team&#39;s worth of capability. Whether this future arrives in two years or twenty, the implications are worth considering now.</p> <p>It is understandable that people spend a lot of time worrying about how AI could displace them and lead to mass unemployment. It ties into personal fears, which means it gets a lot of traction in discourse, and it has historical precedent (which I won&#39;t bother repeating).

Tasks that used to go to juniors just never appear anymore because one person with AI can do them on the side. Writing code, fixing bugs, writing tests, drafting documentation, doing basic analysis, even helping with design and planning, it feels like every part of the process is being squeezed a bit tighter and the human part keeps shrinking. What really makes it scary for me is that the tech is clearly not even close to done.
