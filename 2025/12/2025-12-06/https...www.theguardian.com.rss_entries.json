        "description": "<p>A moment of sheer brilliance in the 65th minute from Rayan Cherki had all at the Etihad Stadium sucking air in awe. The Frenchman burst along the right and cut back, then delivered a scintillating rabona plum on to the head of Phil Foden, who nodded home off the bar. Manchester City had cruised to a 3-0 lead and were heading for second, two points off the top, after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/06/aston-villa-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal\u2019s defeat at Aston Villa</a>.</p><p>The manager will adore Cherki\u2019s man-of-the-match display as much as there being no second-half defensive horror show to follow the one at Fulham, and you have to wonder if City will again break the hearts of the Gunners come May, when the title is handed out. If Cherki continues to star as he did here then he will join Foden and Erling Haaland as City\u2019s gun attackers who will give them the best chance of yet another crown.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/",
