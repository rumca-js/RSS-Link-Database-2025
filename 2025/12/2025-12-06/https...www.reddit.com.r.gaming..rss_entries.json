When you get to Viewros, the first few minutes feel amazing, scanning the flora, learning about the planet and it&#39;s creatures etc. but then you meet this NPC and the curated atmosphere that the game creates completely flips on itself and now you have a Deadpool wannabe character in the story, and from here on out the game doesn&#39;t quite feel like a Metroid game. There are sparse moments when it does feel like one but through out the majority of it you&#39;re either babysitting an uninteresting NPC or being directed on where to go",
