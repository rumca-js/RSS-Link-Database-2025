She explores relationships, love, pain and grief in a deep yet accessible way. I first became aware of Lily\u2019s writing when I read a Vogue article titled: My Boyfriend, his Best Friend and Me: A Love Story. That article describes a love triangle that happens at University that reverberates across all of their lives for many years. Lily dates a guy who&#39;s a bit of a dink and doesn&#39;t treat her super well and she falls for the best friend. Heart the Lover is a fictionalized expansion of that Vogue piece. I was not ready for this book. The Vogue article knocked me flat emotionally and this book does that and then some. Relationships are joyful and painful and they almost never go the way you expect them to. Lily King navigates those complex emotional dynamics with gravitas and grace. If you have the time, read that Vogue pi",

I didn&#39;t understand the book at first-I thought it was like all other books where you sit by yourself, read one page in silence, turn the page, read the next page in silence, until you&#39;re done, you put it on your bookshelf, and that&#39;s that. It&#39;s dinner time.</p> <p>I can&#39;t remember how I realised this is a different book, it&#39;s not a book to hide away, but a book to show off to people, to watch them hunt for the rabbit hidden on each page, to read out the riddles, to laugh out loud, to be completely and absolutely charmed by this gorgeous, gorgeous book.</p> <p>I remember showing ",

I\u2019ve taken to reading analyses by others to see what their takes are. I\u2019ve been watching YouTube videos on literary analysis. I\u2019ve been underlining, taking notes, and writing chapter summaries of what I\u2019m reading. Having never done any of this before, I\u2019m finding it hard work. And honestly, it makes reading less enjoyable because of that hard work!</p> <p>I tell myself that all this will get easier and in the end, I\u2019ll get more out of the books I read. But, to what purpose? Maybe it\u2019s the connection I could make with some of my favourite authors.

Written entirely from the pov of the protagonist, it details her experiences, her little wins, and the climax of the story builds steadily as shades shift from warm to cold. I especially like how, similar to cinematography, the descriptions of objects in any given scene are used to convey to the reader the tone of the story. All in all it was borderline horror set in early American society i believe, and very much a treat to read. </p> <p>I plan to read and review one short story a day, I hope that is ok.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bakakura\"> /u/Bakakura </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pfegl2/getting_back_into_reading_one_short_story_a_day/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pfegl2/getting_back_into_reading_one_short_story_a",
