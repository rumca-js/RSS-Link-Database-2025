So I&#39;m wondering, is the creation in general of a resource pack considered programming - assuming one is mainly spending time working with json and .fsh files? </p> <p>I feel like the answer should be no, but at the same time there&#39;s a lot of interesting if/else logic that goes into json files in my case, so I&#39;m not sure. </p> <p>p.s. to be clear, I&#39;m not asking so I can brag about me being a programmer or wtv to anyone, just interested in what y&#39;all think. obviously coding an actual app or smth like that will always be much more actual programming than resource",
