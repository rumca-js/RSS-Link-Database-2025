This season could hardly be more different; they are neither unfussy nor competent. They led 2-0 and, four minutes intostoppage time, they led 3-2, and yet still they didn\u2019t win it. It was tremendous fun, but Arne Slot will have hated it.</p><p>Just as no side can be sure whether a win at West Ham in their previous away match means they\u2019ve played well or were just playing West Ham, so it would be unwise to read too much into this mishmash of the haplessness and excellence. Their three goals all resulted from fine finishes and one from clever buildup play, but the image of the game \u2013 once again \u2013 would be Virgil van Dijk standing hands on hips, steam rising both literally and metaphorically as he glared in disbelief at the bizarrely diffident defending around him.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/06/leeds-li",

Stuck in the wilds of Donegal for two weeks as part of teacher training, I listened to Broadway musicals while the rest of the lads watched the Gaelic fixtures and got drunk. I stumbled upon the recent production of Merrily We Roll Along<em> </em>with Jonathan Groff and Daniel Radcliffe and like most of the internet, I became obsessed.</p><p>Afterwards, I went down a Groff rabbit hole tracking down interviews and cast recordings. I was drawn to how bubbly he was, how smiley he was. Groff had a joyous energy that was infectious. His voice was like melted chocolate. I both loved \u2013 and envied \u2013 his calmness and his openness to the world.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/dec/06/my-cultural-awakening-jonathan-groff-overcome-stammer\">Continue rea",
