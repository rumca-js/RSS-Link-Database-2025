        "description": "FGF19 triggers the brain to burn more energy and activate fat-burning cells, offering a potential new path for obesity treatments. The hormone enhances thermogenesis and reduces inflammation, but only when the sympathetic nervous system is active. Researchers uncovered how cold exposure increases receptor expression for FGF19 in the hypothalamus, hinting at an evolutionary role in temperature regulation. Ongoing work aims to discover how to boost natural production of this powerful metabolic hormone.",

Orbiting sensors tap into Earth\u2019s enormous natural polarized spin source and benefit from low-noise periodic signal modulation. A robust prototype with advanced noise suppression and radiation-hardened engineering now meets the requirements for space operation. The long-term goal is a powerful space-ground network capable of exploring dark matter and other beyond-Standard-Model phenomena.",

Even more surprising, AI could help accelerate green technologies rather than hinder them.",

Using an expanded molecular clock approach, the team showed that crucial cellular features emerged in ancient anoxic oceans long before oxygen became a major part of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Their results indicate that early complexity developed slowly over an unexpectedly long timescale.",

Using advanced RNA imaging techniques, the team mapped more than 330,000 genetic signals from tens of thousands of neurons, revealing crisp, shifting bands of cell types that run along the length of the hippocampus. This layered organization may help explain why different parts of CA1 support different behaviors and why certain neurons break down more easily in disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and epilepsy.",

These bright arcs and faint clouds reveal where tiny planet-building bodies collide, break apart, and reshape their systems. Some disks contain sharp edges or unusual patterns that hint at massive planets still waiting to be seen, while others resemble early versions of our own asteroid belt or Kuiper belt. Together, the images form one of the most complete views yet of how newborn solar systems evolve and where undiscovered worlds may be hiding.",
