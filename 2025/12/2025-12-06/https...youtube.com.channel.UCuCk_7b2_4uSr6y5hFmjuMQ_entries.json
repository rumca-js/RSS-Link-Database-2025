        "description": "The Last Starship is exploding across the comics world, and in this episode of Heroes Journey, writers Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly join Sean O\u2019Connell to break down why The Last Starship is resonating with longtime Trek fans and bringing in brand-new readers. From its bold reinvention of Star Trek storytelling to the emotional return of James T. Kirk, this conversation dives deep into how the creative team built a comic that feels urgent, contemporary, and uniquely human.\n\nLanzing and Kelly open up about the early drafts, the surprising fan reception to Last Starship #1, rising sales into issue #3, and how the series intentionally welcomes readers who have never considered themselves \u201cStar Trek people.\u201d They also explore how the book tackles failing institutions, societal collapse, and the challenge of maintaining a utopian ideal \u2014 without becoming a one-to-one allegory for modern news cycles.\n\nNext, Sean and Sierra discuss all the new ways the world of Star Trek can be explored ",
