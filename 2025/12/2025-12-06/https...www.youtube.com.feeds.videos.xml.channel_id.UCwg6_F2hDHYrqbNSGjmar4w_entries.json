        "description": "The silent bear of the Andes, the spectacled bear is a monk-like giant of the hills. It has an ethereal aura, which has made it the inspiration for the cartoonishly friendly Paddington Bear. But despite it's ghostly presence, it's a real survivor who has adapted to life in one Earth's most unique ecosysystems: the paramo. Can our team find this elusive bear? Or will it just disappear like a mountain ghost?\n\nGet your copy of \"Strange Creatures\" now!
