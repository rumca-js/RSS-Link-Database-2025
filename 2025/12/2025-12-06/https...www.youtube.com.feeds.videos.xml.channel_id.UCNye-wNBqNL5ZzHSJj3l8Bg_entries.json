        "description": "How do the legacies of empire continue to shape politics today? In his new book, Slow Poison: Idi Amin, Yoweri Museveni, and the Making of the Ugandan State, Mahmood Mamdani examines how colonial rule shaped Uganda\u2019s political institutions and the leaders who emerged from them.\n\nMamdani also reflects on political change closer to home: His son, Zohran Mamdani, is poised to become the first Muslim mayor of New York City - a victory he says reveals deep generational shifts in US politics.\n\nThis week on UpFront, Marc Lamont Hill speaks with renowned scholar Mahmood Mamdani about colonial legacies, multipolarity, and what these shifts mean for global politics today.\n\n#zohranmamdani #uganda #unitedstates #yowerimuseveni #newyork #politics #upfront #marclamonthill",
