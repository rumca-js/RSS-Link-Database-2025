        "description": "A Zero G flight is incredibly strenuous \u2013 not just for the occupants (though definitely them too, it\u2019s called the Vomit Comet for a reason!) but also for the plane! \n\nA Zero G flight requires 3 pilots to complete 31 maneuvers that involve repeatedly experiencing VERY steep inclines, HEAVY G forces, and casually diving toward the Earth. \n\nI assumed these planes needed to be specially designed and reinforced to pull this off. \n\nIt turns out\u2026 I was wrong.
