        "description": "Turn your Windows 11 desktop or laptop into an Xbox-style living room console.\nIn this video I show you how to enable Xbox Full Screen Experience Mode (FSE) on any compatible Windows 11 machine using the Xbox Insider Hub, and then test RAM usage and performance in real games. We\u2019ll walk through the full setup step-by-step, from joining the right Insider channels to configuring Full Screen Experience to auto-launch on startup. Then I\u2019ll jump into some real-world testing with a desktop and a laptop to see how much RAM it actually saves and whether there\u2019s any real performance gain in games like Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nLearn More Here: https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/11/21/full-screen-experience-expands-to-more-windows-11-pc-form-factors-for-windows-insiders/\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Black Friday Sale code for software\uff1aETA \nWindows 11 Pro Key($23):https://biitt.ly/RUZiX \nWin",
