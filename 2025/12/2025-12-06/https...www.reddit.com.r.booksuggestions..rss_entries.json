He\u2019s read every Louis L\u2019Amour novel about 50 times, as well as most Zane Gray and similar. He\u2019s got hundreds of books like this from the 70s and 80s so I think it needs to be something released 2000-present to avoid buying him something he already has. The L\u2019Amour are his favorites, and I\u2019d love to find him something comparable. (He also read a lot of early James Patterson in an effort to branch out - my recollection is he didn\u2019t love the writing but liked the overall plot?)</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t like books with a lot of on-page gruesome violence or any sex, etc. so trying to avoid those. My thought was maybe cozy mysteries set in the old west?

I\u2019ve also read the Untethered Soul and am about 1/2 through Living Untethered. I liked the Untethered Soul a lot but something about it just wasn\u2019t as uplifting as the Four Agreements. I\u2019ve also read the Fifth Agreement, the Mastery of Love (I don\u2019t think I got all the way through this one) the Voice of Knowledge (haven\u2019t read in 3 or 4 years, might re-read) the Gifts of Imperfection (that was just meh to me), 7 Rules for Life, the Subtle Art of not Giving a Fuck, and How to Win Friends and Influence People.

She recently read Taylor Jenkins Reid\u2019s \u201cThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo\u201d and absolutely loved it, she couldn\u2019t put it down and it has reignited her desire to read. She said she loved the style of writing of this book and the way the author tells stories. So my question is, to anyone who has read the book and others from this author; Which of her books are most similar to The Seven Husbands, are written in the same style, or do you think would be most enjoyed by someone who was a fan of The Seven Husbands. I\u2019m open to other suggestions as well of course :) </p> <p>Thank you guys in advance! Hoping to find another book or two that my girlfriend will enjoy and that will inspire the same emotions as when she cracked the spine of The Seven Husbands. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Canad",

She has a huge imagination and creates a ton of unique OCs and art, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily an opposition to fantasy, just the ones I read. </p> <p>There are two Roblox games she\u2019s told me about that have super unique plots and she loves reading comics/fanfiction about them. One is Dandy\u2019s World and the other is Forsaken. The Dandy\u2019s World comics she reads are just fanfics based off the characters and not based in the game world, while I believe the Forsaken comics she reads are also based in the Forsaken world.

Which makes it hard to just look on Amazon or Goodreads to find what I\u2019m looking for. </p> <p>What I\u2019m looking for is a book with a Male MC, personality not very cheery. Has some kind of struggle the whole story. Emotional turmoil, addiction, anxiety- Think James Sunderland from SH2. I don\u2019t often enjoy books where half the story revolves around the love interest. Not against there being a side love story, but don\u2019t want it to be part of the main plot. The genres I don\u2019t gravitate towards are Science Fiction, fantasy, or historical (fiction or non). I enjoy suspense, but also just emotional stuff. Like psychological horror. I\u2019ve been into older western outlaw type of books rn. Like showing the darker side of the Wild West. I\u2019m not usually against any time period, but the ones I like are set in 1770-1935. Then 2001-2009. I like books like The Sister Brothers, The Chill, and The Revenant. Last pic",

I looked up a few spoilers and the rest of the books have a lot more sexual violence and I will not be finishing.</p> <p>I prefer medium steam. High steam isn&#39;t a deal breaker but sometimes I end up skipping through those scenes.
