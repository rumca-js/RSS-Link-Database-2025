        "description": "For $40, the content that Renegades lacks, no Strikes or Crucible maps, only one Exotic gear piece per class, no new region (unless you count Tharsis Outpost, which you shouldn't), cuts a little too deep. I probably wouldn't mind it so much if there were tons of fresh ideas, instead, a good portion feels very \u201cBeen there, done that,\" except those times had better characters and mission design.\n\nIf The Edge of Fate dissuaded you from ever engaging with Destiny 2 again, then Renegades is at least worth a try. It may pleasantly surprise the most jaded fans, offer some enjoyable loot for the most hardcore, and maybe remind you of the good times in the Star Wars universe. While never meant to be this giant momentum shift for the franchise that would finally steer it in the right direction, I find myself, as always, yearning for more.",

        "description": "Since the hovering view over Fjord-like territories announced Skyrim\u2019s follow-up at E3 2018, Bethesda has offered almost nothing concrete about The Elder Scrolls VI. No trailer, no confirmed setting, not even a pixel of concept art. For a series whose influence imbues every modern-day RPG, their silence only intensifies the notion this game is forever out of reach.\n\nIn the past few months, however, Todd Howard has been progressively opening the curtain, offering tiny glimpses of Bethesda\u2019s internal mindset. And despite talking more about other projects, he\u2019s given something resembling clarity for The Elder Scrolls VI\u2019s expectant fans.",
