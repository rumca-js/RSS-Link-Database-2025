I have added this existing ZFS pool as a ZFS Storage type in the Datacenter menu, and now in the PVE Node it&#39;s mounted at /pool, with all the subvolumes inside.</p> <p>Am I understanding this right - when I give an LXC a mount point through the resources it creates a CT Volume - so basically a separate subvolume? I haven&#39;t tested adding stuff to this because I wanted to add my existing subvolumes.</p> <p>And the only way to add existing subvolumes is to edit the config and mount it by using the /pool path and doing user and group adds to the unprivileged LXC?</p> <p>I did this with cockpit and made an SMB share for my immich subvolume. But from what I understand, NOW I&#39;ll need to mount this SMB share in my PVE Node (with the samba user and passwd) -&gt; Attach this NEW mount to my immich LXC.</p> <p>So I will basically have my ZFS /p",
