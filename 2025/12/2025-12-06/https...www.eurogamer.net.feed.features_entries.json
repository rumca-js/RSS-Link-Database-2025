I was stumped; maybe because I've been so coddled by modern gaming's frequent insistence on eradicating all but the most minor of friction points that - without a conspicuous Post-it note secreted in the immediate vicinity, a blatant on-screen objective marker to beckon me onward, or (sigh) a chatty companion ready to spit out the answer four seconds in - I wasn't sure how to proceed. And then it hit me. Not 20 minutes earlier, I'd explicitly printed out my own ID card and pinned it to my chest - all the game wanted me to do was look down.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/cracking-sci-fi-horror-routine-escapes-a-decade-of-development-hell-as-a-great-reminder-that-patronising-game-design-can-do-one\">Read more</a></p>",
