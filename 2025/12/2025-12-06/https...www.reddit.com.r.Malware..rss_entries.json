The linked form contains a Dropbox link that lets you download the supposed salary structure and terms docs. </p> <p>But the link led me to a zip file. I knew something was amiss. Since I was using Linux, I downloaded the file file anyway. It contained an exe named Salary Structure. I uploaded the file to virus total and yes it turned out to be trojan.</p> <p>I alerted the LinkedIn communuty in a post. It seems, other peoe are receiving such messages too.</p> <p>Interestingly, if you show any suspicion, the mule account sends another DM along lines of - Sorry someone hacked my account bla bla...
