        "description": "In August 1944, shortly after the Allied landings in Normandy, Flight Lieutenant Walter Dinsdale and Pilot Officer Jack Dunn of the Royal Canadian Air Force were flying their de Havilland Mosquito heavy fighter over the invasion beaches when they spotted an unusual shape in the distance. For several moments, the airmen struggled to make heads or tails of the strange aircraft, as Dinsdale later recounted:\n\n\u201cI recognized it as a [Junkers] Ju-88 [bomber] but couldn\u2019t figure out what the thing on top was. I thought it was one of their glider bombs mounted in a new way. It was on top, mounted between the rudder and the main wing.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, however, the aircraft\u2019s precise identity was unimportant. All that mattered was that it was German - and thus a fair target. Unfortunately for the Germans, the aircraft proved easy pickings for Dinsdale and Dunn:\n\n\u201cIt was retribution for Jerry for thinking up such things. [It was] an awkward thing which lumbered along at about 150 miles an hour\u2026it",
