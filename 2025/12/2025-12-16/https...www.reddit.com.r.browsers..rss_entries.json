On Android, I normally use Brave and Firefox for regular browsing and important stuff. But for YouTube, neither gives the experience i want (built-in player, proper full screen, no ads). I tried Samsung Internet, but YouTube ads still show. Then i tried Quetta Browser and honestly, for YouTube it\u2019s perfect: strong ad blocking, built-in video player, smooth full screen. The issue is that Reddit reviews about Quetta are mostly negative, especially around privacy and trust. So my question is simple: Is it safe to use Quetta ONLY for watching YouTube, YouTube Music, and streaming movies? No logins, no accounts, no banking, no personal data just video streaming. All important browsing will stay on Brave/Firefox. I\u2019m trying to understand the real risk here, not panic or assumptions. Would appreciate technical or practical answers. Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",
