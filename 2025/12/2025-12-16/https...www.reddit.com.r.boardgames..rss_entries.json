Some players were way more engaged because of visuals components atmosphere and the overall vibe. Others almost didn\u2019t care about that at all and focused only on decisions balance and how the system works. It made me think about how people actually judge games at the table. When mechanics are solid does production really change the experience for you or is it just a nice bonus.</p> <p>And guys I\u2019m really curious about one more thing. How interested are you in lore in board games. Do you usually read the story when you open the box or the rulebook or do you skip it and just start playing. I\u2019m not talking about heavy narrative games just regular hobby games.

I would have been 5 or 6. It could have been a few years later, but I doubt it was much earlier. We did buy it new. It was a pirate themed game. The board was a 3D ship. From what I recall the goal was to climb to the top of the ship perhaps getting to the crow&#39;s nest was how you won. The twist was that there were hazards and the board itself moved causing pieces to rock or fall.</p> <p>The one thing I can concretely remember was there was a plastic barrel which had a ball bearing on the bottom and it rolled around. Either this was the main hazard or the main gimmick. The game may have had a ghost theme to it or a ship in a storm theme. I googled for this, but my details are pretty vague here. I want to say the name was also some sort of play on words. Maybe a pirate command like &quot;Ahoy!&quot;, &quot;Walk the Plank!&quot;,",
