Unfortunately, the official Garmin website only hosts the absolute latest update bundle, and I can&#39;t find any official archives.

So first I used the DownThemAll browser extension to download the MP3 files, then I imported them into Audacity and found the book on Spotify, so I could have the timestamps for the chapter cuts. I made the chapter cuts, exported them, put everything into my Plex folders, and now I can take the book wherever ",

I wanted to watch a show but most streaming places in my country don&#39;t have subtitles included but Netflix does.</p> <p>I start the first episode and it says I have until next week to finish the show before they pull it from the service. </p> <p>Why bother advertising that you have this in your library if I have to rush to finish it in a few days. I also had to pay for HD streaming and sharing within my own house. </p> <p>I remember you had to wait for them to mail you the physical disc, but at least I could enjoy the content without all these bullshit restrictions. </p> <p>I&#39;m back to torrenting it next week I guess. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/crinklypaper\"> /u/crinklypaper </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1pno9m",
