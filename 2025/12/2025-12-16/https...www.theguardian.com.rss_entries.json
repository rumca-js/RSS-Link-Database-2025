The internet is full of DIY advice, and one of the most popular tips is to mix washing-up liquid with water and use it as a pest spray. It\u2019s cheap, easy and always within reach. But it\u2019s not without risk.</p><p><strong>The hack</strong><br>\n A diluted detergent solution is said to break down the waxy coating of soft-bodied pests, dehydrating them on contact. It can work wonders on aphids, spider mites and thrips, killing them quickly without the need for harsh chemicals. But household detergents weren\u2019t made for plants. The wrong formula or a heavy hand can cause serious leaf burn, leaving behind residue that stresses your plant more than the pests did.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/16/houseplant-hacks-does-washing-up-li",

For a start, the high-achieving 16-year-old went into labour in the school toilets, having not even realised she was pregnant. Not long afterwards, she was forced to tell her boyfriend he wasn\u2019t the father \u2013 the baby was the product of a fling with another classmate.

By treating horror as an art form rather than a cheap set of jump scares, this thrilling new show, which wears its connection to the world of the Paranormal Activity film franchise lightly, proves how jaw-clenchingly, arm-clutchingly frightening horror on stage can be. Under the direction of Punchdrunk\u2019s Felix Barrett, the in-the-moment fear is acute. But what is remarkable, thanks to Chris Fisher\u2019s eye-popping illusions, is how that terror is accompanied by a giddy, awe-filled delight at the devilry we just witnessed \u2013 and how the hell they made it work.</p><p>In Oren Peli\u2019s original movie, a young couple set up home video cameras to capture night hauntings. The brilliance of Barrett\u2019s production is in the ditching of screens, too often relied on",
