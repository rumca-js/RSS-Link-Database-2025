Neil deGrasse Tyson and Paul Mecurio answer a grab bag of fan questions about black hole mergers, the misconception about gravity assists, and if there\u2019s such a thing as laws of physics.\n\nCould you see the merger of two black holes from inside one? What would the collision even look like without outside reference points? Neil breaks down nested universes, warped timelines, and what falling through the event horizon really means for your perception of the outside world.\nListeners ask whether we could detect when we crossed an event horizon, how spaghettification feels moment to moment, and whether time dilation means the universe outside would speed ahead as you descend. We explore Hawking radiation, particle pairs, and whether black holes truly evaporate. Plus, the practical question: what observational evidence do we actually have?",
