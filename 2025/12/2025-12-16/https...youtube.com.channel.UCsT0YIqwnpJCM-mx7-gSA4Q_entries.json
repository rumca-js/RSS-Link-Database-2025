        "description": "What happens when lying no longer shocks us and dishonesty become normal? In this eye-opening talk, Skylar Hughes, a journalist and psychological researcher, explores why our outrage at fake news has faded and what that means for democracy. Hughes reveals how repeated exposure to lies changes our brains, shifts our social norms, and threatens our moral compass. Skylar Hughes is a Robertson Scholar at Duke University, combining psychological research with frontline experience in combating misinformation. As part of CNN's fact-checking unit, she verified over 100 articles, broadcast packages, and scripts, serving on the Republican National Convention live fact-checking team. Her expertise extends to the Poynter Institute, where her content reached over 150,000 people.\n\nA Kenan Ethics Fellow, Hughes has explored the moral dimensions of misinformation and digital communication. At Duke\u2019s Marsh Memory Lab, she secured grant funding to lead experimental research on misinformation correction",

        "description": "In this talk, Sunil Sharma stresses upon remaining grounded in successes, and recovering from failures of life. \n\nHe relates to a tough lesson he received early in life. A sudden success, and the resulting admiration of well meaning friends had made him complacent and over confident. He lost focus and failed to reach a much bigger goal - clearing the IIT entrance, one of the toughest competition exams in India. \n\nHe recovered slowly, but made humility and balance the pillars of his life. One should stay away from extremes, especially of ego, followed by other areas of life.  \n\nHonouring the eternal concept of The Golden Mean by Confucius, he added his humble thoughts of making flexible bands to handle five major areas of life, as we age: health and fitness; relationships; career and finance; personality; and spiritual evolution, ultimately leading to good deeds.

Olivier spent over a decade playing field hockey at the highest level, discovering how the smallest habits can influence performance and well-being. This passion for human potential led him to a seven-year career as a sports physiotherapist, helping both elite athletes and ordinary people to recover, progress, and achieve balance.\nToday, Oli translates these lessons into Yoboo \u2014 a health-tech startup with the mission to help people everywhere optimize their lifestyle and feel their best, combining science, technology, and personal balance.

        "description": "Beck has shared a very intimate and emotional aproach to self-discovery and self-empowerment and her personal view around artistic talent and skills. Beck Samuelsson is a singer, songwriter, product designer and co-founder of a social business based in Timi\u0219oara. As an author and performer, Beck combines poetic lyrics with soulful melodies. Her debut album, Bridges of Peace, had a significant impact and was broadcast on Radio Rom\u00e2nia Cultural, establishing her as a distinctive voice in Romania's independent music scene. Beyond her artistic career, Beck is deeply involved in social impact projects. Together with her husband, she founded a business that actively supports Roma citizens and marginalized communities. Three years ago, she opened an Upcycle Jewelry Hub dedicated to Roma women \u2014 a space that is more than just a workshop: while creating unique jewelry, participants also shape new opportunities for inclusion, empowerment and self-expression, through art made with their own hand",

        "description": "\u0218tefan has shared his view around moving from urban to rural and how this phenomenon affects building, humans and ways of living. Stefan Vaida was born on December 26, 1983, in Altana village, Sibiu county, right on the main street. 35 years later, we find him still here, but on \"parau' napilor\" as he likes to say, which is the former Romanian street in Altana, with a beautiful personal history. He became a restorer. He saved houses from destruction or mistreatment, participated in the restoration of many heritage buildings in Transylvania, alongside his brother Eugen Vaida - architect. Together they established the Monumentum Association, the Ambulance for Monuments, and the Interethnic Museum of the Hartibaci Valley.

Wareesha emphasizes that while everyone has ideas, it is consistent contribution, small or large, that creates lasting impact.

I\u2019ve written two books, Grammar It Fun and Mind of a Young Founder, and founded English with Wareesha, where I run a YouTube channel inspiring Gen Z through science, startups, and self growth.
