On paper it&#39;s brilliant; smaller attack surface, fewer CVEs to track, compliance teams love it. In reality tho, no package manager means rewriting every Dockerfile from scratch or maintaining dual images like some kind of amateur hour setup.</p> <p>Did my homework and found countless teams hitting the same brick wall. Pipelines that worked fine suddenly break because you can&#39;t install debugging tools, can&#39;t troubleshoot in production, can&#39;t do basic system tasks.</p> <p>How are you all actually solving this without turning into full-time image baby sitting job? What&#39;s your go-to for keeping familiar build workflows (apk, curl, etc.) while still shipping lean runtime images? Desperate for battle-tested hacks on multi-stage setups that don&#39;t explode CI/CD times or force constant rebuilds.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

In researching solutions, I\u2019ve found Hysteria 2, which can be connected via the mobile app Hiddify.
