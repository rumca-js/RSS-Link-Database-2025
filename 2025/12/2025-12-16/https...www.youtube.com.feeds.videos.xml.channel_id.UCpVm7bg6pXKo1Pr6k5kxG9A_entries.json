        "description": "Join Eva zu Beck in Thailand to train under one of the country's most decorated Muay Thai champions, Manasak Pinsinchai. Eva's journey begins in Bangkok where she meets young Thai fighters and learns about the culture, history, and discipline behind Muay Thai and how it is woven into everyday life. She then travels to Chiang Mai for a two-week intensive training bootcamp where she spends long days in sparring sessions, intense conditioning workouts, repetitive drills, and learning clinch and bag work. The challenge pushes her to her physical limits and a painful injury threatens to derail her entire journey. Through it all though, Eva discovers the true meaning of Muay Thai: respect, heart, and self-improvement. At the end of her two weeks, Eva honors the spirit of Thailand's national sport by stepping into the ring for her first-ever fight. \n\nSuperskilled with Eva zu Beck | S2, E4 \n\nExplore the World with National Geographic subscriptions: https://natgeo.com/ytngmagazine\n\n\u27a1 Subscribe",
