        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Welcome readers,</p> <p>Over the last several weeks/months we&#39;ve all seen an uptick in articles about schools/towns/states banning books from classrooms and libraries. Obviously, this is an important subject that many of us feel passionate about but unfortunately it has a tendency to come in waves and drown out any other discussion. We obviously don&#39;t want to ban this discussion but we also want to allow other posts some air to breathe. In order to accomplish this, we&#39;re going to post a discussion thread every month to allow users to post articles and discuss them. In addition, our friends at <a href=\"/r/bannedbooks\">/r/bannedbooks</a> would love for you to check out their sub and discuss banned books there as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator\"> /u/AutoModerator </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1po76z2/banned_books_discussion_december_",
