We jump about the timeline of her life and then back to current time. It also explores the difference between humans and elves, and the fleeting nature of a human life, and presents a different set of values between the characters.!&lt; </p> <p>I just want to find other media that explores that kind of a timeline. I have seen it done with vampires, but not so much with elves, unless it&#39;s LOTR or similar works where they aren&#39;t the central feature. </p> <p>Also Frieren explores the fantasy genre in a way that feels familiar to fans of it&#39;s tropes, but it also carves it&#39;s own identity within it. Highly suggest it to anyone who enjoys a spot of anime.</p> </div><!-- SC",

I didn&#39;t fall in love with the book and I&#39;m wondering if I should keep reading, in hopes it gets better, or if I should switch to another series. I disliked the in-the-past style narrative (as I know he will survive - although I enjoyed it with Rothfuss), the very few characters, the entire book is basically set in one city, and the magic system seems simple.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read and enjoyed ASOIAF, Wheel of Time, Patrick Rothfuss Kingkiller Chronicles, LOTR. Other series that have caught my eye : Malazan, stormlight archives, eathsea.</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sweetpodwl\"> /u/Sweetpodwl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1po6xtz/should_i_keep_reading_past_assassins_apprentice/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><",

A baby gets replaced with a changeling who is supposed to die but doesnt. The baby grows into a child. I think the child then explodes but comes back to life. Theres a doppelganger who I think kills its victims and takes on their appearance and memories. Theres some warriors who half shape-shift into birds.
