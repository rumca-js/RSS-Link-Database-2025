Since Proton Plus allows you to have 10 different email addresses on one account, I&#39;m considering splitting my current personal address into two: one for contacting friends and family, and one for all my internet accounts to enforce separation between my personal and online life (ensuring there won&#39;t be any association that can be found between me and whatever weird forums I mindlessly sign up for) and having a third address for professional/work/school.
