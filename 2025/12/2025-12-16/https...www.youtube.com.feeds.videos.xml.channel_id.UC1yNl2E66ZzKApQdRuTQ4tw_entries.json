Physicists have tried to make sense of this by contracting the space in front and expanding the space behind the ship. In a new paper, a former NASA scientist outlines how we can engineer such warp drives. Really? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/ae237a\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open",
