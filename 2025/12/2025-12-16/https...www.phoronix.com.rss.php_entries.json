        "description": "One of the exciting Intel innovations to the Linux kernel this year has been around the Cache Aware Scheduling for helping to deliver better performance on modern CPUs with multiple last level caches. The kernel patches have yet to be upstreamed but testing has shown to be quite promising for grouping tasks sharing data to the same LLC domain to help reduce cache misses and cache bouncing. Those wishing to learn more about Cache Aware Scheduling, there was a presentation on it last week by Intel engineers Tim Chen and Chen Yu at the Linux Plumbers Conference 2025 in Tokyo...",

The Vulkan ray-tracing performance in particular was standing out this year as having evolved quite nicely while for conventional OpenGL and Vulkan performance the performance has been largely stable this year with its great at-launch support.",
