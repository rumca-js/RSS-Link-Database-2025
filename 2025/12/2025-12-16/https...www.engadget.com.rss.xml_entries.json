The nautically-themed Sea of Sorrow update will come to the moody Metroidvania some time in 2026, and better still, it will be free for all players.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The DLC will include &quot;new areas, bosses, tools and more,&quot; the developer wrote. There aren&#39;t a lot of clues to the gameplay in the short trailer below, but the four shots definitely relay the vibe.

Next an orb-like structure crackling with electricity looms",
