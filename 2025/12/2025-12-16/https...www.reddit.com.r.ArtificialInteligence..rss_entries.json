Italian AI researchers were able to fool leading models by simply turning malign prompts into poems.</p> <p>Gemini 2.5 was the most vulnerable to this attack but OpenAI and Anthropic models were more robust. Also surprising was that the more powerful the model the more vulnerable it was to poetry. Does this means more powerful models appreciate poetry more so submit more easily to poetic commands?</p> <p>The whole thing is very bizarre and reminds me of the Waluigi effect. Because LLMs are trained on a vast corpus of stories with characters who are defined by their antagonists, if you force a model to act like a hero it is more likely to flip and become the anti-hero (waluigi instea of luigi). Models would be more likely to do the exact opposite of what they were instructed to do because the good character and bad character were close together into the compressed semantic space of the",
