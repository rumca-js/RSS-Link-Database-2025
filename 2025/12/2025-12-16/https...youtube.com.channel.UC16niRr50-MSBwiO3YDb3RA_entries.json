        "description": "Today, the government has ordered an independent review into foreign financial interference in UK politics.\n\nThe government say this is in response to what it called the \u201cshocking\u201d case of Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales. Gill was jailed in November, after admitting to taking bribes for pro-Russian interviews and speeches when he was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP).\n\nAnnouncing the review, Communities Secretary Steve Reed said the government must \"learn the lessons\" from the case so \"this can never happen again\". Responding to Reed's statement in the Commons, Reform UK's deputy leader Richard Tice said his party welcomed the review but called on the government to also make sure it looked into the influence of China on the Labour Party. Victoria and Chris discuss what the review could mean\n\nPlus, President Donald Trump has filed, what is being reported as, a $5 billion dollar lawsuit against the BBC.
