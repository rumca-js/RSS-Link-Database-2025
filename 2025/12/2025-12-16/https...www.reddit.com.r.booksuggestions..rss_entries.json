I&#39;m not exactly a religious person, maybe I would like to be, but I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions like those listed above. It doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be about Jesus, like in the Fraticides, but about something Holy, or more so, somebody holy. </p> <p>Also after writing I see that the Bible may count as a suggestion.

They&#39;d always be around 150-200 pages and I&#39;d finish it on that day itself. I&#39;ve done this every year and I&#39;m looking forward to doing it next year too. I don&#39;t read religiously, I don&#39;t even read for months sometimes but I do love reading on the 1st as it kinda gets me in the mood to read all year round. </p> <p>The only issue is ive got a pretty big exam on January 2nd so I&#39;ll need to spend A LOT of time studying for that. But I really want to continue this little tradition I have so I figured I&#39;d read a short book. I&#39;m thinking of dedicating an hour to reading as I do have other new year family events to attend plus the studies. I&#39;ve read a few short books - like metamorphosis, white nights etc and I don&#39;t know of many short books to read.</p> <p>I love classics, literar",

Schwab</p> <p>-The Shepherd King duology</p> <p>-Throne of Glass</p> <p>Below are some books I\u2019m questioning.

I do not enjoy reading about, say the bad boy x good girl where it&#39;s all about the good girl being inexpreienced and having no friends asides from the guy who she eventually gets with. Not that kinda stuff. So if anyone has any recs about a bad boy and a popular girl where she is even sort of mean but gets treated like a princess and is somewhat self entitled, or something akin to this- please give me all your recs!! thank you xx</p> <p>(oh and also i would like something thats more on the romance side than the smut side. i dont mind smut but i dont want it every other page and would also prefer for the mmc to have love for the fmc not just lust.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TotallyNotAyla\"> /u/TotallyNotAyla </a> <br/> <span><a ",

Considering Islington or Abercrombie, but I would love some spoiler free help. I have a really hard time following books that get super political. Not sure if that\u2019s the right word to describe it, but when there are too many moving parts and characters to keep up with and I have to make notes just to follow along, I usually move on. I got a few chapters into Black Company, and was pretty quickly thwarted \ud83d\ude05. I will eventually read Hobb\u2019s other books but I don\u2019t want to binge it all at once. I\u2019ve read Stormlight and while I do like Sanderson, I\u2019d like something that isn\u2019t so imaginative. Enjoyed Demon cycle for one book and suffered through the rest which was pretty awful lol. I\u2019m also not huge on super futuristic/space but can be convinced.. I really enjoyed Dune. Anyway.. lol. Would love suggestions, if Islington or Abercrombie would be a goo",
