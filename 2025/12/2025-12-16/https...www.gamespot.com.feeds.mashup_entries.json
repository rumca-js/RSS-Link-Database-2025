In the free trial, which runs December 16-22, players can access 20+ maps and try the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. In terms of modes, players can try out mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed, as well as the Holiday Havoc mode and Prop Hunt.</p><p>Alongside this, Activision has discounted Black Ops 7 by up to 30%. This brings the price down to from $70 to $49 for the standard edition, or from $100 to $80 for the Vault Edition.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-is-trying-really-hard-to-get-you-to-play-black-ops-7-right-now/1100-6537022/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",
