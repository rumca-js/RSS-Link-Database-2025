        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nLarian boss Swen Vincke confirmed some details about their upcoming game, Divinity. While the announcement trailer was decidedly not kid-friendly, the game's tone will be similar to Larian's hit RPG, Baldur's Gate 3, and it will be turn-based, too. Fans can also expect the game to hit early access, just like BG3. In other news, dataminers have unearthed about 30 more minutes of unused dialogue from Metroid Prime 4's NPCs. This basically confirms that the divisive NPCs were chattier than what's in the final game, but there's always a chance that DLC could unlock that content. And finally, Prime Video's Fallout Season 2 will be available a full day than originally announced. The first episode goes live tonight at 6pm Pacific.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

The more powerful hybrid console has seen an extremely busy first six months, filled with excellent first-party games, surprising third-party ports, and highly anticipated indies. And even deep into its ninth year, the original Switch provided its players with plenty to do, too, with the long-overdue arrivals of Super Mario Galaxy 2 and Xenoblade Chronicles X, and a few cross-generation Nintendo games that made it to both Switches. \n\nNintendo itself published a whopping 16 games in 2025 \u2013 spread across new Switch 1 and 2 games and enhanced Switch 2 editions of older games \u2013 and along with the higher volume of third-party support brought on by a new console, it\u2019s a crowded field to choose the best of the best from this year. But ranking things is what we do at IGN, so here are the best Nintendo Switch games in 2025 we went bananas for.\n\n#IGN #GameOfTheYear2025 #2025Gaming",

James Cameron's third chapter of the Avatar franchise, Fire and Ash, picks up right where The Way of Water left off, with both the Sullys struggling to find their place in the world and with James Cameron continuing to blow us away with big screen spectacle. IGN's Max Scoville reviews Fire and Ash, to find out how much \"new\" there is left in Pandora, how familiar Avatar seems in spite of a whole new tribe, and whether or not that actually matters, because man is this a big, fun movie.\n\n#IGN #Movies",
