Use Code PLAYON25 for 10 Isabel Shards and 2k Gold.  Valid until Dec 31st 2025 https://play.tacticusgame.com/playontt\n\n\nTyranid Hierophant Bio-Titan is the source of a rumbling threatening the entire planet. Worse yet it seems to be burrowed deep underground and attacking from 40mm tunnels. The Adepta Sororitas have been deployed to purge the threat. Jordan is back with Tyranids and has decided to try a Titan and Tak plays a new Sisters detachment.\n\n===============LINKS=================\n\nJoin this channel to get early access, exclusive shows and discord access:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ4-WFTrDNWvcM7dEC6E2mw/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/playontabletop\nYouTube Member:  https://youtube.com/@PlayOnTabletop\nOfficial Merch: https://merch.playontabletop.com/\nSPONSOR: https://play.tacticusgame.com/playont",
