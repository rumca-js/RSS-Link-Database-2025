Are we sometimes nothing more than what we think others think of us?\n\nFree Pursuit of Wonder Newsletter: https://pursuitofwonder.ck.page/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/pursuitofwonder\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/PursuitOfWonder\n\nIf you are interested in further supporting the channel, \nyou can contribute to our Patreon here: https://www.patreon.com/pursuitofwonder\nSpecial thank you to our very generous Patreon support",
