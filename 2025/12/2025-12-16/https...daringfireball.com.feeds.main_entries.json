They offered a discount of some sort if I gave them a phone number and permitted them to send me marketing messages. That got me curious about what they\u2019d do with my number, and it was a $50-some dollar cap, so I took the discount and gave them my Google Voice number. That was 17 days ago. They sent me 19 SMS marketing messages since then, before I\u2019d seen enough today and called it quits on this experiment. (Or called \u201cSTOP\u201d, perhaps, which was the magic word to opt out.) They didn\u2019t send a text every day, and on some days, they sent more than one. But the overall effect was relentlessly annoying.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m sure some of the people who sign up for these texts in exchange for a discount code wind up clicking at least one of the offers sent via SMS and buying more stuff, and the marketing team running this points to those sales as proof that it \u201cworks\u201d.
