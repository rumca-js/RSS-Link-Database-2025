        "description": "Nearly 20 trees are cut down every second in the Amazon rainforest, as authorities struggle to monitor millions of acres and stop illegal clear-cutting. But land reformer Tasso Azevedo and his team at MapBiomas have changed the game, transforming satellite imagery into precise, real-time maps that make every clear-cut visible \u2014 and every actor accountable. Learn how they're helping slash deforestation in the Amazon, proving that transparency is a forest's strongest defense. (This ambitious idea is part of The Audacious Project, TED\u2019s initiative to inspire and fund global change.)
