        "description": "The heroic war narrative collapses when money, power, and history are traced instead of slogans repeated. As corruption scandals circle Zelensky\u2019s inner circle, the same patterns seen in Vietnam, Iraq, and Iran-Contra re-emerge: oversight dismantled, aid siphoned, and legacy media pivoting only once denial becomes impossible. This isn\u2019t about Ukraine alone, but about how democracy is marketed while corruption is tolerated whenever geopolitical leverage is at stake.\n[UNPACKED]\n\nGo to https://rumble.com/premium/BRAND and join the movement.\n\nENTER THE REBORN GIVEAWAY \u2014 I\u2019ve partnered with Reborn for a massive giveaway where you can win a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 plus $10,000 cash.
