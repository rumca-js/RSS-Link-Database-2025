I\u2019m super stoked about this since it\u2019s a really good gig.</p> <p>The Conflict: I also just received an offer for a fall internship with the U.S. Secret Service (cybersecurity division).

It\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted to do to travel and chill before graduating.</p> <p>My Question: Is it worth grinding out the Secret Service internship just to get the TS clearance?</p> <p>I know the clearance is huge for government work, but does it actually hold any value in Big Tech (specifically for a return offer at Microsoft or similar groups)?
