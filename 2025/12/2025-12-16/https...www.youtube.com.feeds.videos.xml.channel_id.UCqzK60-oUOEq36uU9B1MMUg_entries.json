And I'm not exaggerating.\n\nA company called QuantWare just announced the world's first 10,000-qubit quantum processor - a 100X leap that solves the fundamental scaling problem that's plagued the entire industry for nearly a decade.\n\nHere's the perspective you need:\nGoogle went from 53 to 105 qubits in SIX YEARS. IBM just unveiled a 120-qubit processor they say will lead in 2028.\n\nThis new processor? 10,000 qubits. In a SMALLER package than today's systems.\n\nBut the real story isn't just about more qubits. It's about what happens when quantum computing breaks through its barriers at the exact same moment AI is racing towa",
