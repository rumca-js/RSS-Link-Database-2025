The main features I\u2019m depending on is credential storage for easy admin password rotations and ssh key agent, some other features are very welcoming as syntax highlighting in terminals by user rules and multiple 5-7 tabs sometimes with mixed rdm/ssh sessions for several days.

By contrast the old card I installed connected instantly with an 866mb/s link and great speeds (200mb/s, as opposed to not-even-connecting)</p> <p>Are most MediaTek drivers this terrible on Linux? I swapped the card completely because I didn&#39;t want to go through the headache of finding/configuring proper drivers.
