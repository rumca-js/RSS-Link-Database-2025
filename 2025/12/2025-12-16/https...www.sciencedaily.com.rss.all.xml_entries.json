        "description": "A museum visit sparked a revelation when a Roman glass cup was turned around and its overlooked markings came into focus. These symbols, once dismissed as decoration, appear to be workshop identifiers used by teams of skilled artisans. The findings challenge centuries of assumptions about how Roman glass was made. They also restore identity and agency to the anonymous makers behind these stunning objects.",

Researchers show that active molecular processes can create voltage spikes similar to those used by neurons. These signals could help drive ion transport and explain key biological functions.

By using atoms that emit light cooperatively between mirrors, acceleration subtly shifts when a powerful light burst appears. That early flash acts like a timestamped signature of the effect. The method could make once-theoretical physics experimentally reachable.",
