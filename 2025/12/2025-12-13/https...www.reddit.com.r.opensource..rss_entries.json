The format is built with a robust hybrid architecture utilizing Python for the SDK/CLI and Rust for high-performance core processing. This foundation targets high-fidelity sound, multi-track support, and, crucially, developer ease-of-use, directly addressing the limitations of legacy containers in the immersive audio landscape. Bitwave positions itself as a solution for dynamic content that needs to adapt in real-time.</p> <h1>Architectural Deep Dive: Spatial and Adaptive</h1> <p>The core <code>.bwx</code> format\u2019s file structure is its true innovation. It mandates distinct blocks for metadata, including a crucial <code>SPATIAL_BLOCK</code> for x, y, z positional data and a <code>META_BLOCK</code> that stores essential information like BPM. This intrinsic inclusion of dynamic and spatial data is key t",
