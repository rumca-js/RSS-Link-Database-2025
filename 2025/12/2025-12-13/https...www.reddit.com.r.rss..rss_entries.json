What are my options ? I have tried the usual apps but a lot of them do not do well with text extraction, self hosting infrastructure is no feasible because of my hardware limitations. Any solid suggestions open to web apps. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dependent_Scar1896\"> /u/Dependent_Scar1896 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1plsok0/which_rss_app_to_use/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1plsok0/which_rss_app_to_use/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Either I need to include some tutorial on how to copy the feed URL and paste it into their app, or I tell them to install the RSSPreview addon for Firefox so it will render the feed for them like it used to by default.
