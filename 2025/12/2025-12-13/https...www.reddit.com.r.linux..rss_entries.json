Not only does it unnecessarily pit programmers against designers, but it also limits our vision of what we could be doing. In this talk, Scott Jenson gives examples of how focusing on UX -- instead of UI -- frees us to think bigger. This is especially true for the desktop, where the user experience has so much potential to grow well beyond its current interaction models. The desktop UX is certainly not dead, and this talk suggests some future directions we could take.</p> <p>About Scott Scott Jenson has been a leader in UX design and strategic planning for over 35 years.

Anyone have a similar experience of migrating a foldable over to Linux?</p> <p>My laptop&#39;s served me well, but the poor thing&#39;s on her last legs. I want to uninstall Windows to get rid of the bloat, but I&#39;m scared of compatibility with touchscreen features. I&#39;m also a newbie to linux - but I&#39;ve heard good things!</p> <p>As a secondary question: does anyone know of any good open-source alternatives to Microsoft OneNote that work on Linux? Ideally something that works on Windows too, supports drawing, and supports live updates across devices (like if I type something on a note on one device it&#39;ll show on another).</p> <p>Thanks :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zeeshmania\"> /u/Zeeshmania </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1plqmhl/thinking_of_switching_my_acer_spin_5_foldable/\">[li",

I\u2019ve primarily used it on my laptop as a dual boot only to move fully to it in the last few years. I migrated to Arch around 5 years ago now and have loved it ever since. I use the laptop for teaching and bounce between Niri and Plasma pretty regularly depending on the work I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve loved Niri\u2019s gesture support and the simple functionality of the whole thing. All this to say, I\u2019ve tried a handful of DEs over the years and function is what I care about most.</p> <p>Which leads me on to my current set/situation. I use a mid to high range desktop next to my TV stand as a home server, console, and remote workstation all in one.
