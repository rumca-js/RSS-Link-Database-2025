        "description": "A short coastal walk along a stretch we haven't visited before - starting at West Bay and walking along the beach to Eype, then back along the cliff path inland.  The promenade is closed at the western end of West Bay and *I DO NOT RECOMMEND* traversing the closure as the cliff is in danger of sudden collapse.\n\nJoin the Atomic Shrimp official Discord server for FREE early access to videos! - https://discord.gg/atomicshrimp  \nAtomic Shrimp subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/AtomicShrimp/",
