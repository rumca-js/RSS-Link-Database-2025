        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Swisscows, as a lot of you know is a privacy focused engine. I have made a Threads post earlier on it so here&#39;s my experience. Swisscows is pretty good, it&#39;s freemium (can pay to customize results and no ads) with PG-13 censoring. You can see political stuff, but not violent or explicit content. There are times the filter fails however. I believe it anonymizes data after 1-2 weeks, which is solely collected to improve censoring and get diagnostics. It doesn&#39;t shove AI in your face, but you can summarize pages with AI if wanted. I bought the Platinum subscription, and it&#39;s great. You get Pro, which allows you to control what results you get and no ads. On top of that it has a VPN included, which honestly isn&#39;t Mullvad or Proton level but possibly best suited for casual internet browsing. Finally, it has an email. Swisscows mail is E2EE and I&#39;ve been using it as a secondary email. Yes, you have to create an account for Pro/Platin",
