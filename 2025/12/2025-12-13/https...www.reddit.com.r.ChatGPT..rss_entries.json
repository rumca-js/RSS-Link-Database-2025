No resistance on either for suicide, substances, or physical violence. </p> <p>5.2 gives the weirdest erotic content I&#39;ve ever seen from openai models. Genuinely it&#39;s hilarious.

Not as a replacement for therapy, just as a way to organize my thoughts without emotionally dumping on friends (I also feel slightly odd for doing this)\u2026</p> <p>What surprised me is how helpful it\u2019s been for clarity and naming dynamics I couldn\u2019t quite articulate on my own so I\u2019m happy about that. But I am curious:</p> <p>Does anyone else use ChatGPT this way? For family stuff, emotional prep, or reflecting before stressful situations?</p> <p>I\u2019m getting to the point where whenever I have a trigger, I take the entire situation play by play through Chat, figure ",
