No line of sight? No data. No exploit.\n\nCCP walks through the problem, shows how they solved it for EVE Vanguard, and demonstrates how they integrated the solution on top of Unreal Engine's replication graph.\n\nIf you care about fair multiplayer experiences, this talk is for you.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#AntiCheat, #WallHacks, #CCPGames, #FogOfWar, #EVEVanguard, #ReplicationGraph, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestStockholm",
