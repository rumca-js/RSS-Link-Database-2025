Usually when an actor gets huge they only stay doing movies where they are the main character and I feel like it gets boring continuously seeing someone always be the main person like the Rock for example. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/xoBonesxo\"> /u/xoBonesxo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ply3v9/who_are_some_actors_that_despite_being_huge_stars/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ply3v9/who_are_some_actors_that_despite_being_huge_stars/\">[comments]</a></span>",

No one wants to go see it with me, but I\u2019m kinda hyped about this movie. I\u2019m considering going to the movie theater where you can order food and mixed drinks, just living it up solo.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It seems that most movies that tried to adapt his books just took ideas from them (Mysterious Island, Journey to the centre of the earth). The Disney movie from 1954 and Atlantis are the only ones that capture the real vibes of the books. I&#39;d love to see a faithful adaptation of Voyage to the Moon, or 20.000 leagues. I don&#39;t get why studios won&#39;t do it (specially now when they will make remakes of anything). Imagine what would a director like Villeneuve or Nolan do with the source material!
