Hunter, a troubled black police detective, decides this is also the one case he&#39;s going to take a stand on after years of going along to get along.

Memorable books, these who would let you thinking in your bed midnight. Well-written characters. Just in case: Some adult content wouldnt hurt. ( Psychological terror and such ).

Most sources (including wikipedia) say there are 210/211 fairy tales collected by the Grimm brothers, with roughly 30 additional children&#39;s stories, but I found a 2003-published &quot;third edition&quot; translated by Jack Zipes that claims to have 250 fairy tales + 29 additional stories, which means there are an additional 39-40 fairy tales in the latest book, completely overtaking the accepted number I keep finding around.</p> <p>So, are these just new stories somehow found and compiled into this edition or... well, what are they? Did the Grimm brothers collect a total of 210/211 fairy tales or did they collect a total of 250 fairy tales? Also, what are these 29/30 additional stories?</p> <p>P.S. - I ordered the 250-tale &quot;third edition&quot;, but it says it&#39;ll take almost a month to arrive and I&#39;m impatient for the answer. \ud83d\ude43</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a",
