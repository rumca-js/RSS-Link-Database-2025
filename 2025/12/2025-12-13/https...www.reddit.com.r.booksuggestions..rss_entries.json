I would welcome any book suggestions that have to do with Louisiana, small towns in Louisiana, Native people in Louisiana, black people, and the segregation in this area, local beliefs about magic. I know it&#39;s a lot, but the topic touches me incredibly, and I&#39;m looking forward to your recommendations. I know this isn&#39;t the subreddit&#39;s topic, but if you have any movie recommendations, I&#39;d love to hear them also.

She is a mystical, romantasy, author (her books including witches, vampires, werewolves, magic etc.) 2. She has read all the mainstream books already (ie. fourth wing series, acotar, when the moon hatched) 3. She is an indie artist herself so recommendations from small or indie artist are highly sought after 4.

Any recommendations for a book (preferably one that is obscure or otherwise not all that well known) with a strong female lead who overcomes adversity and/or goes on a journey of self-discovery? A good bit of humor (without being vulgar or crude) would be appreciated. The genre doesn&#39;t really matter, as long as the book is engaging through the end.

Although my mother allows me to read nearly anything, I&#39;d rather not read anything too raunchy or disturbing. (Despite me enjoying books, my reading level is not extremely high. I struggle with classics like \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bJane Austen, as they&#39;re quite wordy.) (EDIT: I figured I&#39;m probably being pretty vague here...

I\u2019ve never been an avid reader, so that speaks volumes for how much I enjoyed this series. I really enjoyed the FMC, Dominika Egorova, and am looking for recommendations on spy thrillers that contain characters similar to her.</p> <p>I want the story to be primarily a gripping spy thriller, but with a female spy that oozes sexuality, confidence, and eroticism. The story can include genuine romance or just heartless \u201choney-trapping\u201d. I gravitate toward Cold War era spy thrillers, but that\u2019s not a requirement. Some mild sex scenes as well were a nice touch in the Red Sparrow series. A series is always more preferable, but standalone books work too.

I dislike when we have fmc and there is a romance subplot that takes up so much space. Also would really appreciate if characters have actual depth instead of the book being plot focused only. No mary sue type characters, they should have actual flaws other than &quot;oh she loves too much, she trusts too much&quot; type of thing. And the flaws actually affecting the character and other characters around her. Overall a women centric story.</p> <p>I know I am asking a lot but yeah I would really appreciate some recs, even better if it is queer, tho it is okay even if it is not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vee_skittles\"> /u/Vee_skittles </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1playum/book_recs_with_female_mc_and_no_romance/\">[link]</a><",

Its how these books use languge to evoke emotion and dont lean on cliches. They have a literary fiction feel to them. Can my fellow avid readers recommend more such books? I would highly appreciate it. I&#39;ve also noticed that i lean more towards British, Irish, Aussie and European literature as I enjoy their audiobook version more.
