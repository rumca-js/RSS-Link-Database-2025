These hubs don\u2019t just provide extra ports, they can transfer data at high speed and supply devices with power. These are often USB 3.0 or even USB 3.2 Gen1/Gen2 ports, offering transfer rates of up to five or 10 Gbps, which is ideal for fast external SSDs or high-quality peripherals. Nevertheless, these ports are often left unused, even though they can significantly improve both the technical and ergonomic setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using the monitor as a central USB hub, you can shorten cable runs, organize devices efficiently, and increase accessibility. High-quality mice, mechanical keyboards, or graphics tablets benefit from this, as short, direct connections often provide more stable data transfers and lower latency.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"",
