Heavy coffee intake\u2014over five cups a day\u2014was linked to lower bone density, especially in women who consumed more alcohol. Tea\u2019s benefits may stem from catechins that support bone formation. The researchers say small daily habits could make a meaningful difference over time.",

They also identified natural resilience systems that help protect certain individuals from harm. These findings are opening the door to treatments that focus on building strength, not just correcting problems. The work is also fueling a broader effort to keep science open, independent, and accessible.",
