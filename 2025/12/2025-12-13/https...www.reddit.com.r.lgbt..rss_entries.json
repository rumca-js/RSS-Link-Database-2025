In my childhood I always was a tomboy and now I&#39;m a masc and would definitely pass as a boy, also because my voice is a little deeper. There were times I introduced myself as a boy (just for the benefits \ud83d\ude2d) but even then I didn&#39;t mind.</p> <p>If someone mistakes me as a boy I never really corrected them, instead my friends did, so like whatever i guess. I labeled myself as non binary 2 years ago for my close friends and they were infact not surprised. </p> <p>I mean like, call me what you want because just use my name?

My entire family expects me to travel with them for a 17-day trip. My sister keeps insisting, ignoring my reluctance. Why this is impossible for me: - Safety &amp; Dysphoria: Being an ex-Muslim and bisexual in Morocco feels genuinely oppressive and unsafe. The environment is heavily Islamic and homophobic.
