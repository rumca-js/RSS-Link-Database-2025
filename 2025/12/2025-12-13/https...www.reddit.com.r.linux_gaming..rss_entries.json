I have not done any system updates in between, nor have I touched anything else either. It just refuses to launch with the error mentioned on the title.</p> <p>I have tried <code>__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia __VK_LAYER_NV_optimus=NVIDIA_only %command%</code> and <code>DRI_PRIME=1 %command%</code> to no avail.</p> <p>I also tried launching it through Lutris, which still works.

I played Marvel Rivals on Linux Mint like a month ago and it ran flawlessly, but I played it again today after the most recent game update and every minute or so I get 5 fps drops: what I mean by that is that it&#39;s running at 170-200 fps, and suddenly the game stops one time, then goes to normal, then stops again, and so on, 5 times in a span 3 seconds. I haven\u00b4t actually measured it, but it is extremely consistent.

I am wanting to play roms from several different consoles. Which emulation front end comes the most recommended? I know of Retroarch, which I am not too fond of because, to me, it seems like once you install it, you&#39;re on your own, but if I have to go with it I will. I&#39;m just wanting a few more options besides Retroarch.
