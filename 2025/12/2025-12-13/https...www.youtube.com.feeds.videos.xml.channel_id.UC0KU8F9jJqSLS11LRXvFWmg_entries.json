Available now. For free. Only on Roblox.\n\n#Rabbids #Roblox #Takeover\n\nAfter first appearing in the Rayman series, the infamously mischievous, playful, and whacky Rabbids are a staple in Ubisoft\u2019s creative universe. Since their debut, the Rabbids have starred in several eponymous titles, including many of their own party games for the whole family and their newest release, Rabbids: Takeover. This multimedia franchise has amassed more than 20 million units sold worldwide over 16 games, comic books, and the Rabbids Invasion television series. Now synonymous with Ubisoft itself, Rabbids serve as an outlet for creativity and even foster relationships with some of the most famous video game characters in the world.\n\n#Ubisoft #Rabbids\n\nLearn more about Ubisoft",
