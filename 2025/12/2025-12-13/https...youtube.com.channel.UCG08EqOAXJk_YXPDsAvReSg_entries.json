        "description": "This talk covers how Survival Kids uses key DOTS features\u2014Burst, Jobs, Systems, and Collections\u2014to optimize GameObject gameplay without fully adopting Entities. Learn how we used Systems for update order, Burst-compiled Jobs for multithreading, TransformAccessArrays for off-main-thread transform access, and Unity source to create Burst-safe camera functions. We\u2019ll also share profiler insights that helped us identify bottlenecks and unlock major performance improvements.\n\n#Unity #Unity2025 #GameDev",
