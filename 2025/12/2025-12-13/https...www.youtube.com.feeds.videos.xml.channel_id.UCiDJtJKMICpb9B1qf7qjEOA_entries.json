        "description": "Tested's general manager Kristen Lomasney builds all the \"supervisor bundles\" of Tested (de) merit badges herself, and her description of her process prompted Adam Savage to reminisce about his early work days when he had a similar task and spearheaded a solution to an efficiency problem. (Kristen's not budging from her own process, but now she has 15 fewer bundles to assemble herself.)\n\nBuy the Supervisor Bundle here:\nhttps://adamsavage.com/collections/fun-stuff/products/supervisors-demerit-badge-bundle\nNOTE: Fifteen of the bundles at our warehouse were assembled in this video, and have an \"A\" written in red on them so you'll know if Adam worked on yours himself!\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://",
