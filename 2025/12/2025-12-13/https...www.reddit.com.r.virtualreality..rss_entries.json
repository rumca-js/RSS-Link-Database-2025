We either need a headset with a built-in computer that doesn&#39;t need a PC. Or something that&#39;s compatible with the PS5 (PS VR I&#39;m guessing) because we own one. Budget is around $300, but that&#39;s just our currency converted, so to give you a better idea: I was mainly looking at used Meta Quest 3s&#39; and PS VR2&#39;s, so that&#39;s the price point.
