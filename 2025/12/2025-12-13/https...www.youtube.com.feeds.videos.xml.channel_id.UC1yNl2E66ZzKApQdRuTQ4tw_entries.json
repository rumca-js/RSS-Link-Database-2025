In theory, photonic computers are both faster and more efficient than today\u2019s silicon chips, and \u2013 according to the headlines \u2013 the technology is making serious progress. Does the technology live up to the hype? Let\u2019s take a look at the current state of photonic computing.\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n\ud83d\udd17 Join this channel to g",
