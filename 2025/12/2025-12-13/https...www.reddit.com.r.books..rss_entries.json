And then, of course, actually carrying the plan out, and going in those cosy caravans, on their own.

The story itself is fairly simple despite its implications inviting debate based on various viewpoints. Within the narrative though, it asserts itself unapologetically, albeit with a proper build up for acceptance. The scene where the protagonist looks out of the window is written so wonderfully! In the face of grief, she sits and observes the liveliness of the world outside. I loved the author&#39;s vivid description of this liveliness. This is preceded by the juxtaposition of her condition, her vacant stares and exhaustion. Then, as the scene moves from one feeling to another, we are faced with its perplexing effect on the protagonist. She accepts it fearfully at first, and then wholly, letting it take her fancy - paving the way for the story&#39;s climax. </p> <p>The story was a sad story. The writing was beauti",

But Isabell was probably my favorite. (Other than tall, dark, and ugly himself of course.) Jesse is flawed, stubborn, and painfully human in a way that makes his arc hit harder than I expected. And Isabell? Absolute standout. Sharp, fierce, tragic, and impossible not to root for. Brom is incredible at writing characters who feel mythic and grounded at the same time\u2014like they could step out of a legend and still bleed like the rest of us.</p> <p>I loved this depiction of Santa Cla",

Things have been going well, but I&#39;ve muddled things a bit. I&#39;ve asked ChatGPT on a few occasions &quot;can you suggest books similar to [book I had just finished and liked]&quot;, but now I find myself with a list that&#39;s like....30+ titles long??? So, I&#39;m having a hard time choosing and just wanted to step away from the list.</p> <p>Which brings me to: How do y&#39;all find books to read? To you research extensively first? Only read books from authors you&#39;ve read before? Or do any of you just pick something random (RNG, built in systems for random decisions, etc) and go from there? I know being spoiled for choice really seems like a non-issue, but I&#39;m wondering if a small palate cleanser would work wonders for me right now, but I don&#39;t even know how to do that!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",
