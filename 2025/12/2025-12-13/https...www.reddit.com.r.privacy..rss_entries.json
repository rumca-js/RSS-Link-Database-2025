It was released in Nov 2021, so slightly older, but it\u2019s still Wi-Fi 6 and receives firmware updates. ASUS is a Taiwanese company, which might ease some geopolitical concerns, though it\u2019s still manufactured in China.</p> <p>Has anyone tried the RT-AX1800S, or do you have other good, secure alternatives around $70?
