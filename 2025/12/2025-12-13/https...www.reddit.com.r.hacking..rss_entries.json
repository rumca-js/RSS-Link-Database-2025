After a few hours I noticed movement on the PC, as I&#39;m staring at it I then see the mouse moving on its own.. knew instantly someone has remote access and ran out my chair to pull the power cable. As I&#39;m doing that I see them open up PayPal and start logging into my account with the saved password on my browser.</p> <p>Luckily they didn&#39;t have time to transfer anything, another 20 seconds and I was cooked. It&#39;s really spooked me tbh. I&#39;ve left the internet off and I&#39;m currently wiping my hard drives and going to do a fresh windows install. I&#39;ve never had an issue in 25 years so I don&#39;t know how they got in. What else can I do to make sure I&#39;m secure other than a fresh install? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",
