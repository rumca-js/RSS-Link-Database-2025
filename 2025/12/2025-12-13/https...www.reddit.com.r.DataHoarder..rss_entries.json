The drives are going to be kept as an 8 drive pool, and I&#39;m going to load my 180TB of mixed drives as a seperate SATA drive pool.</p> <p>Onboard there&#39;s 4 mini SAS ports on the expander and an additional 3 ports directly on the main board. It&#39;s my understanding that all 7 can be used, but the three onboard ports are purely for SATA expansion and can&#39;t be used for SAS pools. Is this correct? Or is it something else like I can only use onboard OR expander card? </p> <p>I haven&#39;t turned it on to test yet. Still preparing the drives for a wipe and reinstall of my unraid setup. Just curious if anyone can clear this up for me, as online sources can be vague. Can I use all 7 mini SAS ports as I wish, or are there limitations to this? I am prepared to pick up a jbod rack housing if I can&#39;t use all 7.</p> <p>Edit: for conte",

Currently, I either pay for multiple subscriptions for extended photo storage, or I hear constantly of complaints about running out of space. I got big into homelabs a few months ago, and since have decided to hone it into mass photo storage, with automatic backing up, much larger storage than offered in cost comparable subscriptions, and its completely local, not cloud based. Have decided to put together a compact device with 8tb of storage dedicated to stictly photo storage for my whole family. As some folks who presumably take many photos, I thought here would be my best first place to ask: would you be in the market for a similar solution? One time setup in your home, automatically saves and backs up any and all photos or videos you have on synched devices, with easy access and UI for the gallery. Can custom storage size, how it backs up, etc. Any feedback on the id",

I do use Linux occasionally (Ubuntu at home, RHEL at work), but so the CLI breaks my brain. If I do it often I can retain it well enough, but it&#39;s not ideal because if something goes wrong, it is time consuming to troubleshoot and learn, etc. </p> <p>My problem I ran into: out of laziness, initially I setup my other driver&#39;s in Windows Storage Spaces. It worked extremely well, rarely reboot unless doing software upgrades/patches for Plex. It was 8 drives used with 1 for parity and I kept one spare for a replacement if ever needed. The drives are 7.27TiB each in Windows so it was about 58TiB usable. This time around the 8x 14.5TiB drives only gives 78TiB usable storage. WSS seems to use 2.5 drives worth",
