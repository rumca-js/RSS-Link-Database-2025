I&#39;m super new to the dark web, so new in fact that I have no idea how to even navigate it, all I know is how to get ON it by using TOR (on safest mode) and I&#39;ve heard yes VPN and no VPN so I still need to do some more looking into that one. But yea! Could someone PLEASE hit me with the dark web bible or where to find it?? I also wouldn&#39;t be angry if you gave me instructions on how to find and use a dark web search engine, ultimately I&#39;m looking for like chat rooms/blogs, search engines so I can look up stuff and ask questions, Thank you!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Stuffiswords\"> /u/Stuffiswords </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/1pln0u5/dark_web_bible/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.",

Obviously, the current tails version I have on my USB is outdated. From my understanding, when you boot up tails and connect to wifi, you get a pop-up screen that an update is available and it gives you the option to update using the built-in installer.</p> <p>I remember reading somewhere that these automatic upgrades are technically unsafe and it&#39;s advised to do a &quot;manual upgrade.&quot; I imagine this isn&#39;t that difficult to do but I&#39;m since I&#39;m not super tails-savvy I&#39;m slightly concerned I may mess something up in the process.</p> <p>My question is regarding whether or not it really is a legitimate security concern to allow the built-in automatic upgrade.
