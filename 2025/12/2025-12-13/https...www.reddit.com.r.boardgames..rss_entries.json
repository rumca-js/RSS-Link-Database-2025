However the usual candidates are out because my partner would rather not play strategy games with me because he\u2019s too competitive and I win. We do love a co-op or something maybe with a luck element that\u2019s maybe a bit less pvp strategy. We tried hive on BGA and he got in a sulk We have been enjoying lots of co-ops(dorf romantic, gloomhaven, burgle bros) games we like that aren\u2019t co-ops are love letters, spots, flip 7 </p> <p>Something smallish, not too long play time. Not dexterity based as he has very limited dexterity in his hands. </p> <p>Thanks in advance </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/afbart92\"> /u/afbart92 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1plucp2/travel_games_for_vacation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1plucp2/travel_games_for_vacation/\">[comments]</a></",

At some point I would love to run playtests through something like tabletop simulator to get a feel for the balance and the fun of the game for quick iterations. My question is, how do you go about this? Is it a risk to share an early alpha version of a game? Does it run the risk of others taking off with the idea if it is seen as really cool? Do I need some legal advice already?

So I was thinking of buying another one from the same company but I thought Id ask for reccomendations.</p> <p>The first murder mystery game I played was with me and my partner and it was by cryptic murders, the case was &#39;murder at merivale manor&#39;. We LOVED it, the narrative was fantastic, the clues were such good quality and it is still my favourite that i&#39;ve played to date (no its not just nostalgia talking, it was only a few months ago).</p> <p>Afterwards, me and him played &#39;murder of a musician&#39; (also by cryptic murders) and didnt like it as much, we didn&#39;t feel like it made as much sense despite it being easier difficulty. It just didn&#39;t feel like ",

There are 4 Swordfighting styles, Sword and Shield, Dual Blades, Great Sword, and Long Sword, with each having a distinct playstyle. Sword and Shield, and Great Sword were made first, then the whacky and creative, more inventive iterations of Dual Blades and Long Sword came later. There are many similarities shared between the official board game and this, even though despite the partial inspiration, the rules that seem similar were deliberated separately. The game is playable on Tabletop Simulator, feel free to DM me or add me on Discord, cleverandwitty_95959.</p> <p>Here are the rules: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BJa40o6qeMb5gdvMU69V1_2ZyESzXHk9M40baiXcjyM/edit?tab=t.0\">Swordfight - Google Docs</a></p> <p>I am in fact thinking of making a Charged Blade Sword ",
