I had made an insta group with some girls in my family where we shared non specific bookish reels. One of my cousins suggested we should make it a functional book club as well as a chat group. Everyone liked the idea....Here is the issue, this is attempt 2 at making a physical book club, the first go round we tried with A Court of Thorns and Roses....5 books was to big a commitment....and that series leads in to far more, that we have all read on our own now. For this reason we said we had to start off with Fantasy/Romance/Romantacy that are stand alones, not books in any series. I being simi-new to these type books cant seem to find any good ones. All the ones I find have 2 or more books. </p> <p>So can anyone, or everyone, suggest some good book club reads for the smut enthusiasts looking to try to start a little club? \ud83d\ude01 ",

But it doesn\u2019t have to be the whole plot of the book. It could just be a side plot. Or it could be the whole plot\u2026that\u2019s fine too. </p> <p>I\u2019m particularly looking for contemporary fiction, somewhat uplifting, romantic interest is cool, and some humor. Also, everything needs to be ok in the end. I read {It\u2019s Kind of a Funny Story} ages ago and really liked it. That may be the vibe im looking for but also maybe not. </p> <p>I don\u2019t know what I want and at the same time I want something very specific \ud83d\ude05 Google has come up short, so I will ask the people!
