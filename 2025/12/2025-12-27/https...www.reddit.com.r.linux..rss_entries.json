I dont hate windows and I have a gaming desktop for gaming with windows, so if I ever need the use of Windows it wont be a problem. With my majors I don&#39;t require heavy programs and I mostly use word and google docs and any other browser program. I know Windows uses a lot of RAM and I was wondering if its worth switching over to Linux so I can get the most of my laptop and use my battery efficiently. Also, I was wondering if it is even possible with my processor. I have a snapdragon X Plus (Not the elite version although other than performance I don&#39;t think there is much difference.) I&#39;m interested in switching but I also dont wanna do something thats not gonna help at all.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TimOTay2005\"> /u/TimOTay2005 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",
