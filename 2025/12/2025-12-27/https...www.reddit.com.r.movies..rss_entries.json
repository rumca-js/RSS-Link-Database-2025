But Arrow Video goes out to make sure every cut of a movie is included in their sets of the movies. For example: Robin Hood Prince of Thieves had both cuts in 4K whereas iTunes only has the theatrical cut in 4K. </p> <p>They also include amazing special features that are brand new for these older movies. The audio options of movies are amazing as well. </p> <p>Note: I\u2019m not paid by Arrow ",

Not just story, but patience, atmosphere, and effort in the small details. Real locations. Practical sets. Letting scenes breathe. Silence that actually means something.</p> <p>For me, a perfect example is Alien. </p> <p>The movie takes its time. The ship feels real and lived in. The darkness hides things instead of showing everything. The tension comes from waiting, not from constant noise or fast cuts. It feels like the filmmakers trusted the audience to be uncomfortable and pay attention.</p> <p>I am not saying modern movies are bad, but it feels like something shifted. Faster pacing, cleaner visuals, and less willingness to sit in a moment. </p> <p>What is something older movies did really well that you feel is mostly lost now?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gamersecret2\"> /u/gamersec",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Over the festive period, I&#39;ve introduced my son to some Disney films. Robin Hood, Jungle Book, Aristocrats to name a few. Upon watching them (re-watching for me) I&#39;ve realised how much we are missing that era in terms of value. Sure the films are entertaining, whether comedic, melancholy, but I just feel that each voice was specifically picked for that role, qualities in voice to suit a role, making it a profound performance. As opposed to now where it&#39;s a big budget cgi affair and without taking consideration into who&#39;d be a good fit just employ whoever is hot now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TomTom89728\"> /u/TomTom89728 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1pwjloi/disney_classics/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1pwjloi/disney_classics/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It&#39;s still considered a holiday week for kids who are off from school or college, and even many people take that week off from work. Seems like it would easy to think up a premise for a good comedy film --- all the kids are playing with their toys and driving their parents nuts and to deal with the stress the parents get sloppy drunk on New Year&#39;s Eve as the kids trash the house and neighbors get in on the shenanigans?
