Recently they had a major breakage and their solution to it was launch a new app :/</p> <p>Anyways, I am considering moving to Monarch which is paid service and well integrated (from my research so far). I am fine paying for it but I dislike the idea of all my data on yet another external cloud service.</p> <p>So, I am planning to give ActualBudget with SimpleFin a try. Automatic transaction import from various banks is pretty important to me so I wanted to find out how good is the SimpleFin integration for automatic imports and how is the coverage across major banks/CC/retirement accounts? </p> <p>I did a quick search on ActualBudget subreddit and found some gaps but it is same on Monarch ",
