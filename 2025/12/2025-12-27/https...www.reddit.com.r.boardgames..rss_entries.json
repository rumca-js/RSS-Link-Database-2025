We are in holiday and we started playing these games for the last week, we also had Catan at home, and now we love all 3. And from what I read on reddit, these 3 seem to be the Starter Pack for Beginners. From all 3 my favorite is Ticket to Ride, because even if you lose, at the end you have some roads built by you to feel proud about. </p> <p>I wonder what should be the next game after these 3? I would be interested in a more difficult game, but not something that is 4+ on BGG (as I assume it would be too much for us). Like recently I watched a &quot;How to play&quot; on Chicago Express, Ark Nova and 1817 and they seem a bit too complex for us at the moment. 1817 does not even look like a game anymore. xD</p> <p>Someone suggested The Quacks of Quedlinburg and it seems interesting, but I was wondering what your suggestions would be. <str",

Fold-out player spaces, hidden storage, clean lines, it looked like something you\u2019d actually want in your home, not just a dedicated game room. What really stuck with me wasn\u2019t how impressive it was, but how livable it felt. It got me thinking about folding kitchen tables and why they make so much sense for small spaces. My table already gets used for everything: meals, work, sometimes half-finished board games. Space is always tight, so the idea of a table that expands when friends come over and folds back into a normal piece of furniture feels freeing. Good folding kitchen tables don\u2019t feel temporary or cheap, they just adapt quietly to your needs. I loved how that custom build handled fold-outs and storage without feeling cluttered.

Or are classes with &quot;defeat&quot; abilities just busted and should not be played since the best way to use the ability is to pretty much use them all the time?</p> <p>Thank you and happy holidays :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",
