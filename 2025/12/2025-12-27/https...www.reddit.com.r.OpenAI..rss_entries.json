Multi-prompt chaining doesn&#39;t fix it.</p> <p>The docs suggest 400,000 tokens in some places (API?), and 128,000 for non-reasoning or 196,000 for reasoning models on the ChatGPT pricing page. That includes prompt and response, so I suppose if they allocate half for each, that would be about 60,000, assuming Pro Extended is considered a non-reasoning model.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if OpenAI has started limiting context window size as a way to reduce GPU server load.</p> <p>Whatever&#39;s going on, it&#39;s very annoying.</p> <p>I don&#39;t use the memory feature, so I considered trying Playground or OpenRouter, but the per-token pricing is wild. A single prompt+response as above, with 60k tokens each, looks like it would cost about $11.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://",
