I was checking the Vsync settings, I tried different protons, and so on, nothing helped me. First, I wanted to know if someone had a similar problem, and secondly, how to solve it?

I can play World Of Tanks just fine, but I would like to limit the fps, but so far I have not found a way how to do this.

Anytime I level up, try to allocate a point, or even switch to a different tab, my game crashes, I&#39;ve disabled menu transitions, enabled lower inventory res, and am running windowed fullscreen now and it still doesnt want to work properly. I had to make a server so I could play the game normally (dino spawns are dick for normal single player), and on normal single player I could get lucky and have zero issues for a period of time, but my game constantly crashes when Im in my inventory on the server (was able to level up and use my inventory for a while before I got another crash so it works sometimes). I was using proton Ge10.25 but Im using experimental and changing to either of them doesn&#39;t fix my issue. I use fedora kde 43 and have a nvidia gpu. Game runs great, and ONLY crashes from my inventory. If you have any idea of how to help my issue, please comment or something.</p> </div><!--",
