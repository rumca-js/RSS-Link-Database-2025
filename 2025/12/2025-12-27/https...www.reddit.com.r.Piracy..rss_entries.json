This guide is focused on PC, but some Android things will also be mentioned.</p> <ol> <li>Where to get music? It is recommended to use Nicotine+ (approved by the megathread). It is a graphical client for the Soulseek peer to peer network. Soulseek is a system for file sharing. It is mostly used for music, but you can find some other files there too. You can download it on Windows, Linux and macOS. Android has its own Soulseek client called Seeker, but it is not recommended to use it since some people report being unable to download files.</li> </ol> <p>After installing it, you will be asked for a username visible to other people and a password. Then you will need to choose a folder where downloaded stuff will go. It is recommended to create a folder called Soulseek or however you want, just do not choose the Downloads folder or any other where",

Defender will be off and I&#39;ll exclude files; it still happens, it doesn&#39;t matter. I&#39;m highly suspicious that it&#39;s my RAM, as I&#39;ve had other instability issues the past few months and I can&#39;t seem to figure it out. To further confirm it, OCCT is registering 100k+ RAM errors when testing, with or without XMP enabled. Just so I&#39;m not going crazy, is the failing RAM what&#39;s likely causing my CRC issues? Have any of you had similar issues that were resolved once you swapped your RAM?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Recently I have been very in to listening to the Game Grumps read fanfiction while I am working and usually I just listen to it off of Kemono Party so I don&#39;t have to pay, but Kemono Party has not updated the Game Grumps page since October and I need my fix of Game Grumps fan fiction. Anyone aware of any piracy website that is like Kemono Party, that has a lot of creator variety on it and n doesn&#39;t ask for you to sign up or anything? Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Optimal-Algae-9649\"> /u/Optimal-Algae-9649 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1pwj4i4/a_site_like_kemono_party/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1pwj4i4/a_site_like_kemono_party/\">[comments]</a></span>",
