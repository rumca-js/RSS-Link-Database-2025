She was amazed by the fact that she could control the game using her own body.</p> <p>Her favorite games are Beat Saber, Superhot, and Walkabout Mini Golf. I even bought a second headset, and now we often play Walkabout Mini Golf together in co-op. We\u2019re also looking forward to trying more co-op VR games in the future.</p> <p>So if your girlfriend doesn\u2019t enjoy traditional games, maybe you just haven\u2019t shown her VR yet.

I am blind, and I&#39;m looking to use a dummy plug in place of an expensive TV. I&#39;m looking for one that supports 4k Dolby Vision and HDR 10+ but the problem I&#39;m having is that I&#39;ve learned that sometimes the product descriptions say they do support this when they don&#39;t. The one I bought is supposed to be HDMI 2.1, which I&#39;ve read usually means I should be good to go, but according to my streaming device it only does basic HDR. The reason I need it to support the higher quality video is that I&#39;ve recently learned that certain video streaming services lock access to Dolby Atmos audio so that only people streaming in DV or comparable can access it.

You may think that if you\u2019re not the Dragonborn, Skyrim probably wouldn\u2019t be that fun. Elite dangerous doesn\u2019t have any hero\u2026but not everyone is a pilot\u2026but I could still live as a station clerk or some background tech guy\u2026</p> <p>If I had to pick one:</p> <p>Skyrim VR, as a rural NPC with a routine and a hearth fire.</p> <p>It offers:</p> <pre><code>\u2022 Daily rhythm \u2022 Community without obligation \u2022 Danger you can avoid \u2022 A world that waits for you, rather than demands from you </code></pre> <p>And if you ever got bored\u2026 you could always walk to another town and start a new life\u2014still not a hero.</p> <p>So Skyrim wins again for me.

It was with the PlayStation VR for PS4, not that inferior Google Cardboard junk. </p> <p>My first games were Astro Bot, Beat Saber, and Job Simulator, which I even platinumed. </p> <p>I got the headset as a Christmas gift in December 2019, and setting it up was an extremely tedious and ludicrous process for no reason, and looking back, the tracking was pretty atrocious. I also tripped over the wire once and fell, so we had to get a new one. </p> <p>All of this, and yet I still look at it fondly regardless. But maybe I should have genuinely waited to get a Quest instead of looking in hindsight. Recently, I&#39;ve taken a break, but now I&#39;m back in VR like I never left.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MaterialLeader3441\"> /u/MaterialLeader3441 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pwjosi/what_were_some_of_your_guys_firs",
