I&#39;ve turned both off, run only one or the other, and run both at the same time and regardless ads on YouTube still play here and there. I get that the browser is still in its early days but it&#39;s really annoying. Does anyone know of a solution?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bucket_Head-o7\"> /u/Bucket_Head-o7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1pwovrd/ad_blockers_on_helium_dont_work/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1pwovrd/ad_blockers_on_helium_dont_work/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It organizes everything into a proper <strong>tree structure</strong>, so new links actually nest under their parent tab.</p> <p>Plus, I spent a lot of time making the UI look genuinely nice (glassmorphism/native feel) because I stare at it all day.</p> <p>View the source code: <a href=\"https://github.com/shuknuk/zentreetabs/\">https://github.com/shuknuk/zentreetabs/</a></p> <p>Download the first release here: <a href=\"https://github.com/shuknuk/zentreeTabs/releases/tag/releases\">https://github.com/shuknuk/zentreeTabs/releases/tag/releases</a></p> <p>Feel free to test it out, give me feedback, and add/remove changes on GitHub!
