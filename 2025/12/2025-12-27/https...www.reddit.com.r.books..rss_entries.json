Well it started good and it finished good, the last half was good, but there was an awful lull until the mysteries were finally beginning to be revealed in more detail. It just was not the near perfect book some mentioned it as, though I did find it an easy smaller read, much quicker than most books. Not drowning a fantasy world in oddly named characters is a great way to tell us about a world, yet at the same time we were not really told that much of the world, certainly not its full extents or reasons for existence. The mention of animals is quite random and one wonders if they really fit the world. Even the upper and lower extents were barely a part of it. Anyway the setting was imaginative just not fully realized, it would need a sequel to properly do that. What other books do perhaps a better imaginative world reveal without drowning it in dif",
