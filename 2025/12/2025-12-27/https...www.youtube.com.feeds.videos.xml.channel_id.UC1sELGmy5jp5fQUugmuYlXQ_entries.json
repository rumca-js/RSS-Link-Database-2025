Couldn\u2019t wait to Spring to Life and join new mob variants. And when the Mounts of Mayhem were unleashed, you raised your spears and rode into the fray. And of course CHICKEN JOCKEY! Enjoy the free Inflatable Chicken Jockey CC item and thank you for all your creativity (and chaos). \n\nDisclaimer: Inflatable Chicken Jockey requires the latest version of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (sold separately), with access to Minecraft Marketplace.",
