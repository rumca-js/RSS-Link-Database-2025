If anybody has seen the Linus video you will know that these two SOC manufacturers essentially make up 99% of the market (from Garmin to cheap Chinese cams). most of these dashcams are super overpowered, so this mod puts it to work. we have a waitlist for the cloud product and also support local storage/self hosting. the website is mainly for standard consumers but let me know if you have any technical questions, I\u2019m happy to answer them. we are taking this seriously so are going to quite some effort to ensure that any modifications are CE/UKCA compliant and don&#39;t turn your dashcam into another endpoint in a botnet. check it out and let me know what you think! </p> <p>ps, yes your dashcam can run crisis.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",
