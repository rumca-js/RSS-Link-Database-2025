My only successes have been Hello World, Portainer, and bitwarden. Bitwarden was the only one that had a &quot;fedora&quot; image in their separate repository. Bitwarden ran fine but the client wouldn&#39;t connect due to self-signed cert. Of the others, some just threw generic errors and wouldn&#39;t run, some just wouldn&#39;t do anything with logs that did not indicate what was wrong, and come ran but would not open a network port. I found one that wouldn&#39;t run was just some php code, so I installed in on my already installed and running web server.</p> <p>Because of thes",
