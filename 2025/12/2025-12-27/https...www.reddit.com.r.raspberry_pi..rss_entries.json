I set up a static IP for my ethernet connection, netmask /24, gateway &amp; DNS set to 192.168.1.1 (modem), then I added the RasPi IP to the DHCP Reserved list on the modem. I wanted to have it set up so I can remote into it either via SSH or VNC because the RasPi is basically sitting right next to the modem so I can&#39;t plug a monitor in and control it manually. Both SSH &amp; VNC are enabled on the RasPi and I can confirm they work because I was able to remote into my RasPi through WiFi, but I can&#39;t do it via ethernet. I pinged it from my PC (Windows 10) and I&#39;m getting &quot;Destination host unreachable&quot;. I tried running &quot;arp -a&quot; on my PC and the RasPi ethernet IP is not listed. Only the WiFi is listed among some other unrelated stuff. The left LED for ",

I got given it by a friend who didn&#39;t know what to do with it, and I&#39;m hoping to see what other people have tried with it? I tried to install Raspberry Pi lite os on it, but I&#39;ve not tried to SSH into it yet. I&#39;m unsure if lite is the right choice of os for such an under-powered device?</p> <p>I also have an OG Raspberry pi model B (My first computer when I was a kid!) and I&#39;m hoping to go get it from my mum&#39;s house and collect a small army of pis to take over the world... erm make a little server rack for a home lab running dockers. I really hope these two old pis aren&#39;t dead and they&#39;re the little Pis that could!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DarklingIllustration\"> /u/DarklingIllus",
