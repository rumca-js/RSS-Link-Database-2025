No streaming of audio or video.</p> <p>I am looking at the DH2300/4300 and the DXP2800/4800.</p> <p>The DXP4800 is the only one with a 10Gb LAN port. I\u2019m wondering, with him only transferring files and not streaming will he even need the 10Gb or will the 2.5Gb/ 1Gb be enough?</p> <p>I was reading about the proprietary HDD Synology news, thats enough to avoid them all together. I think for his first NAS we need a plug and play device and OS, not DIY.</p> <p>My goal is to have this NAS last my son through his next 3 years i",
