        "description": "<p>Before C++20, <code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code> gave us a solid foundation for working with clocks, durations, and time points -  but it didn\u2019t really know anything about the civil calendar. If you needed to represent \u201cMarch 15\u201d, check whether a date is valid, compute \u201cthe third Monday of November\u201d, or add a few months to a date, you had to rely on custom utilities, <code>std::tm</code>, or external libraries like Howard Hinnant\u2019s excellent date.</p>\n<p>C++20 finally fills this gap by standardising a complete set of calendar types: <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>weekday</code>, <code>year_month_day</code>, <code>month_day_last</code>, and many more. These types let you express dates in a clear, strongly typed way, without fragile integer arithmetic or manual conversions.</p>\n<p>All of this comes with a very clean API: more than 40 overloads of the <code>/</code> operator let you build date types fluently, almost like writing calendar expressions.
