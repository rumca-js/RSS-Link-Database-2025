After the use of traditional statistical methodologies and machine learning in the past, various fundamental deep learning architectures such as MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, and GNNs have been developed and applied to solve time series forecasting problems. However, the structural limitations caused by the inductive biases of each deep learning architecture constrained their performance. Transformer models, which excel at handling long-term dependencies, have become significant architectural components for time series forecasting. However, recent research has shown that alternatives such as simple linear layers can out",

I\u2019ve been pretty vocal about my issues with Perplexity\u2019s model opacity and other issues. But after testing everything else, I\u2019m realizing that their method/architecture is the only one that actually makes sense for AI, and for reliability.</p> <p>The industry is obsessed with knowledge compression. It has its usefulness (definitely makes the model smarter), but it is also obviously a dead end on its own. It inevitably leads to hallucinations because probabilistic token prediction isn&#39;t the same as fact storage. This is the main gripe everyone has with LLMs. It is intrinsic to their non-deterministic nature, and very clear. It also shows how unimaginative all the big labs have been when trying to release their models/products to the public.... it&#39;s going to undermine the trust of people on your product, how hard is it to",

I\u2019ve been attempting this with Gemini, but with little success. I found that if you tell it to \u201cmake a natural continuation frame\u201d, it focuses on the traditional minimalistic movements depicted in 2d animation, but each image gets more pixelated. Any ideas or thoughts on the matter? I know that Disney made a deal with Sora so it will be able to use copyrighted characters, but will that be able to capture the magic?
