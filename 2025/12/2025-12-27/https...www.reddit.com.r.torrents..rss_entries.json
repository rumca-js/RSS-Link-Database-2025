Surprisingly, it worked very smoothly for the crappy laptop (any issues that rose were due to the computer). I finally decided to get it on my new laptop knowing that it was safe, so I downloaded the exact same file with qbittorrent again, but when I opened FL it said I needed to sign in etc, and the trial would be activated for now. </p> <p>I also tried another older version by the same uploader on rutracker, but the same thing happened. I uninstalled the \u201cMcfee\u201d virus protection thing that came with the laptop and tried again, but nothing happened. I\u2019ve had no error messages and retried multiple times now. It\u2019s the exact same file- so my only guess is that there\u2019s something within the computer that is causing the problem.</p> <p>Has this happened to anyone? Does anyone know how to fix it?
