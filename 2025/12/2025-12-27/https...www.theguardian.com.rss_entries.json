A display of equal parts grit and skill by Newcastle threatened a huge festive upset in the freezing-cold south-west, but two tries by the elusive Louis Rees-Zammit and some classically fluent attacking by Pat Lam\u2019s buoyant team eventually enabled them to overpower their spirited visitors.</p><p>After the Bears ruined Harlequins\u2019 Christmas at Twickenham last Saturday, sticking 40 points on the Londoners in Big Game 17, they were widely expected to ease to victory against the Prem\u2019s bottom side, who were yet to muster a bonus point after seven matches. The question seemed to be not if Bristol would win, rather by how many.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/dec/27/bristol-newcastle-prem-rugby-union-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

A putrid stench came out of the water and the shock of the smell was overwhelming. The shimmering rainbow swirl of oil seemed to kill any fish that were in its path.
