About 14 months ago I got frustrated with how fitness apps work: mandatory accounts, cloud sync by default, Google Analytics baked in, and subscriptions tied to constant data collection. So I built the opposite. SkiCoach is a ski coaching app that: \u2219 Runs 100% offline - works in airplane mode \u2219 Requires no account, login, or Google sign-in \u2219 Zero analytics SDKs, tracking pixels, or background uploads \u2219 Processes all sensor data locally on your phone \u2219 Stores everything on-device only \u2219 Exports data ONLY if you explicitly choose to There are no servers. No Firebase. No Google Play Services dependency. The app functions fully without any network connection. Privacy tradeoffs I\u2019d like input on: \u2219 Is \u201coffline by default\u201d still viable when users expect sync and backups? \u2219 Do you trust on-device processing more than cloud, even if results are less accurate? \u2219 Are there pr",
