Part of that conversation included them saying they aren\u2019t homophobic, so I asked three questions that I consider being able to measure whether or not someone is homophobic:</p> <ol> <li>Do you believe that being gay is \u2018wrong\u2019 or \u2018unnatural\u2019 or \u2018sinful?\u2019</li> <li>If gay marriage was on the ballot, would you vote to support or ban gay marriage?</li> <li>Is anyone I\u2019m dating allowed in your home? </li> </ol> <p>Do you think these are accurate? Would you add any other questions you could ask someone if they insisted they aren\u2019t homophobic?</p> <p>I will add, my main point in this was to explain to them why I don\u2019t like to spend a lot of time with my family. They\u2019ve told me all of these things and more, so I was trying to help them understand how telling me they think being gay is wrong, why they don\u2019t ",
