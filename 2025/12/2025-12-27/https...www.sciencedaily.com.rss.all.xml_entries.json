They found that the vaccines can spark a two-step immune reaction that floods the body with inflammatory signals, drawing aggressive immune cells into the heart and causing temporary injury.",

        "description": "UBC Okanagan researchers have uncovered how plants create mitraphylline, a rare natural compound linked to anti-cancer effects. By identifying two key enzymes that shape and twist molecules into their final form, the team solved a puzzle that had stumped scientists for years. The discovery could make it far easier to produce mitraphylline and related compounds sustainably. It also highlights plants as master chemists with untapped medical potential.",

Long-standing anomalies had hinted at a mysterious fourth \u201csterile\u201d neutrino, potentially rewriting the laws of physics. Using exquisitely precise measurements of tritium decay, the KATRIN experiment found no evidence for such a particle, sharply contradicting earlier claims. With more data and upgrades ahead, the hunt is far from over.",

        "description": "Researchers have discovered how cells activate a last-resort DNA repair system when severe damage strikes. When genetic tangles overwhelm normal repair pathways, cells flip on a fast but error-prone emergency fix that helps them survive. Some cancer cells rely heavily on this backup system, even though it makes their DNA more unstable. Blocking this process could expose a powerful new way to target tumors.",
