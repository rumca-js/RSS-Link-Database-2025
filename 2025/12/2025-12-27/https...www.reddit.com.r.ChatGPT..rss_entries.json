Right now, everything lives under a single \u201cidentity\u201d and memory space. Over time, this can lead to some friction. Personal context, preferences, or conversational tone can bleed into work-related sessions, and vice versa.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Leaning entirely on any one entity for support, whether it&#39;s your partner, therapist, a family member, a close friend, or an LLM, is dangerous, because we need access to diverse perspectives to make informed choices. LLMs can hallucinate and have issues with sycophancy, but there are also manipulative partners, abusive families, and bad therapists. We need someone to push back when the advice we&#39;re getting from another source is counterproductive or not fully taking context into account, and that goes in both directions, both with AIs pointing out when someone in your life is treating you unfairly, as well as your human support pointing out when your AI has gone off the rails. Thinking critically, synthesizing multiple sources, and making your own independent choices is the key.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChiaraStellata\"> /u/ChiaraStellata </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

On the other, I\u2019ve noticed that constant interaction can create a kind of false continuity: thoughts feel coherent in the moment, but it\u2019s hard to tell what actually integrates when you step away.</p> <p>I\u2019m not talking about \u201cAI is bad\u201d or moral panic. More like:</p> <pre><code>\u2022 Does insight still hold after distance? \u2022Do ideas feel authored by you once the mirror is gone? \u2022 Is silence part of thinking, not just a gap between prompts? </code></pre> <p>(a little in the weeds at this point)</p> <p>For casual users this probably doesn\u2019t matter. But for people who use AI as a thinking partner\u2014does deliberate disengagement improve clarity, or is that overthinking it?</p> <p>Would genuinely like to",
