Im using a front end (ytdlp-interface v2.18.2) to make life easier, and ive noticed it doesnt download all the videos in the playlist. I thought this might be a region/cookies issue, but when i download the videos individually theres no issue. Is there a way to know what the issue is then redownload just the missing videos? </p> <p>Second question In this same instance i was trying the &quot;-download-archive FILE&quot; and not sure where it saves this info to, or if it saves it at all? or if it even works?? </p> <p>Third how do I get the aforementioned cookies to download certain videos? I tired the command from the Github but no dice so not sure if either of the commands i mentioned today are just user error &quot;the most likely&quot; or a matter of the front end. I&#39;ve used commands with the front end before and they do work, but im not very techsavey.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> ",

I downloaded yt-dlp again in my new PC; turns out that on this machine, it has been downloading the video and the audio separately because of the lack of FFmpeg if I understood the program correctly, I looked for it and downloaded via the enviroment variable path thingie, went back to it and...</p> <p>It doesn&#39;t download anything anymore because it says I do not have the Java scripts for it, and that I should prove I&#39;m not a bot by passing through cookies, taking the FFmpeg out of the enviroment variable path seems to go back to normal.</p> <p>I clicked through every link I saw and came out empty-handed or with another problem to solve, so before I spend more time in deciphring this puzzle, what I&#39;m really interested for is if there is a way to download video and audio, in one file together, without needing the extra loops that ffmpeg is giving me?</p> <p>The code, for those interested:</p> <p>C:\\Users",

So that&#39;ll get you the &quot;best&quot; video regardless of audio and then the &quot;best&quot; audio-only. But what does that mean?<br/> According to the documentation bv without the * only checks for video-only formats disregarding any videos that contain audio while bv* gets you the best video period which may or may not contain some audio, but then ba is the best audio-only format ignoring any audio contained inside a video format and ba* says do not use and it explains why rather well. Not sure what the /b at the end means.<br/> So that still leaves several possible scenarios where you aren&#39;t getting the best video and best audio available. What if the best audio is &quot;hidden&quot; inside a video format that&#39;s lower total quality than the best quality",
