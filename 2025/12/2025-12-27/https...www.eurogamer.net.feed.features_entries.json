Who saw that coming&hellip; Seriously though, let me tell you about a little downside of my job: if we're covering a game, or considering doing so, I have to spoil everything for myself for planning purposes. End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled. If I don't learn it before the game comes out, I'll certainly know about it shortly after release thanks to research. (I learned what happened to Zelda in <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343\">Tears of the Kingdom</a> via Google Trends. <em>Google bloody Trends</em>.)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2025-deltarune-remi",

Instead, they just touch. They graze. They fuse. It's all very gentle. And then, over time, the two objects become one.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2025-skin-deep\">Read more</a></p>",
