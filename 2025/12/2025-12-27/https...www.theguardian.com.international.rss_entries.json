Football was about possession, about the press, but most of all about position, about the careful manipulation of space. Much-improved pitches meant first touches could be taken for granted: players receiving the ball didn\u2019t have to focus on getting it under control but could instead be parsing their options.

These images from the last 25 years chronicle modern history in the making</p><p>At the turn of the century there was a modest debate, mainly conducted on the letters pages of the newspapers \u2013 back then, still the prime forum for public discussion \u2013 as to when, exactly, the new millennium and the 21st century began. Most assumed the start date was 1 January 2000, but dissenters, swiftly branded pedants, insisted the correct date came a year later. As it turned out, both were wrong.</p><p>The 21st century began in earnest, at least in the western mind, on a day that no one had circled in their diaries. Out of a clear blue sky, two passenger jets flew into the twin towers of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 and so inaugurated a new age of anxiety \u2013 a period in which we have lived ever since.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2",
