Kind of curious if there&#39;s any Victorian-era fantasy out there, even though I know a lot of that tends to trend toward steampunk.

I love literature, big Terry Practhett fan, love Louis De Bernieres, love Douglas Adams, love Gerald Durrell but I don&#39;t really get these books. Yes, there are funny lines here and there and admittedly I&#39;m only 3/4 of the way through book three so I should still give it a chance. But I&#39;m finding tons of the text just goes on and on in a slightly droning and repetitive way. I absolutely can&#39;t get behind the main character, he seems just a bit wet and insipid. I was told by the purchaser of the books that I probably just wasn&#39;t &quot;seeing the big picture&quot; but the big picture so far seems to be that he works in a fairly shady firm and each book reveals that one more of the partners is evil is a slightly different way from the last. I am totally open to persuasion on this one so if someone wants to tell me I&#39;m a moron I&#39;m fine with that! </p",

I couldn&#39;t find mass market paperbacks for anything but LOTR and Malazan, and even Brandon Sanderson&#39;s newer books B&amp;N only had the big chunky paperbacks/hardcovers available. What angers me more is that books such as James Islingtons &quot;Will of the Many&quot; and sequel have paperback versions but B&amp;N seem to be hiding them/putting them in places where its hard to find while openly advertising the hardcover version, Why are there not more Mass Market Paperbacks for other books (Besides the fact that production ends ofc) it just seems very upsetting that books can be upwards of $20-30 nowadays and we can&#39;t protest unless we want to get a damn kindle or audiobook (Which sometimes I don&#39;t mind but not for fantasy books), thoughts?</p> </div><",
