However, recent reasoning models have achieved strong results on graduate-level academic and professional examinations across various disciplines. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art reasoning models on a set of mock CFA exams consisting of 980 questions across three Level I exams, two Level II exams, and three Level III exams. Using the same pass/fail criteria from prior studies, we find that most models clear all three levels. The models that pass, ordered by overall performance, are Gemini 3.0 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Opus 4.1, and DeepSeekV3.1. Specifically, Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves a record score of 97.6% on Level I. Performance is also strong on ",

For example, Plaintiff complains about the sexual nature of [the minor\u2019s] conversations with some Characters and remarks the Characters made about suicide.\u201d The court also noted that even though the minor \u201cmay have been ultimately harmed by interactions with Character A.I. Characters, these harmful interactions were only possible because of the alleged design defects in the Character A.I. app. Accordingly, Character A.I. is a product for the purposes of plaintiff\u2019s strict products liability claims so far as plaintiff\u2019s claims arise from defects in the Character A.I. app rather than ideas or expressions within the app.\u201d&#39;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/250618-software-gains-new-st",
