It feels awful, but let&#39;s be realistic: it&#39;s not dying, it&#39;s just maturing.</p> <p>Too many people flooded the gate with the same resume: A boot camp, a Security+ cert, and zero practical IT/networking experience. Companies realized that hiring a dozen Tier 1 SOC analysts with no troubleshooting skills wasn&#39;t sustainable.</p> <p>We created an expectation that you could jump from zero to six figures just by passing a multiple-choice test. The Reality: That bubble has popped. The market is now filtering out people who can&#39;t actually do the work.</p> <p>I believe demand for specialized people is still high but for newbies who need 2 years of hand holding is dying. </p> <p>Let&#39;s Be Honest: We Need the Villains This is the cold truth about our entire industry, and why the jobs will never truly die",
