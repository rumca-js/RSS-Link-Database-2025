It first started with random letters added while I was searching for stunt jump map for gta4. A couple minutes after it started opening random chrome pages(mostly blank, but one charity). I googled &quot;can a hacker connect to my phone&quot; right away and again, there was random letters added and enter key pressed itself.</p> <p>I was still pretty sure that my phone(Xiaomi 10 5g) was just tweaking. So I wrote into the search bar: &quot;type something&quot;. My keyboard language changed to russian and I got &quot;r,\u0447,&quot; as an answer.</p> <p>Wrote: &quot;what do you want&quot; into the search bar and YouTube popped up after a minute or two with &quot;I want your money&quot; music video on.</p> <p>Turned mobile data off and shat down my phone by holding on/off.</p> <p>Was this just a coincidence or how easy is to pull off something like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
