At some point I noticed that most SaaS UIs aren\u2019t an open world \u2014 they\u2019re mostly projections of BFF DTOs into a small set of recurring patterns: forms, cards, tables, dashboards, filters.</p> <p>I was experimenting with letting an LLM drive parts of this UI. I started with the usual agent loop: the model reasons, mutates UI state, checks the result, and repeats. It technically worked, but it was fragile. Simple tasks took multiple loops, state drifted in ways I couldn\u2019t reproduce, and debugging mostly came down to reading logs and guessing.</p> <p>What changed things was making that SaaS structure explicit and narrowing the model\u2019s role. Instead of letting the LLM mutate state directly, I made it emit a single validated intent over a typed snapshot of the UI state. A deterministic runtime then applies effects, runs validation, and updates the snapshot.</p> <p>That removed agent loops entirely. State tra",

Therefore, the AI agents typically create a plan of what they intend to do first (which as a side effect also increases the likelihood that they do not drift off). Then, the human verifies the plan and approves it if it is correct, and the AI agents execute the plan. If the plan is not correct, the human rejects it and sends the agents back to replanning, providing information about what needs to be altered.</p> </blockquote> <p>These agents might get better with time, but they will continuously need human oversight - there is always the possibility of error.
