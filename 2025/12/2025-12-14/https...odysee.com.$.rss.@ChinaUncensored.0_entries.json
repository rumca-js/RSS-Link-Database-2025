A political organization with such noteworthy members as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.<br /><br />In this episode of China Uncensored, we expose how China\u2019s messaging is being pushed through American political organizations, media figures, and so-called \u201cpolitical education\u201d seminars. From praising the CCP as a \u201cdemocracy,\u201d to opposing U.S. efforts to counter China\u2019s growing power, these narratives line up remarkably well with Beijing\u2019s interests.<br /><br />",
