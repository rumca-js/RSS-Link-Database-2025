I\u2019m building an actual good TOR search engine, it deduplicates your search results by identifying content mirrors, it uses semantic search and Google like operators (e.g. \u201cIntitle:\u201d or \u201cfiletype:\u201d) it will be open source once it launches publicly, and it\u2019s built in rust. Everyone\u2019s favorite language. Service name is called \u201cDeepLens\u201d and it will be hosted at Deeplens.fi . However, testing the crawler, indexer, and search performance requires a production-like environment. I need your XMR to pay for this cloud hosting infrastructure for about two months. One month of tests and development, then the public release along with opening of the source code.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested donate here: <a href=\"https://kuno.anne.media/fundraiser/cbwi/\">https://kuno.anne.media/fundraiser/cbwi/</a></p> <p>If you aren\u2019t interested, then thanks",
