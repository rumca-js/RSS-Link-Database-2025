That's because he seems to act more like a pet than a reindeer, taking up residence in the main house and playing with the family dog. He does live on a reindeer farm in the UK, but his keeper says it's not his fault for the misunderstandings. Inside Edition Digital\u2019s Mara Montalbano has more.",

        "description": "Suzie Lopez says she looked pregnant for the last five years because she had a large ovarian cyst. When she went to the hospital to have it removed, she was given a routine pregnancy test, and it was positive. Lopez had an ultrasound and she says her tumor blocked the image. The growing baby was not in Lopez's uterus. The pregnancy was an \"abdominal ectopic pregnancy\" a rare life-threatening situation for mom and baby. A team of medical professionals removed the tumor and a healthy baby boy. To support the Lopez family, visit their GoFundMe: https://www.gofundme.com/f/welcome-to-the-world-baby-ryu",
