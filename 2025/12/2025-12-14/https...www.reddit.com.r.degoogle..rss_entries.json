I&#39;ve never used any financial apps. I only do important financial/legal/medical stuff on one of my computers for both convienence and privacy/security. I recognize not everyone has a personal computer but even then I&#39;d just use the browser since it&#39;s not something I need to access daily. Honestly I feel like I just use devices and technology in general differently than most people. But then again I had my own personal computer for many years before I had a smartphone so that&#39;s what I&#39;m accustomed to. </p> <p>For example I try to minimize invasive software on any device. Google is basically only for YouTube. I use Linux so Microsoft is only for Minecraft. I don&#39;t use any Meta products.
