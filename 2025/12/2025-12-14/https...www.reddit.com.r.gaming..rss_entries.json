I can give some examples but it seems mostly this is done by flooding the area, yet I&#39;m sure there are more creative instances of this out there. Sorta like in Majora&#39;s Mask when you flip the entire dungeon upside down and back again, also Ocarina of Time Water Temple and Tomb Raider Cistern where you can flood and unflood the entire level. It doesn&#39;t have to be back and forth, though, can be an irreversible change (though I lack examples of that).

The puzzle like strategy, combined with very satisfying shooting combat is just straight up awesome. </p> <p>That being said, the dialogue and performances are pretty damn hokey.

My eldest playing Pokemon, and the youngest playing a bluey game on her tablet. Myself playing Red Alert. I told em times up we gotta go have outside time, and said &quot;Everybody Find a Save Point.&quot; Idk why but as a gamer/dad/husband it made me really happy. I think I won at life. </p> <p>Thought I&#39;d share this. It was a gaming moment that just made my heart smile. Sometimes as aging gamers we wonder what&#39;s the okay amount for gaming, but honestly having gaming time has been really awesome. It feels bonding all of us in the same room playing video games. My kids get frustrated and ask for help so I help them. Or they get excited when they succeed or beat a boss. My wife and I will occasionally play games together and it&#39;s awesome. It such a Divinity trailer world, sometimes it&#39;s good to have a wholesome gaming time.</p> </",
