Then an Apple employee left a prototype in a bar. Gizmodo bought it, took it apart, published all the sordid details, and pretty much broke the internet. And thus, the story of the iPhone 4 began well before the launch of the iPhone 4.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://play",
