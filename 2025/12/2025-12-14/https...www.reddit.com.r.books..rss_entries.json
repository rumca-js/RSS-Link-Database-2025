        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Whenever I go to a well-stocked used bookstore I always marvel at the authors who have a good deal of titles to their credit but have largely fallen out of the mainstream consciousness. Robin Moore, for example, is best known for The Green Berets and The French Connection, but had written dozens of other novels. Are there any others that come to mind?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OnlyCelebration7443\"> /u/OnlyCelebration7443 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pmcwej/prolific_yet_forgotten_authors/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1pmcwej/prolific_yet_forgotten_authors/\">[comments]</a></span>",

A title that sounds too serious. Or the fact that everyone keeps talking about it.</p> <p>I ignored The Goldfinch for years because it felt long and heavy. When I finally read it, I learned how quietly grief can shape a person over time. I also felt like I missed years of sitting with that story and letting it grow on me earlier. </p> <p>I skipped Gone Girl because it felt overhyped. When I read it later, I learned how sharp and controlled the writing really was. I missed the experience of discovering those twists without already knowing the reputation. </p> <p>Both books made me realize how many good reading years we lose by judging too fast.</p> <p>What book did you avoid for a long time for a silly reason but ended up loving once you finally read it?</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
