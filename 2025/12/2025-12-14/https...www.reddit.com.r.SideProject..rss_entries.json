But you don&#39;t need viral fame right now. You just need 10 real users.</p> <p>Why 10? Because 10 users are enough to find your bugs, validate your idea, and give you the confidence to keep building. To find them, you need to go where the early adopters actually hang out.</p> <p>Here are the 5 best platforms to get your first 10 users and the high-quality feedback you need: <a href=\"https://www.nxgntools.com/blog/the-5-best-platforms-to-get-your-first-10-users-and-killer-feedback-2026?utm_source=reddit\">https://www.nxgntools.com/blog/the-5-best-platforms-to-get-your-first-10-users-and-killer-feedback-2026?utm_source=reddit</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/doppelgunner\"> /u/doppelgunne",

The idea came from a simple struggle: sometimes working hourly or freelance feels like a drag, and it&#39;s hard to visualize the reward while you&#39;re in the grind.</p> <p>I wanted to &quot;gamify&quot; my work day. I built this app to track earnings in real-time. You input your salary or hourly rate, and the app shows a live counter of the money you are making right that second. It actually helps me stay focused because I can literally see the cost of taking a break or the reward of working another hour.</p> <p><strong>Core Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Real-time earning counter (literally watch the money go up).</li> <li>Works for fixed monthly salaries or hourly rates.</li> <li>Customizable work hours.</li> </ul> <p>I\u2019d love to hear what you think of the UI (screenshots attached) and if you have any feature requests!</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong><b",
