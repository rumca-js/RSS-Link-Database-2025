These molecules change depending on diet, genetics, and shifts in the microbiome. Some even improved insulin response in liver cells when tested in the lab. The findings could open the door to new ways of preventing or managing obesity and diabetes.",

        "description": "A series of century-scale droughts may have quietly reshaped one of the world\u2019s earliest urban civilizations. New climate reconstructions show that the Indus Valley Civilization endured repeated long dry periods that gradually pushed its people toward the Indus River as rainfall diminished. These environmental stresses coincided with shrinking cities, shifting settlements, and eventually widespread deurbanization. Rather than a dramatic collapse, the civilization appears to have faded slowly under relentless climate pressure.",

By blending these clues, they overcome nature\u2019s misleading signals and maximize their chances of fathering offspring.",

Researchers at Mayo Clinic have now taken an inventive leap by using aptamers\u2014tiny, shape-shifting DNA molecules\u2014to selectively tag these elusive cells. The project began as an offbeat conversation between two graduate students and quickly evolved into a collaborative, cross-lab effort that uncovered aptamers capable of binding to unique surface proteins on senescent cells.",
