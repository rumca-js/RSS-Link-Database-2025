Anyway, I&#39;m interested in fiction exploring some subjects in Todd Haynes&#39; Safe, specifically health anxiety, women with chronic illness, pseudoscience/new age &#39;wellness&#39;, isolation, and maybe the increasingly hostile environment. Something anxiety-inducing like the movie would be perfect too. Leaning towards lit fic with a female protagonist but i&#39;m fairly open to anything tbh.

It was quite niche and I like exploring books so yeah... It&#39;s basically a story, where (No spoilers, just the starting chapter) The protagonist gets a space tour offer in the year 2057, and he and several other people go on that tour to Moon. On the way to the Moon, they come to know about something BIZARRE, something that will ruin their lives forever, and change everything in the story.</p> <p>Right now I have reached Chapter 4 and I am genuinely enjoying it, completely hooked. It&#39;s an indie book, so it was good to explore something new. Plus it was really affordable.</p> <p>Let me know if you want to know about the book, I&#39;ll DM you the details, since I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s okay to share the details here lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Iate69kids\"> /u/Iate69kids </",

First time posting here, my book reading history goes back to my teenager years and like most people I read LoTR, Harry Potter, Artemis Fowl, Bartimaeus, etc.</p> <p>Later i started playing games and I&#39;m mostly interested in story games, especially Remedy games (Most importantly Alan Wake 2) or even Baldur&#39;s gate 3 which i think are the closest to imaging a book in your head</p> <p>Now i&#39;m trying to dial back my screen time and go back to reading again, what book or book series would you recommend? My main requirement is for me to get introduced to new concepts, new relationships, new flawed characters, new worlds and so on It can be a romance book, sci-fi/Fantasy or fantasy even Horror, as long as it has strong world and character building and dialogues </p> <p>Thanks in advance </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shervin_dgn\"> /u/shervin_dgn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https",

PLEASE! </p> <p>Only read this part if you\u2019re somewhat of a literature nerd: I\u2019ve got a background in linguistics and composition, so I love the style he writes in. He is very manipulative (in the best way), using an Omniscient Narrator, false foreshadowing/ misdirection, non-linear narratives, very direct, ALL CAPS, type of language\u2026 I could go on. </p> <p>The author I compare him to most is Lemony Snicket (DH). Not because they\u2019re anything alike story wise, but their style of writing is so similar\u2014 the wit, the misdirection, the repetition, etc. </p> <p>ANYWAY- HELP.
