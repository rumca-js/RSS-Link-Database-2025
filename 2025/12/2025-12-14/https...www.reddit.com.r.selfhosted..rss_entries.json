If the program gets hacked, an attacker would still need to know the password of the user to run sudo. On the other hand, it likely would be better, to create a new user with no sudo rights. Then again, most tutorials request to install certain programs as services or with sudo. So my logical step would be to find out, which services (e.g. Plex) really need to be run with sudo... Which brings me to the title, which ways do I have to dtermine this? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/innaswetrust\"> /u/innaswetrust </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1pmlky2/best_way_to_determine_whether_a_service_needs_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments",

I&#39;m a web developer, and I&#39;m trying to build a web app to be open-source and maybe open a SaaS service in the future. Being open source and free, I don&#39;t want to pay $10 a month for a cookie consent manager, but I need it to test the UI and improve it. I saw there&#39;s an open-source Google Analytics, but I was wondering if there&#39;s any type of open-source Cookie consent manager platform (CMP). It has to comply with GDPR laws, as data will be processed in Italy.</p> <p>I think there might be some problems because of Google&#39;s recent consent mode v4, but there might be a workaround. I think by using Google Tag Manager, Google would register the consent correctly.</p> <p>Edit: I forgot to mention I use Next.js for the frontend, and the app is hosted on a Docker container at the moment.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Major_Lect",
