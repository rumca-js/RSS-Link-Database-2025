It had Macaulay Culkin in his last major film role, voicing an animated character who goes on an adventure with antromorphic books voiced by Whoopi Goldberg, Patrick Stewart and Frank Welker. Christopher lloyd as a wizard/librarian. A nice soundtrack with songs by Wendy Moten, Lisa Stansfield and Babyface. And a positive message about convincing kids to read, pretty much what The NeverEnding Story was supposed to be as well. But nobody saw it back then. </p> <p>Now, it&#39;s regarded as a cult classic, because many folks watched it on cable, home video. I discovered this movie thanks to a VHS tape that was lended to me and I loved it.

Another Polar Express style film, this time costing 200 million dollars(!!!), of a movie we\u2019ve seen dozens of iconic adaptations for. </p> <p>But then one year I caught it on TV and was just blown away by Jim Carey\u2019s Scrooge. And now it\u2019s become what I consider to be the best Christmas Carol adaptation. It\u2019s neck &amp; neck with Mickeys Christmas Carol(whose only weakness is that it\u2019s not long enough!). Yet it\u2019s Jim Carey who really impresses me. This is not phoned in, not just another role. The man gives it his all and gives what I think is one of his finest performances. </p> <p>I can\u2019t say it enough. Carey is a stunning here. He plays multiple roles(including 2 of the Ghosts) but his Scrooge is something else. I honestly believe that had this been live action instead of animated, he might\u2019ve received an Oscar nomination. </p> <p>His p",
