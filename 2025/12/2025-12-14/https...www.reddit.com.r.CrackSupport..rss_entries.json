Finally, I would recommend installing Hekate and Admosphere from scratch a while ago, and then running the FIX ARCHIVE BIT command right after installing Admosphere.</p> <p>I hope this post helps someone, as it took me a long time to find the solution.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thechettito\"> /",

I can&#39;t update my game anymore or get the new DLCs but I figured I&#39;d just play the outdated version. My game keeps crashing within 5 mins of loading my save, no error message of course so I don&#39;t know why. I tried to disable all my mods because I thought maybe one of the mods I installed was intended for a newer version but it still crashes with mods disabled.
