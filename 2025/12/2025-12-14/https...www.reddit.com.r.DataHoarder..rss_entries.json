Case can fit 4 3.5 drives in it, which is great because it&#39;s only 11 or so liters! </p> <p>Anyways I&#39;ve been searching for cheap large capacity drives and I stumbled upon the seagate expansion from their <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/products/external-hard-drives/expansion-desktop-hard-drive/\">website</a>. I figured I can just rip two 24tb drives out of their enclosure, install them and setup with raid in case one of them croaks.</p> <p>Assuming the average 4k blueray movie is 50gb a pop, that leaves nearly 500 movies can stored on a single 24tb drive. I think that should be plenty and I still have room for expansion if needed.</p> <p>Are these drives any good? They seem to be the best choice for the price brand new.
