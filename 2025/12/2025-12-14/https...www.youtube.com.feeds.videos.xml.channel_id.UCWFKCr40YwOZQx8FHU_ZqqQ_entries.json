        "description": "Rivian recently had their AI Day where they announced their new 3rd Generation Autonomy computer. These chips have a combine total of 1600 Trillion opperations per second. I was able to take two of them to my own lab so we can see what's on the inside.  Are you a fan of self driving? or are you more of a fan of driving your self? Let me know in the comments. \n\nGet up to 500 dollars off of your own Rivian with my code here: https://rivian.com/configurations/list?reprCode=ZACK1594426",
