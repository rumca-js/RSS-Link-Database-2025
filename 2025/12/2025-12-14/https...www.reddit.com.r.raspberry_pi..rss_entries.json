This time, I kinda wanna use it as a desktop for light work like YouTube, LibreOffice, but nothing too complex. The Raspberry Pi 5 2GB version is $56 were I live, while the 4GB version is $72. I&#39;m kind of a cheapskate, so I&#39;m wondering if 2GB RAM would be enough for that? I would also like to use a 128GB USB drive as a drive for the OS and my 60 watts phone charger as power. My other &quot;problem&quot; is that a lot of Linux distros don&#39;t run on Raspberry, but I want something &quot;cool&quot; Windows 11ish in terms of looks. So can anyone help me with my decision of how much RAM I should invest in and what Linux would be the best for me?

I have a pi5 with the Radxa Penta SATA Hat with a Ironwolf 4TB drive. My issue is my transfer speed is stuck at around 11 MB/s on the Samba Share. I&#39;m not sure if its a network issue, i have the pi plugged into the 5Gbps port on my router and i have 2GB internet speed. Any guesses on what it could be? It&#39;s driving me crazy at this point. I&#39;m also using OMV if that matters. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/andyw720\"> /u/andyw720 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pm5t4c/pi5_slow_transfer_speeds/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pm5t4c/pi5_slow_transfer_speeds/\">[comments]</a></span>",

He has done some coding camps and loves it but is pretty much a novice. I know nothing but an eager to learn with him and am inspired by your projects. 2 questions: good tutorials/beginner projects for him? And good tutorials for me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Longjumping-Cut-4337\"> /u/Longjumping-Cut-4337 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pm37p9/beginner_dad_learning/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1pm37p9/beginner_dad_learning/\">[comments]</a></span>",
