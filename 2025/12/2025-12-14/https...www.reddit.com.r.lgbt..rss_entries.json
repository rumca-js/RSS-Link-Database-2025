Why is there still so much hate towards LGBT people, and especially towards gays?</p> <p>I&#39;m gay myself, and I&#39;ve experienced this hate firsthand \u2014 even from my own parents. They used to say that gay people are &#39;sick&#39; and that we &#39;need to be cured&#39; or treated like something is wrong with us. Hearing that from the people who are supposed to love you no matter what... it really hurts and leaves deep scars.</p> <p>I&#39;m not broken. None of us are. We don&#39;t need fixing. We just want to live our lives and love who we love, the same as everyone else.</p> <p>When will this kind of hate finally stop? \ud83d\udc94\ud83c\udf08</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Financial_Coyote7913\"> /u/Financial_Coyote7913 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1pmgj5l/why_is_there_still_so_much_hate_against_lgbt/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>",

I want to extremely emphasize not to if you\u2019re not willing to have it removed or covered up. </p> <p>It\u2019s a bad idea for many reasons but the one I wanna touch on is the possibility that the person may change their name. As a trans guy it\u2019s horrific knowing that my mum has my deadname plastered on her calf for everyone to see, or getting to see it myself anytime she wears anything above the knee. It is the only 1 of 2 tattoos she has because she can\u2019t stand the experience of getting a tattoo. I requested that she cover it and instead she wants to add my current name onto it and leave my deadname too because she can\u2019t stand to do a full cover up. It\u2019s her body so it\u2019s not as though I have any choice but that tattoo will bother me til the end of my days.</",
