For 6+ hours of motion-captured, cutting edge CGI, fully-realized alien cultures and an amount of whale drama that's surprising every time i think about it, it's a little hard to keep tabs on the comings and goings of the Na'vi, the Metkayina and the humans looking for all the Unobtanium cheddar they can dig out from under the Home Tree. So here's a quick story recap of Avatar and Avatar: The Way of Water to refresh your memory of Jake Sully, Neytiri and their family before Fire and Ash hits IMAX screens and blows us all away again.\n\n#IGN",
