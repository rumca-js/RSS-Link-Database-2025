The sender used a display name that matched a known vendor, but the actual domain was a look-alike with a single character swap. That alone bypassed visual checks. The email relied heavily on urgency (\u201caction required within 24 hours\u201d) and avoided specific details that would normally raise suspicion. No ticket numbers, no account references, just pressure. The link itself resolved to a domain that was not owned by the real vendor, but it was close enough that quick inspection wouldn\u2019t catch it. Nothing here was sophisticated. It worked because it exploited speed, trust, and incomplete verification.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all, </p> <p>I would like to seek some opinions on the topic of vpn vs sase setups. Our network engineer seems to think that vpns are no longer required, this is a old legacy system that people used to use and suggested that sase (doesn\u2019t encrypt data) just web filtering is the way of the future? Am I insane to think he is incorrect?</p> <p>Thanks for your thoughts all!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Consideration7553\"> /u/Ok_Consideration7553 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1pm5gzq/vpn_vs_sase/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1pm5gzq/vpn_vs_sase/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;d like a centralized access management system that can consider factors such as user training (expires), group membership, current network threat level, and location of requesting asset. Some if it of course can be done with group management crossed with automation, but an ABAC framework may work well. Are there any such capabilities that are community-developed that are proven effective? Of course depending on how open-architecture it is, could tie in physical access control systems to it too like badging/door access, and centralized audit / logging. Know there is nothing exactly like this but is there anything close?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
