Unfortunately, all of my controllers are drifting, and the cable has been kinda busted. It still works, but I&#39;m looking for an excuse to get another VR headset. How would Steam Frame fare against the Rift S? Would it be a worthy purchase? It&#39;s worth noting that I really like PCVR, and don&#39;t care too much about It&#39;s standalone abilities. It sounds like the qualities that it has would be very useful in some aspects, but my priorities are PCVR games. I don&#39;t really have any games on the Meta store, so that&#39;s also an incentive to jump. I believe most of my games are on Steam.</p> <p>I didn&#39;t opt out for the Valve Index because it&#39;s a lot of money at the time I was browsing, and now Valve ",
