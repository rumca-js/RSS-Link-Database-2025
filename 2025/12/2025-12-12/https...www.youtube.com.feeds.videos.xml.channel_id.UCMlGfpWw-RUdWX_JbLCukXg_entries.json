In this keynote, I\u2019ll share some of my experiences and learnings from that journey, talk about how LLMs work more generally, attempt some live demonstrations of the latest functionality, explore the future of agentic programming, and tie all of this back to what it means for your workflow as a software engineer.\n\u200b\nWhen I agreed to give this talk earlier this year, there was some portion of the narrative that involved \u201cwhy you should be using ",
