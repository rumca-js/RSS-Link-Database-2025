Does it mean writing your own poc/exploit/malware from scratch? As I see a few elitist always say \u201cif you didn\u2019t write the exploit/poc/malware yourself it doesn\u2019t count\u201d \u201cyou didn\u2019t discover the CVE or write the poc for it\u201d blah blah you know what I mean. I know the term hacking originated in the late 50s-60s where people that tinker with hardware were called hackers and of course the term has evolved but it\u2019s also evolved into a meaningless word where to each individual person hacking means 1 thing but to the next person hacking could mean something else hence I referenced the typical elitist saying \u201cyou didn\u2019t discover the CVE &amp; write the PoC doesn\u2019t count\u201d</p> <p>So just general question what does hacking mean to you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Commercial_Process",
