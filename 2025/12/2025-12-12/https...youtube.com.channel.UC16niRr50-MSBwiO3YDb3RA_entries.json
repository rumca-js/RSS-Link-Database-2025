        "description": "Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro says escalating pressure from the US comes down to one thing: Washington wants to grab the South American nation's vast oil reserves.\n \nThis week, the American military seized an oil tanker, which was allegedly carrying Venezuelan oil being shipped in violation of US sanctions, and threatened action against other ships.\n \nThe move followed a series of military strikes on Venezuelan boats, which the US alleges are drug-trafficking vessels. President Donald Trump has called on Maduro to leave office, accusing him of sending narcotics and murderers to the US.\n \nSo is it Venezuela's oil that Trump really wants? And would it actually be worth it? \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Venezuela #Oil #PresidentTrump #BBCNews",

        "description": "In Marseille, locals talk of a state of panic and terror gripping the city. Rival drug gangs are now using automatic weapons in their turf wars - and using teenagers too. \n \nThe number of children involved has risen sixfold in recent years. Many are forced into debt, beaten and threatened. \n \nThe city\u2019s prosecutor called it a kind of slavery. Among the latest gang-related deaths, a fifteen year old boy was shot in the head and set on fire. \n \nFrench police are carrying out what they call \u201cbombardments\u201d of certain areas, trying to drive the dealers out. But the trade is being amplified on social media \u2013 where drugs and gang jobs are routinely advertised. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#France #Crime #BBCNews",

        "description": "England's Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is \"extremely worried\" about rising numbers of flu patients in hospitals and forthcoming strikes by resident doctors in England next week.\n\nSpeaking to LBC, Streeting said the current situation was \"probably the worst pressure the NHS has faced since Covid\".\n\nFlu has come early this winter and it looks to be a particularly nasty season because of a new mutated version of the virus which is circulating, say experts. Many are now calling it \"super flu\", but it is not more severe or harder to treat.\n\nA five-day strike by resident doctors in England, the new name for junior doctors, is set to begin on 17 December, but there are hopes it could be called off. The doctors' union, the British Medical Association, has agreed to poll its members to see if they are willing to call off the walkout.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Flu #NHS #England #BBCNews",
