Not trying to give any spoiler but the book is amazing. When you start reading the book it feels like &quot;okay maybe it&#39;s one of those usual horror books but with a different background&quot; but only when you&#39;re 40% into it, you get to know that there is more depth. It has so much of emotions proportionately mixed that the overall story doesn&#39;t seem to be clich\u00e8. You can&#39;t blame any of the characters and feel sorry for all. Such a masterful writing and presentation. What are your thoughts about the book?

It made me wonder what actually tips the balance. Is it the writing, the character\u2019s voice, the pacing, or just whether they\u2019re \u201ccompelling\u201d in some hard\u2011to-define way? The contrast hit me after finishing a novel where the main character was a complete disaster of a person, yet I couldn\u2019t stop reading because the author made their spiral strangely fascinating. Then I picked up another book with a much milder \u201cmessy\u201d lead and found myself getting irrationally irritated two chapters in. I\u2019m trying to figure out what the difference was. Well, Curious how other people think about this.
