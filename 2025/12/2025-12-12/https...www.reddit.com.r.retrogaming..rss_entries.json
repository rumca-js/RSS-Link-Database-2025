She sees the ones on tik tok and said she really wants one but she\u2019s not a gamer or anything and just wants something for fun. Does anyone have recs for something like that? Like beginner level emulator that works and she\u2019ll have fun with?

I don&#39;t know how many times I&#39;ve already played this game. I&#39;ve already beaten the 3rd dungeon and I&#39;m on my way to get the 4th instrument. Some things that stood out to me this playthrough: (1) it is still quite annoying to bump against a pot or crystal and (2) getting enough Rupees to buy the bow wasn&#39;t as hard as I thought it was. I just played naturally; in the past, I would grind for the Rupees as soon as I had access to the zombie enemies. I&#39;m still enjoying the game, but I have to confess that I might end up consulting a guide to find all of the Secret Seashells again.</p> <p>What about you guys? What are you planning to play this weekend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LabRat2329\"> /u/LabRat2329 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

It was an arcade-like racer, in the sense that it was not open world. What I remember the main UI being a big map, kinda like midnight club 2 map, but you just picked icons to do races. the premise was you started out with like a VW jetta or some basic car and you entered the free race. after winning the free races a couple times you&#39;d make enough money to buy into a race with paid entry. then on to a bigger buy-in race so on and so on, meanwhile buying and upgrading cars along the way. I want to say it was all on-road, nothing on dirt tracks. but it was just pick race, make money, buy stuff, repeat on loop and i cant seem to find it.</p> <p>any help finding it or suggestions on a money grind, buy &amp; upgrade, non-open world racing game would be very appreciated</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
