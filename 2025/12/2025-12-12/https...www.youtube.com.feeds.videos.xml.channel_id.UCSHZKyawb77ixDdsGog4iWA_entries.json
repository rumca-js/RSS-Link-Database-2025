        "description": "Irving Finkel is a scholar of ancient languages and a longtime curator at the British Museum, renowned for his expertise in Mesopotamian history and cuneiform writing. He specializes in reading and interpreting cuneiform inscriptions, including tablets from Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian contexts. He became widely known for studying a tablet with a Mesopotamian flood story that predates the biblical Noah narrative, which he presented in his book \"The Ark Before Noah\" and in a documentary that involved building a circular ark based on the tablet's technical instructions.\nThank you for listening \u2764 Check out our sponsors: https://lexfridman.com/sponsors/ep487-sb\nSee below for timestamps, transcript, and to give feedback, submit questions, contact Lex, etc.\n\n*Transcript:*\nhttps://lexfridman.com/irving-finkel-transcript\n\n*CONTACT LEX:*\n*Feedback* - give feedback to Lex: https://lexfridman.com/survey\n*AMA* - submit questions, videos or call-in: https://lexfridman.com/ama\n*Hiri",
