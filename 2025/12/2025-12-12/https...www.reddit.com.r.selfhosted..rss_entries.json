Thank you all so much for the kind words, and helpful suggestions! </p> <p>You can read about all the changes in the changelog linked above, but the short is:<br/> 1) Improved large model support. Tasks won&#39;t just die if they are too large. They may take a while, but will finish. ( Try unchecking the repair option to speed it up ) I had one example from the original thread ( A dyson Fan clone ) take 20 mins.<br/> 2) Added 3MF support! This was far more difficult to do than I thought. LOL<br/> 3) Fixed a bug when canceling jobs where the job would cancel, but subsequent tasks would get queued. Freecad now correctly terminate",

Main reason being I add series/movies whenever i see something interesting but i have limited time to watch those. so by the time I am done watching one series, the recently added list in jellyfin has changed and i forget what i added and miss out on watching some that i download.

When I tried to find this on my own nothing seemed like exactly what I needed (or maybe it was and it just went over my head). I&#39;m a writer and really, I want a way to work on my books on one device, and then have it synced to all my other devices automatically. That way I have safe backups and so I can pick up working on them from my laptop, tablet or desktop etc. I used to use Google Docs for this but started just using libreoffice on my desktop. Having my entire book on one computer is scary though, so for the last while I&#39;ve just been periodically copying the file to an external SSD but this system isn&#39;t really... great in a lot of ways. I&#39;m a total newbie to all this, sorry if this is an obvious question. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AnyHour91",
