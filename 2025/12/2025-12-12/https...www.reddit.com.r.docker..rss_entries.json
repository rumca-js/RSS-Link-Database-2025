I consulted with ChatGPT and it said that it could be causing a pathing issue. I was hesitant to follow it&#39;s instructions further to fix it and would appreciate any help in solving this issue.</p> <p>I should also add that it had been awhile since I updated, I went to update this morning and it did install the latest version of docker.
