This increased inclination for more challenging is HUGELY helpful for me vs even 5.1 where the conversations still looked more like \u201cyes user-sama, you truly are special and different,\u201d which costs me time and coherence as I then have to add additional superfluous weights to my own reasoning as a natural response to balance the model\u2019s unconditional validation, not so much of this is happening with 5.2 compared to 5.1.
