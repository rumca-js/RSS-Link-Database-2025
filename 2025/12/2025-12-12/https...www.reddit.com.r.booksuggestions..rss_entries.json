This year, I have enjoyed Alchemised and how beautiful the writing is and Fourth Wing. I have also read The Serpent and the Wings of Night and enjoyed it, but did not enjoy its sequel, I did not enjoy ACOTAR. I DNFed the Spear Cuts Through Water, The Kingdom of Jasmine, and Powerless. I\u2019m looking for books that will hook me early on, are actually well written (like Alchemised), and that I cannot put down. Also, not a big fan of YA at this point, looking for more adult books. </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Downtown-Wave-7293\"> /u/Downtown-Wave-7293 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pkhrp8/book_recs_for_fan_of_alchemised_and_fourth_wing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1",

I\u2019m seeing a kinda dystopian, maybe eerie introspective theme but I honesty haven\u2019t read too much in this genre so I don\u2019t know of a good book i\u2019ve read personally that I think they will like except maybe The Illustrated Man or (it doesn\u2019t really fit the vibe but i loved this book) In Cold Blood. I don\u2019t read much lol. So if anyone has a recommendation they\u2019d like to pitch in please do! Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Safe_Winner5395\"> /u/Safe_Winner5",
