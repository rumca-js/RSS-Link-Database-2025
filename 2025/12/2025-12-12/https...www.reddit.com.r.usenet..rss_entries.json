Most of the recs that come with my searches here are centered on US providers. In my case, being half-way from the US, latency + jurisdiction are two things I want to weigh properly. I think any solid EU or other non-US providers might work, but I can\u2019t seem to find much info on providers on google</p> <p>I\u2019m mostly concerned with billing terms and support responsiveness. And should I stick with one provider outside the US, or do you pair an EU option with a US backup to cover gaps? Any experiences on what stood out for you, good or bad, would be really useful.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rmartin00\"> /u/rmartin00 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1pktoqg/non_us_based_usenet_providers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/u",
