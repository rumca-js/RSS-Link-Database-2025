Previously I used to be working at small startup with only 4 iOS developers in the team and in the org, It was challenging and so much fun working there (yes it was stressful many times). But now working in this big org it completely sucks, not great work (doesn\u2019t excite me mentally). Is this the scenario with most of the big techs ??
