Michelle Khare (@MichelleKhare) chats up the stars of the movie, Bailey Bass (Tsireya), Jack Champion (Miles \u201cSpider\u201d Socorro), and Trinity Jo-Li Bliss (Tuk) about learning to free-dive, doing parkour, and stepping back into Na\u2019vi culture. Oona Chaplin (Varang) will then introduce Movie Surfers to the treacherous \u201cAsh People\u201d who will wreak havoc in the upcoming film. The Surfers also get a crash course in performance capture with Richard Baneham, the movie\u2019s Executive Producer and VFX Supervisor, and stunt performer, Alicia Vela-Bailey.
