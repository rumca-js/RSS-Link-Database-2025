        "description": "For more than four decades, Hooters has been one of America's most recognizable restaurant chains, famous for its wings, \"delightfully tacky\" atmosphere, and all-female waitstaff. By the mid-2000s, the chain had its own airline, casino, and calendar, and it operated hundreds of locations around the world. But what most people don't realize is that, from almost the beginning, Hooters wasn't one company \u2014 it was two. And in 2025, the larger of the two filed for bankruptcy after years of declining sales.\n\nNow, the original founders are stepping in to revive the brand and return it to its roots. Their goal is to restore the menu, uniforms, and atmosphere that defined Hooters from the start. We visited the flagship Hooters in Clearwater, Florida, and spoke with people who\u2019ve been with the brand since the beginning, including the founders and the original Hooters Girl, Lynne Austin.\n\nSo can the founders save the brand, and can Hooters make a comeback?\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:08 - The Origin Story",
