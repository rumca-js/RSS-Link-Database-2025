        "description": "I've had my Unistellar Odyssey for a year now, and have always wanted to talk about the Science mode where you can use the telescope to perform some basic scientific data collection. There's no way for these small telescopes to compete with big observatories in ideal sites, but there's always been plenty of opportunities for amateurs to get involved through organizations like The American Associate of Variable Star Observers - AAVSO, https://www.aavso.org/. But Unistellar's small telescopes handle a lot of the hard work, by making it easy to find the targets and schedule the observations. Also, by having a consistent hardware platform \n\nThere's a Unistellar Christmas sale on right now, if you use my affiliate link then I get a small reward for any purchase made https://tidd.ly/4i7ZlZB\n\nSo, feel free to use that, or if you've got an existing telescope maybe you want to take a look at organizations like AAVSO.\n\nAlso, I started figuring out how to process the images with Seti Astro Suite",
