I can\u2019t hook up all my driving and flight sim peripherals, etc. to the Frame, so I\u2019ll likely need to stick to the wired (and lighthouse?) solutions. I will be building a sim chair setup, so I don\u2019t mind either (although inside out would be nice too just for fewer wires on the walls).</p> <p>I\u2019ve only scratched the surface with things like BSB2 (impressive but sad refresh), and Pimax (just remember their poor reputation from years past).

I use a Mac so that is very expensive. WorldLens update: super frustrating. (What I hate about updates is the 4 times out of 5 I don&#39;t need it or want it and at least one time, it distinctly reduces the value for me. But more than that, I feel when it happens without my choosing that my space is invaded. Makes you feel powerless.) Anyway, this update has suddenly put little floaty blue labels above towns and countries in space, with a blue ghostly beam descending to the town etc. For someone who likes to figure out where I am by the geography, this is infuriating. ALSO, it clutters up and spoils the beauty of the Earth, which is why I use WorldLens. Anyone know a workaround? I could not find a toggle. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Unable_Envi",
