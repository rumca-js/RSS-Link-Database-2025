Next two were amazing to me and maybe my favourite books or up there since returning to reading extensively both physically and audiobooks In the last year as a 34year old after not reading much since my teens. I remember seeing some reviews say that the book is a bit like red rising but done well/better ;I honestly wish I never saw those reviews and comments because it feels so different it\u2019s crazy to me. The protagonists are so different in personality and the way you hear their thoughts as a first person . For people who have read both did you have similar thoughts ? I mean I guess it\u2019s first person and someone from the lower caste of that society but other then that it is so different I find it weird.

I\u2019m between reading The Wheel of Time (I already read the first book a while ago) or starting a brand new series: The Stormlight Archive!!!<br/> I know, I know, two super niche books, but don\u2019t get on my nerves, I\u2019m just starting this reading consistently thing. So now, give me motives on which I should choose and why.
