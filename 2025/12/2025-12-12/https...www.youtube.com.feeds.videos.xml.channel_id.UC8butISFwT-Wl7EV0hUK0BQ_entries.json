He's a college dropout who taught himself programming while building websites for his emo band. 22 years later he's worked as a developer at IBM, Netlify, run his own dev consultancy, and he now runs CodeTV making reality TV shows for developers.\n\nWe talk about:\n- How many CEOs over-estimated the impact of AI coding tools and laid off too many devs, whom they're now trying to rehire\n- Why the developer job market has already rebounded a bit, but will never be the same\n- Tips for how to land roles in the post-LLM r\u00e9sum\u00e9 spam job search era\n- How devs are working to rebuild the fabric of the community through in-person community events\n\nSupport for this podcast is provided by a grant from AlgoMonster.

Their curriculum covers patterns like sliding window, two-pointers, ",
