        "description": "Mariachi Legends is a brutal, pixel art, combat-focused Metroidvania set in the heart of Mexico. You play as Pablo Cruz, a detective who makes a deal with Death herself. She grants him the power to transform into the mighty La Sombra, so he can strike back against the criminals that threaten his hometown.\n\nIn return, Pablo vows to deliver to Madre Catrina the one thing that has always escaped her grasp: the man who defied her power and became immortal. Dive into a dark, cinematic story about life and death, family bonds, and historic roots, while you master fast-paced combat and explore a world full of mystery, folklore, and danger. Think: a ruthless Metroidvania, like if Symphony of the Night took place in Mexico.\n\nMariachi Legends is now coming to Xbox.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO XBOX: https://xbx.lv/2EEjmaR \n\nFOLLOW XBOX \nhttps://twitter.com/xbox \nhttps://www.facebook.com/xbox \nhttps://www.instagram.com/xbox/ \nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@xbox\nhttps://www.threads.net/@xbox\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/x",
