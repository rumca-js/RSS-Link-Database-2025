He may be big \u2013 6ft 4in tall and around 130kg \u2013 but as far as the internet is concerned he arrived some time ago.

England are suddenly lighter in the tight-head department after Will Stuart\u2019s unfortunate recent achilles injury, with Asher Opoku-Fordjour also currently out of action. If Leicester\u2019s Joe Heyes so much as breaks a fingernail, alarm bells will start ringing at Twickenham.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.c",
