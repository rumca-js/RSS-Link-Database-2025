        "description": "I\u2019m protecting the shower tray with Builder Board Hydro Shield. This is 18 mils thick and waterproof. If I drop anything it won\u2019t damage the tray and the surface cleans up nicely. This is definitely a great option for protecting showers and tile floors. Many thanks to Surface Shields for sponsoring this video \ud83d\udd25",
