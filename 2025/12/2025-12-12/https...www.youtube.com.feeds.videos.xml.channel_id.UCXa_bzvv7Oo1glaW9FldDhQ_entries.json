        "description": "Skyrim is one of the most beloved and influential games of the modern era, and that\u2019s because its core design is so innately compelling. It\u2019s so easy to pick it up and get lost in its dense, layered, sprawling fantasy world again, and find yourself in adventures of discovery and exploration and intrigue. \n\nThe fact that the game itself remains fun to play means it is still easy to recommend, well, mostly. There are those peripheral caveats that can\u2019t really be dismissed or handwaved after all. I would definitely be a lot angrier at the missteps taken here if it weren\u2019t for the fact that the upgrade is being offered for free; however, for anyone who is looking to jump in now, these omissions and fumbles are fair warnings for them to consider and bear in mind. \n\nSkyrim on the Switch 2 is conflicted - it\u2019s Skyrim, and on Switch 2, which is great, but this isn\u2019t a particularly great version, and there are some very obvious fixes Bethesda can make here. Hopefully in the months and years to",

        "description": "Resident Evil Requiem would receive a \u201cnew look\u201d at The Game Awards, I was expecting Leon. You know, rookie detective, president's bodyguard, stunning hair follicles \u2013 that Leon. Yeah, I believed Dusk Golem when all of you doubted him! Jokes aside, however, it seemed like the right time. Even if the sequel is getting a \u201cdeeper dive\u201d in early 2026, if Leon is really such a significant part of the game, what bigger and better stage to reveal him than The Game Awards?\n\nWell, if that PlayStation Store leak wasn't enough evidence, we can finally confirm it: Leon S. Kennedy is in Resident Evil Requiem. That alone would be enough, but the game wasn't just content on teasing, oh no. It showcased his new look \u2013 one that's gruffer, with longer hair and some stubble. Don't even get me started on his new outfit \u2013 the black coat, complete with the high fur collar and gloves, is pretty darn cool. Almost covert ops but far sleeker.",
