        "description": "Getting the best performance for your game can depend heavily on the way you're using memory, and C#, while a language with many great features, wasn't initially designed around the performance needs of game developers. Understanding the way your C# code uses memory can unlock significant performance gains and provide deeper insights into your Unity projects.\n\nIn this session, we will cover:\n\n- The structure of memory from the CPU's point of view, and how accessing one bool can cost 200X the time of accessing another\n- How your C# objects can end up laid out in memory\n- What's actually happening during those GC spikes, and how to reduce them\n- Strategies for working with memory more directly\n\nThis session will provide a comprehensive introduction to these concepts, equipping you with foundational knowledge to identify significant performance optimizations and navigate the crucial considerations when working with \"\"low-level\"\" C#.\n\n#Unity #Unite2025 #GameDev",

It draws upon insights from how developers build games and visibility across billions of player sessions around the world, driving around 15-20% increase in installs and up to 20% boost in in-app purchase spend by acquired players. Naveen Mawani, VP of Growth at Homa, also came onstage to share his team\u2019s experience with Unity Vector for\u00a0All in Hole, which helped the team double their percentage of players buying items\u00a0and\u00a0their spend.\n\n#Unity #Unite2025 #UnityVector",
