It\u2019s a lightweight app that plays custom audio files whenever you click your mouse. My inspiration was from a movie called Unfriended.. I don&#39;t know why, I just found that vibe of the movie and the little clicks satisfying.</p> <p>Unlike basic sound scripts, I built this using a real time audio engine (NumPy) which allows for independent pitch shifting. This means you can use one sound file, but have your Left Click sound deeper and your Right Click sound higher (or vice versa) to differentiate the actions.</p> <p>**What it does:**</p> <p>* **Custom Audio:** Load any .wav or .mp3 file (mechanical switch sounds, UI effects, etc).<br/> * **Pitch Engine:** Independent sliders to pitch-shift LMB ",
