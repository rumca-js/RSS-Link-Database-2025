Crucially, understand the difference between possessible assets that persist in the world and spawnable assets (like characters and cameras) that only appear for specific shots, giving you control over dynamic scene changes.

        "description": "In this talk recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, we explore how physically simulated characters can be created and controlled within the framework of Control Rig. This has the potential to transform the way game developers and content creators portray powerful and believable characters. \n\nTraditionally, adding simulation to characters in UE has been straightforward, so long as the setup is simple and secondary (e.g. ponytail). \n\nIt is much harder to set up physics to work directly alongside animation, operating on the same bones that the animator is authoring. Animators and game developers need tools to enable physics to contribute to the realism of the movement while letting the animator tell the story through the character.\n\nControl Rig already exposes a rich set of tools, enabling animators to concentrate on being expressive. Integrating physics simulation into these tools enables animators to use exactly the amount and type of simulation they need, and to animate and control the ef",
