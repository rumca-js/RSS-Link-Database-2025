The recycling plant ?).</p> <p>Also, how do you deal with the fact that, when playing this game, some players never pay attention to what their opponents are doing and just let key cards go? As a result, some players end up scaling massively.</p> <p>So you find yourself being the only one trying to deny cards, and you come across as \u201cthe annoying player\u201d who blocks others, even though, to me, this is literally part of the strategy (just like in <em>7 Wonders</em>).

He winds up paralyzed, and then the rest of us spend the night gently guiding him over even the simplest things: &quot;Now you can discard your card... not that pile... face up... no, not that card... not that pile... yes, discard...&quot; It causes the sessions to drag on and kind of sucks all the joy out of the evening. Recently at bgg.con, everyone who wound up playing with him emerged with a shellshocked look on their faces.</p> <p>And yet he seems to love playing these games. At game night when we break into groups of 3-4 people, he always adds himself to the heavy games. The guy is lovely, but when I see him shuffling over to me, I do feel a sense of dread.
