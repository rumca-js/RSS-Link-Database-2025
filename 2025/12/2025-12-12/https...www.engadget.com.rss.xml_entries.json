I\u2019ve had probably hundreds of notebooks over the years, serving as repositories for my story ideas, to-do lists, meeting notes and everything in between. However, I turned away from physical notebooks at a certain point because it was just easier to store everything digitally so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.<br><br>E Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in the past few years, and we\u2019re just starting to see more color E Ink tablets become more widely available. I tested out a number of different E Ink tablets to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">",

        "description": "<p><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em> has a lot of things going for it already, in my book. It stars a hero rarely seen in video games, an elderly woman, and it has gorgeous storybook-style art in a lush fantasy setting. It\u2019s a single-player puzzle platformer, it relies on wordless storytelling and the woman, a witch named Gertie, travels with a creepy-cute companion. Plus, Gertie has chicken feet. I love her little chicken feet.</p><p><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot </em>is the first game from Wildflower Interactive, the independent studio founded by Naughty Dog veteran Bruce Straley. The game is coming to Steam and it\u2019s available to wishlist now, though there\u2019s no firm release date. The first trailer for <em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em> premiered at The Game Awards 2025, showing Gertie and her friend traveling together through caves, forests and temples. </p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/emb",

The conceit is similar to <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>. Bradley, the protagonist of a fictional platforming series, is suddenly transported into the worlds of other unfinished video games; the trailer shows a badger-ified <em>Bloodborne</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>The Last of Us</em>. He also has access to a kit of dev tools that let him modify these incomplete projects, getting a taste of making a game. As the trailer ends, Bradley briefly crosses into the real world and comes face to face with an actual game developer. This looks like it will be a funny and very meta game. <em>Astro Bot</em> ",
