From my current understanding the business continuity program would be the umbrella all of the others fall into, so my current plan is to define a business continuity program and parse out segments of the playbook to develop the disaster recovery plan.

It feels like it is easy for a remote attacker to initiate a login on a device, and try to socially engineer the victim to validate the prompt on their device, through phishing or phone calls. All while the victim does not feel like they are giving away any sensitive information such as a password or OTP.</p> <p>Do you have any insight into how these risks are mitigated? I&#39;m genuinely curious to know, as I may have to implement this kind of feature someday.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC",

On paper, it sounds promising adaptive authentication, behavior-based risk scoring, automated access reviews, and faster incident response. But I\u2019m curious how much of this actually delivers value in real enterprise environments versus just adding complexity.</p> <p>For those managing IAM at scale, what AI capabilities have genuinely helped? Things like reducing alert fatigue, catching abnormal access patterns, or simplifying identity governance? And where has AI caused issues false positives, lack of transparency, or hard-to-explain decisions?
