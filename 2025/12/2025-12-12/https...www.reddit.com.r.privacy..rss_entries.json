        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Most online platforms make you trade privacy for access. Banks, KYC, account freezes, identity verification, tracking, and centralized databases are now standard just to sell a product or get paid. For people who care about privacy, this creates a real problem. Even selling digital work often requires handing over personal data, linking bank accounts, or trusting platforms that collect and retain sensitive information. I\u2019m curious how people here approach this today. Questions for the community: How do you currently sell goods or services while minimizing data exposure? What privacy trade-offs feel unavoidable, and which ones are deal-breakers? Are there tools or models you trust more than traditional platforms? What would an ideal privacy-preserving marketplace need to do differently? Not promoting anything here. Just looking to learn how privacy-focused people think about commerce and where current systems fail.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submit",

The tablet had been water-damaged and was non-functional. When discarding it, I first removed the battery. Then, lacking the proper tools to detach the motherboard, I used a hammer to break it into several pieces before disposing of it in a trash bin located away from my home. I safely discarded the battery separately.</p> <p>Following this, I began receiving over ten scam calls per day, all flagged as spam by my screening app (Hiya). This sudden increase has caused significant concern that someone may have retrieved the destroyed motherboard and accessed my personal information from it.</p> <p>My primary questions are:</p> <ol> <li>Is it technically possible for someone to recover data from a physically destroyed motherboard that was chipped with a hammer and thrown in the trash?</li> <li>",
