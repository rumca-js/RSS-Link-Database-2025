Today I installed Spider-Man Remastered using the FuckingFast links. The install went fine, but when I launched the game it was stuttering like crazy even though my FPS counter showed 120+. I thought something was wrong with my system, so I restarted Windows.</p> <p>Right after the reboot, I suddenly got a popup to install something called \u201cInternet Downloader.\u201d I obviously declined it, but then another window appeared asking for age, gender, etc. Even after I denied everything, it still tried to install itself. That\u2019s when I realised something was seriously wrong.</p> <p>I restarted again, installed Malwarebytes and did a scan. It found a Trojan inside a folder named EminentLastSetting (?? never seen that before). I quarantined and deleted it, and things seem normal now\u2026 but I\u2019m still ",
