This week on Mixture of Experts, we analyze the \u201ccode red\u201d release of GPT-5.2 as OpenAI responds to Gemini 3. Are the constant model drops benefitting consumers? Next, Stanford released their Foundation Model Transparency Index, revealing a troubling trend that most labs are becoming less transparent. However, IBM Granite achieved a 95/100 score. Then, our experts discuss what model transparency means for enterprise AI adoption. Finally, we debrief AWS re:Invent\u2019s biggest announcements, including Nova frontier models and Nova Forge. Join host Tim Hwang and panelists Kate Soule, Ambhi Ganesan and Mihai Criveti for our expert insights.\n\n00:00 \u2013 Intro\n1:02 -- GPT-5.2 emergency release\n12:21 -- Stanford AI Transparency Index: Granite scores 95/100\n27:18 -- AWS re:Invent: Nova models and enterprise AI\n\nThe opinions expressed in this podcast are solely those of the participan",
