Both folders came from different zip files but I was under the impression that the higher file size means its saved more of the information from being compressed so keep the bigger one but clearly I&#39;m wrong or there&#39;s a setting on photo sweeper I need to change to default keep the higher file size.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lilmrpimp\"> /u/Lilmrpimp </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1pl4s0d/quick_photo_file_size_question/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

Also I think that wd passport and other wd\u2019s external drives are not the best for cold backups, is this correct or should I better buy an external HDD?

I&#39;d have to sacrifice a cheap drive duplicator or build a custom solution so I went custom. $5 for a piece of popular wood (fairly strong and cheap), 6 feet long cut to 4 of 18 inches long. Then carefully measured out 42mm for each sets of 2 holes to be drilled. the second holes 12mm from the first hole.
