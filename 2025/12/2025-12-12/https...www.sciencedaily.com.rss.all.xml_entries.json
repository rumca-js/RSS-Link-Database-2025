        "description": "A sweeping review of more than 2,500 studies reveals that despite booming public enthusiasm, cannabis has strong scientific support for only a few medical uses, leaving most popular claims\u2014like relief for chronic pain, anxiety, and insomnia\u2014on shaky ground. The findings spotlight a persistent gap between what people believe cannabis can do and what clinical evidence actually shows.",

The site contains the densest known collection of fossil sea cow bones, showing that these animals once thrived in rich seagrass meadows. Their ecological role mirrors that of modern dugongs, which still reshape the Gulf\u2019s seafloor as they graze. The findings may help researchers understand how seagrass ecosystems respond to long-term environmental change.",
