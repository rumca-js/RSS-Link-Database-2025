I determined that the best course may be to use funds on an SEO audit of the site to then act on and make improvements (rather it\u2019s technical, content, etc\u2026). </p> <p>What product (ahref, screening frog) or services do you recommend? It\u2019s for a very small startup company in the space industry (very niche). </p> <p>Also if you have any ideas on what additional things I should consider please let me know. I understand that to do SEO properly, real money needs to be used ($1000/mo), however that\u2019s not currently possible\u2026 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OneBananaMan\"> /u/OneBananaMan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1pkh0nn/seo_on_a_budget_with_a_limited_budget_where_can_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1pkh0nn",
