If I\u2019m in a Hotel, that has free WiFi, but it\u2019s an unsecured network\u2026.. but I have the IP address, subnet mask number AND the router number, can I do anything with that?</p> <p>When you scan for available networks, your Room number comes up as an option. If you click on it, it asks for a password.</p> <p>Now, because I\u2019m disabled, some of the staff here have been helpful, and one told me that the network that shows up as a room number, is for the tv. </p> <p>I\u2019m trying to connect my laptop to a network that is secure.
