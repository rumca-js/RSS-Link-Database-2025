Running lm_sensors on my laptop mentions that &quot;thermal management is [often] handled by ACPI rather than the OS&quot; so this also indicates to me that some sensors are interfaced through ACPI. I&#39;m not sure if there are any other sources of sensor data is may or may not be used.</p> <p>There are two parts to reaching parity with software like HWiNFO on Linux:</p> <h1>Sensor Data Parity</h1> <p>The first is of course to be able to get access to all of the same sensors.
