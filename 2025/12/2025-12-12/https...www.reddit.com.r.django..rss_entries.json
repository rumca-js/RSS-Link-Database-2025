The problem is exporting massive amounts of data without overloading the container&#39;s CPU. </p> <p>My solution was to create a streaming Excel exporter, processing and writing all the data in chunks. The details of my implementation were, first, to use the iterator() method of Django QuerySet to query the data in chunks from the database and then pass it to Pandas Dataframe, apply some transformations and overwrite a temporary file to complete all the data in the report, and finally upload it to a bucket.</p> <p>This solution works very well, but I would like to know if you know of a better way to solve it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FabianVeAl\"> /u/FabianVeAl </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1pkfzr4/massive_excel_exportation_problem/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/co",
