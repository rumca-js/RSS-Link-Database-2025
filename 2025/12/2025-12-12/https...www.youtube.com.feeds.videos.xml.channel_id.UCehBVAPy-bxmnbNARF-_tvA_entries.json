        "description": "Behind Italy\u2019s beauty (and parmesan) is a radical tradition of cooperatives.vIn some areas, they make up nearly a fifth of the GDP. We went to Emilia-Romagna, one of the richest regions in the country, to investigate how Italy\u2019s workers built a more democratic economy. \n\nMany thanks to the Bologna Film Commission and the City of Reggio Emilia for the support and for the assistance.\n\n-----\n\nMore Perfect Union is an Emmy-winning, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to build power for working people. Here\u2019s what that means: We report on the real struggles and challenges of the working class from a working-class perspective. We attempt to connect those problems to potential solutions. We report on the abuses and wrongdoing of corporate power. And we seek to hold accountable the ultra-rich who have too much power over America\u2019s political and economic systems.\n\n To support our independent journalism, subscribe, donate, and follow our other pages through the links below:\n- Help fund our repo",
