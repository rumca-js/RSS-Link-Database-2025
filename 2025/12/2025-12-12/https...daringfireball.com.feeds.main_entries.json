        "description": "<p>Six-minute from Amazon\u2019s AWS re:Invent keynote last week:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Payam Mirrashidi, VP, Cloud Systems &amp; Platforms, Apple, explains\nhow AWS Graviton helps improve developer velocity at scale. Hear\nSwift\u2019s journey from the premier programming language for the\nApple ecosystem to adoption by millions of developers around the\nworld building apps for everything from devices to data centers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Graviton is AWS\u2019s ARM-in-the-cloud initiative.)</p>\n\n<p>Nothing earth-shaking in this brief presentation, but it\u2019s not often you see an Apple VP on stage at another company\u2019s keynote, or see Apple so very publicly declare their reliance on someone else\u2019s infrastructure. It speaks to Apple and Amazon being more allies than competitors amongst the big tech companies. And of course, you even less often see anyone from Apple speak live on stage at Apple\u2019s own keynotes, which, alas, are no longer live nor on stages.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Apple a",

        "description": "<p>Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">back in 2007</a>. They\u2019ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There\u2019s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors\u2019 perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">return for subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the results.</p>\n\n<p>After solid run in the second of 2025 with sponsorships sold out weeks, if not months, in advance, we\u2019ve arrived at the end of the year with the last three weeks still open\u2009\u2014\u2009starting this coming Monday. I\u2019m offering those weeks at a discount.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>December 15\u201321 (next week)</li>\n<li>D",

According to the developers of\nthe font, which is open-source and free of charge, the \u201cheaviness\u201d\nof the letters prevented them from turning upside down for readers\nwith dyslexia, which they claimed would improve reading accuracy\nand speed.</p>\n\n<p>Researchers put the font to the test, comparing it with two other\npopular fonts designed for legibility\u2009\u2014\u2009Arial and Times New Roman\u2009\u2014\u2009and discovered that the purportedly dyslexia-friendly font\nactually reduced reading speed and ac",

The AES key for the attachment, its\nUniform Resource Identifier (URI), and an SHA-1 hash of its\nencrypted form are then sent to the recipient as the contents of\nan iMessage, with their confidentiality and integrity protected\nthrough normal iMessage encryption, as shown in the following\ndiagram.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This explains why you can often text, but not send or receive images, with iMessage over in-flight Wi-Fi.
