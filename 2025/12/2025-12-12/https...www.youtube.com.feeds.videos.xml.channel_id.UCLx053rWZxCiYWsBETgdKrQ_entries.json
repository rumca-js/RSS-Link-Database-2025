        "description": "It's December and that means Christmas LGR! This is the Pac-Guy Christmas Edition I ran across in a recent LGR Blerbs video. It's a small 3-level game created with Klik & Play / Multimedia Fusion in 1998. But the more interesting thing is that it became a commercially-sold product, especially dubious with its blatant Pac-Man ripoff cover and title during a time when Hasbro was going nuclear with legal threats against those selling clones.\n\n\u25cf LGR things elsewhere:\nPatreon https://www.patreon.com/LazyGameReviews\nBsky https://bsky.app/profile/lgr-yt.bsky.social\n\n\u25cf eXoWin9x archive download: https://www.retro-exo.com/win9x.html\n\n\u25cf Background music licensed from Epidemic Sound:\nhttps://www.epidemicsound.com\n\n#LGR #retrogaming #christmas #gaming",
