They\u2019re also great picks for a Steam Deck or pretty much any other handheld PC. Oh, and it sure doesn\u2019t hurt that all of these games are under $20 at full price, and many come with demos. And it helps that these are the kinds of games that often go on sale, especially the Steam Winter Sale that\u2019s coming up right quick.
