Capcom developers have clarified how much of the game will be from Leon's POV, and just like his first outing in RE2, it looks like about half the game will have you playing as him. The other half will be played out via Grace Ashcroft, but there's a very strong possibility you'll have at least one more character to play as. In other news, Clair Obscur almost had a clean sweep at last night's Game Awards, winning 9 of 11 nominations. As a thank-you to fans, developer Sandfall has made the upcoming DLC not only available right now, but it's totally FREE. And finally, take a peek at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando Resort.\n\nPresented by Universal Orlando Resort.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe Call of Duty dev team has issued a statement basically acknowledging Black Ops 7's shortcomings and promising to move off the back-to-back yearly release of mainline Call of Duty games. This comes as Black Ops 7 was met with middling reviews and apparently worse sales numbers in the face of stiff competition this year. EA's Battlefield 6 and Embark Studios' ARC Raiders both launched around the same time and were met with widespread acclaim. Black Ops 6 was released only last year, and Modern Warfares 2 and 3 were also released in back-to-back years, leading many fans to complain each entry did not feel or play substantially different from the previous year's. In other news, two new games are being added to December's PlayStation Plus lineup: Assassin's Creed Mirage and Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty. They join the recently-released skating game Skate Story.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

        "description": "Here's your look at the Decrepit announcement trailer for the upcoming dark fantasy first-person souls-like game from developer J\u00e4mmerdal Games and publisher Three Friends. The Decrepit reveal trailer showcases terrifying enemies you'll face in a dungeon-crawling adventure. Decrepit will be available on PC in 2026.\n\nIn Decrepit, every death drags you back to the dungeons below, stripped of all equipment. Armed with only the knowledge gained from each escape attempt and whatever you can loot from undead inmates and guards, the only path out is learning the castle\u2019s layout before it kills you.\n\nInspired by classic first-person action games like Hexen, dungeon crawlers like Eye of the Beholder, and modern souls-likes, Decrepit emphasises spatial mastery over power creep. Keen-eyed explorers will find hidden secrets throughout the castle that provide permanent bonuses. Helpful, but never a replacement for knowledge and execution.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #TheGameAwards2025",
