        "description": "For the briefest moment in the 1990s, Britpop ruled the airwaves. Suede sighed out a romantically ambiguous soundtrack for elegant wastrels. Blur and Oasis were vying for number one. And everybody wanted to live like Common People. It was music that delighted in Britain\u2019s pop history, taking the best bits of The Kinks, Jam and Smiths and reshaping them into anthems, the country\u2019s most important guitar-based movement since punk. \n\nBut at the same time many of those who weren\u2019t lifted by the rising tide of retroism found it tiresome, unoriginal and encroaching on jingoism.
