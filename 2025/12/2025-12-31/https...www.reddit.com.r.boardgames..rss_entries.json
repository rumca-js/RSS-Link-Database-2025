It\u2019s just the four of us, two adults, an 8-year-old and a 15-year-old. The plan is to play board games until the new year rolls in. </p> <p>We already have <strong>Animal Upon Animal, Jenga, Camel Up, Get Bit!, King of Tokyo, Tsuro</strong>, and a few <strong>Unlock!</strong> games.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for other game suggestions that everyone can enjoy together. Easy enough for the 8-year-old, still fun for the teen and adults, and not too heavy to teach. Party games, light strategy, co-op, all fair game.</p> <p>It\u2019s still early, and a trip to the game store isn\u2019t out of the question, so I\u2019m happy to hear any recommendations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NGDPauper\"> /u/NGDPauper </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1q0pxjm/new_years_eve_board_games_with_the_family/\">[",

Co-ops seem like good games for easing in newbies: we&#39;re all working together, can freely talk about strategy, take back moves, etc. But most get much harder as players are added: pandemic, Hogwarts battle, gloomhaven, Captain is dead, etc. </p> <p>That&#39;s not a great intro, most casual gamers aren&#39;t into &quot;obviously impossible to win after 30 mins of investment&quot;. Guess we&#39;ll play another round of One Night.</p> <p>So I think about games that are fun to lose and most are limited communication games: hanabi, magic maze, the crew.
