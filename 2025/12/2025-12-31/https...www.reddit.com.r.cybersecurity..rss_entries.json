Just because an image is clean and passes the build checks does not mean some tiny dependency is not going to start acting up or misbehaving once it is actually running under real world traffic. I have personally seen small libraries cause massive runtime issues that never showed up once during our scans and it is incredibly frustrating to deal with. It makes you realize that supply chain risks do not just stop the moment the image is scanned.

Maybe it is even a dangerous amount of confidence at this point. We spend so much time making sure every single thing passes and that every image is clean and every policy is enforced. On paper the system looks like it is untouchable. But then you get into the real world and runtime incidents still happen anyway despite all that work. I have seen it happen a few times now where the first real signal that something was wrong was not a failed scan or a red flag in the pipeline at all. It was just some weird and unexplainable production behavior that we did not see coming. It really makes you realize that pipelines are totally necessary but they are just not the full picture of what is happening.

By exploiting a race condition during the file validation process, a standard user can swap legitimate binaries with a malicious payload, leading to arbitrary code execution with administrative privileges.</p> <p>\u200bStatus:</p> <p>The vulnerability has been reported and acknowledged by the developer. While the maintainer was aware of the theoretical risk, no functional PoC had been demonstrated until now. I have provided a working Proof of Concept (PoC) and a proposed fix.</p> <p>\u200bRelease Timeline:</p> <p>Per the developer, a patched version is scheduled for release between late January and February.
