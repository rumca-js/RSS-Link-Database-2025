Which I regret but that&#39;s not the point. She took revenge by sending me to jail with a police statement she lied on. I&#39;m currently fighting the charge as I have evidence of the statement being false. I showed my public defender our text history and he completely agrees that she&#39;s trying to ruin my life and we will win the trial.</p> <p>Before jail and after the breakup. I got spammed with dozens of phishing links. I didn&#39;t click on any of them I don&#39;t believe, but there were so many daily, it is slightly possible by accident. Then I noticed my icloud wouldn&#39;t sync properly, and at one point I had to reset my icloud password, and also my phone number said recently removed. There are also duplicate iphone 11 pro&#39;s logged into all my google accounts when i look at devices",
