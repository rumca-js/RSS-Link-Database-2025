        "description": "Welcome to the GRAND FINALE of the 2025 J vs Ben season! We have clipped together every J vs Ben for the entire year so you can relive it all and find out who the grand champion is!  From the \u201cIn the Movies,\u201d \u201cQuotes Quizes,\u201d and \u201cOpen Book,\u201d formats we had a lot of curve balls this year.\n\nWe actually had so much footage this year we had to break it into 2 parts, so be on the look out for part 2 in a couple of days! (if you have finished this one by then!)\n\nHuge thanks to all the quiz masters throughout the year! We could not make the show without you and look forward to all of your questions next year!\n\n#SuperCarlinBrothers #HarryPotter\n\nWritten by: J & Ben Carlin\nEdited by: Ethan Edghill\n\nSuper Carlin Brothers explore Harry Potter theories, Pixar connections, and all your favorite fandoms every week!\n\n\u2615 Carlin Brothers Coffee & Merch\nhttps://carlinbrothersmercantile.com\n\n\ud83d\udcf2 Follow Us\nPatreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/SuperCarlinBrothers\nInstagram \u279c http://instagram.com/jonkerlin & ht",
