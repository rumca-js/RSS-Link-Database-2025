I have a big disagreement about it with a friend of mine. </p> <p>I add that when I open Vuze and I go to &quot;my shares&quot; (or whatever is it called in the English version), I have zero files listed. And that my upload speed is always at zero ko/s, or at less than 10ko/s, even when downloading something. That makes me think I can &quot;trust&quot; the data I get from Vuze, and that I don&#39;t share anything when I&#39;m not downloading. Am I right ? </p> <p>The reason I ask, and the reason why I have this discussion with my friend is that, in my country, downloading movies and series for private and persona",
