Keywords are messy, and crucial info like BPM or Key is often missing.</p> <p>So I built a site that uses bots to aggregate beats from the web in real-time. For every track found, it generates a dedicated page with deep analysis. You get the BPM, Key, and a visual timeline showing the actual structure (Intro, Chorus, Verse) so you can navigate the beat instantly.</p> <p>It is designed to speed up your process. You can open a &quot;Studio Mode&quot; to write lyrics side-by-side with the video and loop specific sections to practice your flow. Once you are ready, you just take the exact data into your DAW (like FL Studio) to record.</p> <p>It is currently in Beta. Some beats might still miss specific analysis data while I improve the engine, but the core search and writing tools are fully live.</p> <p>Let me know what you think!</p> <p><a href=\"http",

Started with a basic regex to check for the @ and a dot in the domain \u2013 seemed straightforward enough.</p> <p>Then I dug deeper: handling plus-addressing (like <a href=\"mailto:name+tag@gmail.com\">name+tag@gmail.com</a>), catching common typos, checking MX records, dealing with disposable/temporary emails, and properly detecting catch-all domains without false positives. Oh, and actually doing SMTP checks to see if the mailbox exists, but without getting your IP blocked or triggering anti-abuse measures.</p> <p>A weekend turned into a rabbit hole. I realized proper email verification is way more complex than it looks \u2013 regex alone rejects valid addresses or lets junk through, and full verification involves DNS lookups, careful SMTP handshakes,",
