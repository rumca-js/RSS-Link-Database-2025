I&#39;ve contacted support, but they have not helped with this issue. I&#39;m using Chrome, but I&#39;ve also tried using Edge with the same results. I&#39;ve turned off my firewall - still no help. I get the error message: No internet connection. This is impossible, since the search still works. Has anyone experienced this and have a fix? If not, I have to just quit using Easy news after 15 years. One more thing - I downloaded newshosting app, and it works.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BassrInstincts\"> /u/BassrInstincts </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1q0ka02/easynews_web_interface_download_errors/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1q0ka02/easynews_web_interface_download_errors/\">[comments]</a></span",

For example, if I download a pack of 100 images but 5 of them are unavailable, can I still use the remaining 95?</p> <p>Also, is there a way to check if files are missing <em>before</em> starting the download? I encounter this issue quite often with these bundles.
