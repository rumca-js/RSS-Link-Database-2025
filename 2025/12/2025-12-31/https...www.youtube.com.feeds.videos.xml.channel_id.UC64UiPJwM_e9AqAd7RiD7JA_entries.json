        "description": "Anybody reading remember the film Jingle All The Way, you know the one where Arnold Schwarzenegger body checks his way through a crowd of harried single mums, is an accessory to a bomb threat and physically assaults like 4 retail workers, all for the chance to get his hands on that year's hottest toy? Of course you do. That film is great. Okay so let\u2019s talk about the time all of that happened for real, here in our world. Only instead of a turbo-tastic action figure with Booster accessory (don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s always plenty of Boosters left) we\u2019re talking about a foot tall vibrating Elmo plush.\n\nThis is the story of Tickle Me Elmo and how the cutesy red muppet indirectly caused a whole heap of problems including, as alluded to, a bomb threat, irate mob bosses and even an Elmo-knapping.\n\nAuthor: Karl Smallwood\nEditor: Daven Hiskey\nHost: Simon Whistler\nProducer: Samuel Avila",
