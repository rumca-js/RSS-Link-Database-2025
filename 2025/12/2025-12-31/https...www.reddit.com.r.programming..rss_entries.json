I use it for myself when I have a couple of minutes while waiting for something (running tests or just need to take a couple of minutes off from work), it is quite convinient to simply run it from terminal. It is written in bash (the code is quite ugly but I may improve it in the future). I haven&#39;t tested it on Mac or with any other bash implementations, so not sure how stable it is. But I shared it to a couple of friends already, they started using it and found it quite nice.
