Heres the thing, I have to set up the phone on a tripod in a corner of the gym/court and while that angle allows me to film everything, the resulting video sucks because of how far away everything looks when watching the game film. Ive tried the off the shelf gimbals and sports trackers (like the xbot go and the insta gimbal), but they are were rarely accurate for me, esp when I had to film a game when multiple games are going on at once. (maybe the trackers get confused with too many objects?)</p> <p>There are some larger cameras made for recording sporting events, but they start around $1200 AND require a subscription. This is a no go for me. I do believe these sport cameras use multiple cameras and stitch together a panorama video or something similar, then use AI to track things within the video to keep the action centered....or something like that.</p> <",
