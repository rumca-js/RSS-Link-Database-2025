        "description": "Discovered on New Year\u2019s Eve 2020, the Champagne Cluster is a striking pair of colliding galaxy clusters revealed through combined X-ray and optical observations. NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory shows superheated gas stretched and distorted, exposing a massive cosmic collision hidden from visible light alone. Studied by UC Davis astronomers, the system offers a rare natural laboratory to explore how dark matter behaves during cluster mergers. Understanding such violent encounters could help unlock fundamental clues about the universe\u2019s largest structures.",
