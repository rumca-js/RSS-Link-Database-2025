When I&#39;m debugging an error, I want Stack Overflow and GitHub issues. When I&#39;m comparing products, I want review sites and Reddit threads. When I&#39;m learning a concept, I want docs and tutorials.</p> <p>So instead of just &quot;search and summarize,&quot; the system figures out what kind of question you&#39;re asking and pulls from the right places automatically. Then it synthesizes everything into one answer while you watch the sources stream in.</p> <p>The part I&#39;m most proud of: it genuinely feels like part of the browser, not a sidebar I bolted on.

I&#39;ve been reading several posts and have selected the most mentioned ones. I hope you can help me choose the right one. I would like one that allows extensions to be added, such as an ad blocker. I&#39;m not a fan of Chromium-based browsers, so I&#39;m avoiding them, but if you really think they are private and secure, I might give them a try.</p> <p>Anyway, the ones I read about that were mentioned a lot are these: \u00d7 DuckDuckGo \u00d7 Brave \u00d7 WebLibre \u00d7 IronFox \u00d7 Fennec \u00d7 Iceraven \u00d7 Vivaldi \u00d7 Mullvad, although I couldn&#39;t find the mobile version of this one.</p> <p>It would be very helpful if you could give me your opinion and share your experiences with these browsers.

I\u2019ll be using it alongside Firefox for a while, as some sites I use are unstable there.</p> <p>Also, the <strong>Web Panel</strong> (overlay mini-browser) is a great feature. Zen had something similar early on but removed it.
