I was about 40% into this sequel and the movie mob plot line was going strong and I thought, aha, maybe she will actually revisit some of those nonsensical dangling threads and explain them! She did not. Almost none of the complaints i listed last year were explained. Mob-adjacent murder nun? Seemingly benevolent monk treats his niece like crap resulting in a lifelong estrangement and her turning into a supervillain? Homeless shelter/Paolo subplot? The newspaper prints a recipe featuring an obscure liquor that is also used as a secret message? Apparently all these ridiculous things were actually coincidences because none of them were revisited. </p> <p>Cons: </p> <ul> <li><p>multiple flip-flops in identification o",

It was definitely not horror, except for maybe one or two scenes, so I don&#39;t think it deserves the horror-mystery tag on the front. I was bought into the idea of the pictures being ingrained into the story and we have to solve things to understand it, but it all just led to a bunch of info dumping towards the end of each chapter explaining everything step by step. As a whole, the story is actually really good and I think I would have enjoyed it more without being led to believe it was this grand, masterfully weaved puzzle box type of story that gets pushed by reviews and online synopses. </p> <p>Some gripes I have: The smudged room picture could have been left out entirely and we could have had a decent character building chapter.

Every Wednesday, we&#39;ll post a new country or culture for you to recommend literature from, with the caveat that it must have been written by someone from that country (i.e. Shogun by James Clavell is a great book but wouldn&#39;t be included in Japanese literature). </p> <p>December 26 was the first day of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkanoo\">Junkanoo</a>! To celebrate, we&#39;re discussing Bahamian literature! Please use this thread to discuss your favorite Bahamian authors and books.</p> <p>If you&#39;d like to read our previous discussions of the literature of the world please visit the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/literatureof\">literature of the world</a> section of our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/wiki/index\">wiki</a>. </p> <p>Thank you and enjoy!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",

This year I read a book featuring supernatural characters in a post apocalyptic world and I just wanted to know more about that world!! But obviously it focused on the romance.</p> <p><em>Cozy mysteries</em> - just not for me. Too slice-of-life</p> <p><em>Historical thrillers</em> - eg Robert Harris.

Elphaba does awful things to Dorothy (in both the musical, book and movie, to be fair with reason but just because u have a reason to do something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s right.) becomes a terrorist in the book, and finally admits she cant be good by &quot;No Good Deed&quot;. Fiyero emotionally cheats on Glinda with Elphaba, and eventually leaves her (either after elphaba comes or at the altar in the movie). Boq literally openly expresses that he wants to kill Elphaba (after he becomes the tin man) and emotionally cheats on Nessa with Glinda. Nessa is.. obvious. Glinda sells Elphaba and Nessa out to the Wizard, plays a part in convincing her to join them in &quot;Wonderful&quot; (in Wicked: For Good), and she does resent elphaba&#39;s looks at the beginning of the musical and &quot;Popular&quot;.

I truly felt for them and I was so sad when scriber was killed off. He truly wanted to be accepted by Johanna and his peers for his hard work and Johanna threw his papers in a fire. Poor guy. </p> <p>Steel was such a compelling villain. So cunning and truly evil. The way they did experiments by torturing individuals and attempting to put them into a pack to create desired traits was haunting.
