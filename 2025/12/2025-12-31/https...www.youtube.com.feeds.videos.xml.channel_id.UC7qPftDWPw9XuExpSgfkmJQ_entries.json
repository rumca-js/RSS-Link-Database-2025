        "description": "Back in 1999, everyone was convinced the Millennium Bug would destroy our computers at midnight; so I ran an actual Y2K diagnostic disc I found inside my Doom II box to see what really happens. From BIOS rollover tests to DOS panic dates, this little utility was supposed to save your entire PC from collapsing into 1980.\n\nIf you like retro tech; weird old utilities; and forgotten Y2K paranoia; you\u2019ll enjoy this one.\n\n#y2k #retrocomputing #doom2 #vintagepc #millenniumbug #windows98",
