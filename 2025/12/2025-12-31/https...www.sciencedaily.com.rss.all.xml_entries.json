        "description": "As we age, our immune system quietly loses its edge, and scientists have uncovered a surprising reason why. A protein called platelet factor 4 naturally declines over time, allowing blood stem cells to multiply too freely and drift toward unhealthy, mutation-prone behavior linked to cancer, inflammation, and heart disease. Researchers found that restoring this protein in older mice \u2014 and even in human stem cells in the lab \u2014 made aging blood and immune cells behave strikingly younger again.",

The newly named Paradoxophidion richardoweni lived around 37 million years ago, during a time when Britain was warmer and teeming with reptiles. Though known only from tiny backbone bones, this \u201cparadox snake\u201d carries a surprising mix of traits seen in modern snakes, placing it near the very roots of today\u2019s most diverse snake group.",

        "description": "New research reveals a brighter side of ADHD, showing that adults who recognize and use their strengths feel happier, healthier, and less stressed. People with ADHD were more likely to identify traits like creativity, humor, and hyperfocus as personal strengths. Across the board, using these strengths was linked to better quality of life and fewer mental health symptoms. The study suggests that embracing strengths could be a game-changer for ADHD support.",

New research shows that sunlight drives this process, causing different plastics to release distinct and evolving mixtures of dissolved organic compounds as they weather. These chemical plumes are surprisingly complex, often richer and more biologically active than natural organic matter, and include additives, broken polymer fragments, and oxidized molecules.",

        "description": "Mars once had sprawling river systems that rivaled major watersheds on Earth, and scientists have now identified the biggest ones for the first time. Researchers mapped 16 massive drainage basins where water likely flowed long enough to support life. Even though these areas cover just 5% of ancient Martian terrain, they account for a huge share of erosion and sediment movement. That makes them some of the most promising places to search for ancient life.",
