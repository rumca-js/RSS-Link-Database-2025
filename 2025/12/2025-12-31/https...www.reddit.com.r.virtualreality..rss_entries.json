I messed up on that part and since I can&#39;t run it on pcvr I thought it&#39;d be more useful to just switch to a more budget friendly VR headset? </p> <p>I&#39;ve been considering a Pico but I&#39;m really new to VR so I would like to know which VR headset would be good instead for standalone, I don&#39;t need face tracking either I think I just want to play in VR right now without anything extra.</p> <p>I am also considering on waiting for the Steamframe but I&#39;m not sure, any advice is really appreciated :&#39;D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Firm-Toe3522\"> /u/Firm-Toe3522 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1q0q86c/budget_friend",

It was a strategy game in the style of Wargame: European Escalation (same Cold War vibe/atmosphere), where you command your troops from inside a bunker or an... armored vehicle ? In VR. I don&#39;t know if the game is VR-only or if it offers both VR and non-VR modes. I think it&#39;s in Early Access, or at least not fully released in 1.0 yet, but I&#39;ve lost the name and I can&#39;t find it anymore.

My other hobby is campaign narrative board games. There have been a lot of those in recent years, and some even have miniatures, and I do like to paint miniatures. Games like Mansions of Madness 2nd Edition. Awakened Realms games like Nemesis, ISS Vanguard. Sleeping Gods. Lucky duck games like Destinies, The Dark Quarter. The new edition of Hero Quest has an app with sound and atmosphere, and it can be your DM, so you can even play solo!</p> <p>I kinda get that vibe with the new Demeo AD&amp;D game. You can pick your hero, there is music and sound, voice acting. I would love to see more campaign board games like that. Heck, I wish there could be a collab and some of the board games I listed actually get a full VR version! I think I would be even more hyped to &quot;back&quot; a gamefound game that is a narrative based campaign fantasy game that&#",

I don&#39;t even think you need to edit that shit. </p> <p>But in reality... it&#39;s like looking at a 420p video.</p> <p>I have constantly wondered why when even amateurs record their own content natively with the Quest 3 that suddenly it looks like I&#39;m looking at 720p content or higher... and then someone told me it&#39;s because post-processing on the Quest itself afterwards makes it look better.</p> <p>Well... that&#39;s fucking great. And listen. I am actually a huge fan of the Quest 3&#39;s potential regarding passthrough and mixed reality... make no mistake. I&#39;ve experienced it myself.</p> <p>I enjoy passthrough... but I&#39;ll admit... I&#39;m tired of the fucking dishonesty when seeing some of these passthrough videos. No... it will not be that clear. It will look like you&#39;re looking at reality vi",
