Silksong's real bread and butter, though, is how it brings out the best in you, allows you to relish in your accomplishments, and quickly reminds you that pride is a sin most grave, punishable by death... over and over again.\n\n#hollowknight #hollowknightsilksong #gameoftheyear",

In doing so, the game unravels in a novel way, leaving the order of events solely up to the player. The result is quite inspiring.\n\n#gamespot #gaming #atomfall",
