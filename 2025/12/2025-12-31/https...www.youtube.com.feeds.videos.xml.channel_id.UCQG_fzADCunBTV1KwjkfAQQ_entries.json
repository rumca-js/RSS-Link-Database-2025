It may not be filled with optimism or grand ambitions, just fragments of how I genuinely feel right now.\nI\u2019m deeply grateful to myself for surviving one \u201cwinter\u201d after another, and even more grateful to you for walking with me through year after year of spring, summer, autumn, and winter.\nIn the new year, I hope we can all stay safe and happy.\n\nHello, everyone!
