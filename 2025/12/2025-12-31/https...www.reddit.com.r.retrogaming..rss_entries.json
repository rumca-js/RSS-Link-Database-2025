Now 43. Hit my head, ended up in a coma. Memory is shot now).<br/> I live in the UK and I would love some help trying to find an arcade game I used to play at a shop near where I used to go to school.</p> <p>From what I can remember. It was on a arcade machine. Had a stick with I&#39;m guessing 6 buttons. You could have 2 players. If you wanted to do vs I guess.<br/> I think you used to put \u00a31 in and you got 3 lives.<br/> Now the game I don&#39;t remember much about but the MBoss (last bad guy) was in I think golden Armor.<br/> It was kind of like a street fighter style game, with combos and what not.<br/> If you have any idea or suggestions to what it might be. Could you post some pics or links to like a Ytube vid or anything.</p> <p>I would really appreciate it. Thank you for reading this and hopefully you maybe able t",
