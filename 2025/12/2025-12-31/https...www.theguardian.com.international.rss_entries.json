At midnight, there would be an amateur firework display on the roof of the old lido.</p><p>In the shop that afternoon, some of the fireworks sat behind a glass-fronted cabinet. They had names like Stinging Bees, Vendetta and Sky Breaker, and beneath each item was a small laminated caption: \u201cOne hundred shot roman candle firing high whistling bees,\u201d read one. \u201cTwenty-five secs of time rain salutes.

Is The Apartment suggesting that Kubelik and Baxter then live happily ever after? Probably not, because I\u2019ve never been convinced that these two lovers are going to stay the course. They\u2019re too mismatched and desperate; their wounds are still too fresh.
