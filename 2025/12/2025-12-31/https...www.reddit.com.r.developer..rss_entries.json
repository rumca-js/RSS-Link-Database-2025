The idea is fairly unique and global in scope, but reaching influencers or advertising platforms has been difficult, especially since many ask for budgets that are honestly beyond what I can afford right now.</p> <p>The platform supports 9 languages and uses AI heavily. Each session is played by three people, and the AI generates a complete case every time including the story, evidence, witnesses, and questioning. No two cases are the same. At the end of the session, the AI evaluates all players based on their performance.</p> <p>It\u2019s also designed to be educational. Law students can use it to experience realistic court sessions, and the project itself is protected under intellectual property registration. The platform has strict rules, safety measures, and clear boundaries for how the AI operates. There\u2019s a built in guide inside the game that explains how everything works once you sign up<",
