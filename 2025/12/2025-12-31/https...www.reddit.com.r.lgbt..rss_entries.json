First off I told her that everyone I had ever loved left me for a guy and she promised never to do that. She claims to be pan but I really think she&#39;s just straight.

In those 3 months she pressured me to send nudes often, even when I firmly told her no. However when I did say no, she would stop talking to me and so eventually I gave in and sent her nudes. I\u2019d never really sent nudes before, I expressed this was difficult for me being trans, I don\u2019t really like my body. When I did get upset about this she told me to send more nudes to apologise.</p> <p>Tonight she just broke things off as I am too \u201cemotional\u201d. I don\u2019t know what to do, I can\u2019t calm myself down. I feel like an idiot for acknowledging she is a bad person but continuing to text her as I get attached easily. This girl has eluded that there is a chance I can \u201cresolve\u201d things and told me she\u2019s going to text me tomorrow, I\u2019m scared I will text back. I feel like I can\u2019t breathe, the idea I\u2019ve been vulnerable with a person who doesn\u2019t care about me at all. </p> <p>",

I came out when i was 11, and while I thought my family accepted me, their behavior towards my younger brother has made me realize their &#39;acceptance&#39; has some conditions.</p> <p>I\u2019m 15 and openly gay. When I was younger, my family would often shame me for doing anything feminine, telling me to &#39;man up&#39; because looking gay was &#39;embarrassing.&#39;</p> <p>I have a brother who is ten years younger than me (he\u2019s five). Ever since i came out, my parents have been telling me not to act feminine around him because they\u2019re afraid he might &#39; copy me and &#39;become gay&#39; when he gets older.</p> <p>Whenever he shows interest in things they consider feminine like choosing the color pink, catwalking, or playing with certain toys etc. they immediately criticize and bully him. They tell him not to act gay because &quot;we can\u2019t have two gay people in this household&quo",
