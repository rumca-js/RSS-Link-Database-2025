The book was interesting enough, but I felt really disappointed about a decision the MC makes felt incredibly stupid. In general I find it off putting when MCs repeatedly make stupid decisions. I ended up putting the book on hiatus for at least a year. After being urged to give it a second try with the promise of character development, I took it up again and I am very glad I did. I\u2019m now cruising through book 5 and I love it. Book 2 was a huge improvement, book 3 was great, 4 was excellent and 5 is fantastic.

Song of Ice and Fire is my absolute favorite fantasy series. </p> <p>Here&#39;s some other books I like: Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn and Last King of Osten Ard by Tad Williams. Everything Joe Abercrombie has done. Faithful and the Fallen, Bloodsworn, and Of Blood and Bone by John Gwynne, all the Realm of the Elderlings books by Robin Hobb, all the Riyria books by Michael Sullivan, all the Echoes Saga by Phillip Quaintrell, </p> <p>I read Kings of the Wyld and thought it was just okay. Same with The Bound and the Broken. I started Empires of Dust, but something about that series I&#39;m just kinda meh on. Started Darkness That Comes Before and never got into it. Never really got into Stormlight Archive after reading the first two or three books, but I&#39;ve been thinking of trying them again. </p> <p>So, yeah, that&#39;s my taste. I like adult stuff, but not necessarily grim dark. I also like classical fantasy",
