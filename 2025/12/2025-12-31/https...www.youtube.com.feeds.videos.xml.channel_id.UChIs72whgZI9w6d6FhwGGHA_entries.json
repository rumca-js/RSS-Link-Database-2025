Hopping in a car with competitor Der8auer of Thermal Grizzly, we drove up to Waren, Germany to visit Watercool and learn about how the MORA-600 radiator components are manufactured and assembled. The MORA is the largest radiator we know of for computer use and happens to be Der8auer's favorite, so he took us to his competition to show us how it's made and help translate complicated manufacturing topics.\n\nThis travel content is funded by the audience!
