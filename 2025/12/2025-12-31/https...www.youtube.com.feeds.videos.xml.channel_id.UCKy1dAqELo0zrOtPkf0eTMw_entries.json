        "description": "Okay, let\u2019s get this out of the way: we have no idea what we\u2019re talking about when it comes to baseball, sports in general, or even video games about sports (baseball, or otherwise) but considering MLB The Show 25 was one of PlayStation\u2019s few first-party releases of the year, we figured it\u2019s worth discussing. What could the next installment possible add that would liven up the experience enough to get even the most sports-averse of us interested? Explosions? Fireworks? More fireworks? Like, dangerous fireworks? Karaoke? Mascot fights? Sports teams made up of literal versions of whatever they\u2019re named after, like Blue Jays, Diamondbacks, or a variety of different colored socks? Again, we have no idea what we\u2019re talking about here, but when has that stopped us from having fun? Beyond and Happy New Year! \n\nThis weeks show is Hosted by Max Scoville, Brian Altano, Jada Griffin, Nick Maillet, and is produced by Nick Maillet. \n\n#MLBTheShow #PS5 #PlayStation6",

        "description": "This review contains spoilers for Fallout Season 2, Episode 3, \u201cThe Profligate,\u201d which is available to stream now on Prime Video. \n\nCivil wars are erupting all over the wasteland in Fallout Season 2\u2019s third chapter, and in the middle of it all are two men making hugely important decisions that will shape their destinies. While it\u2019s a shame that Lucy had to be put in crucifixion time-out for most of this episode, and Robert House\u2019s not-so-mysterious identity continues to be a sticking point, this is an otherwise fantastic, character-driven episode that thrives on bringing important elements from the New Vegas video game into the spotlight. It\u2019s packed with so much good stuff that I didn\u2019t even get to mention Victor the Securitron\u2019s guest appearance, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re as pleased as me that he\u2019s still rolling around the Mojave.\n\n#IGN #Fallout",
