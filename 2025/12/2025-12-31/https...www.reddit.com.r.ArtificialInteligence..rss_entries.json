I am more interested in trying to predict what the future level of commonplace AI capability will be based on safety and security considerations.</p> <p>At a certain level of ability it will be impossible to separate the safe abilities of an AI model from the dangerous abilities. It is relatively easy to prevent an AI from giving the recipe for gunpowder with pattern based filtering, but it is generally easy to get around this. Research from Palo Alto Networks demonstrates that even advanced models can be manipulated through techniques like &quot;Deceptive Delight.&quot;[1] For the gunpowder example, instead of asking directly, you can ask for a history lesson about the invention of fireworks in China and eventually you will get there. Gunpowder is no secret, but I think the concept applies to other problems as well. Microsoft",
