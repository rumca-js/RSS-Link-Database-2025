The thought of another roast dinner makes me yawn, so something with spice feels exciting. Biryani, with its layered complexity of flavour and texture, has always been the ultimate celebratory centrepiece for guests to congregate around, and it needs little accompaniment bar a bowl of cooling raita. This meat-free version made with tender paneer koftas is light and fresh, yet still warming and packed with flavour. End on a sweet note with an incredible, Indian inflected tiramisu, which is fragrant with saffron and rich with nuts.

Cameo\u2019s Candy, one of the all-time great funk records, comes on and everyone lines up to do the dance. Maybe you throw yourself into it, maybe you are a white friend who looks around in confusion, or maybe, like me, you just sigh in resignation.</p><p>The dance is a US import, beginning life as the electric slide in the mid-70s, and eventually becoming the Candy in Britain, thanks to its appearance at the end of the 1999 movie <a href=\"https://youtu.be/gAvGSfU3lqc?si=fxwjWHqYrcMHwnj1\">The Best Man</a>. Since then, be it birthdays, christenings, Christmas, NYE \u2013 even funerals \u2013 you\u2019re certain to see the dancefloor immediately fill and get into formation once the initial few chords are played.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/31/the-hill-i-will-die-on-cameo-candy",
