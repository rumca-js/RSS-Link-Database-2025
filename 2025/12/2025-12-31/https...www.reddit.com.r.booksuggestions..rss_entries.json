I used to read any chance I got but once I started uni I stopped reading for enjoyment. Some preferences are: - Horror/thriller like Stephen King - Historical fiction like The Book Theif and Tattoist of Auschwitz - Dystopian types I liked as a teenager like The Hunger Games and Divergent - Not a huge fantasy fan but I did enjoy the Throne of Glass series and Harry Potter - I&#39;m not a huge romance person but will read it if it&#39;s part of a bigger plot, but I did love John Green as a teenager - Some of my all-time favourites are The Book Theif, IT, Looking for Alaska, Jasper Jones, and The Hunger Games </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/undercookdspaghetti\"> /u/undercookdspaghetti </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1q03ek6/suggestions_to_spark_love_of",

So far, I have read what I think is a variety of books, but they probably miss many genres. From the recommendation of relatives from the Soviet Union, I have read and loved many of Jack London&#39;s books, with the top few being Martin Eden, The Sea Wolf, Burning Daylight, and Smoke Bellew. I also enjoyed the first 5ish of Tom Clancy&#39;s Jack Ryan series, until it started seeming outlandish and repetitive. Other things I have read include the satirical, funny, and cynical styles of Catch-22 or Breakfast of Champions, varied classics like 1984, The Invisible Man, or The Great Gatsby, books leaning on philosophy like The Stranger and Notes From the Underground, and other books I found, such as Airport or The Firm. My question is, what books would you recommend to me? I want to hear any suggestions, both books that ",

Generally speaking I love fantasy and historical fiction (or books set in a modern day that have some fantastical or mysterious element). </p> <p>The only other books that have come close that I also really enjoy are Sepulchre by Kate Mosse and the Essex Serpent by Sarah Perry. </p> <p>I would love recommendations from folks who have read these books and can recommend something similar to scratch the itch.
