        "description": "After the Assad regime brutally tortured and killed 13-year-old Hamza al-Khateeb in May 2011, Mohammed al-Hallak decided to join the protests against the government. Later, when the army stormed his city, he made a life-altering decision to pick up a rifle. He was only a teenager. \n\nAl-Hallak\u2019s mother pleaded for him to stay home and continue his studies, but his father urged him to defend Atarib, their town. \n\nHe carried both a schoolbook and a weapon, attempting to balance his education with the realities of soldiering.\nThis film explores the harsh realities faced by many young Syrians, caught between fighting for freedom and the demands of war.\n\nThis documentary first aired on Al Jazeera 360 in April 2024. \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X : https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDown",
