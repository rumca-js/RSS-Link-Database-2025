        "description": "There's an art to scaring people, and no, I don't mean popping out from behind cover with a loud sound, going \u201cboo\u201d, or delaying Grand Theft Auto 6 again. I'm talking about instilling actual living dread into someone; bringing out their worst fears and leveraging them to deliver an experience that causes discomfort, maybe even outright disgust. The sheer range of fears for humanity is near-endless, but crafting an experience that frightens on such a collective front, even if it's not a typical \u201cscary\u201d game, can be tough.\n\nSo it's all the more impressive that the video game industry, be it triple-A developers, independent studios (even with the backing of major publishers) and smaller creators, can craft such a wide range of terrifying games, year in and year out. While that also means a heaping helping of shovelware \u2013 awful releases that wouldn't even muster a simple yawn \u2013 a select few rise above the rabble to dominate.\n\nThumbnail credit: Gamespew",
