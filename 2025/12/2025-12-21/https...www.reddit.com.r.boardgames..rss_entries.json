The first player to go (2 or more, doesn&#39;t matter) will basically always win due to a significant margin, if they make a resource switch to take a Coco card. This will give them an automatic 3rd. lair (for getting the 1st coco card) and often an additional lair from a lair/ship card, or from the &quot;Captain Raven&quot; card - that enables the player to move the cap&#39; from his island and place a player lair instead. Unless we are reading the instructions wrong, I was considering removing at least one of the free lairs to make it more fair (and interesting) for my kids.

Catan and Ticket to Ride have been staples for my family for several years as even the non-gamers have been able to catch on and remember how to play. But her kid is only 7 and and I imagine the full-size versions of those games would probably still be a bit much for her. Don&#39;t get me wrong, she&#39;s a bright kid but also about as patient and easily discouraged as, well, a 7 year old.</p> <p>So I ask if any of you have played either of these kid&#39;s versions of these games? Is either of them going to be too difficult or be too baby? Is one going to be better for the two of them to play together when me and my GF aren&#39;t around to play with them? Do you prefer playing one of them over the other?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",

Yes, we all know (and you don&#39;t really need to say it..) that it has many flaws and falls short in more than a few ways by modern standards. The play-length being anything from 4 hours to 44 hours being one, the broken combos/characters being another, etc. etc. </p> <p>But it still has something I have not really seen captured in anything else since. </p> <p>The magic of it. Not the magic system (which is also broken). But the magic <em>feeling</em> of it. It feels actually lovely, rolling a dice, moving that many spaces, drawing a card and encountering whatever you encounter. Maybe it&#39;s a troll. Maybe it&#39;s a witch selling potions. Maybe it&#39;s mule. Maybe it&#39;s a boatman offering to ferry you across the river. ",
