Said link was sent on Whatsapp and it asked me to vote for someone in a sporting contest and validate my vote by introducing my phone number. The next day, after about 12 hours, a message was sent to everyone of my contacts with the same description and link. I deleted my Whatsapp account instantly after, and I contacted them and they said everything should be fine now, I remade my account with the same number and for now it&#39;s restricted, but I have no idea how this works and I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m still at risk, should I change my phone number/reset my phone to factory settings? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/puunkeeh\"> /u/puunkeeh </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1ps52gs/my_whatsapp",
