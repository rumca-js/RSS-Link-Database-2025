        "description": "Welcome to the first ever Spiffmas MMP Livestream, a medieval minecraft simulation like no other. We invite you to join an ever growing server of players and create characters that will rise and fall in this hardcore simulation of a medieval society. THIS WEEK WE ARE DOING A SUPER SPECIAL CHRISTMAS STREAM WITH FOCUS ON SPREADING FESTIVE CHEER AND NOT DYING! We have been working on this project since the first spifftopia in 2020 and have had many ups and downs along the way but its been great to see the excitement people have shown for similar projects like Ish and his incredible minecraft civilization videos. Now remember this is not like normal minecraft. This is spifftopia, and that means the gameplay is not like anything you have seen in vanilla minecraft so far, expect a mix of vintage story and hardcore runescape as the fundamentals of minecraft are impossible for those who have not practiced and trained their skills in a particular talent. \n\nSpifftopia Gameplay Guide: https://yo",
