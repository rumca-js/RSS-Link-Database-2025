        "description": "Get-ready-with-me videos saturate social media feeds, targeting young girls with multi-step skincare routines where popular brands partner with kid-fluencers to create viral skincare products. \n\nThe skincare industry is cashing in on so-called \"Sephora kids,\" fueled by Gen Alpha (kids under 12). But dermatologists warn that many viral products contain anti-aging ingredients that can harm young skin, and it's hard to tell the products apart.\n\nA California lawmaker wants to restrict the sale of some anti-aging products for kids under 18. Critics say that's misguided.\n\nSo, CBS News California investigative correspondent Julie Watts teamed up with her daughter's fifth-grade class and the CBS News Confirmed team to examine the risks and the proposed solutions.\n\n</br></br>\n<b><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/video/skincare-brands-make-billions-selling-products-including-some-harmful-to-young-skin-to-tweens/\">WATCH PART 1 - Investigating \"Sephora Kid\" Concerns: How skincare brands",
