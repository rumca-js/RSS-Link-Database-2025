And I can&#39;t seem to change it. </p> <p>Just something I thought about recently, but in many fantasy coming of age stories where the main character has to train for something, there&#39;s some sort of elaborate obstacle course that the main character has to pass. The most recent I&#39;ve read are Book of the Ancestor, Will of the Many and Fourth Wing.</p> <p>I think this is a very strange choice. It&#39;s often framed as &quot;if you can pass this obstacle course, then you can do this other thing you need to do&quot; as if running an obstacle course will somehow prepare you for fighting or dragon riding or whatever. I don&#39;t know, I think it feels kind of cheap. </p> <p>Anyone else who has thought about this?
