        "description": "Australia has marked a National Day of Reflection to honour the 15 victims of the terrorist shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach last week. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has launched a major review of the country's law enforcement and intelligence agencies, which must report its findings by the end of April.\nThe review, led by a former spy chief, will examine the \"right powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements\" to keep Australians safe. The investigation follows questions about the intelligence assessment of one suspect in 2019. Prime Minister Albanese has also condemned divisive anti-immigration rallies, stating they have no place in Australia in the wake of an antisemitic attack.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Victoria Gatenby reports. \n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com",

Their rapid expansion is causing significant conflict with local communities, particularly over noise pollution. Residents report constant, intolerable noise from cooling systems, leading to health complaints and plummeting property values.\nLegal action is being taken against the operators, with lawsuits alleging the disturbances cause physical and mental harm.
