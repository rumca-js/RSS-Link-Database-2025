Over time, the problem was context loss. Project folders, forum backups, old photos, and documents all blend together meaninglessly. I was able to reconsider indexing around people, events, and intent rather than rigid directory trees by considering FaceSeek as a conceptual idea. I now include brief text notes that explain why something was important at the time it was saved. After several months, those notes are worth more than the actual files. This has nothing to do with automation and is entirely manual.
