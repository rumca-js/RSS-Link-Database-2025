        "description": "The United States Coast Guard is in \"active pursuit\" of an oil tanker sailing in international waters off the coast of Venezuela, according to US officials.   It follows the seizure of two other tankers by the US in recent days. \n\nUS President Donald Trump has ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country, accusing Venezuela of using oil revenue to fund drug-related crime and terrorism.\n\nA US official said the latest ship being targeted was part of a \"sanctioned dark fleet that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion\u201d and said it is \u201cflying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.\"\n\nVenezuela has described the seizures as theft, kidnapping and piracy and accuses the Trump administration of seeking to overthrow its president Nicolas Maduro. \n\nIn recent weeks the US has been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, with growing speculation that the Trump administration could launch a direct military attack on Venezuela.

The most recent decision brings the total number of settlements approved over the past three years to 69, according to Smotrich.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Israel #WestBank #BBCNews",

        "description": "Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a review into the police and national intelligence agencies after the Bondi Beach attack in Sydney.\n \nThe shooting, in which 15 people were killed after two gunmen opened fire at a Jewish festival, has been declared a terrorist incident. Police say the attackers were inspired by \"Islamic State ideology\".\n \nA national day of reflection is being held on Sunday, and a minute's silence was observed at 18:47 (07:47 GMT) - the time when the attack began.\n \nAlbanese looked startled as he arrived at the event in Sydney as he was met with a loud chorus of boos and jeers, and at least one member of the crowd shouted \"blood on your hands\" while another was tackled by police after moving towards the prime minister.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Bondi #Australia #BBCNews",
