Stuart Findlay claimed the first of them, the centre back rising highest after Alexandros Kyziridis combined with Claudio Braga for a short corner. Kyziridis\u2019s cross was pinpoint. The Greek winger had earlier threatened the Rangers goal twice, the visitors having a potential opener ruled out for an offside against Bojan Miovski.</p> <a",
