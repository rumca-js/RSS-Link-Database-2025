My goal for the Christmas vacation; create a movie trailer to promote my novel Buckyball. Ran the novel and the script through chat GPT to access some scene prompt and ran it through Mootion for a trailer. ( I am not a spendthrift and I really thought the 15 dollars worth of credit would last longer.) I am not one to research too much. I see the cliff and I jump. I really thought I would get a worthy trailer. So all this banter to ask what is the AI I can use to feed it my novel and script and get a worthy actual movie trailer out of it.
