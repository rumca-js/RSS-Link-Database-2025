This deep dive into C++ template metaprogramming demonstrates how to achieve compile-time arithmetic without using built-in integers, runtime execution, or `constexpr`. Instead, Peter explores a novel approach using pointer arithmetic in C++ \u2014 safely and entirely in type space.\n\nIf you're interested in type-level programming, pointer tricks, or pushing the limits of compile-time computation in C++, this talk is for you. Using recursive templates, the talk shows how to represent numbers as stacked pointers, implement addition, multiplication, and even exponentiation \u2014 all using C++ templates. This is not just metaprogramming; it\u2019s metaprogramming with style.\n\nWhether you're exploring alternatives to `constexpr`, looking to understand pointer manipu",
