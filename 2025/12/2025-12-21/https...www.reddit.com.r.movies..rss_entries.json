Something that hit harder because of age, loss, work, marriage, failure, or just time.</p> <p>For me it was Lost in Translation.</p> <p>I watched it younger and thought nothing really happened. Years later it hit completely different. Feeling disconnected, stuck in routine, surrounded by people but still lonely. The quiet moments made sense. The looks, the pauses, the things not said. It was not about romance anymore. It was about timing, distance, and how some connections only exist for a moment in your life.</p> <p>Curious what movie changed meaning for you.

We see Die Hard on numerous best Christmas movie lists, and rightfully so. We see so many ardent defenders of Die Hard but in doing so we&#39;ve neglected this 1987 classic. Make no mistake, Lethal Weapon absolutely qualifies as a Christmas Movie. Not only does it feature the decor of the season heavily, the film opens with &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot;, it has an introductory action set piece in a tree lot, and the movie follows the depressive seasonal slump of a recently widowered cop challenged by the themes of family and redemption, until he&#39;s offered a new family and a path to redemption. Despite being set in LA, the filmmakers work in a little &quot;snow&quot; into the plot. I think it&#39;s time we started defending Lethal Weapon&#39;s status as a Christmas movie.</p> </div",
