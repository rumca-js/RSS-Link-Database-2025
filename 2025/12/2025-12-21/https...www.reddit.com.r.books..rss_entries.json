So many times I sighed when a tenant made another bad decision or felt angry when the landlord figured out another way of exploiting the tenant, or just felt powerless when the government officials&#39; actions just build the road to hell with good intentions (on paper). After reading it for two weeks I have to put it down, coz forseeing another tenants&#39; inevitable tragic ending is just too much.</p> <p>It&#39;s not for entertainment but if you are in for a thorough, deep, brutally honest and easy-to-read analysis to learn about what poverty trap means Evicted is definitely the book for you.</p> <p>I&#39;m only 38% through and here is a table of the evicted tenants that Chatgpt helped make:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Tenant</th> <th align=\"lef",

I hold this opinion just. </p> <p>However, there\u2019re also some readers who say they cannot blame him for his wrath and rage and actions because of the environment he grew up in.

Because of this, it&#39;s pretty hard to parse some passages on the first read, and I had to go over them a couple of times to figure out what&#39;s happening. I loved this aspect, but I totally get why that would turn some folks off.</p> <p>The story is about one night in a queer homeless punk kid&#39;s life, the day before his 13th birthday. Set in 1981 in LA. </p> <p>Anyone here read this book? I&#39;d love to just chat about it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Born-Anybody3244\"> /u/Born-Anybody3244 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1prxl7z/anyone_read_what_we_do_is_secre",

It sat behind a bunch of other books on my shelf until i did some library rearranging.</p> <p>i finally read it last week and man, that was a ride of a book.
