Sessions would overlap, cookies would mix, and accounts would get flagged. Beginner tools worked only for a small number, but once I scaled up, they became slow and unreliable. Later, I moved to a more professional setup and tried Incogniton. It helped keep each browser session fully separate, even when handling hundreds of profiles. Everything stayed fast and stable, and the API automation made managing repetitive tasks much easier. I&#39;m able to run large workflows without worrying about sessions colliding.
