        "description": "If you grew up with adults praising you for your intelligence, but now you\u2019re stuck, watching life pass by while others pull ahead then this one's for you. In this video, I break down the uncomfortable psychology of why early intelligence often turns into adult paralysis, how your biggest strength quietly became your biggest weakness, and why protecting the identity of being \u201csmart\u201d is holding you back from real growth. This isn\u2019t feel-good motivation or IQ worship, it\u2019s a blunt look at failure, identity, and why learning to be bad at things might be the smartest move you ever make.\n\nIf you are not already a member of my premium community, get access to monthly challenges and daily action steps that add up to real change here: https://mrk.mn/ZcFwvxv\n\nFREE: For practical advice each week that might change your life, sign up for my newsletter here: http://bit.ly/3JRg3NX\n\nWritten & Directed by Mark Manson\nProduced by Will Weir\nCreative Direction by Devin Robbins x.com/devinrobbins\nEdited",
