They have long descriptive sentences, a very poetic writing style full of simile and metaphor, and they like to use unconventional words whenever possible, which makes it harder to read.</p> <p>I grew watching superhero cartoons and anime, and between my severe ADHD, and my strong preference for that fast paced and punchy storytelling style, I find it really hard to get into reading, even though I really want to. And I do want to, because I feel a very strong need to unplug from screens, because I feel like they&#39;re taking over my life. Slop anime and doomscrolling on TikTok are rotting my brain. I need to sit down with some text, and just imagine something with my own brain for a change.</p> <p>In short</p> <p>I like books on the shorter side like novellas, a fast-pace, quippy dialogue,",

This is largely the result of incredibly inadequate homeschooling for most of his early education. He is now in public school, catching up slowly, and expressing interest in reading for the first time. I\u2019m hoping to gift him a few books for Christmas (last minute shoppers unite). The difficulty is that a lot of the books at his reading level are targeted at much younger kids and I fear will seem too \u201cbaby-ish\u201d. </p> <p>I was thinking that middle grade graphic novels might be a good place to start since he can also get a lot of the story from the picture. I\u2019d also like to get him a more text-heavy book that his parents will (hopefully) help him read. </p> <p>Ideas? What are 8-9 year olds reading these days anyways?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Squirrel_9601\"> /u/",

I\u2019ve been on a nonfiction kick as of late, and I am looking for nonfiction books about niche topics (anything and everything), but also some very specific things. I am really interested in major events and factors that contributed to the way many countries are today. I\u2019m mainly thinking about how many African countries suffer from European intervention, civil wars, and systemic rape and slavery. Or how Latin American countries like Mexico and Mexicans are exploited for labor. Maybe also about the history of Latin American countries like Trujillo in the DR. How the US and Soviet intervention forever changed the Middle East. Stuff about Soviet Russia. I would also love to learn about more Asian countries! India, China, Vietnam (especially about the war, but much more), the Koreas, etc. History of like the Irish famine. Just anything and anything. Feel free to drop recommendations about random, completely unrelated niche topics. Thank you!</",

I&#39;ve tried things like Dungeon Crawler Carl but realized that style of humor didn&#39;t work for me, i more love the dialog humor where it&#39;s just the characters having banter and finding the humor even in the most extreme of situations! A couple of years ago i read the Renegades trilogy and i feel like it had a lot of that, and YA tends to do it a lot in general, but i also loved Brandon Sanderson&#39;s Skyward book",
