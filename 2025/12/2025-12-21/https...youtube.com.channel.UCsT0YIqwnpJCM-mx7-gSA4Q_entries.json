        "description": "Sport retirement is something all athletes will experience at some point. During sport retirement, individuals may experience identity crisis, depression, and grief. Following any major life transition, the goal is to adapt to the new identity, routine, and lifestyle. Athletic identity is one major factor that influences the likelihood of successful adaptation. In this talk, Andrea will explore athletic identity and other factors that influence adaptation to sport retirement based on her research and experience as a coach and educator.  \n\nDr. Andrea Cota Powell spent 10+ years in the sports performance arena coaching athletes of all ages and levels before taking the leap into academia. Her research has focused on how athletes adapt to retirement from sports, with the goal of using research-based methods to coach athletes through the retirement process. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
