I&#39;ve used a shell script to deploy my apps many years (using Docker and Compose since 2016 or so).</p> <p>Although tools like Dokku, Coolify and Kamal exists (and they are amazing) they all have tradeoffs. Dokku comes with the plugin system when it comes to DBs etc. which I don&#39;t like. Coolify since v4 it has 4 containers running to get started. Kamal is pretty awesome but the build process and config file which is mandatory and also secrets management is time consuming to get up and running.</p> <p>Mushak is very simple. If you have A Docker or compose file, it should JUST WORK.</p> <p>Create a .env.prod file in, and it will detect it and pushes it to the server if you want.

Too slow for a broad firewall rule. Paid APIs: Most had strict rate limits (20-50 RPS) unless you paid huge monthly fees, and they still added network hops.

Well, one way or the other the communication needs to happen and often this is done via (udp) hole punching, like tailscale or newt. So I am wondering where is the adavantage other than they randomly open ports compared to standard ports which could be part of standard scanning scripts.

My current stack: \u2022 DNS/WAF: Cloudflare \u2022 Reverse Proxy: Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM) \u2022 Hypervisor: Proxmox The Flow: My domain queries hit Cloudflare -&gt; redirected via DNS to my NPM -&gt; NPM routes traffic to the specific local IP/port of the container or VM. The Problem: I tried setting up Authelia, but I\u2019m struggling to get the configuration right between Cloudflare&#39;s proxying and NPM\u2019s header handling. It feels like I\u2019m going in circles with the middleware settings. My Questions: 1. Security vs. Necessity: Since I am already using Cloudflare (which offers WAF and some level of protection), do I actually need a self-hosted solution like Authelia or PocketID for an extra layer of MFA/SSO? Or is it redundant for a home lab?",
