I&#39;m Alfred Baley, the one-man team behind Baffled Engineer. I&#39;ve been making games as a hobby for more than 10 years, but I&#39;ve finally worked up the courage to actually release one. </p> <p>Super Cosmolite is an endless runner, except you&#39;re in control of a tiny spaceship with realistic space physics. Take account of your thrust, momentum, and velocity as you dodge through procedurely generated sectors full of asteroids, explosive mines, and gravity wells. You can play in real-time, or pause whenever you like to plan your trajectory.</p> <p>Space physics aren&#39;t easy, so don&#39;t expect to get very far on your first run! But the more you play, the more you&#39;ll understand, so keep trying to beat your own high score and get further and further. My personal",

My game is 50% visual novel and 50% side-scrolling adventure with exploration (walking sim). [and yes, we all know that neither VN nor walksims are real games, haha]</p> <p>Plot: The main character is a young astronomer working at a mountain observatory, decoding a new signal coming from the stars. It seems simple -a sequence of prime numbers - but every few months the prime number decreases, almost like a countdown. I won\u2019t spoil anything else - that\u2019s just the beginning.</p> <p>For now, I have 4200+ wishlists. Mayak also won a community voted &quot;best art&quot; award in OTK fest.

Defeat enemies with skilled point defense use, a huge assortment of missiles, customizable ships, and fancy equipment like the EMP.</p> <p>On the Starmap, choose which areas to explore, which factions to assist, and which areas to clear out - ever wary of an unexpected ambush!</p> <p>You can customize your ship to fit your playstyle via ship types, modules, and weapon upgrades. So if you want to play a short range brawler that&#39;s great at ramming, you can grab a ramming prow - or if you want to be a hit and run sniper ship, that&#39;s possible too!</p> <p>The game features:</p> <ul> <li>A single-player camp",
