Basically a minimal, centered search bar that lets you search the web, enter a URL, search open tabs, etc.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using Helium lately and missed that feature, and the existing extensions I&#39;ve found are either too busy or don&#39;t behave quite the way I hope.</p> <p>Sadly I&#39;m not a web dev and couldn&#39;t be bothered to learn a ton of Javascript/HTML at the moment, so this started out with me just throwing things at Claude Code and seeing where it could go. So that&#39;s a warning, this is probably 75% vibe-coded.</p> <p>But its at a point where I&#39;m happy with it for my use-case and thought others might like it as well. If you have suggestions, feel free to create issues, fork, whatever you want. Not sure how quickly I&#39;ll get to updating things, but I&#39;ll try.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/ethantheb/command_tab/",

In the realm of open source, do you believe that the use of forks can affect browser security and that it is therefore better to use major browsers that have development teams to maintain browser security?</p> <p>I have been analysing the possibility of using a fork of Chromium (Cromite) and a fork of Firefox (Fennec), but in the end I wondered whether, as these are forks maintained by very few people, the security of the fork could be compromised in code updates that are designed for the main browser and that need to be adapted, if necessary, to the fork, which is usually a personal project or one involving very few people. In addition, the attack surface is expanded by using code that, although open source, is not as closely monitored as that of large projects such as Chromium or Firefox.</p> <p>In summary, what do you think is the optimal balance between security and privacy? </p> <p>Hardened Firefox vs Fennec?, Chromium vs Chromite?........",
