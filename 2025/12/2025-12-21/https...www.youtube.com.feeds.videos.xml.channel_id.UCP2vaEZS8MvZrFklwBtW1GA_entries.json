        "description": "I'm cutting this last tile in the corner. I get four different measurements and score/snap it to snug. It has an expansion joint in the corner and at the shower tray. I'm wearing the Ironclad Command A7 insulated gloves, which are great for outdoor projects and protection from sharp objects. Many thanks to Ironclad for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#tileshower #homerenovation #sponsored",
