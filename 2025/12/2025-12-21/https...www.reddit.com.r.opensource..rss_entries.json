Too slow for a broad firewall rule. Paid APIs: Most had strict rate limits (20-50 RPS) unless you paid huge monthly fees, and they still added network hops. In-Memory Map: Loading 600M+ IPs into a standard Go map ate up 16GB+ RAM. So, I built IPGate.</p> <p>It\u2019s a lightweight Go binary that uses Path-Compressed Tries (via cidranger) to store massive CIDR datasets efficiently.
