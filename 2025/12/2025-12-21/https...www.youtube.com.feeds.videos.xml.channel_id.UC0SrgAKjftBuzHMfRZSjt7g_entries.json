Well, it all goes back to one man: Robert Zemeckis.\n\nMost people know him for the classics we all grew up with\u2014we\u2019re talking about the Back to the Future trilogy and the absolute heart of Forrest Gump. Those movies were massive hits, but Zemeckis wasn't done yet. He wanted to try something that most directors thought was impossible at the time.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019re diving into how he shifted from live-action hits to a total obsession with performance capture animation.\n\nYou know the style\u2014where actors wear those funny suits with dots all over them to bring digital characters to life? It all really started with The Polar Express. We\u2019ll take a look at his \"antecedents\" (where he started) and then walk through all his big swings in animation, from the action in Beowulf to the holiday magic of Jim Carrey\u2019s",
