Our texts, our location, our photos. Right now, that data mostly flows outward. It goes to Big Tech platforms to train models or sell ads.</p> <p>I started wondering... what if that data flow was turned 180 degrees? What if we used AI not to generate content for the world, but to reflect our own patterns back to us?</p> <p>I call this concept &quot;Inward AI.&quot;</p> <p>The problem was that building this is incredibly hard if you actually care about privacy. The easy path is to scrape user data to a cloud server and analyze it there. But I didn&#39;t want to build a surveillance tool. I wanted to build a mirror.</p> <p>So we took the hard path:</p> <p>\u2022 100% On-Device Processing: We use Matrix bridges that run locally on your phone.</p",
