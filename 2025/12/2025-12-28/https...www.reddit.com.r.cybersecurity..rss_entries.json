I\u2019m also planning to pursue BTL1 to gain more hands-on blue team experience.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m struggling with direction more than motivation. I have no prior professional IT experience, and I keep hearing mixed opinions on whether I must start in an entry-level IT role (help desk / IT support) before moving into security \u2014 or if it\u2019s possible to move directly into a junior security or security-adjacent role.</p> <p>My long-term goal is to work in Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) and eventually transition into cloud security. I\u2019ve been experimenting with Microsoft Entra ID and Azure in labs, but I\u2019m not sure how to best turn this into something employers will value.</p> <p>I\u2019m hanging in there and pushing through but any genuine advice is much appreciated :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u",

They were affected by budget cuts and layoffs from DOGE and couldn\u2019t give me a full time offer. I have my Security+, projects, and some hackathon experience. After graduating I received a few contingent offers from other contracting companies however the contracts were not awarded and the positions closed.

Makes some sense but with the advancements in windows defender and similar defense options and (presumably) the need for a virus to actually be opened/run on a pc to cause harm what\u2019s stopping people with a possibly infected system from saving certain files they want to save on an external hard drive and then wiping the pc then plugging in that hard drive and scanning it for viruses before opening or downloading anything off of it</p> <p>Second of all: what\u2019s the benefit to a \u201cfull scan\u201d or \u201coffline scan\u201d if it doesn\u2019t truly make you 100% certain a device is free of malware.</p> <p>Total idiot btw so just give me you guys\u2019 tid bits of cybersecurity knowledge</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/oOVraptorOo\"> /u/oOVraptorOo </a> <br/> <spa",
