Namely, the use of tabs for categories, which made browsing so much more pleasant and smoother. </p> <p>Aggregator News does it, but development seems to be halted and there&#39;s a few limiting factors for me in the UI.</p> <p>Furthermore, what app do you find is actually fast at syncing 100s of feeds? I am not interested in continually syncing, only when I load the app - for me, the fastest is Capy Reader, others I have tried are quite slow.</p> <p>My ideal reader would have:<br/> - Tabbed interface (swipe to change category)<br/> - Fast syncing 100s of feeds<br/> - Shows thumbnails of images in list<br/> - Shows favicons of websites<br/> - Reading view<br/> - Click on article title to open in browser<br/> - Swipe gestures<br/> - Ability to change to custom font<br/> - OPML import </p> <p>Thanks for your suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",
