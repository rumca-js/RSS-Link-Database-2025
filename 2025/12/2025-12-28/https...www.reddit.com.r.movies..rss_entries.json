I loved the colors, the scenes, the writing. It all just had me locked in. It\u2019s been so long since I had a movie keep me interested.</p> <p>There were also like settings or idk how you call it but like characters would be talking and the camera would adjust and you would see the whole Sven and background and it\u2019s like it caused the scene to mean something else. For example on the Nile movie, Hercule and Bouc were talking in some wicker chairs. The camera lowered and it was like they were in cages or a confessional. </p> <p>Overall highly recommend. Only downside was Gal Gadot in the Nile one. Her scenes just kinda fell short for me.

Hard to quantify it in a post but this movie was just really entertaining to me. I feel like it&#39;ll definitely be nostalgic in a few years. Just a cool and novel idea that, to me, was well executed.

I was surprised at how the story broke down in the beginning that made it somewhat confusing, but after watching it all the way through.

I mean, not that I just watch movies all the time, but this was such a good movie. No fluff, no cgi, just a really good movie, with great performances, great storyline and direction. </p> <p>And the whole time I could have sworn I was watching Alicia Silverstone - I never realized her and Meg Ryan looked so much alike. </p> <p>And Billy Crystals jogging outfit was everything, lol. Anywho, if you haven\u2019t seen it, I would recommend that you do. </p> <p>Signed, Better Late Than Never</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hersugarplumfairy\"> /u/hersugarplumfairy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1",
