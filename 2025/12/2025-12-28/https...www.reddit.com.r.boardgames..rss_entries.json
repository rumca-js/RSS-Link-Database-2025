I host a public event which sees people grabbing games to play and while they\u2019re respectful about putting the boxes away correctly, they don\u2019t keep them in the same location of the table they picked them up from, and I don\u2019t really expect this to change nor am I worried about it. </p> <p>We store them in 10 totes and 3 bags, but are in the process of redoing the organization and replacing some totes/bags with larger ones. Each game goes in a specific tote so as to minimize the totes we\u2019re using. </p> <p>Currently we have a spreadsheet of games and which tote/bag they go into. But sometimes people want to stay after game night to help clean up (which is super appreciated). In this case, it\u2019s tough to have them help because it results in us sitting there calling out games while they run",

The aim of the game was to pick a song and sing it using the word on the card. The other people then had to guess what song it was. I\u2019ve been searching for weeks but have had no luck!
