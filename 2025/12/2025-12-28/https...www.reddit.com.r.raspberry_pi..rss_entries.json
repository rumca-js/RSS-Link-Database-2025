I want to put a Poe hat and a case, I&#39;ve seen people recommend the pibow coupe, and I really like the design but on their website they have discontinued it for the 3B+ but for some reason still sell the 3A+ version. Is it still possible to get this now? </p> <p>Now there are several Poe hats and I&#39;d like to have the gpio still usable though so it looks like the official one is out of the question. Waveshare makes some really small ones and I&#39;m not too sure of the quality or which one to use as there are many models that are compatible. If anyone has used these could you tell me if they are any good? </p> <p>I don&#39;t have a fan on it, just an soc heatsink and no issues currently. </p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Universe9096\"> /u/Universe9096 </a",
