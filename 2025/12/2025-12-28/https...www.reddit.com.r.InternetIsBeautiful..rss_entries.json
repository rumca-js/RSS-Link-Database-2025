I spent the last few months building 221B Reboot, a web tool that attempts to do this digitally.</p> <p>What it does: You upload a photo of a personal space (like a desk, a bookshelf, or a hallway), and the engine scans for &quot;trace evidence&quot;\u2014things like specific item placements, wear patterns, or environmental cues. It then generates a logical profile of the &quot;subject&quot; based on those observations.</p> <p>I originally built this to help readers visualize the logic used by the protagonist in my mystery novel, but it\u2019s grown into a standalone experiment in algorithmic observation.</p> <p>I&#39;d love to see how accurate (or hilariously off-base) the deductions are for your setups!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#",
