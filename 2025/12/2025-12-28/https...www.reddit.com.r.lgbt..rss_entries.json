I want to look like the perfect symphony between man and woman. But its really hard, especially when my wardrobe is mostly feminine. (I&#39;m not out to anyone). So I was very surprised one day after school as I was heading home and a little kid stopped me and asked &quot;Are a boy or a girl?&quot; Keep in mind I had braids and earrings on, wearing bellbottoms and overall I thought I looked pretty feminine. But I was so wrong (I think). Believe me when I say I ascended at that moment. I didn&#39;t even know I was nonbinary at the time but damn that felt good. And this isn&#39;t even the first time this happened. Adults have asked me this too but its mostly little children. And the neat part is that since they&#39;re children, I can tell them to just call me a boy (since gender neutral pronouns sadly don&#39;t exist in portuguese), and all is dandy.</p> </div><",
