After a year that ranged from decent to disastrous, it\u2019s tough to argue that \u201cfatigue\u201d isn\u2019t a factor, but true believers are holding firm that next year will change everything. Spider-Man is going back to the streets, Supergirl is poised to build on Superman\u2019s momentum, and all eyes are on Avengers: Doomsday \u2013 the ultimate test of Marvel\u2019s remaining muscle.\nThe stage is set for box office redemption and a new path forward for superhero cinema. It\u2019s the end of the post-post-pandemic era, a once-in-a-generation chance for a fresh start. If they mess this up, the genre might be truly cooked; next year could be the last chance to save comic book movies and shows from their flop era. That\u2019s why we\u2019re looking forward to 2026, the make-or-break year for superhero media.\nOne caveat before we begin: All dates are subject to change. Schedules can and likely will slip, but as far as we know, this is what\u2019s on deck for 2026. So, let\u2019s start with the main ",

        "description": "Red Dead Redemption 2 compared to Mafia: The Old Country - there should be no contest. One is old, one is new, running on the very latest Unreal Engine technology, which promises unprecedented fidelity. So why are people still saying that, from a technical perspective, Red Dead Redemption 2 is still better?\n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 came out 7 years ago, and is still technically impressive the best part of a decade later. It's built around one of the most detailed and immersive world simulations ever conceived, and its narrative chops easily elevate it to Rockstar's best work. It's the closest thing we have to a genuine masterpiece.\n\nBut after 7 years, it should be starting to show its age next to the latest AAA releases. Instead, the internet is awash with damning comparison videos that show, time and time again, that new games just aren't as good as Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nIs that really the case, though? And if so, why? Well... as ever, it's complicated.\n\n#IGN #RedDeadRedemption2 #Maf",
