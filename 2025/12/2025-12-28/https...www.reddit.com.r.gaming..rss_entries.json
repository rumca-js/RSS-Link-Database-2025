Pulling shrapnel from your leg; binding your arm with a bandage; seeing your feet as you slide through the grass or across the hood of your jeep. You could argue that the first-aid bits got old after a while, and I don\u2019t remember being able to look down anytime and see your body (I think only during animations? It\u2019s been a while), but it was all still handled quite well.</p> <p>The first Assassin\u2019s Creed was revolutionary for a few reasons, one being the crowd interaction. You couldn\u2019t just run through crowds like a knife through butter; you had to either dodge the NPCs, push them down (slowing you in the process) or make a careless move and slam into them, being thrown to the ground as a result. I loved that it felt like every character in the game had weight and presence in the world. They completely removed the sense of this in later AC ",
