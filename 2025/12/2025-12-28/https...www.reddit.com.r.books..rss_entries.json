I like the way he told the whole story and how much time he gives some of the lesser known people that were so crucial to the success of the music. </p> <p>Trigger warning though-there are mentions of violence towards women.

The Catholic Church has begun its missionary efforts in Japan. Japan has closed its borders to Christian missionaries and launched a brutal persecution campaign against the local Christian population. Our protagonist ventures into hostile territory to search for his mentor who is rumored to have apostatized and abandoned his faith. This story has always been meaningful to me as it portrays a harrowing tale of religious persecution and what being faithful to God really means. When you contrast this with the often fake persecution narratives perpetuated by modern American Evangelicals, you can\u2019t help but question what genuine Christian faith actually looks like in the face of a culture hostile to that message. </p> <ol> <li>The Peloponnesian War by Donald Kagan</li> </ol> <p>This is the stor",
