I also want there to be a lot of magic, for example Harry Potter didn\u2019t really use his magic much and I want to see more magic happening. I don\u2019t mind romance but I don\u2019t want it to be the main plot line. I also don\u2019t mind it not being magic, but it has to be interesting and not a slice of life, but mystery or action.</p> <p>For Reference: I loved the Academy\u2019s Undercover Professor because the main character is awesome, the power system is fun to learn about, it is complex, it has a more dark theme, magic is used a lot, it uses science to go along with the steampunk imagery, and the school is important to the plot.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t enjoy Harry Potter becaus",

In the midst of looking something up about the series, I discovered an article from December 2021 announcing a TV adaptation of Black Sun, the first book in the series. The only other sources I can find about this are other outlets reporting the announcement around the same time. I keep imagining how awesome it would be to see this story adapted and I really hope they\u2019re still working on it.

The majority of what I read is literary fiction, and if I have to choose some genre fiction, I normally choose sci-fi because it is much, much easier to find this particular something that scratches my unscratchable itch. We&#39;ll get to it in a second.</p> <p>Secondly I would like to say that this is all my own personal preference, applicable to me only, I&#39;m not trying to degrade things other people enjoy; other people, if they exist, are allowed to enjoy the things that bring them enjoyment. Daddy&#39;s just talking about daddy here.</p> <p>Over the last few years I&#39;ve noticed a trend in fantasy reddit, nerd spaces, and in the general culture that I call a &quot;goodness obsession&quot;. My basic understanding of this is that we now want all the actors, singers, and novelists to be &quot;good people&quot",

I like dark fantasy with complex characters who leave a trail of destruction in their wake, but I don&#39;t like it when they address sensitive topics in a morbid way (for example, abuse).Here is the dilemma: in many books I have noticed that fantasy is limited by the human condition. I don&#39;t like extreme anthropocentrism.Therefore, I&#39;m specifically looking for a book that deals with plots and characters that transcend these boundaries. It&#39;s not fantasy per se, but I enjoy hermann hesse, His characters address both sides of the binary, with descriptions that mentioned their masculine and feminine nature.So, the more inhuman the characters are, both in culture and appearance, the better. Bonus point: if the book has a romance aspect and the love interest is androgynous, their gender doesn&#39;t really matter. If it looks like a questionable and somewhat terrifying ver",

EotV is one of my favourite books of all time (yes, I know its not perfect, but I love none the less) and Book 2 was amazing, too. So it really hurt, when the final couldnt deliver. </p> <p>90% of Book 3 were Ok, with a lot of interesting moments and developments.

Not really, but I still felt with Gabe and it hurt my heart. </p> <p>Then came the final fight",
