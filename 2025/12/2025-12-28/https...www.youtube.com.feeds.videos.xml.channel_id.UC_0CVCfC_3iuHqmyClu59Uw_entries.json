        "description": "Testing Intel\u2019s very last NUC laptop\u2014the Intel NUC X15\u2014a reference design Intel made right before the NUC division shut down. I grabbed this one used on eBay as a cheaper way to get a premium-feeling gaming laptop, cleaned it up, dropped in a 2TB M.2 SSD, and then put it through benchmarks + real gameplay to see if it\u2019s still worth buying at the end of 2025 going into 2026.\nThis unit is running an Intel i7-11800H (8C/16T), 32GB DDR4, and an RTX 3070 Laptop GPU (up to 125W Dynamic Boost, 8GB VRAM) with a 15.6\u201d 2560\u00d71440 165Hz display. Benchmarks were solid for the price\u2014but in newer games the VRAM limit and CPU temps can show up fast, and there\u2019s also a big downside: Intel\u2019s NUC Laptop Control Center no longer works, which means no easy fan control on a machine that can hit thermal throttle.\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Black Friday Sale code for software\uff1aETA \nWindows 11 Pro Key($23):",
