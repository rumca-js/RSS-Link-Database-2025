Ive noticed that so, so so many videos and posts on social media use chatgpt for scripting and writing post info. The AI generated photos and videos are bad, but at least they are getting called out for it. Chatgpt has this structure it sticks to, and a certain candence to its text, that I pick up on almost immediately. But no one seems to care about it! Now, I hear it in radio ads, commercials on tv, and even in the way some people talk. It is concerning how quickly its plagued everything. I miss hearing people actually talk about things, show they are actually interested and not just pumping out content for views. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/eating_raspberry_pie\">",

If you extrapolate from there, that means everything else they\u2019re giving you also probably has those same slight errors from what I understand the way LLM\u2018s are built to hallucinations will always be a problem. There is no new version that will eliminate the hallucinations. </p> <p>With that in mind I\u2019ve been thinking is all the AI hype for curing cancer, reducing medical costs, and solving the world\u2019s biggest problems and and making the world this utopian place hinged on LLM\u2019s improving so drastically you can ask them to cure cancer and they\u2019re gonna figure it out.
