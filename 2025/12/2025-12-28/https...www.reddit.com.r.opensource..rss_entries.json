I know there are definitely benefits like community assistance but I also plan on monetizing it in the future in case it were to take off (with ads and subscriptions) and was unsure whether open-sourcing it would be beneficial or perhaps detrimental.

The PR was rejected because it conflicted with a feature of another project of the author. He explicitly marked the FR as &quot;not planned&quot;. I\u2019ve told him that I\u2019ll continue with this change in a fork. He wasn\u2019t objecting to that. After that, during a period of roughly two months, I added a couple of unique features and was frequently merging upstream into my fork (merging also became more difficult with time). And because I put quite a lot of effort into the fork, also complying with the GPL-3.0 license, I started to think about making a public release. I\u2019ve reached out to the author to see what he was thinking about it. I\u2019ve tried to be friendly, but the farther the discussion went, the stranger his behavior became. At first, he said that he had stabilized his features, and now we can work together on merging my fork. I asked hi",

Just building, fixing, and shipping.</p> <p>What makes me happiest is seeing it help others who are just starting their open-source contribution journey.</p> <p>If you want to try it: <a href=\"https://www.issuefinder.fun/\">Issuefinder.fun</a></p> <p>I\u2019m open to all feedback, favours, and suggestions \u2014 good or bad.
