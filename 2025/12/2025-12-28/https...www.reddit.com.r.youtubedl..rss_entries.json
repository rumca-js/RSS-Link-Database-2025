It served me well for awhile, but unfortunately yt-dlp switching to AV1 by default has thrown a wrench in the works: for some reason playing any AV1 video with Kodi causes it to immediately crash and I have no idea why, so I have to watch a lot of my more recent downloads with VLC (which works fine on the Pi, go figure). This is all a bit ridiculous. How do those of you deeper into this watch your videos? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AnyKey19\"> /u/AnyKey19 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/comments/1pxh8me/how_do_you_watch_your_video_collection/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/comments/1pxh8me/how_do_you_watch_your_video_collection/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I know that yt-dlp prefers AV1 in this case, but what is the basis for this choice? Is AV1 actually slightly better quality than VP9, \u200b\u200bor is there no difference in quality, and yt-dlp chooses AV1 because it takes up less space?
