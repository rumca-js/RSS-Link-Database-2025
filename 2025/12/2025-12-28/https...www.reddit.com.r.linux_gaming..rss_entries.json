Now on Fedora Workstation however, the slightest movement on the mouse wheel is picked up and moves throughout my loadout.

I have an AMD CPU and a 4070Ti. </p> <p>On System76&#39;s website, they state that every program working on Ubuntu will work on Pop_OS!. Is it enough to say that it is an Ubuntu-based distro? </p> <p>I have a 8BitDo Ultimate controller which works thanks to a dongle, is it supposed to work out-the-box on Linux too? </p> <p>Thanks to anyone who gives me a piece of advice. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nayero\"> /u/Nayero </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1pxnx6q/questions_about_pop_os/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1pxnx6q/questions_about_pop_os/\">[comment",

However, when I decided to play Borderlands 2 with my controller, I noticed this bug. I checked my in-game controls; the same as always. I checked my Steam Input bindings to see if that was the issue, because bl2 doesn&#39;t have native support for Switch controllers, but those were also unchanged. Nothing points to a personal error as being the issue here, and this had never happened while my laptop was running Windows 10. </p> <p>There&#39;s really not much else I can do to troubleshoot this. Has anyone else seen this before? How might I rectify this issue?</p",
