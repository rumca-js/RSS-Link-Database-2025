        "description": "Forspoken's poor commercial response has never sat right with us. It was a game that did a great job of bringing its world to life with its excellent visuals, while making your way through that world is a stunning showcase of what current-gen hardware can achieve. \n\nIts story wasn't too bad either. But a few lines taken out of context, robbed the game of the chance it needed to prove itself, and its developers suffered the consequences as a result. \n\nJoin us as we take a look at one of modern gaming's bittersweet tales, and attempt to give one of this generation's underrated titles its due. We might even convince you to give this one a shot.",

Nevertheless, 2025 is chock-full of new stealth experiences, from follow-ups to familiar franchises to long-missed legends. \n\nThe sheer range and variety this year, with different perspectives, settings, and gameplay mechanics, is pretty incredible.
