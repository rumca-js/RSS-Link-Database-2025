I have used Django a fair amount and I have gotten comfortable with its concepts and generally the way it works. Recently, I started a small project with the aim of learning FastAPI (and a fewDevOps concepts). I really like the async first approach of FastAPI for things like web sockets, background tasks, etc, but I can\u2019t help but feel that there is way too much work and babysitting you have to do in order to get a good project structure and maintain it. I have used SpringBoot before and to me, FastAPI felt like SpringBoot without the ease that auto-configuration provides. Does anyone else feel the same? If anyone has a go-to project structure/boilerplate setup for FastAPI that makes it somewhat similar to Django or makes it easier to build maintenance functionality please share.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hadiz1\"> /u/hadiz1 </a> <br/> <spa",
