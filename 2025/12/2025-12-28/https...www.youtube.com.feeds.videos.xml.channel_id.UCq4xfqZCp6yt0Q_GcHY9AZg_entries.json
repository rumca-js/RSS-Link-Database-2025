        "description": "#cinematography #martysupreme #movies \n\nMovies are finally starting to look like movies again, and Marty Supreme is proof. This video is all about why this film hits so hard visually, from the way it was shot to how the world inside the frame was built and designed. I break down the look of the movie, the long lens style, the tight close ups, the gritty atmosphere, and why the cinematography feels so raw and intense. I also talk about the production design and how the spaces, locations, storefronts, and tiny details make the world feel real, lived in, and loaded with character.\n\nI also had the chance to talk with legendary production designer Jack Fisk about building the world of Marty Supreme and what goes into creating environments that actually support performance and story instead of just sitting in the background.\nWatch my full chat with Jack Fisk: https://youtu.be/JXq5hUWpj7k\n\nThis is the kind of filmmaking that feels tactile and grounded, and honestly it gives me a lot of hope ",
