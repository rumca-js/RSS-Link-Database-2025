        "description": "He was called \u201cThe Einstein of Brain Science.\u201d\nA neuroscientist whose ideas quietly reshaped how we understand the mind, perception, and reality itself.\n\nIn this talk, he doesn\u2019t speculate. He demonstrates.\n\nWhat he shows challenges one of our deepest assumptions: that reality is simply out there, waiting to be perceived.\n\nDecades ahead of his time, Karl Pribram proposed a model of the brain so radical that it forced science to reconsider what perception actually is, and where reality truly comes from.\n\n\n\nThis work is powered by those who resonate with it. - buymeacoffee.com/videoadvice\nThank you for being part of the journey.\n________________________________________________________________________\nFollow us: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/videoadvice\nhttps://www.instagram.com/videoadvice2025\n________________________________________________________________________\nScript and Narration by Video Advice\nFootage provided by MotionArray \nMusic provided by Epidemic Sound and Artlist\nReferences u",
