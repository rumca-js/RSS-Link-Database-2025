These nuclear-capable weapons can reach the United States and threaten U.S. allies across the Pacific, including Japan and South Korea.<br /><br />At the same time, China is refusing to engage in arms control or denuclearization talks, despite warnings that its nuclear stockpile could exceed 1,000 warheads by 2030. This comes amid repeated nuclear threats against Japan, rising tensions over Taiwan, and growing fears that the CCP is preparing for a major regional\u2014or even global\u2014conflict.<br /><",
