        "description": "I'm repairing a copper pinhole leak using two SharkBite fittings. Unfortunately, the leak was under a joist. So I cut the copper pipe a few inches to the left and right. The SharkBite 3/4 inch coupling and ball valve made this an easy fix, especially in such a tight space. Many thanks to SharkBite for sponsoring this tutorial",
