Hundreds of people contacted me saying this was the app they have been waiting for. It was heartwarming.

I wanted a way to chat with a friend that was truly ephemeral\u2014no central servers, no logs, and no metadata trail left behind and ofcourse terminal based .</p> <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Host Mode:</strong> It launches its own isolated Tor instance and creates a temporary Hidden Service. It generates a one-time <code>chat://</code> invite URL with a random token.</li> <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Uses ChaCha20-Poly1305 (AEAD) for end-to-end encryption.</li> <li><strong>Ephemeral:</strong> As soon as you close the app, the private keys and the <code>.onion</code> address are wiped from the temp directory. It\u2019s like the chat never existed.</li> </ul> <p>I just packaged it as an <strong>AppImage</strong> to make it easier to run on Linux without messing with dependencies.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ch",

It was a huge boost for her business and was a incredibly helpful launch pad</p> <p>I wanted to capture this idea and create a place where vendors and hosts could connect. My first host is a boba shop and we&#39;ve completed 3 popups in December with makers who I found through another maker faire - mostly selling stickers, pins, etc. I thought it was a good fit because of the holiday gifting season and the target market seemed similar - high school/college students on a budget. </p> <p>Monetization model is based on bookings. Planning to onboard more cafes, bakeries, flower shops, gyms, and other high traffic retail locations. </p> <p>Would love feedback, criticism, leads for venues",

Wanted to share my journey building PromptSudo.</p> <p><strong>The problem I solved:</strong> Working with AI daily, I kept losing great prompts in chat history. Copying prompts between tools was tedious. There was no &quot;IDE for prompts.&quot;</p> <p><strong>What I built:</strong> PromptSudo - a professional prompt management platform</p> <p><strong>Key features:</strong> - Multi-model support (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Midjourney, etc.) - Smart variables &amp; templates - Testing laboratory for A/B testing prompts - Version history - n8n workflow generator</p> <p><strong>Monetization:</strong> Freemium model - 5 free daily credits, paid plans for power users</p> <p><strong>Lessons learned:</strong> 1. The &quot;Testing Lab&quot; feature drove most upgrades 2. n8n integration brought unexpected organic traffic 3. Free tier is crucial for trust-building</p> <p>Happy to answer questions about tech stack, growth, or features!</p> <p>\ud83d\udd17 <a hr",
