        "description": "Donald Trump and Ukraine\u2019s leader Volodymyr Zelensky have described their latest meeting in Florida as \u201cterrific\u201d and said significant progress had been made.  President Trump said a peace deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine was \u201cvery close\u201d. \n\nSpeaking after the meeting, President Zelensky said the 20-point peace plan was 90% agreed, while Donald Trump said a security guarantee was \u201cclose to 95%\u201d done.  Zelensky said that was a \u201ckey milestone in achieving a lasting peace\u201d in Ukraine.\n\nHowever the US President also said \u201cone or two very thorny issues\u201d remained to be settled.   These include the future of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, which Russia\u2019s President Putin has laid claim to.    Trump confirmed that issue was unresolved although he said agreement was getting closer.\n\nNotably, Trump and Zelensky did not offer any timelines, instead vowing to have their teams meet again in the coming weeks.\n\nClive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Sean Dilley in Washington and Sam",
