        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I started using vaultwarden few days ago after moving away from dashlane. Everything worked good except lack of emails ( needed them for emergency access and email verification and probably more). Though there were few services offering few plans for smtp like zoho, mailchamp but I wanted redundancy. I thought it would be obvious that vaultwarden would have support for multiple smtp servers but it didn&#39;t. So here is smtp-mux. Works with vaultwarden ( I am using it in my setup already), and best part is routing logic is pluggable. I&#39;ve now connected gmail, zoho and sendgrid - so in case any one of them fails I still receive my emails. Everything is open source and freely available for the community. This is my small contribution to community members who host their own vaultwarden</p> <p>repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/goyal-aman/smtpmux/\">https://github.com/goyal-aman/smtpmux/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",

Since I bought it second hand it didnt come with any storage disk, so I hooked up an old 512 gb external ssd running windows 10 pro on it headless via RDP. </p> <p>My intention with this was to run a MetaTrader5 Trading-Bot on it 24/5 and a few docker containers like paperless-ngx, immich and maybe jellyfin. </p> <p>After installing everything, today I realized that Windows 10 closes all processes after disconnecting from my Remote-Desktop Session. This renders my setup useless since none of the docker images are available when I am not connected to the Remote-Session..</p> <p>So, as someone who is new to the self hosting scene I am asking: </p> <p>- How would I ensure a 24/7 uptime for my Mini-PC Setup and the docker containers that it is running? </p> <p>-How do you guys use your Mini-PC Setups?</p> <p>Thanks in ad",
