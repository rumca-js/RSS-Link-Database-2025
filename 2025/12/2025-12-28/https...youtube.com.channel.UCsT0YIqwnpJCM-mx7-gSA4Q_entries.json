        "description": "Deafness is often seen as a disability, but after being raised by two Deaf adults, Matthew Cooper doesn\u2019t view his parents as disabled. Instead, he views Deaf people as a marginalized culture that needs recognition. This change of viewpoint paves the way for true inclusion and equity. \n\nBorn in Tulsa to Deaf parents, Matthew Cooper grew up in a family active in the local Deaf community. Like many CODAs (Children Of Deaf Adults), he grew away from the Deaf community but eventually found his way back through life events. After graduating from Oklahoma State University, his teaching career began with middle school science.\n\nIn 2017, he became an adjunct instructor teaching American Sign Language at Tulsa Community College. From there, he transitioned to teaching high school ASL, and in 2022, he accepted a full-time position at the University of Tulsa. He is currently in his eighth year with TCC and his third year at TU. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference forma",
