Our communication is like I\u2019ve never had in a relationship and I can truly see myself being with her for the rest of my life. I\u2019ve had a past of some not so healthy relationships (not anything crazy but not the best). Because of this, I\u2019d love some book recommendations on general healthy relationships. How to be a good partner, learning more about communication, really anything! I\u2019d really like to set myself up for success in our relationship, so any books that might be a good read would be great! </p> <p>I\u2019m okay with any suggestions (even just books with some characters with healthy relationships) but if it feels too much like a textbook I might have a harder time getting through it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Message-Agitated\"> /u/Message-Agitated </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestion",

Mostly thanks to the Karl May and his books Winnetou but also due to the tramping movement in the 70s. Basically people who fled the regime control cities time to time to spend time in the woods and they idolized westerns, country and indians. Altough this era is gone, I was still influenced by it and since representation of natives in Karl May books is not very accurate, I would like you to recommend to me a book. I don&#39;t care if its fiction as long as represents the life of indians, customs and culture accurately. I would prefer it to have story, but will be glad for a good science book as well. I read The White Fang by Jack London and really liked it, so if you could add a comment about this authors accuracy, I would be very happy.
