        "description": "Tiny lab-grown brains are offering an unprecedented look at how schizophrenia and bipolar disorder disrupt neural activity. Researchers found distinct electrical firing patterns that could identify these conditions with high accuracy. The discovery opens the door to more precise diagnoses and personalized drug testing. Instead of guessing medications, doctors may one day see what works before treating the patient.",

        "description": "Scientists have uncovered why big predators like sharks spend so much time in the ocean\u2019s twilight zone. The answer lies with mid-sized fish such as the bigscale pomfret, which live deep during the day and rise at night to feed, linking deep and surface food webs. Using satellite tags, researchers tracked these hard-to-study fish for the first time. Their movements shift with water clarity, potentially altering entire ocean food chains.",

A new theoretical study shows how neutrons inside future fusion reactors could spark rare reactions that produce axions, particles long suspected to exist but never observed. The work revisits an idea teased years ago on The Big Bang Theory, where fictional physicists couldn\u2019t solve the puzzle. This time, real scientists think they\u2019ve found a way.",

        "description": "Weight loss restored healthy metabolism in both young and mid-aged mice, but the brain told a different story. In mid-aged animals, slimming down actually worsened inflammation in a brain region tied to appetite and energy balance. While this inflammation eventually subsided, brain inflammation has been linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease. The results suggest that weight loss in midlife may not be as straightforward as once thought.",

Scientists analyzed decades of research and found little reliable evidence that popular approaches like probiotics, acupuncture, or music therapy truly work. Alarmingly, safety was often ignored, with many treatments never properly evaluated for side effects. The researchers stress that looking at the full body of evidence matters far more than trusting a single hopeful study.",

Their absence hints that climate-driven oxygen loss could unravel entire whale-fall ecosystems.",
