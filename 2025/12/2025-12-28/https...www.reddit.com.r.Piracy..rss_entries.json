But if the site is like specifically about coding tutorials, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m looking for.</p> <p>NOT udemy as that content is generally low quality or introductory imo.

These are datum that are usually used for research purposes only. They can sometimes be data that resulted from a research study, which people can analyze in other studies (e.g. corpora). In other cases, they can be a set of materials which other can download and implement to their research. In any case, published datasets are also subject to similar processes to journal articles (e.g. <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ft66667-000\">International Affective Picture System</a>); they both require approval to be published, and they both are attached to a DOI when published.

So, I have a Real Debrid plan which I use along with stremio on my phone and laptop, and since Stremio dosent exist for xbox, I was wondering which the next best option or a good alternative option. I tried Kodi with addons, but it&#39;s such a hit or miss. Kodi isn&#39;t optimised for xbox, and it has the worst controls I have seen in a while. And also, the app is clanky, and also, sometimes it doesn&#39;t even work, and crashes 5-6 times before finally working. I&#39;m not trying to trash-talk kodi, as I love it and have used it as my main before switching to stremio, but the truth is, Kodi isn&#39;t for xbox. Maybe it&#39;s my older hardware&#39;s problem, but im just trying to see if there is anyway to put my xbox to use, as i don&#39;t play games anymore</p> <p>And as always, thanks in advance to anyone that helps in anyways, because it means a lot\u2764\ufe0f<",

From what I&#39;ve learnt the sites themselves dont hold content but are a front for movies hosted on servers. Based on that I had a couple of questions: </p> <ol> <li><p>Best place to buy and base the servers? I was thinking iceland or switzerland for their security.</p></li> <li><p>Do I need to manually download and upload each pirated movie to the designated server?</p></li> <li><p>Was thinking of buying safe domains like .ru or .su which are harder to get prosecuted. Any other staples that I missed out on? </p></li> </ol> <p>As it is I&#39;m living in a Global South country where anti-piracy laws are weakly implemented so I dont have the fear of being prosecuted for this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheIglooBoy\"> /u/TheIglooBoy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1pxe2oe/how_do_i_set_up_a_pirat",
