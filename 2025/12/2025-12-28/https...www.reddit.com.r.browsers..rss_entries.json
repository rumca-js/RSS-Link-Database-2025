From my personal experience, I can only really talk about Opera GX and Brave. Both are solid and have some interesting features. The downside of Opera GX is that it sometimes doesn\u2019t support certain extensions (like Pricy) and honestly, the addblocker feels useless more like it\u2019s there for looks than for actual blocking. As for Brave, I haven\u2019t used it for very long (about 2 months), but overall it\u2019s been good. The only issue I\u2019ve noticed is an occasional bug where Brave freezes for a few seconds and all the tabs start glitching.

I like it a lot because of the organization (integrated Spotify, tab islands, etc.), but it is kind of a battery drainer, so I want to see if there&#39;s anything else out there that&#39;s better. I know Safari is the best for a MacBook, but it has such an awful interface and no organization, so I cannot bring myself to use it. Any recommendations/reviews for other optimal browsers for organization and still good for battery? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ambitious_Bee_7452\"> /u/Ambitious_Bee_7452 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1pxg766/help_me_pick_a_new_browser/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1pxg766/help_me_pick_a_new_browser/\">[comments]</a></span>",
