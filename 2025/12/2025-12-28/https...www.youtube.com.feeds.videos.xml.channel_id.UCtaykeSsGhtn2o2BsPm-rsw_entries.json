For 10% off your first purchase, go to: http://squarespace.com/makesomething\n\nPatreon members get Fusion 360 files, early and ad-free videos, my custom finish, behind the scenes videos, as well as access to our private Discord: https://www.patreon.com/picciuto\n\nThis workshop breaks every rule, carpeted floors, hidden tools, no exposed ductwork. And it\u2019s all intentional! This isn\u2019t a space designed for maximum efficiency, it\u2019s designed for comfort, creativity, and wanting to be here. In this video, I walk through my shop, talk about why I made these choices, when efficiency actually matters, and how the environment you work in quietly shapes the way you think and create.\n\n\u2605 TOOLS / SUPPLIES (affiliate links) \u2605\nVacuum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nod36fAVvNs\nDust Collectors (similar): https://amzn.to/42eCZhw\nCyclone: https://amzn.to/4je20lD\nDisc Sander: https://amzn.to/3E2lMvv\nRyobi Belt Sander: https://amzn",
