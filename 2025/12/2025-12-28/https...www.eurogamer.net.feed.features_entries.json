Raw power went aside with the Wii, but the company's dedication to tinkering around the edges to create stand-out original experiences in other ways remained - or perhaps even intensified. There's been a lot of examples over the years, of course, from clever game design innovations to zany peripherals - but <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza\">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has to be one of the finest showcases of that thinking from Nintendo in years.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-might-not-be-the-best-game-of-the-year-but-its-surely-the-one-i-loved-the-most\">Read more</a></",

It's not a spoiler so much as a contaminator, a finger on the scales of something it'll feel wonderful to go into unweighted. So go away right now if you want to experience it for yourself.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2025-despelote\">Read more</a></p>",
