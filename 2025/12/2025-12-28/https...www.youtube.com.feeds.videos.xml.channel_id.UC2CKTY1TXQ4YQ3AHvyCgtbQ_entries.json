I'll talk about plans and changes for the channel, what I want to do with my hobby in 2026 - and what you want to do next year, too. I'll talk about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards - miniatures-agnostic necromantic skirmish combat at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com\n\nI'm a member of The Army Painter Factory Team - and I'm passing the savings on to you!
