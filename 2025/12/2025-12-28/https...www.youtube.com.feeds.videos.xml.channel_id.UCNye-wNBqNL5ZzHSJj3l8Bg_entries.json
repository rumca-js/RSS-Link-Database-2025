        "description": "Brigitte Bardot, the French actor and singer who became a global sensation before reinventing herself as an animal protection campaigner and outspoken supporter of the far right, has died aged 91.\nThe Brigitte Bardot Foundation announced her death on Sunday, saying \u201cwith immense sadness\u201d that its founder and president had died.\nBardot rose to international fame in 1956 with her role in And God Created Woman, a film that sought to project female sexuality on screen. She went on to appear in about 50 films, becoming one of the most recognisable faces of post-war French cinema.\nIn the early 1970s, Bardot quit acting at the height of her fame, turning her attention to animal protection. While her campaigning earned admiration from supporters, her public life grew increasingly controversial as she embraced far-right politics and made repeated racist and inflammatory remarks.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Natacha Butler looks back on her life and career.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe",
