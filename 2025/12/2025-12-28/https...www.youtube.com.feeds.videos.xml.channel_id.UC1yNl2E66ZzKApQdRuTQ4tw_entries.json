Stay fully informed on events around the world with Ground News.\n\nHuman brains are roughly 100,000 times more energy-efficient than current AI systems. So why don\u2019t we build computers using human brain cells? Don\u2019t worry, researchers are one step ahead of you there \u2013 different teams across the globe are racing to develop neuron computers; processors that integrate living brain neurons into their chips. Let\u2019s take a look at how this technology is developing and when we might see brain cells chips in the future.\n\nPaper 1: https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273%2822%2901033-9\nPaper 2: hhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1376042/full\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.pa",
