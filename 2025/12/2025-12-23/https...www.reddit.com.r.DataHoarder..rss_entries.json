My goal was to rip all of them since I only have space for them in my storage unit. From searching around, this sub recommends torrenting the equivalent of your dvds, which sounds much easier. Some of the obscure older discs don\u2018t have existing torrents, so what is best practice for ripping maybe ~50 discs?</p> <p>I\u2019m new to this, but have been slowly assembling a used parts special in a rsv4000 with 5tb redundant across 4 drives, with an old 5.25\u201d bluray that was supposedly good in its day for ripping. I\u2019ll probably need to add ~25 tb for this collection in total? Also what software stack is best here? I\u2019ve heard proxmox and handbrake are good places to start.

A big part of it would not be technically legally distributable even if done not for profit (like some random recorded community TV bits, abandonware videogames, etc.).

Well, the way I see it, there is no way to access this &quot;lost-media&quot; even if someone was well-intentioned and was willing to pay the original distributors (if there even is someone left to pay...).

Not a perfect one, just something sustainable that reduces exposure over time and limits future damage. Do you focus more on cleaning up old data, changing how you sign up going forward, or isolating your real contact info completely. Curious what actually works in practice and not just in theory.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Objective-House-6760\"> /u/Objective-House-6760 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www",

For all the movies and TV series that I have curated over the years, I keep them offline in 3 x 20TB drives. All drives have a duplicate copy, so a total of six drives, but usable space of three drives.</p> <p>I found the Orico HS500-Pro in a local shop, asking for $380. I was thinking if I should get it. I can use 5 x 20TB drive in RAID5 and move all my movies and TV series there. I will have 4 x 20TB worth of space which is 20TB more than current setup and have redundancy, and a 20TB drive free.</p> <p>But obviously this is not a Synology or QNAP, and I do not know how good it is.

These are 10 or so pages each with fold out wiring diagrams, board views, BOM, and other repair details.</p> <p>I plan to make these available for free after getting them scanned, but I am not really sure where to begin. What services are good, which aren&#39;t.</p> <p>I personally do not have the time or motivation to do this work myself but I recognize the value of these service manuals. Most of them are not available online or hidden behind expensive paywalls for an &quot;unknown&quot; product which may not be your actual device.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chasesan\"> /u/chasesan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ptgpwt/digitization_services_for_old_service_manuals/",
