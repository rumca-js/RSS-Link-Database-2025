It can now be applied even if Israel is not under a state of emergency.\nIn May 2024, Israel shut down Al Jazeera operations in the country, weeks after the law was passed by the Knesset.\nThe law gave the prime minister and communications minister the authority to order the closure of foreign networks operating in Israel and confiscate their equipment if it was believed they posed \u201charm to the state\u2019s security\u201d. \nThe closure of Al Jazeera's bureau has been widely criticised.\n\nAkiva Eldar is a political analyst.
