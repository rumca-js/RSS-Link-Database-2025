I\u2019m not looking for step-by-step instructions or anything that crosses ethical or legal lines\u2014I\u2019m trying to move past script-kiddie usage and build the right mental model for how modern authentication protections and defenses interact with this class of tooling. If you\u2019ve gone through that learning curve, I\u2019d appreciate pointers to high-level resources, talks, or research that helped you understand the space without relying on copy-paste guides.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#",
