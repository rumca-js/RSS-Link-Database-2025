Recently, wormholes have been making a lot of headlines. Let\u2019s take a look at a few recently-published wormhole papers and figure out why wormholes are important for physics today.\n\nPaper 1: https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07831\nPaper 2: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/btw6-44ry\nPaper 3: https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07486\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Au",
