I personally like archlinux so much. I tried Kde Plasma in Arch linux and switched to hyperland. I created my own first rice, and I faced a problem. I couldn&#39;t maintain the updates and syntax changes, which is not reliable so I switch to fedora which really good distro but in fedora I initially tried with gnome desktop which good but I don&#39;t like it very much then I found COSMIC DE I love that DE so much even though it crashed lot of time initially I managed and now it&#39;s run really good but I has to improve it self a lot. </p> <p>The COSMIC desktop carsh complete oru the screen turned black I don&#39;t know how to resolve such an issue",

Yet, it is exactly that &quot;secondary&quot; hardware that makes life better. Next to our set of offices sit a fine IT company (merry folk, love them), that has a rather large number of regular office clients under their care. Most of the time, when Excel stops running as smoothly as it used to on the first day, or the system feels sluggish and all that, it is easier, faster and cheaper in the end (for these great folks) to just get a new office PC for the client, set it up and take the older box away. These used boxes are then cannibalized for parts (no one really knows why, actually, just a prudent thing to do) and then stacked in a huge room behind their own office forever. Once in a blue moon, they can&#39;t fit the newly arrived old box inside",

Mint primarily relies on APT and the Ubuntu/Debian repositories, but it also provides Flatpak integration out of the box and increasingly leans on Snaps through compatibility layers. This raises interesting questions about software availability, system stability, and dependency management.</p> <p>How do you balance using native APT packages versus Flatpaks or Snaps in Mint? Do you run into issues with library conflicts, theming inconsistencies, or update management? Have recent Mint releases improved the workflow for integrating multiple package formats, or is it still a manual balancing act? I\u2019d love to hear your strategies for maintaining a clean, stable system while having access to the latest software.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Raw_Rain\"> /u/Raw_Rain </a> <br/> <",
