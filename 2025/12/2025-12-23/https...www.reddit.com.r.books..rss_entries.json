Some type of non fiction that will teach me something about a subject. Doesn&#39;t have to be boring. Right now I&#39;m reading a memoir from one of my favorite bands members.</p> <p>3 - Fun!

As it comes to an end, I found myself reflecting, replaying so many failures, and thinking about purpose and meaning. So I asked a few people what they\u2019d recommend if someone wanted to read a book about the meaning of life, fiction or nonfiction.</p> <p>The suggestions were predictable...and weren&#39;t: Man\u2019s Search for Meaning, The Alchemist, The Stranger, The Midnight Library, The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, The Happiness Trap, and other philosophical and spiritual books by authors like Ram Dass, Alan Watts, Eckhart Tolle, Marcus Aurelius and other Stoics, and so on.</p> <p>Of the ones I read, a short one was quite interesting and I like to mention it because it has stayed with me, or the main ideas have. I&#39;m talking about Albert Camus\u2019s The Myth of Sisyphus.</p> <p>Camus begins from the premise that life has no inherent meaning, and this fact creates what he famously calls \u201cthe absurd.\u201d The absurd isn\u2019t that",

It\u2019s a nice spin on a very classic fairy tale trope, the kind that feels familiar in a comforting way without being stale. The whole book has this warm, gentle tone that makes it easy to sink into. Nothing overly grim or exhausting, just an enjoyable, well-paced read.</p> <p>The biggest comparison I kept coming back to was Howl\u2019s Moving Castle. That same whimsical, slightly oddball magic, charming characters, and fairy-tale logic where things just work because they feel right. If you like stories that lean more toward atmosphere and charm than high-stakes chaos, this fits perfectly.</p> <p>I genuinely enjoyed my time with it, but let\u2019s be real, Cornelious the Cat absolutely stole the show. Easily my favorite character, no contest.</p> <p>If you\u2019re looking for something cozy, magical, and pleasant, especially if you love fairy tale r",
