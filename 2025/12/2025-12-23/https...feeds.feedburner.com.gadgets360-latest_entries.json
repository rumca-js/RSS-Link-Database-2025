The music streaming service made the move after Anna's Archive, an open-source library, highlighted in a blog post that it had discovered a way to scrape Spotify at scale. As a result of this, the group said it has managed to scrape about 86 million music files, representing nearly 99.6 percent of Spotify's streams, of a total file size of a little under 300TB.",
