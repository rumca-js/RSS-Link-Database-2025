I&#39;m sure there are retro examples as well, although I could only think of a few:</p> <ul> <li>Alien 3 (Ripley dies in the SNES version, but I think she lives in the NES game)</li> <li>Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein (not explicitly stated, but the SNES credits sequence matches the final shot of the movie)</li> <li>Castlevania 2: Simon&#39;s Quest (possible endings where Simon dies)</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;m not thinking so much of RPGs where like, one out of many party members gets killed (let alone the old arguments about whether Crono &quot;really&quot; died!) nor an NPC like the baby metroid at the end of Super Metroid.

What do ya\u2019ll think of using these as compared to things like the Advantage or Max controllers? I much prefer the OG controller over both the Advantage and Max. Max has terrible button placement imo and the Advantage is, well, a joystick. Joystick can be good for some games I guess but those generally aren\u2019t my jam. Anyone think turbo is legit for beating games or is it cheating? Take Gradius for example: you can unlock turbo shooting if you collect an upgrade when you have a certain score. It takes a bit of skill, but nothing crazy. Would you consider it cheating to just use turbo from the beginning?</p> ",

Today I picked up a sega master system 2 for \u00a340 (I think it was a bargain because I see prices ranging all the time so not really sure) the console works perfectly fine no issues whatsoever but the official PSU makes a really REALLY loud buzzing sound. (similar to what a stalled motor makes if you have heard one of those before) I was wondering if there was a way to fix it because I like having the original cables and accessories for my retro consoles and I would rather not put my money and trust into some sketchy PSU from Amazon. Any help would be appreciated thanks! Note: it happens no matter of the console is on , off or the cable is unplugged. And yes it\u2019s plugged into a regular wall outlet not a power strip. Ive tried many method like plugging it in horizontally instead of vertically but this only seems to make it louder.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alarmed-Bluebird416\"> /",
