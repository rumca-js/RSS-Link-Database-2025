My exwife converted to Assembly of God right before our divorce and now I&#39;m worried about my kids.</p> <p>In fact I believe it was her conversion to AOG that caused the divorce. I&#39;m fairly confident they told her to divorce me. She has fallen DEEP into the cult like church.</p> <p>When we married at 22 she was Pagan and I was Agnostic. We had three kids together. Fast forward to 34 and she started going to a Baptist church. I said it was fine, you do you, but I have NO interest in it. Then at 35 she started going to an AOG church. This is where things got really bad.</p> <p>During this time she had multiple affairs with some the people who went there. Then she filed for divorce because we were not &#39;equally yoked.&#39;</p> <p>I have my kids 45% of the week. Every Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday. I see them Wednesday mornings, and Sunday morning as well. I drop them off at their moms and they go to church every Sunday. T",

Our emotional connection is amazing, deeper than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced. Early on, I told her I might be asexual and she accepted that because our bond felt strong enough without sex.</p> <p>Over time she started to grow distant and recently she opened up to me. She said the distance was largely because of a lack of intimacy, sex, which she needs in our relationship. She hadn\u2019t said this before because she didn\u2019t want to hurt me or risk losing me. When I heard this it was really hard for me. I cried a lot and realized how much I don\u2019t want to lose her.</p> <p>I have been honest with her throughout. I told her that I\u2019m not actually asexual. The truth is I am scared and insecure about my own body, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve avoided sex and am still a virgin.</p> <p>One thing I haven\u2019t told her yet is that I feel uncomfortable about the fact that she has a penis",

I&#39;m 16 and recently dated a guy who was also 16 but broke up with him because he didn&#39;t like gay people. That was that I thought but turns out my family just LOVED him and they want me to get back with him even though they know why I broke up with him. I&#39;ve said no, multiple times, and they stopped apart from my aunt, who still insists I should give him another chance. Her reasoning is &quot;He&#39;s very sweet and everyone is entitled to their opinion.&quot; He can have his opinion, but he can&#39;t date me with it. Apparently she even talked to her friend about setting us back up and I&#39;m i the only one who thinks this is weird and creepy?! They&#39;re full grown adults in their 30s and seem way too interested in my love life</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/trans_emofemboy\"> /u/trans_emofemboy </a> <br/> <s",

For a lot of us, the holidays aren\u2019t all sparkly and safe. Sometimes it\u2019s family stuff, sometimes it\u2019s grief, sometimes it\u2019s loneliness, sometimes it\u2019s being around people who don\u2019t really see you, or having to shrink yourself to survive the day.</p> <p>If nobody has told you today, I\u2019m proud of you. Being you, even quietly, even privately, even when it\u2019s hard, takes real grit. If all you did was get out of bed, eat something, ignore a nasty comment, set a boundary, or just exist through a tough day, that all counts.</p> <p>If you feel alone right now, you\u2019re not. Drop a comment if you want a quick g\u2019day from a stranger who genuinely cares. And if you\u2019re not up for words, chuck an emoji and I\u2019ll still send you love back. \ud83c\udf84\u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RainbowsTwil",
