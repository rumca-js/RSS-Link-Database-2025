A WH spokesperson\nresponded within a few hours. The quote was not included in the\n\u201c60\u201d report\u2009\u2014\u2009so, judge for yourself whether it should have been\nincluded or not.</p>\n\n<p>WH spokesperson Abigail Jackson said \u201c60 Minutes should spend\ntheir time and energy amplifying the stories of Angel Parents,\nwhose innocent American children have tragically been murdered by\nvicious illegal aliens that President Trump are removing from the\ncountry.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite the fact that it doesn\u2019t address a single aspect of the report, 60 Minutes should have included that statement, both to reveal the belligerent callousness of the administration, and to highlight the glaring grammatical error. In its way, the statement speaks volumes.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018The White House\u2019s Belligerent, Igno",

You don\u2019t even need to crack open the new PDF in a text (or hex) editor and hunt for the original text within non-human-readable PDF formatting code.
