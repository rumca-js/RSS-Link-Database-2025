It was especially useful for unmanaged switches, so no discovery or automation \u2014 just clean, structured documentation of physical connections.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I can\u2019t remember the name of the project and I haven\u2019t been able to find it again.

I did the same, putting Gluetun, Prowlarr, and Ephemera on the same stack, but I&#39;m still experiencing that high CPU usage.</p> <p>Has anyone else experienced this?
