I stumbled upon a few options like Decodo, SOAX, IPRoyal, Webshare, PacketStream, NetNut, MarsProxies, and ProxyEmpire.</p> <p>We\u2019re looking for something with a pay-as-you-go model, where the cost is calculated based on GB usage. The proxies would mainly be used for testing different ad campaigns and conducting market research. Has anyone used any of these? Which one would deliver reliable results without failing or missing? Appreciate any insights or experiences!</p> <p>Edit: Seeking a proxy that does not need to install SSL certificate on local machine since we are having multiple users using adspower, this would be an extra headache</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TangeloOk9486\"> /u/TangeloOk9486 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comme",
