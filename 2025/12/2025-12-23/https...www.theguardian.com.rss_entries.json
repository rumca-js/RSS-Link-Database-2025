It was one-way traffic for Arsenal in the first half but they found Crystal Palace\u2019s second-string goalkeeper Walter Ben\u00edtez in an inspired mood as he kept his side in the contest with some fine saves.</p><p>An own goal from Maxence Lacroix looked to have booked a semi-final against Chelsea after Chris Richards had been carried off for Palace with a nasty gash to his ankle. But Marc Gu\u00e9hi had other ideas and his goal in the fifth minute of injury-time took this rematch of last year\u2019s quarter-final to penalties. The first 15 were all successful before the unfortunate Lacroix saw his spot-kick saved by Kepa Arrizabalaga to send Arsenal through in dramatic style.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/23/arsenal-crystal-palace-carabao-cup-quarter-final-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",
