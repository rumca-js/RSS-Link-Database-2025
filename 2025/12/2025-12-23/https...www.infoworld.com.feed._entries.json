Anything with an IP address and a data center suddenly became a cloud. Vendors rebranded hosted services, managed infrastructure, and even traditional outsourcing as cloud computing. Many enterprises convinced themselves they had modernized simply because the language on the slides had changed. Years later, they discovered the truth: They hadn\u2019t transformed their architecture; they had just renamed their technical debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That era of \u201ccloudwashing\u201d had real consequences.

An \u201curgent\u201d Slack, a last-minute requirement or an exec ask is enough to nuke your standard agile rituals. Apart from randomizing your sprint, it causes thrash for existing projects and leads to developer burnout. This is even more critical now in the AI-accelerated landscape, where overall volatility has increased with improved developer productivity. Randomizations are no longer edge cases; they are the norm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\u2019s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-the-2025-dora-report\">DORA 2025 re",
