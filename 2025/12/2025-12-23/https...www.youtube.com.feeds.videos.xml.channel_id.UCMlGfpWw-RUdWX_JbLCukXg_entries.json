We provide crucial details that will help programmers understand how to access and manipulate coroutines inside GDB. A key aid is the -fdump-lang-coro option added to GCC 15.1 that is not yet documented. It dumps the intermediate representation of compiler-generated code of a transformed coroutine without which coroutines cannot be easily controlled inside GDB. \n \n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2025/blob/main/Presentations/Debugging_Cpp_Coroutines_In_GDB.pdf\n\nWork at Hudson River Trading (HRT): https://tinyurl.com/safxfctf\n---\n\nZartaj Majeed\n \nZartaj has extensive experience developing large distributed systems, operating systems and desktop applications.
