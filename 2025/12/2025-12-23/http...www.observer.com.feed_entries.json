As Oram Hotels\u2019 newly appointed Director of Arts &#38; Culture, she brings that perspective directly into hospitality development. In this Expert Insights Q&#38;A, Findley joins Oram Hotels co-founder Kevin Mansour\u2014whose real estate and investment expertise has shaped the group\u2019s Southern California portfolio\u2014to examine how embedding artists, institutions and cultural process into hotels from the earliest stages is redefining brand value, guest engagement and long-term asset identity. Together, they explore why art, when treated as infrastructure rather than ornament, can fundamentally reshape what hospitality delivers.",
