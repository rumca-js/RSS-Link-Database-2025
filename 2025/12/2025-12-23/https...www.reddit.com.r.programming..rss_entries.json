Along the way I learned something interesting about algorithm selection.</p> <p>The conventional wisdom is that radix sort is O(n) and beats comparison sorts for integers. True for random data. But real data isn&#39;t random.</p> <p>Ages cluster in 0-100. Sensor readings are 12-bit. Network ports cluster around well-known values. When the value range is small relative to array size, counting sort is O(n + range) and destroys radix sort.</p> <p>The problem: how do you know which algorithm to use without scanning the data first?</p> <p>My solution was embarrassingly simple. Sample 64 values to estimate the range. If range &lt;= 2n, use counting sort. Cost: 64 reads. Payoff: 30x speedup on dense data.</p> <p>For sorted/reversed detection, I tried:</p> <p>- Variance of differences (failed - too noisy)</p> <p>- Entropy estimation (failed - threshold dependent)</p> <p>- In",

Highlights include Greg Law&#39;s L3 logging library achieving 1ns latency by eliminating locks via memory-mapped buffers and atomic operations, Khalil Estell&#39;s 90% reduction in C++ exception overhead through smarter table search algorithms, Denis Yaroshevskiy explaining C++26 hazard pointers for lock-free config access at Meta, and Andrew Drakeford demonstrating a million-times speedup in leave-one-out regression by exploiting mathematical properties rather than just cache locality.
