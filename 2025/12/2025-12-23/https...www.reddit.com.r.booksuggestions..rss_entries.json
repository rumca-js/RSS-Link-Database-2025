And I\u2019m sure that she\u2019ll love the book as long as it\u2019s right for her. She really liked Camus\u2019 The Stranger. She loves movies like the new Batman, La Haine, Prisoners and almost all Wes Anderson movies. I think she\u2019d enjoy a fiction book, preferably fast paced as her attention span isn\u2019t the best \ud83d\ude06.

So I&#39;ve been looking for this book I read like 10 years ago, it&#39;s probably from the 90s The plot is : A deep lake exploration team finds a slimy dark worm like creature they bring back to study. The creature escapes and starts killing people through the plumbing. It also multiplies very fast. It eventually undergoes metamorphosis and becomes a giant warp like creature and the whole hive start indiscriminately killing anything in sight. The story mostly follows this young boy who&#39;s doesn&#39;t fit in at school, he becomes friends with this other guy who he thinks is cool. The loser guy has a scientist dat who says the creatures are earths immune system which has been disturbed by going that deep into the lake.

I haven\u2019t read a full book probably in 10 years (I know, I know) and I would LOVE to get into it more in the new year but I tend to get very distracted when I read and my mind wanders. Does anyone have any suggestions of very good books that hook you? I don\u2019t really know what I like but TV wise I love thrillers, true crime, deep dramas, juicy things! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/alexella000\"> /u/alexella000 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ptr7w8/books_that_make_you_fall_in_love_with_reading/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ptr7w8/books_that_make_you_fall_in_love_with_reading/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019m looking for romance book recommendations where the main leads haven\u2019t had casual hookups, flings, or one-night stands in their past.</p> <p>Just to clarify \u2014 this doesn\u2019t mean the characters have to be virgins. I\u2019m completely fine with them having had past committed relationships that didn\u2019t work out. I just prefer stories where intimacy isn\u2019t portrayed casually for either lead.</p> <p>This is more of a personal comfort thing (maybe my South Asian brain showing), but I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of books tend to include casual hookups as backstory, and I\u2019m trying to avoid that.</p> <p>Any genre or setting is fine.
