However I have a small issue that I would like advice on how to fix. Every now and again usually when I open the laptop it starts redownloading torrents that I&#39;ve already downloaded. From my understanding once I download a torrent I should keep it seeding cause thats what keep torrents up and running cause ppl are downloading the file from me until a certain point when it&#39;s seeded enough. My problem is that if I download a file and leave it seeding sometimes folx will start downloading the file again like its the first time and it just takes up bandwidth and memory unless I notice it in time plus it clogs up my downloads folder. I have to stop it and delete task but then its no longer seeding the torrent which from my limited knowledge on torrenting its a big no no to download files but not seed them. Any advice on w",
