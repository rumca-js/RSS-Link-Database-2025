I was never able to finish the game as a kid and I\u2019m trying to find closure with a raspberry pi. Said game freezes randomly but if I save state then I can load tha state after the game freezes and it will run smoothly again until it randomly freezes again. I was prepared to breath whole game this way but there are certain scenes the game can\u2019t move past. I\u2019m pretty sure this is an emulator issue and not the rom itself but I\u2019m at a total loss on how to go about fixing it. I personally have zero background in computers/computer tech so I have had friends helping me out but it overwhelms me everytime I see them boot up all of the software. I feel like no amount of beer and pizza will compensate the mental anguish I\u2019m putting these people through. </p> <p>Does anyone have any quick tips or advice on running the 64 game smoothly?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am on a high school supermilage team and i am trying to figure out a rear facing camera for the car (not a backup camera, more like a rear view mirror). I don&#39;t know much of anything about Raspberry Pis or coding at all and i am very new to this kind of stuff. My questions are, Is a Pi B+ 512MB enough for this purpose, or do i need something like a Pi 4 or 5, how do have a live feed from the camera module directly to the display with low latency (sub 500ms) and how do i power the Pi from a battery? Apologies for how basic some of these questions are, I legit know nothing about these things, as i have not worked with them before.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SirThik\"> /u/SirThik </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ptn2kh/how_would_i_use_a_pi_with_camera_module_to_have_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comm",

I have a nice pc but I want a set up i can use in class. Looking around, I found the pi 500. To me it looked really interesting and i would love running it and a portable monitor over a pos laptop. However, I am not the most tech savvy person (I have installed mods for SWAT 4 and changed driver versions on my graphics card) so I would need to have guides available for setting up more complicated things. I saw there were some windows os projects but they seemed complicated and I have never used Linux. Realistically it will mostly be used to run web based programs and at most things such as the standard google or office 365 programs.
