I&#39;m currently in my Master&#39;s program and I&#39;m looking for a thesis topic related to malware. It&#39;s been over 10 years since I&#39;ve done reverse engineering, so I thought it would help me get back into the subject. I was thinking of these two topics: Recent EDR evasion techniques and how to detect when EDR isn&#39;t working (system log traces, network logs for C2, for example) Adding AI to an automated detection pipeline</p> <p>The problem is, I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t be able to do it. I&#39;m still comfortable with assembly and C, and I did quite a bit of systems programming several years ago. This would be my first AI project, so I&#39;m a little nervous about that too.</p> <p>What do you think? Do you have any ideas? (I also need to find a professional challenge because intellectual pursuits aren&#39;t enough; I can&#39;t just do tech.)</p> <p>Thanks! Have a good day!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",
