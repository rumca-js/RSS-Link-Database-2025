So let\u2019s imagine a world in a few years from now where the technology has improved to something we can\u2019t comprehend right now. What if it then has the capabilities to do everything traditional Google searching does. What happens to websites?</p> <p>I run a medium size website and forum that has been around since the 90s. We rely on new users finding us via organic search to join, input new information, and continue that cycle to grow. If this new iteration of AI is no longer allowing people to find the site, do we just slowly fade into the internet as we knew it? </p> <p>Or is there a variable I\u2019m not thinking about? </p> <p>A shift like that would probably take a long time. And not everyone would be on board right away or ever. But people go for the easiest path.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/to",
