        "description": "How did scientists discover evidence for dark energy? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comedian Paul Mecurio explore dark energy, Hubble tension, and the beginning and end of the universe with astrophysicist and Nobel laureate, Adam Riess. \n\nLearn the story of how Adam helped discover dark energy, and how he wrote equations expecting to measure deceleration only to watch his computer spit out negative mass, signaling acceleration instead. From calibrating candles to worrying about bad weather on Hubble observing nights, he walks through the beautiful mistake that held up.\n\nLearn how astronomers once wondered whether there was enough matter to slow the universe\u2019s expansion, and how parallax, Gaia data, Cepheid variables, and the search for ever-brighter standard candles led them to Type Ia supernovae. He breaks down why these explosions are so uniform, how the Chandrasekhar limit works, and how dust tricks astronomers by dimming and reddening starlight.\n\nThe conversation widens to dark energy\u2019s",
