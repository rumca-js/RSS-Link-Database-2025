USB-C was supposed to simplify things: One cable for everything, that was the promise. In practice, it\u2019s a different story: There are cables that can only charge. There are some that transfer data. Some also transmit image information, which can then be used as a monitor cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there is always the question of speed: 30 or 100 watts of charging power? USB 2.0 speed with 480 megabits or USB 3.2 or even Thunderbolt with up to 40 gigabits per second? Unfortunately, the cable labelling often doesn\u2019t help to bring order to the cable chaos. And then devices run or charge unnecessarily slowly because the wrong cable has been used.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"imageId\":\"694ab7f8b573a",

In theory, I should no longer be looking for holiday sweaters, but in part due to more of my colleagues joining in on festive wear, I\u2019ve been wanting to expand my collection. But I\u2019m so dissatisfied with my options. Thing is, I think Microsoft could fix this problem for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>SkiFree</em> holiday sweater.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft is done for the year with holiday sweaters, sure. It released <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2996403/microsofts-latest-ugly-sweaters-go-on-sale-are-selling-out-quickly.html\">a nostalgia collection with nods to early Windows icons, Zune, and the OG Xbox</a>. But I don\u2019t think those move the needle quite the same way as the game all of us wanted to beat but never could. (And technically, never will.) I bet it could be offered year round and it would still sell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(A",
