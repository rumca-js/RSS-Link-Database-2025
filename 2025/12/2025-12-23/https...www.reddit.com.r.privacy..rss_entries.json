It\u2019s an authentic iphone (i paid closer to ebay listing prices than temu prices) and it works fine with one caveat: I have never at any point associated my identity with this phone, simply because of its country of origin. I even set it up without an Apple Account on a separate guest WiFi network. My buddy had a spare Helium Mobile eSim i could use just to test text and call functionality. However, after I sent a text to HIS iPhone phone number, this iPhone XS with no clear owner as far as it SHOULD be aware, iMessage asked if i would like to share MY PERSONAL contact information, First Last Phone number. How in the hell could this temu iPhone XS that has never even been associated with my identity know who I am?</p> <p>Btw, i\u2019m not just some idiot.

Apparently if you hold down the camera button it goes into an &quot;AI mode&quot; where if you scan an item in a different language, it auto translates it for you OR you can google it and find a ton of info on it.</p> <p>... I asked, but wouldn&#39;t this become a MAJOR issue when someone ends up scanning random people and getting all their info? Like hopefully it&#39;s not available currently, but it wouldn&#39;t surprises me especially with all the Meta AI glasses to eventually be able to look up ANY info on ANYONE as. long as they are in your &quot;frame&quot; for the camera or iPhone.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RedditFan3510\"> /u/RedditFan3510 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1ptjq9n/ai_iphone17_privacy_issues/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",
