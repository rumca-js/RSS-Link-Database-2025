It\u2019s a nice spin on a very classic fairy tale trope, the kind that feels familiar in a comforting way without being stale. The whole book has this warm, gentle tone that makes it easy to sink into. Nothing overly grim or exhausting, just an enjoyable, well-paced read.</p> <p>The biggest comparison I kept coming back to was Howl\u2019s Moving Castle. That same whimsical, slightly oddball magic, charming characters, and fairy-tale logic where things just work because they feel right.

I&#39;ve been wanting to read some more D&amp;D books and dont know if I should continue with more Dragonlance and dig more into who Raistin is, or switch over to Forgotten Realms and follow Drizzt. I&#39;ve heard some of the Drizzt books are really good and some are really not so good. </p> <p>So, from the people.who may have read both, which did youu like better, Dragonlance or Forgotten Realms? Who had the better story, Raistlin or Drizzt?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sulcata13\"> /u/Sulcata13 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ptkj0v/dungeons_and_dragons_series_forgotten_realms_or/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ptkj0v/dungeons_and_dragons_series_forgotten_realms_or/\">[comments]</a></spa",
