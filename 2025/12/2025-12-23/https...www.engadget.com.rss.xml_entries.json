Apple\u2019s Family Setup feature makes it possible for a kid to use an Apple Watch without owning an iPhone, and the feature set has expanded thanks to recent watchOS updates. It supports communication controls, location tools, Schooltime limits and privacy protections that allow a parent or guardian to manage how the device is used throughout the day.</p>\n<p>The setup process begins with creating or signing in with a child\u2019s Apple ID. It continues with adding them to your Family Sharing group on an iPhone and pairing a compatible Apple Watch through the Apple Watch app. Once the watch is linked, you can adjust a range of parental controls that shape how the watch works at home, at school and when the child is out and about.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2 id=\"jump-link-confirm-device-compatibility\"><strong>Confirm device compatibility</strong></h2>\n<p>Fami",
