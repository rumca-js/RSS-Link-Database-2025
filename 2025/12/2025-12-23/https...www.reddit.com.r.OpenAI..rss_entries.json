I have been testing the GPT-5.2 <em>Thinking</em> on both ChatGPT and the API and I have come to the conclusion that the reason why so many dislike GPT-5.2 is due to their usage of it on ChatGPT. I think the core of the problem is that GPT-5.2 uses the adaptive reasoning and when set to<br/> either &quot;Standard&quot; or &quot;Extended Thinking&quot; none of the core ChatGPT users (except for Pro)<br/> really see any of the gains that the model as truly made, when however you use it through<br/> the API and set it to &quot;x-high&quot; setting the model is absolutely amazing. I think that OpenAI could solve this and salvage the reputation of the GPT-5 series of models by making<br/> the &quot;high&quot; option available to the users on the Plus plan and then giving the &quot;x-high&quot; to<br/> the pro users as a fair trade.
