Said support team only offers contact thru PGP encryption and you can only send that on one specific page where there\u2019s a text box. However, clicking it does no good, pressing tab skips right over it, restarting made no difference. I have attempted and viewed a few simple things thru inspect, I can see where the information should be but I think since I\u2019m essentially just editing the HTML on that page when I try to submit via doing it that way it gives me an error and refreshes.</p> <p>I have my PGP encrypted message, I just need help being able to essentially access this textbox. (I tried different categories as well,(bugs, general problems, etc) they all seem to share this problem.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Keegan1400\"> /u/Keegan1400 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/1ptw8ip/t",
