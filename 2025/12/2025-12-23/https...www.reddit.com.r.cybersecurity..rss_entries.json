I recently learned that most free VPNs make money by monetizing user traffic, often by logging, selling, or leaking the data you generate while using the service for free. In some cases, this data reportedly even ends up on dark markets. Basically, you don\u2019t pay with money, you pay with your data.</p> <p>Because of that, I started looking into decentralized VPNs and came across Raccoonline, which positions itself as a dVPN. From what I understand so far, the idea is that traffic isn\u2019t routed through a single centralized provider\u2019s servers, but instead through a distributed network of independent nodes.</p> <p>My main question to the cybersecurity folks here is:<br/> does a decentralized VPN actually offer better protection against data leaks compared to traditional or free VPN services? Or is the main advantage simply a different trust model rather than stronger security guarantees?</p> <p>",
