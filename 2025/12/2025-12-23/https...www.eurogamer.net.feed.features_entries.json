I've been playing them (increasingly badly over more recent years!) for almost 40 years and writing about them for over 20, so it's rare that something blindsides me. But that's exactly what happened with <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blades-of-fire\">Blades of Fire</a>, the action soulslike adventure from Mercury Steam. I loved the studio's Castlevania rethink, Lords of Shadow, but was so-so on its output since, including the Nintendo-published <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-dread\">Metroid Dread</a>. My expectations for Blades of Fire were low to moderate. Incredible, then, that I've not played another game released this year that I enjoyed more.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2025-blades-of-fire-and-hideo-kojima-showed-me-i-can-still-be-surprised-by-a-video-game-and-that-ori",
