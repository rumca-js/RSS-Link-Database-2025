Their strategy targets a hidden \u201coff switch\u201d that tumors use to stay invisible to immune defenses\u2014special sugar molecules on the cancer cell surface that suppress immune activity. Early tests show it can supercharge immune responses and outperform current antibody therapies.",

The K2 site preserves thousands of remains from a prehistoric flood-fed lake that acted like a natural bone trap 72 million years ago. Alongside common local dinosaurs, researchers uncovered the first well-preserved titanosaur skeletons ever found in the region. The site reveals how ancient European dinosaur ecosystems formed and evolved in the final chapter of the age of dinosaurs.",

This insight came from a new living-host model that allowed scientists to watch the fungus in action. The findings could eventually lead to new treatments or allow current drugs to be repurposed.",

It relies on nanoparticles that bind to tumor markers, making cancerous areas easier to identify. The system is far more sensitive than existing tools and could speed up cancer screening. Scientists believe it may help detect tumors earlier and reduce delays in diagnosis.",

Researchers found eight body-like maps in the visual cortex that organize what we see in the same way the brain organizes touch. These maps help us instantly understand actions, emotions, and intentions in others. The discovery sheds light on human empathy and opens doors for new brain-based therapies and AI systems that better understand the body.",
