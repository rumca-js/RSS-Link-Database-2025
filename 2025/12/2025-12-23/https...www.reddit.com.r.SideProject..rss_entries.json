That makes it hard to test smaller ideas or iterate without feeling like you\u2019re wasting budget. I\u2019ve tried keeping things smaller and more focused, but even then it\u2019s not always clear how much is \u201cenough\u201d to get signal without overspending.</p> <p>For people who\u2019ve been through this, how do you approach GTM experiments early on? How do you test ideas cheaply without cutting so many corners that the results are meaningless?Would really appreciate hearing what\u2019s worked for others.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Legal_Lingonberry_88\"> /u/Legal_Lingonberry_88 </a> <br/> <sp",

All her classmates are using ChatGPT to write their papers and getting As, while she&#39;s grinding away doing her own work and getting Bs and Cs. But she won&#39;t use it to write for her because (1) she&#39;s terrified of getting caught by plagiarism detectors -- her school has been cracking down hard, and (2) she actually wants to learn how to write well, not just pass the class.</p> <p>I kept thinking there had to be a middle ground. Like, what if AI could help you get better at writing without doing the writing for you?</p> <p>So I built something. You upload your essay, and it gives you detailed feedback -- like where your thesis is weak, where you&#39;re making claims without evidence, where your argument doesn&#39;t flow. Basically what a good tutor or TA would tell you, except available whenever you need it. But it never writes anything for you. You do all the work, it just points you ",

I started this project as a way to learn more about developing apps and I think its finally in a place to share with others. The idea for this app came to me as I watched my own kids regularly use computers at school but was surprised to learn that there was never time in the day for teachers to explain the fundamentals of typing.</p> <p>The app has a progressive approach to help you improve touch typing. It begins with home row fundamentals and expands vertically to cover the full alphabet, capitalization, numbers, and special characters. Beyond lessons, I included a few gamified drills and a Wordle-style daily typing challenge. There is also some fun metrics to help you track speed and accuracy.</p> <p>For those curious about the tech stack; the TypingAce front end is built with React 19 and Vite 7, written using TypeScript.
