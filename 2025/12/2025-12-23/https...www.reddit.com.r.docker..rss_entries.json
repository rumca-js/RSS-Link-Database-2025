I also used the compose file setup from a third-party source (<a href=\"https://hotio.dev/containers/jellyfin/#__tabbed_1_2\">here</a>) Nothing seems to be working. I made sure I put the path to the media in the compose file, but it dose not show up. I will paste my compose file set up just in case!
