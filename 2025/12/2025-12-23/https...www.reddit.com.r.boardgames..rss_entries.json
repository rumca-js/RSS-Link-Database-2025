We&#39;ll have 5-6 players, and while my husband and I are fluent English speakers, the rest of the group isn&#39;t.</p> <p>We love Wingspan, but it&#39;s tough to play with non-English speakers since so much of the gameplay depends on reading card text (bird powers, bonuses, end-of-round goals, etc.).</p> <p>Totally fine explaining rules at the start and doing some translating during setup, but once we&#39;re actually playing, I&#39;d love something where everyone can make their own strategic decisions without needing us to hold their hand every turn. Medium complexity or higher would be perfect. </p> <p><strong>What are your go-to language-independent games for larger groups?</strong></p> <p><em>P.S. I looked everywhere for board games in Spanish but unfortunately they have to be purchased in EU/Mexico. If you have any suggestions for retailers that sell board game",

I should probably say that the only people who would play it is me, myself, and I, and probably a few friends that I would drag the board game to play with. I already have Risk, but I want something more in-depth and more complicated than that. One person suggested that I get the game on Steam to see if I like it.

Third level took some tries, and finally got lucky with some cards and beat that. </p> <p>Which brings me to the upper levels. They are literally not possible. You simply cannot move enough spaces and maintain the kraken deck to win the game in 5 rounds. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible unless there is some communication during the rounds and a massive amount of luck. </p> <p>Would like to hear from others \u2026</p> <p>-all the best! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KHartnettC\"> /u/KHartnettC </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ptfk5r/sail_difficulty_level/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ptfk5r/sail_difficulty_level",
