Do they just literally not understand that closeted people feel shame? Even as children?</p> <p>It\u2019s such an interesting phenomenon when people complain about their favorite shows being too woke. If you don\u2019t like it, watch something else! The show you liked wasn\u2019t ruined - you just never understood it in the first place! </p> <p>As a side note, I am a bisexual millennial woman and I also didn\u2019t like the coming out scene.

I convinced myself it was ocd because I had been with my boyfriend for a year that month so \u201cI couldn\u2019t be a lesbian i love him\u201d I talked to him about it and he was so hurt that I think it just pushed me to convince myself that I was just bi and confused the entire time and I also don\u2019t want to be a lesbian so that was easier (there is absolutely nothing wrong with it I just always imagined being straight and marrying a man and you know the whole picket fence story.) over",
