To what extent does he understand the impact of his silence. How it causes pain, perpetuates misery and protects the criminal? What happens when that silence interferes with his personal life, hurting those closest to him? Can he still hide behind ignorance? How does he live under the weight of such shame? These are the questions John Boyne explores through Father Odran Yates in A History of Loneliness, a novel set against the backdrop of the child abuse scandals involving Catholic priests in Ireland. </p> <p>It is a deeply thought-provoking book that forces you to confront the quiet role silence plays in sustaining injustice and the guilt and devastation that inevitably follow. The book is depressing yet utterly engrossing. It draws you in so completely that putting it down feels impossible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",

Not because it has answers, but because it names feelings you could not explain to anyone around you. People mean well, but they simplify, judge, or try to fix things too fast. A book can just sit with you.</p> <p>For me, that book was Norwegian Wood. </p> <p>I read it during a time when I felt disconnected and emotionally stuck, but I could not explain why. The characters live in that quiet space between sadness, love, and confusion. Nothing is rushed. Grief, loneliness, and longing are treated as normal parts of being alive, not problems to solve. It understood that sometimes you are not broken, you are just going through something heavy.</p> <p>That honesty surprised me. It felt like the book knew what I was carrying before I did.</p> <p>I am curious what book did that for you. A book that understood you better than people did at the time, and why it mattered when you read it.</p> <p>Thank you.<",

They occasionally reference politicians like they&#39;re celebrities and cite random parts of Millenial culture as a substitute for an actual personality.
