His conclusion was a stark warning that Israel has transformed into a fascist system, led by settlers, which is dangerous for everyone, including Israelis themselves.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https:/",
