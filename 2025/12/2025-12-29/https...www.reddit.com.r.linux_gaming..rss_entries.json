I also tried it with Diablo IV, doing 2x framegen from native 60fps, it was super stuttery and the image was poor. Is there any way to also get an overlay from Lossless Scaling, to know when the framegen is working? I mean I can use my eye, I feel like I can generally tell when something has hit at least 90fps (I notice way less going from 90 to 120 then pretty much nothing after), but it would be nice to have an overlay that takes into account the framegen frames to tell me whether or not it was technically working.</p> <p>I have also looked into global frame capping, I installed MangoHud and GOverlay. But GOverlay seems to be not working at all. I have a frame cap set to 90, when I use the Steam metrics overlay, it will still report 120fps in games, someti",

The readme files sadly tell me to use Fluffy Mod Manager to install the mods, but there&#39;s no Linux version. Do I have to emulate it with wine? There&#39;s a functional Linux alternative?

The Sync apparently works, but when I open the game there is no saved files, I tried already to manually move the save files and still doesn&#39;t work. Any idea what could be the issue? I&#39;m guessing I might need to somehow launch the game from the launcher. But then I cannot find a way to install EGL, I tried Lutris and the launcher installs but when I open it, it just crashes.</p> <pre><code>[Core] INFO: Deleting old save files...
