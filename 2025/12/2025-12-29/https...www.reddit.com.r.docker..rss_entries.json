My plan is to set up all the API endpoints on v2 first, then build the v2 frontend. While developing this, I&#39;ve got both sites running on my local. Currently, I have them both running in one network, so I can do things like access the v1 database from the v2 API. This has been fine so far when making AJAX calls from the v1 frontend to the v2 backend.</p> <p>But the further into development I&#39;m getting, the more frustrating it&#39;s getting, because for example, both networks have a <code>proxy</code> service, both have an <code>api</code> service. When I make a curl request from the v1 backend to the v2 backend, I start hitting service name issues, with the v2 proxy calling the v1 api.</p> <p>I tried using aliases, but it means I&#39;d need to modify my v2 proxy to reference the v2 api instead of just calling <code>api</code>.
