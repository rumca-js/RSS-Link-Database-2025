Honestly, what I am looking for is A Book where the FMC Is getting revenge on the MMC And she goes through with it and kills him, but only then she realizes that&#39;s not the type of revenge she wanted That she didn&#39;t want him dead, She just wanted to hurt him, etc. If it helps, there&#39;s also a scene in the show The Queen, Where the main female character stabs her husband in the back and murders him. And then breaks down sobbing, only to realize she truly did not want to murder him. And that her life will not be the same without him. Please I&#39;d love Suggestions and no I DO NOT want an ENEMIES TO LOVERS I want a true LOVERS TO ENEMIES where she lives in sorrow cause of what she&#39;s done. I don&#39;t want it to be a happy ending I want it to be gut wrenching I want to be sobbing cause she&#39;s sobbing no lovey ",

For me the facts and information he provided for both the parties being partially to mostly real was amazing. I literally googles the churches, the angels, the artists, the pagans everything and being present there was a cherry on top.

I\u2019m open to sci-fi, fantasy, horror, realistic fiction, crime, etc. I\u2019ve recently read Dead City by Joe McKinney, Come Closer by Sara Gran, and the Scythe series by Neal Shusterman. I enjoyed Scythe the most. I guess my only request is that it be somewhat more modern, maybe last 30-40 years. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Queasy-Primary-3438\"> /u/Queasy-Primary-3438 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pybio2/cant_figure_out_what_to_read_next/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1pybio2/cant_figure_out_what_to_read_next/\">[comments]</a></span>",

So basically I started reading the Percy Jackson universe probably in 5th grade during my obsessive reading era, and since then I\u2019ve arguably been unable to get engrossed in a book series as much as I\u2019ve been able to with Riordan\u2019s books (and I\u2019m an upcoming college student so it\u2019s been a while lol).</p> <p>like I am currently rereading the <em>Trials of Apollo</em> for like the fourth time and it is SO GOOD, but I\u2019m hoping to start expanding my reading into other books so I don\u2019t keep rereading the same stuff. it\u2019s just that for some reason Riordan has this style of writing where there\u2019s both drama, and humor, and Greek mythology, and Intriguing protagonists that just makes it hard to find another author like him.</p> <p>But if anyone in a situation like mine has any recs that would be great. Although I like fantasy a lot, my main thing that makes books interesting is when there\u2019s A huge character development in the protagonist (like Apo",

I always hated stories with a mystery, but the answer is impossible to solve on your own. Any good mysteries are fine, but nothing made to make people feel like detectives when they\u2019re practically given the answer. Although it\u2019s not a necessity, any mystery books about non-violent crimes would also be interesting. Art theft is especially intriguing to me.
