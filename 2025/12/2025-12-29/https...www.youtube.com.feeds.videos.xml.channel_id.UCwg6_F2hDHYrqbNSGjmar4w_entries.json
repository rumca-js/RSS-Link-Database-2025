        "description": "The coconut crab is the largest land-dwelling arthropod on Earth, and it\u2019s far more intimidating than it looks. With crushing claws, incredible climbing ability, and a diet that includes just about anything it can get its grip on, this island giant has earned a fearsome reputation. In this video, we explore how coconut crabs live, hunt, and survive in some of the most remote places on the planet, and why crossing paths with one might be more unsettling than you\u2019d expect.\n\nGet your copy of \"Strange Creatures\" now!
