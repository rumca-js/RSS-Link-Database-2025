When using fedora the laptop would heat up and spin up the fans even when just browsing the internet with Firefox, meanwhile Ubuntu does a much better job at keeping the laptop cool. Battery life is also up to 70% longer when using Ubuntu over fedora KDE (which I think is a big deal).</p> <p>From my initial evaluation it seems like it&#39;s mainly the CPU that heats up so much, the GPU seems to be loaded to similar levels on both platforms. </p> <p>I also noticed the sound quality difference between the two, I feel like KDE has a better sound quality but has many issues with crackling sound when under load, GNOME has no such issues. </p> <p>C",

They told me to go look at it since it wouldn&#39;t let them past without an MS account (They&#39;re a boomer, they barely known what a MS account is), so I told them that they just have to register their email to it. They told me no, so I offered to install Linux on their laptop, or at least show them how it looks like, they said yes. So I got my KDE Neon USB and shown it off to them and.. Yeah, they told me that it looks so unfamiliar and it wouldn&#39;t probably run their stuff (again, boomer, tech illiterate when their stuff is web based), so they just switched back to windows. </p> <p>Here is my question though, why? Why is that people don&#39;t want to switch even though they don&#39;t want to give their data to Microsoft but they have to just to access their OS?</p> <p>Edit: This person doesn&#39;t use Adobe or any kind of software that doe",

I tried Cntrl-C, but usually that seems to abort the currently executing line and resume execution on the next line of the bash script, or something close to that. It doesn&#39;t happen with everything, maybe only things that involved nested scripts? But it happens a lot. I think the currently executing command catches the SIGINT, aborts, and does not propagate it upwards, so the top level script just keeps going. Sometimes doing two Cntrl-Cs in rapid succession works, but not often. Observed behavior seems to contradict many sources showing up on google, but I&#39;ve observed this numerous times on multiple distros so... hopefully I&#39;m misunderstanding those sources.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>About 16 years ago now, FatELF was proposed, an executable format where code for multiple architectures can be put into one &quot;fat binary&quot;. Back then, the author was flamed by kernel and glibc devs, seemingly partly because back then x86_64 had near complete dominance of computing (the main developer of glibc even referring to arm as &quot;<a href=\"https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5070#c5\">embedded crap</a>&quot;). However a lot has changed in 16 years. With the rise in arm use outside of embedded devices and risc-v potentially also seeing more use in the future, perhaps it&#39;s time to revive this idea seeing as now we have multiple incompatible architectures floating around seeing widespread use. The original author has <a href=\"https://github.com/icculus/fatelf/issues/1#issuecomment-1783983363\">said</a> that he does not want to attempt this himself, so perhaps someone else can?
