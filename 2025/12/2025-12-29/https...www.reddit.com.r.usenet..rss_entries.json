I would like to know the best Usenet Indexer out there to grab spanish-dubbed games and also for movie/TV Shows streaming through a well-known external video player which starts with S. I&#39;m looking for good quality (+1080p) in movies/TV and also ES version of the games downloaded. I also want to know if it&#39;s safe to download nzb files from the Usenet to grab media (more than with Torrents pages) and if I need to take any caution before downloading games/TV/films in Usenet.

I signed up for Newshosting a few weeks ago during one of the black friday sales. I rented a server and installed a full stack of automation apps. I queued up a large library of items because I wanted to create a really awesome setup full of high quality releases. But Newshosting has turned off my account, I assume because of high usage. I can still log in, but everything I try to download fails. Everything, not just specific things, shows not found. My completion level went to 0% on this account. I know its a purposeful event because the Easynews account that came with this account also shows the same behavior. I signed up for a new Newshosting account, just to test my theory and low and behold, the new account and new Easynews account both work. So now I suppose I will just charge back both of these charges, since I no longer have a desire to do business with someone ",
