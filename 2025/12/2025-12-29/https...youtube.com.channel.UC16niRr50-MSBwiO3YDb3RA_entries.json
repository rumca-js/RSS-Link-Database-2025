        "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived in Florida for talks with US President Donald Trump that are expected to cover Gaza and a range of other pressing issues.\n \nIt will be their sixth meeting since Trump's return to office 11 months ago.\n \nAny decisions made could have a potentially momentous impact on questions that determine the future of the region.\n \nThe US has been Israel's strongest military and political backer throughout two years of war in Gaza and many are now looking to the meeting as a test of the leaders' relationship and how aligned they are on key topics.\n \nPerhaps most critically, they will discuss progress of the Gaza ceasefire deal, where Israel's government has taken several positions diverging from those of the US government.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#DonaldTrump #BenjaminNetanyahu #US #Israel #Gaza #BBCNews",

        "description": "Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky said progress had been made to end the Ukraine war during talks but the US leader added \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained.\n \nWhile both the US and Ukrainian presidents described the Florida talks as \"great\", Trump reiterated that a key sticking point was the question of territory. Russia has previously demanded that Ukraine hand over more land.\n \nAddressing reporters at Mar-a-Lago, Zelensky said they had come to an agreement on \"90%\" of a 20-point peace plan, while Trump said a security guarantee for Ukraine was \"close to 95%\" done.\n \nZelensky later said US and Ukrainian teams would meet next week for further talks on issues aimed at ending Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#Ukraine #US #BBCNews",

        "description": "China is holding military drills around Taiwan simulating the seizure and blockade of the island's key areas, as a warning against \"separatist forces\".\n \nThe army, navy, air force and rocket force have been dispatched for the drills which include live-fire exercises, the Chinese military said.\n \nCodenamed \"Justice Mission 2025\", the drills are taking place days after the US announced the sale of one of its largest weapons packages to Taiwan worth $11bn (\u00a38.2bn). That move drew sharp protest from Beijing which in turn sanctioned US defence firms.\n \nWhile some initial drills have begun, the military said it would conduct a major exercise from 08:00 to 18:00 local time on Tuesday.\n \nTaiwan's presidential office has criticised the upcoming Chinese drills, calling them a challenge to international norms.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#China #Taiwan #BBCNews",
