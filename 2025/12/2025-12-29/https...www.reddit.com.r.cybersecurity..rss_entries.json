You know how back in the datacenter era, attackers went after hosts &amp; networks? So it made sense at the time to secure the infrastructure layer, but that no longer wor\u2064ks with current cloud environments where workloads are ephemeral and infrastructure is API driven with most of it constantly mutating. Yet I see and know so many organizations still trying to secure their environments us\u2064ing tools and models designed for more static protection.
