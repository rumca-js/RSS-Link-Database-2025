Companies that want to enter the AI character space often spend heavily on development, when the real investment should be in marketing. </p> <p>To address this, I\u2019m building a white-label AI character B2B SaaS that businesses can license for under $100 per month. This allows them to focus on marketing rather than worrying about development, or B2B partnerships which will be handled by me.</p> <p>I already have a proof of concept, which I am refining based on feedback from similar website owners. My main questions are: - Is there demand for a solution like this? Would businesses be willing to pay for this service? - I have experience marketing B2C products, but this is my first B2B venture. How should I approach it?</p> <p>Looking forward to your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/leot",

Over time, I was surprised to see that many others also found it useful for their parents, grandparents, elderly relatives, and even for simple minimalist setups. After listening to feedback, I\u2019ve recently added multi-language support, a PIN-locked layout to avoid accidental changes, larger text, and a few usability improvements. I\u2019d really like to continue improving it based on real experiences from people who help their family members with phones \u2014 especially what parts of Android tend to confuse them, which changes actually help day-to-day use, and which languages you think would be helpful to add next.

It started after I read an article on Medium about what the author described as an overlooked untapped market: simple, genuinely free tools. Things like converters, generators, small utilities, tools that solve a clear problem, do one thing well, and don\u2019t require an account or a subscription.</p> <p>The article made a fairly pragmatic point: the cost of writing software has dropped so much that it\u2019s now possible to offer genuinely high\u2011quality tools for free. If a tool is useful enough to be used regularly, monetizing traffic (AdSense or similar) becomes a natural consequence of quality, not a substitute for it. These tools can work surprisingly well over time without putting basic functionality behind paywalls.</p> <p>That idea stuck with me. Why not try?</p> <p>I\u2019ve been a developer fo",

It is a low code/no code app builder that combines templates and visual components with ai coding aiming to get people up and running quickly with minimal setup (no IDE, no development environment needed). The feedback i got was that it was difficult to use, or downright confusing for low or non technical users. Instead of getting frustrated or discouraged, I sat down and thought about what my users might really need rather than what I thought was a good idea. I made some major changes and have had a lot more positive feedback on the experience. I would love to get some more feedback from folks, its free to try, and you will have a working play/app store app out the gate. </p> <p>check it out at:</p> <p><a href=\"http://Mvpocket.com\">MVPocket</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Obvious_Image1043\"> /u/Obvious_Image1043 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
