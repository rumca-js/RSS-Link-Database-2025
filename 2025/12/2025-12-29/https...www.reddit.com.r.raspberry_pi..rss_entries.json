I have a usb-c pico and this sorta cable doesn&#39;t exist as it doesn&#39;t comply with the usb-c standard, so my idea was to plug in a battery into the VSYS for power (I have soldered pin headers already), and then just plug in a usb-c to lighting to jailbreak the ipad, but I heard that if I plug in this cable, the ipad even powered off/DFU mode, will still transmit power (read about 100mv, not that sure tho) without disconnecting the 5v line manually (which i dont know how honestly) It can fry the pico which would be not nice\u2122\ufe0f.

I got it set up after watching some tutorials and went to set up retro pi. When in the rp imager no storage devices are listed even though the sd card is being read. I have tried multiple fixes and none have worked. I rebooted the pi. I used the usb micro sd adapter, on both the usb 2.0 and 3.0 ports. </p> <p>It\u2019s a raspberry pi 4 with a 64g micro sd card. The card came preloaded with the is system already installed. I am new to all of this and don\u2019t want to accidentally corrupt my sd card. Anyone know how to fix this! </p> <p>*I did try to list the link to the kit but the post got removed for having a shortened link even though it was not shortened* </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AceLunarMoon\"> /u/AceLunarMoon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1py73z6/rp_image",
