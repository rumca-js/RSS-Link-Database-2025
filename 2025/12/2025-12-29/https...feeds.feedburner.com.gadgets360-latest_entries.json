A new study suggests fusion reactors could produce axions, hypothetical dark matter particles, when high-energy neutrons from fusion reactions strike reactor walls. These interactions may generate axions that escape shielding undetected. Scientists propose future fusion plants could double as dark matter laboratories, with nearby detectors searching for rare axion signals. Even without detection, such experiments could place important limits on dark matter theories.",
