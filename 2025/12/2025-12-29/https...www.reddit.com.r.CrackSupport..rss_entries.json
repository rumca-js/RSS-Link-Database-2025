Its the only game that I didnt buy through steam, I ended up purchasing it through the epic games store since they had a big sale on it a few months ago. All my games are working fine with my controller but for some reason God of War won&#39;t work my controller now. It used to no problem. I have a scuf instinct pro that I love. I bought it for my Xbox but ended up getting my first gaming pc about 9 months ago. I use it plugged into my pc. Like I said, I have no issues with another game. It will recognize that im using a controller, like at the menu if I use my mouse and then use my controller, the mouse cursor will disappear and the buttons for the controller will instantly pop up so its like it knows its plugged in and that im trying to use it, it just won&#39;t let me use it. Im not the most tech savy person in the world. Im not",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Sorry if this question is repetitive, but is there any way to get Sims 4 DLC now that Anadius has quit? I had the Sims 4 Updater on my old PC, but that PC broke and I lost everything, and I got a new one for Christmas and wanted to get back into the game. When I started looking things up, I saw that Anadius quit, and I have seen people saying the Sims 4 Updater no longer works. Others say there are workarounds, but only for people who already had it installed, and with all the talk about malware I am honestly super confused. I am not interested in anything involving torrenting, mostly because I had my internet cut off once in the past and would really like to not relive that experience again. I am also very not tech savvy. Is there any good Samaritan willing to help explain what is going on and what is actually safe?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Curious_Clerk5293\"> /u/Curious_Clerk5293 </a> <br",
