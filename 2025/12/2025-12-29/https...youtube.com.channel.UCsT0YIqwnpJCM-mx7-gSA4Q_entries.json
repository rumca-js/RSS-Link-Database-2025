        "description": "Omri Morris, a certified peer recovery specialist, shares her personal journey through addiction and healing. In this candid and powerful talk, she highlights the importance of breaking silence, reducing stigma, and finding purpose through connection and vulnerability. Omri Morris is a black queer cis woman and mother in recovery from Substance Use Disorder and living with co-occuring mental health disorders. She chose abstinence as her main pathway to recovery, which means that she has chosen to abstain from using illicit drug and alcohol use for the last 11 years, and to take medications to help her maintain recovery as prescribed by her doctors.\n\nAs a faculty member at VCU, she chooses to Recover Out Loud by working as a Certified Peer Recovery Specialist and Peer Recovery Support Coordinator for Rams in Recovery, a collegiate recovery program that helps support students who identify as being in recovery. She is recovery made visible, and invites you to recover out loud, together! ",
