For instance, when I read Arrows of the Queen trilogy by Mercedes Lackey, I had Starvation by Aurora looping in my head. Some of the lyrics are relevant, but that isn\u2019t even the main reason. I think of songs based on feel and environment in books, and this song feels beautifully cold an ethereal just like the setting. When I read earthsea by Ursula K Leguin, specifically The Tombs of Atuan, I had an instrumental track from one of my favorite mobile games as the soundtrack. Every time I reread the Dark is Rising, I imagine a beautiful choral version of Coventry Carol. I have plenty of other examples, but I wish I could do this more often. I\u2019ve noticed that only super impactful books get a song associated to them.

It certainly helps that Tchaikovsky already knows a lot about spiders, but you can tell that he&#39;s also done a lot of work on learning about the other kinds of animals being uplifted or evolved in the series. While I&#39;m not really sure whether the methods being used in-story to uplift the creatures in question really stand up to close scrutiny(I suspect that they don&#39;t), for me sci-fi has always been more about discovering what-ifs rather than it being as true as possible to the current received view(s) in the sciences, so I don&#39;t mind a little handwaving, if it makes it easier to explore interesting what-ifs and ideas.<",
