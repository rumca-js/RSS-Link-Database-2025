At my job, every time we merge code into the staging branch, all other feature branches automatically merge staging back into them.</p> <p>When I look at the Git history tree, it\u2019s a complete mess. Each merge pulls in the entire staging history and creates big merge commits, which makes it almost impossible to pinpoint where an issue came from or which branch introduced it.</p> <p>Is this common in large companies? If not, what would be an ideal workflow to keep a cleaner, more readable history?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alejo9010\"> /u/Alejo9010 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1pyt9br/is_this_git_workflow_normal/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1pyt9br/is_this_git_workflow_normal/\">[comments]</a></span>",
