This is because std::vector\uff1cT\uff1e is cache-friendly. \n \nWhat does that mean, though? \n \nThis talk will answer that from the ground-up. We will cover the need for CPU caches and their consequences, how the CPU tricks to make them as seamless as possible, and when and why those tricks sometimes fail. This means that you need to be careful when structuring your program to avoid slowdowns. We will thus explore cache-friendly data structures, data-oriented design, and how to avoid common pitfalls. \n\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2025/blob/main/Presentations/Cache_Friendly_Cpp.pdf\n\nWork at Hudson River Trading (HRT): https://tinyurl.com/safxfctf\n---\n\nJonathan M\u00fcller\n \nJonathan is a Software Engineer at think-cell.
