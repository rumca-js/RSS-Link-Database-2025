I had tried standup in my last year at university, then did three open mic gigs at the Edinburgh festival which offered strong evidence that I should give up. So I did. Eighteen months later, after a vague plan to try to get into sports journalism ended with me subediting articles about stock markets for a business publishing company (even less exciting than you might think), I booked one gig, at the Comedy Cafe\u2019s Wednesday open mic night, hosted by Daniel Kitson. If that had gone badly, I don\u2019t think I would have tried standup again. It went well enough to carry on, and within a year I was starting to get a few paid gigs, and standup gradually became my \u201cjob\u201d.</p><p><strong>Can you recall a gig so bad, it\u2019s now funny?<br></strong>In about 2002, I did a show in Killarney in Irelan",

In Cruickshank\u2019s pages, classical influences from Rome and Greece give way to a revival of medieval English gothic and the emergence of modernism.</p><p>He is particularly interested in who commissioned and built his chosen dwellings, and how they got the job done. It\u2019s a new spin on the recent fashion for historians to explore the homes of commoners, as opposed to royalty and aristocrats, in order to tell the life stories of their occupants.
