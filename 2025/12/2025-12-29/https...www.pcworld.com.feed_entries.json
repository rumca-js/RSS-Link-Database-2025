Most don\u2019t bother with the unique, complex phrases or character strings that make a good password. Worse, they share weak passwords with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best password managers fix these problems. For starters, they create and store strong, random passwords for you. They also can store <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2319566/web-login-without-a-password-how-passkeys-work.html\">passkeys</a> and securely share credentials. These apps protect your passwords by encrypting your login info in a virtual vault (either locally or in the cloud), only allowing access with a single master password. Many offer additional security features beyond that. And it doesn\u2019t cost much for this service, especially during this season of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/deals\">holiday deals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of our top picks for password ",
