Here, we introduce a mechanistically accurate multi-scale model directly generating simulated physiology from which extended neural and cognitive phenomena emerge. The model produces spiking, fields, phase synchronies, and synaptic change, directly generating working memory, decisions, and categorization. These were then validated on extensive experimental macaque data from which the model received no prior training of any kind.

He refused that, saying that&#39;s not authentic.</p> <p>- The 2nd example he gave was of a woman talking to an AI clone of her dead mother.</p> <p>- He then proceeded to make the argument that companies that create AI clones are profiting off loneliness, grief and the need for human connection.

It rarely gets revisited unless a human is debugging something.</p> <p>I am wondering reflection is the missing step. Humans look back, spot patterns, and adjust. Agents mostly don\u2019t. They remember things but don\u2019t really turn them into lasting lessons.</p> <p>I have been exploring ideas where agents periodically review past experiences, identify patterns, and update their internal assumptions. I came across this while reading about a memory system, which separates raw experiences from later conclusions. It feels closer to real improvement than just better retrieval or bigger models.</p> <p>For people thinking about long running agents, do you see reflection as necessary for real learning? Or can we get there with better retrieval and larger models alone?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u",

It comes from struggle, from trial and error, from sitting with an idea until it actually becomes yours. When we hand that process over to AI \u2013 even for \u201clittle\u201d things like brainstorming, drafting, or refining \u2013 we weaken the muscle that built our most meaningful advancements. In short, less AI, more humanity. </p> <p>If you want, I can make this more direct or cut out some of the softer parts \u2014 just let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Newspaper_846\"> /u/Ok_Newspaper_846 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://ww",
