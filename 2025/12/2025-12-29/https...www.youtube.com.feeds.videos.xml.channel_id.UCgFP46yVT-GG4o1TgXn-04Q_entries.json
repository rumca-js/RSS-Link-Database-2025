But here\u2019s the problem: the CCP is lying about what The Art of War actually teaches.\n\nIn this episode of China Uncensored, Chris Chappell breaks down how Sun Tzu is routinely misinterpreted\u2014and deliberately misused\u2014by the CCP to mask China\u2019s aggressive strategy toward the United States and its allies.\n\nStar Fox 64 | Deep Thoughts While Gaming https://youtu.be/fhiqQRKy_1s\n\nWant to go deeper than YouTube will let us?
