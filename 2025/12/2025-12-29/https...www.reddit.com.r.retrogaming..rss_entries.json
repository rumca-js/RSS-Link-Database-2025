I have a few psps, a N3DS, DS Lite, Trimui Brick, DSI, and a few 2DS. All of these consoles are modded/can be if I need to. I\u2019m looking for what all around (and according to the public) is the best for portable gaming. My N3DS has a cracked hinge so I don\u2019t use it a lot bc it cracks in my pocket. I\u2019ll get it fixed sooner or later. But until then, what is the best for retro gaming? I\u2019m thinking Dragon Quest, Zelda, any JRPGs similar to that. I prefer the brick and PSP because they are easier to repair and are more pocketable. Also I will take any game recommendations, ones where I can freely roam the world and complete quests. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Pixsoul_\"> /u/Pixsoul_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1pyyzvg/what_would_be_the_best_device_out_of_what_i_have/\">[link]</a></span>",

I&#39;m returning to the SNES after about 20 years or so away from video games (other than cell phone apps). Found it in the basement and decided to start playing again. But I also started buying cartridges, and I noticed a lot of them don&#39;t work. I don&#39;t even get a connection. I tried a connection to a different TV, and one of them worked. But several of the other new ones I bought still do not. I saved about 10 games from the &#39;90s that still work. Is there a common reason that the other recently bought cartridges won&#39;t work? Are they fake? Or just broken somehow? What are the basic things I should know when shopping for cartridges?</p> <p>I&#39;m also looking for recommendations for easy RPG games.

Blue sky, daytime. You&#39;re basically racing to catch up to something fast (I think it was a train) and there&#39;s this mountain with a tunnel ahead. The tunnel has one entrance and one exit, and you fly straight through it, no dodging or maneuvering inside as far as I remember.</p> <p>The whole thing was super fast-paced and really hard. I&#39;m pretty sure you were supposed to catch up to whatever you were chasing and maybe land on it?</p> <p>I&#39;m like 90% sure it was NES but not completely certain.
