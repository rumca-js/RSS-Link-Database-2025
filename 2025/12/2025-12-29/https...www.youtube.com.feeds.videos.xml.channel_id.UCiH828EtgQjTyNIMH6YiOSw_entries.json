It is the second film in the View Askewniverse following 1994's Clerks. As in the other Askewniverse films, the characters Jay and Silent Bob feature prominently, and characters and events from other films are discussed. Several cast members, including Lee, Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams, have gone on to work in several other Smith films. Comic-book icon Stan Lee appeared, as did Brian O'Halloran, the star of Smith's breakout feature Clerks. \n\nTwitch - https://twitch.tv/channelawesome\nFacebook: https://w",
