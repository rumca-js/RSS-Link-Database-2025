Unlike other experiences with this mechanic, (Marabunta, Hanamikoji, Tussie Mussie) the resolution is so biting and immediate.

So in this game, there\u2019s something like a \u2019host\u2019 who chooses a question and gives it to everyone but one person who get to different question and is called the impostor. Then everyone takes turns at showing their board and once they all show their board the host reveals the question. Everyone then has to defend the answer and after two minutes they choose who the impostor was. What is this game and if you don\u2019t know the name of the game, can you please leave some of questions you could use?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Strange-Necessary208\"> /u/Strange-Necessary208 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1pyb12p/what_is_this_game_called/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1pyb12p/what_is_this_game_called/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019ve played card and board games my whole life but really got into the hobby a little over 2 years ago.

This would mean needing to dive into the rulebook again to refamiliarize myself with the game again before playing or have my nose in it again the whole time while playing.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t see any resources out there that would help with this so I built my own! This website is not intended to be a replacement to rulebooks, but rather is a quick reference to remind yourself of how to set up the game or for a quick refresher of specifics that you",

We play a single game, and we use as much tiles as possible. That means every single readily available expansion. The last two years we didn&#39;t manage to actually finish, so this year we stopped including double or triple base games. Still, we started with 500+ tiles and playing took us some 16 hours over two days to finish, not counting final tallying and cleanup (an hour extra each).</p> <p>House rules / amendments:</p> <ul> <li>we used two dragons, and every dragon movement happened with both of them</li> <li>from move 1 we allowed drawing your next tile after your turn finishes, to speed up thinking time. I recommend everyone do this, it saves so much time.</li> <li>we house ruled Leipzig to allow all 6 players to enter.
