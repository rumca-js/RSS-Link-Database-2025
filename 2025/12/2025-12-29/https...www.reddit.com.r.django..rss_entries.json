Since it was a full blown project. Initially i thought I would get ghosted like several other times but out of the blue shortlist came and my name was on top. Till today I&#39;ve never been shortlisted in any company so I have no idea as of what they&#39;ll ask. I&#39;m not a cs major but it&#39;s a backend specific role.Can any of you guys tell me what kinds of questions to expect in the interview?; also it&#39;s an online interview. Also it&#39;s a technical interview also the only one .
