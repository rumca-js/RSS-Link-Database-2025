By delivering mRNA to the liver, they created a temporary source of immune-boosting signals that normally come from the thymus. Older mice treated this way produced more effective T cells and responded far better to vaccines and cancer treatments. The strategy could one day help extend healthy years of life.",

Cracks in sea ice release heat and pollutants that form clouds and speed up melting, while emissions from nearby oil fields alter the chemistry of the air. These interactions trigger feedback loops that let in more sunlight, generate smog, and push warming even further. Together, they paint a troubling picture of how fragile the Arctic system has become.",
