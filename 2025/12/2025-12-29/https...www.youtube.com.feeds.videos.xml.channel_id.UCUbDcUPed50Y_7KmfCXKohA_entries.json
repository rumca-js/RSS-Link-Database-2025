        "description": "I built a a Star Wars AT-AT big enough that I can ride on it. I used lots of large 3D printed parts and aluminium extrusion to build the Star Wars AT-AT. It's really strong and can dead-lift both me and itself. It can turn and walk along with me on top.\n\nYou can support me on Patreon, join my Discord, or buy my Merchandise:\n***************************\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/fc6MedG7eW\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/xrobots\nMerch Store: https://james-bruton.teemill.com/collection/all-products/\n***************************\n\nOther socials:\n***************************\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/xrobotsuk\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/xrobotsuk \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/xrobotsuk/\n***************************",
