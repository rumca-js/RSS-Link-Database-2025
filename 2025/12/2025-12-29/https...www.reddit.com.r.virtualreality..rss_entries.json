I connected the quest to my pc with a Usb A to Usb C cable with no adapters and when I enter the link thingy using my vr it displays my desktop normally. Then I launch Half Life Alyx (I have steamvr installed) and it boots up normally. It takes like 3-4 minutes to boot up the menu of the game and when I press continue in the game menu it loads for 5-6 minutes and then kinda messes up my pc and crashes. I am not using an USB 3 cable and I use a pc with the following specs:</span><br/> <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Amd Ryzen 5 1600 Six-Core</span><br/> <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Amd Radeon Rx580 series</span><br/> <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">16 gb ram</span><br/> <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">I run the game on my ssd, but I don&#39;t have a lot of space in my C: drive.</span><br/> <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Can you guys",

So hardware wise I end up with either the Quest 3, Pico 4 or if released in early 2026 maybe the Steam Frame, but trying to understand what each of them is good for is kind of hard based on the threads I&#39;ve read. Apparently there&#39;s 3 different types of resolution that are important, colors look different, there&#39;s different lense types etc.</p> <p>Gamewise I&#39;m looking to play Half Life Alyx ofc, try out racing games and stuff like Blade &amp; Sorcery, Boneworks that kind of stuff so I guess the recommended facetracking is none of my concern as I dont plan",

As unfortunate as it is not many good VR games are made anymore as it seems VR has been put on a backburner. But in my set of games I have played over the years, I had yet to play the vertigo series up until now, and I have to say I do not regret it one bit. Compared to games like boneworks and blade &amp; sorcery, vertigo 1 and 2 are right up there with the gold standard vr of games. You can tell they are a passion project with the polish, detail, and quality put into them. They have a sense of humor, incredible action and weapon functionality, and references to numerous other games that always manage to surprise you. They also bring unique features like actually challenging boss fights and somewhat choice driven storylines. As much as I could say about how good these games are, you just have to try them for yourself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
