        "description": "A fun look back at the greatest things inside the 1995 Index Christmas Catalogue; Argos\u2019s scruffier cousin and an absolute goldmine of 90s chaos. From EXTRA BASS cassette players to Databank watches; from skipping CD players to five-speaker mini-systems; from Bandit savings banks to Shaving Fun Ken; this catalogue was pure festive nostalgia. And of course; the gaming pages packed with Mega Drive bundles; Tiger handhelds and the almighty Pre-Computer 2000. Christmas shopping has never been this gloriously unhinged.\n\n#nostalgia #90s #retro #christmas #catalogue #indexcatalogue #megadrive #retrogaming #90skids #shorts",
