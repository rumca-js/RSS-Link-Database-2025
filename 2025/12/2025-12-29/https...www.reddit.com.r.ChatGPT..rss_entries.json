I had to quickly escape it and luckily there was no car on my left. Since I was in a hurry I could not pull over. I used voice commands and ChatGPT to find the phone number I need, then call the service and report the hazard all while driving at high speed. It took me 2 clicks in total to describe the situation, find the correct number, make a phone call, and report the situation. There is no way I could have done this without ChatGPT or a similar AI powered voice assistant. </p> <p>In 10 years it will be hard to think we used to live without voice assistants. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fix-faux-five\"> /u/fix-faux-five </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1pz0k7c/chatgpt_enabled_me_to_report_a_road_accident_in/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",

Yes, what happened to those teens is devastating too, I don&#39;t want to create a strawman argument, but it&#39;s hard not to consider the irony.</p> <p>If I were a teen right now, I would feel so insulted. No real legislature after even Sandy Hook and Uvalde, but somehow this does it immediately when I&#39;m sure many many teens need support while dealing with this lack of care in their formative years.

So, I was wondering why I don&#39;t just plug a prompt directly into the personalization/customization options.</p> <p>If anybody here is good at prompt engineering, please assist me with a good prompt for this. It needs to be detailed and well-made so the chatbot actually remembers to consider it in every chat. I&#39;ll make sure to try out all the prompts and put the one that worked best for me in the post in a few weeks.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> <p>Edit: I used AI to generate a prompt for me(I know, ironic lol).

Asked it one simple question:</p> <p><em>&quot;Describe this brand&#39;s voice as if you&#39;re someone who just landed on this website and has no idea what we do. What personality comes through?&quot;</em></p> <p><strong>What we think we sound like:</strong> &quot;Innovative thought leaders who make complex technology accessible&quot;</p> <p><strong>What ChatGPT said we actually sound like:</strong> &quot;A person at a networking event who keeps saying they&#39;re &#39;disrupting&#39; something but won&#39;t tell you what they actually do. Lots of confidence, unclear if it&#39;s earned. Uses &#39;synergy&#39; unironically.&quot;</p> <p>I laughed. T",
