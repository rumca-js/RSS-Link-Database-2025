Basically lets you build and share your actual security tool stack with the community.</p> <p>You can:</p> <ul> <li>Build your complete security stack (EDR, SIEM, whatever you&#39;ve got)</li> <li>Create category leaders (like &quot;best pentesting tools I&#39;ve used&quot;)</li> <li>Make tier lists of tools (S-tier to F-tier, judge away)</li> <li>See what 1,500+ other practitioners are actually running</li> </ul> <p>Tool discovery sucks right now because it&#39;s all vendor/Gartner-controlled.</p> <p>Sales decks, analyst reports, sponsored content. Nobody shares their real stack because... idk why honestly.</p> <p>So now you can. And you can see what everyone else is using too.</p> <p>Anyway, if you&#39;ve got a stack worth sharing, throw it up there. Or just browse what others are running.
