The idea: A hassle-free service where you drop your raw ideas, text prompts, images, or clips \u2192 skilled creators (using AI tools + human touch) turn them into polished short videos (reels, product ads, social media content) with music, cuts, visuals\u2014exactly matching your intent. \u2022 Delivery: Aim for 10-90 minutes \u2022 Price: Around $20 for a 10-second video \u2022 You just sit back; no editing skills needed Questions: 1. Would you use this? (Yes/Maybe/No) 2. What would you mainly create? (e.g., Instagram/TikTok reels, product ads, personal videos, etc.) 3. What\u2019s a fair price for a 10-15 second pro-looking video? 4. Biggest pain point with creating short videos today? Global market focus to start, but open to all.
