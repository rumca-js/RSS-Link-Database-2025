Cast in reinforced polyresin with a corroded, heat-discolored finish, the helm features a genuine leather-lined and padded interior. Every surface is hand-finished to match the original Weta Workshop prop, capturing the vine-like engravings, iron texture, and six menacing spikes that crowned Sauron in battle. Standing 30\" tall, this officially licensed collector\u2019s replica is mounted on a custom wood and polystone display stand. It includes a Sauron-scale One Ring\u2122 replica and a fabric war banner bearing the Eye of Sauron, along with a certificate of authenticity. Individually serial-numbered,",
