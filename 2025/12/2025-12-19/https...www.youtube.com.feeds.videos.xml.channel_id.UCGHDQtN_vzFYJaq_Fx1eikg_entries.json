        "description": "This 1,600-year-old poem has never been replicated in English, because it would be virtually impossible.\n\n\n\"The Star Gauge (Chinese: \u7487\u74a3\u5716; pinyin: xu\u00e1n j\u012b t\u00fa), or translated as \"the armillary sphere chart\", is the posthumous title given to a 4th-century Chinese poem written by the Sixteen Kingdoms poet Su Hui for her husband. It consists of a 29 by 29 grid of characters, forming a reversible poem that can be read in different ways to form roughly 3,000 smaller rhyming poems. The outer border forms a single circular poem, thought to be both the first and the longest of its kind.\nThe Star Gauge consists of 841 characters in a grid. The original was described by contemporary sources as shuttle-woven on brocade. It was composed by Su Hui during a time when East Asian M\u0101dhyamaka was one of the predominant philosophical schools in the area.\nThe outer border is meant to be read in a circle. The grid is known as a palindrome poem, and can be read in different ways to generate over 3,000 shorte",
