We understand the reputation of Heat so we\u2019re giving it the benefit of the doubt and seeing if reddit\u2019s answers can open our minds about it. I keep hearing from everyone that there is a good catchup mechanic. While playing, my friend spun out and he couldn\u2019t catch up for the rest of the game. The very next game, everyone slipstreamed to cross the corner so I was the only one who didn\u2019t cross the corner. Then the entire game I was behind while everyone was eventually 2 corners ahead of me. I\u2019ve saved up heat to be able to cross the speed limit and was still so far behind. The adrenaline didn\u2019t help me much because it counts towards speed limit. </p> <p>It\u2019s a bummer cause I love this game and wanted to show to all my friends. They said they didn\u2019t enjoy it because they couldn\u2019t catch up (every race its always one person just left behind). This was the first race where I fell behind and after that race\u2014yeah I kind of understand ",

So I studied the rules, and watched various videos on YouTube about the game to see how it plays, only to then realize that I probably made a mistake backing this game. To the best of my current knowledge, based on studying the game without playing it and on various reviews, Malhya simply isn&#39;t a very good game. It isn&#39;t unplayable, but between bad rules, too many icons, bad balance, and a rather high effort to set up and explain the game, the basic dungeon crawling gameplay isn&#39;t rewarding enough to feel worth the effort. I played a lot better campaign games this year (e.g. Agemonia or Tidal Blades 2), and given that I still have a large backlog of campaign games, I don&#39;t see me playing Malhya anytime soon, if ever.</p> <p>That is kind of a problem.
