The detection method is now public due to news sharing. Once adversaries know what tipped defenders off, they adapt. It feels like cybersecurity is stuck in an escalating feedback loop where public victories shorten the lifespan of defenses. I know that this is one way we collectively learn but like any intelligence based op, I feel a bit more restraint in what info we share publicly is in order here. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CyberRhiz",
