It is part of the Star Wars franchise and a prequel to the film Rogue One (2016), which itself is a prequel to the original Star Wars film (1977). The series follows an ensemble cast primarily centered upon thief-turned-rebel spy Cassian Andor during the five formative years leading up to the events of the two films, exploring how he becomes radicalized against the Galactic Empire and how the wider Rebel Alliance is formed. \n\nTwitch - https://twitch.tv/channelawesome\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/channelawesome\nTwitter",
