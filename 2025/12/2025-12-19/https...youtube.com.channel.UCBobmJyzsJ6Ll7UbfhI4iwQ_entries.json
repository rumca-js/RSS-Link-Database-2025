In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, Tomas Nihl\u00e9n of Tomlin Studio shares how the company brought part of a digital twin of the city of Norrk\u00f6ping into Fortnite using UEFN, and made it available as a sandbox template for others to learn from and build on.\n\nWith Cesium and Google 3D Tiles as the foundation, Tomlin Studio is now exploring how to create immersive city simulations using real-world data in Niagara and high-fidelity points of interest with 3D Gaussian splatting and photogrammetry. \n\nTomas shares the company's experiences working with different types of digital twins, including the pros and cons of using 3D gaussian Splatting versus photogrammetry, and the technical limitations faced in UEFN.\n\nThis talk walks through the technical setup, lessons learned, and future possibilities to make digital twins playable, bridging the gap between games,",
