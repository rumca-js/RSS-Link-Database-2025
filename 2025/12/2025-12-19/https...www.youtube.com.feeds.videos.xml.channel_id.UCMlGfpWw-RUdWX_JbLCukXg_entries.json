As a software engineer on an infrastructure team at a fintech company, I work on low-level systems that power how engineers manage compute at scale. But it\u2019s my background in UX and human-computer interaction that\u2019s made me an invaluable asset. By applying design thinking to infrastructure \u2013 through prototyping, user interviews, and iteration \u2013 I transformed a complex internal workflow and quickly became a subject matter expert. \n \n This talk will walk you through that journey and give you the tools to be a design trailblazer in your own career. You'll leave with practical techniques for integrating empathy and user-centric thinking into deeply technical work\u2014and in",
