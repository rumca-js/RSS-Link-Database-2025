You ask it a question, it gives you answers and breaks them into categories, all behind the respectable appearance of a butler. The issue was it operated like an inferior version of Google and completely fell off like every other non-Google search engine did at the time. Today every big corporation seems to going all in on AI and offering the kind of interface Ask Jeeves did but with AI responses that can actually address the question, to varying degrees of success. It seems a no brainer to bring back this old tech and attempt to get a piece of the future AI marketshare by appealing to us boomers who remember it existed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Resident_Race_7093\"> /u/Resident_Race_7093 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1pqupj3/is_it_time_for_ask_jeeves_to_make_a_comeback/",
