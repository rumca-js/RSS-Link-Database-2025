And this completely baffles to me as to my mind overlap is THE most important feature a headset has. I would say its even what makes VR, VR!</p> <p>Why do I think that? Well I have owned 3 headsets to date: a Lenovo Explorer, a Quest 3 and a Quest 3s.</p> <p>The Quest 3 by common understanding beats the others in every way that matters, and yet its the only one that I immediately dropped after a couple of weeks.</p> <p>The Q3 compared to the others didnt even feel like VR. Yes, it was that extreme to me. It felt flat, sterile, lifeless, no sense of place, no depth, no magic, nothing.</p> <p>I can only put it down to that it has a much lower lower binocular overlap. To me it makes perfect sense- less overlap, weaker 3D, less",

The Valve Index launched June 2019, and 9 months later Half-Life: Alyx dropped. Even though that game is over 5 years old now, it still basically represents the peak of VR interaction. If Valve follows tradition, they should be releasing a game with the Steam Frame too. Now I&#39;m thinking... since the Frame is standalone with a new OS, and the controllers look like they are optimized for some traditional gaming inputs, is Valve&#39;s next title going to be a hybrid developing towards both traditional and VR-exclusive gaming? But at the same time, the Frame supposedly retains strong streaming capabilities... so maybe Valve will release multiple games of different types?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tatonkk\"> /u/tatonkk </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
