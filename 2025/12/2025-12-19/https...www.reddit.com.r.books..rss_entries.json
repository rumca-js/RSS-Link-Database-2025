Are we known or associated with any particular genre (kind of like how most American readers associate South American literature with magical realism)? If I had to guess, I would say maybe the lie of the &quot;American Dream&quot; in an &quot;All that glitters is not gold&quot; kind of way. Are US classics taught in school? If so, which ones? Does winning the Pulitzer carry any weight outside the US?</p> <p>Are there any US literature that is a big part of non-American&#39;s childhood? For example, we grew up reading Roald Dahl, Anne of Green Gables, Babar, Harry Potter, etc. Did anyone outside the US read Little House on the Prarie series growing up? Black Beauty? The Percy Jackson series?</p> <p>Are US pop culture authors like Hoover, Maas, Brown, Spark, Clancey, Yarrrows, etc popular outside the US as well?</p> <p>Looking for some outside perspective.

One day, I hope anyway, we will feel the sadness peel away from our past and stand justified. Knowing that we could not, as imperfect beings, have made any other choices other than those than the ones that haunt us in this moment. I know intellectually that this must be true, but my heart is incapable of feeling it right now. With sufficient time and a daily practice of kindness, I hope to stroll someday into that soft green glen where I can finally be free of my own wretched self.
