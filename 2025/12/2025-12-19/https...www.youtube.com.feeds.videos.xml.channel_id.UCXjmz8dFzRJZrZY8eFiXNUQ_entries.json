        "description": "At one point, Taika Waititi was one of the most exciting new voices in Hollywood. With indie hits like The Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in the Shadows, Waititi quickly established himself as a bold, irreverent filmmaker with a distinct authorial style.  One that felt genuinely fresh in a crowded industry.\n\nThat momentum carried him all the way to blockbuster success with Thor: Ragnarok and an Oscar win for Jojo Rabbit. But somewhere along the way, something changed. As Waititi\u2019s slate grew bigger, and his involvement in massive studio projects increased, it began to feel like the unique voice that once defined his work was slowly fading into the background.\n\nSo what happened? Was Taika Waititi stretched too thin by juggling too many projects at once? Did the Marvel machine elevate him only to eventually dilute what made his films special? Or is this simply a creative lull before a much-needed return to original storytelling?\n\n#taikawaititi #thorragnarok #marvel #whatwedoin",
