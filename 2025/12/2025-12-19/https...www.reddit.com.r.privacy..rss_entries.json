(so, one in 300 Browsers is better than one in 2000 Browsers?)</p> <p>B: Cover your Tracks tells me I have a non-unique fingerprint, and I am one in 900 who have the same fingerprint, but AmIUnique tells me: &quot;Yes! You are unique among the 4675486 fingerprints in our entire dataset&quot; which contradicts what cover your tracks says. Which one is more reliable and why do they contradict each other?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMoon8\"> /u/TheMoon8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pqiyl3/question_about_effs_cover_your_tracks_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1pqiyl3",
