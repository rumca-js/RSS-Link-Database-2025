The idea is to make configuring things like Hypr-whatever, etc. easier. Here&#39;s what I&#39;m working with right now: <a href=\"https://github.com/aarikpokras/cfget\">https://github.com/aarikpokras/cfget</a></p> <p>It has options to be optimized for execution inside of nano or vim. It would be great if you could contribute some snippets, as it&#39;s more of a user-made model. Please let me know if the documentation is clear or if there&#39;s anything else!</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Environmental_Mud624\"> /u/Environmental_Mud624 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1pq6k32/config_file_database/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1pq6k32/config_file_database/\">[comments]</a></span>",
