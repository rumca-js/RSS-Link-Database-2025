I\u2019ve had to beg my phone\u2019s battery to last a bit longer one too many times, and it sucks. That\u2019s why I always have a power bank on me whenever I leave home for more than a few hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re going to get a power bank and you\u2019re the type to spend up on a top model with the best features and performance, then here\u2019s a deal for you: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFDPQXN4/\">Anker\u2019s MagGo power bank is on sale for $60 right now</a>, down from its usual $90 (34% off) on Amazon.

USB-C was supposed to simplify things: One cable for everything, that was the promise. In practice, it\u2019s a different story: There are cables that can only charge. There are some that transfer data. Some also transmit image information, which can then be used as a monitor cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there is always the question of speed: 30 or 100 watts of charging power? USB 2.0 speed with 480 megabits or USB 3.2 or even Thunderbolt with up to 40 gigabits per second? Unfortunately, the cable labelling often doesn\u2019t help to bring order to the cable chaos. And then devices run or charge unnecessarily slowly because the wrong cable has been used.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"extendedBlock-wrapper block-coreImage undefined\"><figure data-wp-context='{\"imageId\":\"694543d8615f3",
