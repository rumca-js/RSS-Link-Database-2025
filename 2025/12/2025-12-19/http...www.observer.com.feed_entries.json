        "description": "Dr. Peter Churgin, a physician and early pioneer in electronic medical records, examines the growing A.I. arms race between healthcare payers and providers, and why it threatens to deepen burnout, erode access and destabilize already fragile institutions. Drawing on decades of clinical practice, health system consulting and experience navigating billing complexity, Churgin argues that automated coding tools are a necessary response to a reimbursement system that has grown too complex. Without shared standards and regulatory modernization, he warns, A.I. risks becoming another front in a system-wide standoff, rather than a path toward clarity, fairness and patient-centered care.",
