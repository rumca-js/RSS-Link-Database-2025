Because whenever I would come across a really well written, organized post there was so much value for me to take away from it for my own journey. It was also a lot easier for me to understand what they&#39;re actually working on and how I can help.</p> <p>So, I started vibecoding this concept in my head on Loveable. I torched through my free credits and decided to spend $100 for an upgrade. After working on it some more over time I literally blew over $300 more dollars just trying to make my vision. I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun and all but damn, hopefully its useful for someone.</p> <p>Heres the project, maybe you can drop a comment to let me know what you think: <a href=\"http://onasidequest.xyz/\">onasidequest.xyz</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/luukiepookie9\"> /u/luukiepookie9 </a> <br",
