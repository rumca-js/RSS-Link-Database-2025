Is there anything for me, a person who doesn&#39;t know a lot about how computers work internally, to see? I personally just like to visit various systems and such [Linux, Haiku, MacOS, Windows] [ARM, x86], though most importantly I guess, what would be a beginner-friendly [or non-technical] way of seeing RISC-V [or buying hardware for it and such]?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ClementinePlus\"> /u/ClementinePlus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1pqijua/new_to_riscv/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1pqijua/new_to_riscv/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019m making a in-order RV32I build, and I\u2019m having an issue resolving stores in a single cycle. For clarity, all memory interfaces in my core are designed to be variable latency, and so they work on handshakes with arbitrary async memory units.</p> <p>To describe the issue:</p> <p>I assert a control line to DRAM that is basically a \u201cstore enable\u201d. It says \u201cgrab the data and store it at the designated address\u201d. Then, my pipeline stalls until after I receive a handshake \u201cdata stored\u201d bit from DRAM.</p> <p>The only way, assuming variable latency, to have theoretical single cycle stores is to assert my \u201cstore enable\u201d line combinationally in cycle n. Asserting it on cycle n edge would mean the \u201cdata stored\u201d bit could only arrive cycle n+1. However, this violates my intuition and general design principles around state changes only on clock edges. Additionally, it means that flushes from the hazard unit may arrive after ",
