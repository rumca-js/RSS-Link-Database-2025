In the penultimate episode of <em>Pluribus</em>' first season, Carol (Rhea Seehorn) actually seems to be happy. That's a pretty big deal for someone the show describes as the \"most miserable person on Earth,\" who also happens to be living through an odd sort of apocalyptic scenario that she is desperately fighting to stop. But what does her change in demeanor mean for the show as it moves toward the finale?</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Welcome to our weekly <em>Verge</em>-subscriber discussion of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/815745/pluribus-review-apple-tv\"><em>Pluribus</em></a>, the new sci-fi series on Apple TV <a ",

The sudden loss of communications, drop in altitude, \"venting of the propulsion tank,\" and \"release of a small number of trackable low relative velocity objects,\" suggests the anomaly was some kind of explosion. SpaceX says it poses no threat to the crew of the ISS and will burn up in the atmosphere \"within weeks.\"",
