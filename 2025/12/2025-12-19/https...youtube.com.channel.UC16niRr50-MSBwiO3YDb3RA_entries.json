One image shows black-gloved hands holding up a piece of paper with the address of what was Epstein's primary residence.\n\nAmong the files are many new photographs.  Some show the former US president Bill Clinton, apparently in a hot tub and also in a swimming pool.  Another shows Mr Clinton alongside Epstein.  The former president has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein\u2019s abuse. \n\nOther photographs shows Epstein with Mick Jagger and the Microsoft boss Bill Gates.   Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. M",
