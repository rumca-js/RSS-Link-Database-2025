Currently i am building a little pen plotter but have run into some issues getting my pi to display text on my 16x2 character LCD. I have a Parallel to Serial Converter soldered onto the back of the screen but I cannot get the pi to display anything onto it for the life of me. </p> <p>I have it connected as follows:<br/> GND &gt; pin 6 GND,<br/> VCC &gt; pin 4 5v,<br/> SDA &gt; pin 3,<br/> SCL &gt; pin 5.<br/> From what I understand this should work. It powers on and i can see the small white squares so I know its not the potentiometer on the back. </p> <p>I have been looking online and even tried chatGPT but alas no joy. Any advice would be appreciated. I am very new to all of this and just messing around having fun, be gentle with me.</p> <p>These are the components I bought from a local-ish store<br/> <a href=\"https://cricklewoodelectronics.com/LC",
