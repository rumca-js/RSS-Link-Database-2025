        "description": "Sam Altman wants to make a deal with us: he'll give us a utopian future, if we give him... everything.\n\n$750 billion in investment. As much electricity as the population of India. And all of our data.\n\nAnd if he's wrong he'll still profit off of what comes next.\n\n-----\n\nMore Perfect Union is an Emmy-winning, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to build power for working people. Here\u2019s what that means: We report on the real struggles and challenges of the working class from a working-class perspective. We attempt to connect those problems to potential solutions. We report on the abuses and wrongdoing of corporate power. And we seek to hold accountable the ultra-rich who have too much power over America\u2019s political and economic systems.\n\n To support our independent journalism, subscribe, donate, and follow our other pages through the links below:\n- Help fund our reporting: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mpu-splash\n- Substack: https://substack.perfectunion.us/\n- TikTok: https://www.ti",
