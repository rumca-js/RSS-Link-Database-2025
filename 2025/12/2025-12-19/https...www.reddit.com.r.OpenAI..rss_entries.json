It was my go-to for everything: daily Q&amp;A, data analysis, 1st draft, brainstorming...For a long time, it was all I needed.</p> <p>But then I started using AI working on more complex stuff, work projects, and I got this nagging feeling. For really important questions, relying on a single model&#39;s answer felt like getting advice from just one person (who might be hallucinating). I started needing a second opinion, or even a third.</p> <p>This is also the year that tons of new models emerged and everyone is arguing about which one is the best. So it&#39;s hard to ignore all these voices and just be satisfied with one thing. My first move was just to open more tabs, ChatGPT in one, Claude in one",

However, even with its limitations, DALLE-3 had great knowledge of artistic styles (that i would say greatly rivals top of the line models today) and can create very vivid and uniquely aesthetic images. With DALL-E 3 being quite outdated for any business purposes, i think releasing it into the public would be a great push for open source image generation even now. I found a great deal of success making great 4k aesthetic images with building upon old DALLE-3 images with modern models like nano banana pro or gpt-image-1.5. If you used to prompt stuff with DALLE-3, feel free to share your stuff here and talk about your experiences with that model.</p> <p>a little album of some greatest DALLE-3 stuff, i mixed some stuff i made and some stuff i found.
