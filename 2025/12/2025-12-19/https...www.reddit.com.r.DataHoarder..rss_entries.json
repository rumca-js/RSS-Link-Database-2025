This will not be for publishing videos onto some social network type site, but for personal archives. I\u2019m also not looking for a video downloader or anything that would need access to my YouTube subscriptions as I would be providing the video files myself (if there\u2019s an API or CLI)</p> <p>One feature that I want to place emphasis on is the ability to assign \u201cchannel names\u201d to videos I upload. Given that the videos I\u2019ll be uploading won\u2019t be created by me but rather created by others, I\u2019d want there to be a field that would allow me to enter that original creator\u2019s name. For example: - I archive all of the hero trailers from the Overwatch YouTube channel. - I upload these videos on my self-hosted site. - I want these videos to appear as though they\u2019ve been uploaded by \u201cOverwatch\u201d instead of \u201cSaki\u201d. - I would also",

If you&#39;re on a tight budget, believe it or not, having food or rent is probably better for your mental health than obsessing over whether you have a cool enclosure for your drives. Post after post is literally the same situation: a new user with little knowledge or experience is running a Plex server and wants a NAS because they heard raid and parity are good for storing data safely. They need a 4 bay drive because that&#39;s what everyone else is posting. All advice not supporting their purchase wants gets downvoted. Heaven forbid they just use external USB drives. </p> <p>Here&#39;s the constructive part so",

What i have now:</p> <p>Asus strix b550 mobo</p> <p>Ryzen 5800x: i heard this consumes too much power, maybe i should sell it for another ryzen with integrated graphics?</p> <p>Corsair AIO 240mm: maybe overkill/not reliable long term?</p> <p>Two rams sets: g skill 32gb 3600mhz 2x16, and an older corsair 16gb 3000mhz 2x8 ddr4. Which one sounds better?</p> <p>Two PSUs: a EVGA 850w gold and an older rosewill 550w gold. </p> <p>I dont have an extra graphics card atm so if i keep the 5800x i will have to buy one. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/waterdrinker619\"> /u/waterdrinker619 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1pq6u74/nas_server_suggestion_from_a_list_of_old_pc_parts/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataH",
