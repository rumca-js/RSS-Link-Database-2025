        "description": "It\u2019s no secret that student loan debt and the cost of attending college are national problems. In the last 30 years, the average price of four-year public and private college tuition has nearly doubled. Along with it, federal student loan debt has skyrocketed to $1.8 trillion. You\u2019ve probably heard a buzzworthy solution: make college tuition free.\n\nWhile voices pitching \u201cfree college\u201d programs tend to be the loudest on the progressive left, it\u2019s actually a red state that was the first to enact a statewide Promise Program.\n\nWatch the full first episode of What\u2019s Working, a video series that uncovers creative policy solutions at the state and local level that are improving the lives of Americans, exclusively on Vox\u2019s Patreon. #freetuition #studentloans #collegetuition \n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (\ud83d\udd14) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in",
