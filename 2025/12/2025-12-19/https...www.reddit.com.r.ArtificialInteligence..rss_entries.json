This was partly a gaming achievement, and also an autophenomenological research into how humans build predictive models under extreme time constraints.</p> <p>The interesting part: fighting games force you to predict, not react. At 60fps with 3-frame (50ms) decision windows, pure reaction is impossible. You&#39;re forced to build an internal world model that compresses 900+ possible moves into actionable threat categories, reads opponent patterns from partial information, and adapts when predictions fail.</p> <p>I am guessing this maps somewhat to what AI researchers are trying to solve with world models and predictive learning. </p> <p>The full writeup explores: how humans compress massive decision spaces, what predictive cues actually matter at reaction-time scales, how internal models adapt under uncertaint",
