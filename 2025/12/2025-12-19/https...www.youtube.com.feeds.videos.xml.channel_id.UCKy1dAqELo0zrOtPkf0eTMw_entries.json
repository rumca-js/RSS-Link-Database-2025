Aonuma said that while he hoped the next main series Zelda game would be the Switch 2's first, some elements from Age of Imprisonment did inspire parts of his upcoming game. In Xbox news, the actor who portrayed Joanna Dark in the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot said she did 'entire chapters' of mocap for the game. She confirmed there was a plan to salvage a 'slimmed' down version, but ultimate the project was cancelled. And finally, the upcoming Honda Afeela car will be able to remotely play PlayStation 5 consoles, provided you have a PS5 turned on at home, similar to how the PlayStation Portal's remote play works.. The upcoming EV, produced in collaboration with Sony, is up for pre-order now for the low price of $89,900.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Nintendo",

But which of the year\u2019s many different video games is worthy of being crowned the very best of 2025?\n\nEvery December, the IGN team considers all the games they\u2019ve collectively played and reviewed across the year, and votes on which one they think is the greatest of them all. Which one is the \u201cGame of the Year\u201d? Sometimes that choice is incredibly difficult. Other years, it\u2019s easy. 2025 was the latter, with our winner securing almost three-quarters of the vote. But what is that near-universally admired game? That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to reveal.\n\n#IGN #GameOfTheYear2025 #Gaming2025",
