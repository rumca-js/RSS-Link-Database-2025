Love is okay, but please, no cheesy relationships like in movies where some guy wants to meet some girl, but neither wants to confess their love in the end. That&#39;s so triggering. If the love themes in a book aren&#39;t at all traditional, or if they&#39;re queer relationships that aren&#39;t traditional either, then great. The inner pain should be intense; you should feel the characters&#39; fear, and fantasy elements are welcome.

I remember scenes of him being inside his house and also outside. He was wearing a scarf, and I remember a scene where he was leaving his house to go do something (I don\u2019t remember what). Definitely from late 90s or early 2000s (I read it as a kid during that time). It was an English book, or at least the version I had was in English.

Not because the author is imposing them but because of how the character has internalized the culture and society she grew up with into her actions and behaviour. </p> <p>I&#39;d prefer there be no major romance and that the story isn&#39;t about disliking being a woman in society. I don;t want the main character to be too self-aware. </p> <p>All genres except romance are totally fine.

I&#39;d like to do some learning and research on medival times, my goal is to know enough to write a plausible story set in those times. My story would be fantasy, but I&#39;d like to write a realistic setting, so I&#39;d love to read a book about the whole time period to help me understand what century exactly should I set my story in. I&#39;d prefer if they were easy read to get into the topic, I&#39;d prefer not to keep a dictionary open the whole time just to understand what I&#39;m reading. If you have any suggestions for books written in italian that would be perfect as well!

Most books I see have instant passion but I truly believe the greatest love is the one that can withstand even when passion sometimes fades!</p> <p>For some back story, my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years and we met shortly after my father passed away. He made me laugh when I thought I couldn\u2019t and he still takes care of me and comforts me years later, even when I know it can be difficult. Larry and Joan\u2019s love through decades with grief and mortgages and children inspired me to be more deliberate in choosing to love him and still work together even when life gets hard. I particularly loved Elizabeth Olsen\u2019s monologue on love and it perfectly encapsulated my feelings on it.</p> <p>I prefer fiction.
