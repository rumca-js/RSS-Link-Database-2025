        "description": "I need to seal the gap between my drywall ceiling and framing. I'm using Great Stuff Wide Spray because it'll close that gap and prevent air from getting into the bathroom below.

Many thanks to Great Stuff for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25 #insulation #greatstufffoam #homerepairtutor #sponsored",
