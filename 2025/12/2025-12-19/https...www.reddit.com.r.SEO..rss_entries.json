But they have like 20-35 spam backlinks from different domains too. After doing some research, I found that in most cases it\u2019s not recommended to use the Disavow Tool, since Google usually ignores this type of automated spam (crawler / scraper / sitewide links) unless there\u2019s a manual action.</p> <p>That said, I\u2019m still a bit unsure about the best practical approach. Apart from monitoring the situation and making sure there are no issues in Manual Actions or Security, is there anything else you would actively do in a case like this?</p> <p>It also feels a bit awkward to tell a client that \u201cwe should just leave them there\u201d even if that\u2019s technically the correct answer. How do you usually explain this to clients, and do you take any preventive steps, or just keep an eye on it?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any insights.</p> <",
