In my estimation, some of it is AMAZING, most is good to great, and some is meh to kinda bad. </p> <p>It seems to me that a common talking point around his work is that Sanderson isn\u2019t really the best author. He is a pretty good author that consistently writes pretty good books, and his success is mainly due to that consistency and accessibility. </p> <p>This point might be true, I\u2019m not sure, but it does sort of assume that there are clearly better writers out there than Sanderson.

It&#39;s not something easily digestible or something that will make your jaw drop with its plot twists. In short, she&#39;s not for most people---and a quick look at her Goodreads score will back up these statements. </p> <p>And yet, her work is un-putdownable. </p> <p>The prose is the best I&#39;ve ever read, dead or alive. It&#39;s poetry, meticulously planned over and sharpened to a knife&#39;s point. I&#39;ll never forget reading the first few pages of <em>Court of Broken Knives</em> and how utterly enraptured I was by it. I&#39;d never read anything like that, and I binged the rest of the trilogy over the course of the next week. She&#39;s now up there with Abercrombie, Erikson, de Castell, Ruocchio, and Anthony Ryan for my most read authors. </p> <p>Looking back, it took a bunch of recommendations for me to pick up her work.
