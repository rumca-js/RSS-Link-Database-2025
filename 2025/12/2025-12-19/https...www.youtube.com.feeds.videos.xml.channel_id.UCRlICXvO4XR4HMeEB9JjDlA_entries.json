        "description": "In the mid-12th century, two unknown children with bright green skin were found near the English village of Woolpit. They spoke an unfamiliar language, refused most food until they discovered broad beans, and were taken in by locals. The girl eventually learned English and described a homeland called Saint Martin\u2019s Land, a twilight place where people had green skin, separated by a river from a land always in daylight, and claimed they reached Woolpit after following mysterious music through a cave.",
