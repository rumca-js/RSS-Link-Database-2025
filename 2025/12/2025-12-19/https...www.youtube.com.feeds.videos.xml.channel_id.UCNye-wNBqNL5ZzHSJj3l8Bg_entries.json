A teacher and local mothers demand answers and form an action group to investigate the cause. When they team up with a scientist, they find out their water is highly radioactive.\n\nCorporate agriculture for export has depleted the aquifers, leaving behind an ancient layer of groundwater that is poisoning their town. This revelation prompts national outrage and leads the government to cut off the town\u2019s water supply, while some officials still claim that the water is safe.\n\nAs the community turns against the women, they face a difficult choice. They must either give up their activism or keep fighting for clean water and environmental justice.\n\nThe Age of Water is a documentary film by Isabel Alcantara Atalaya and Alfredo Alcantara.\n\n#aljazeeraenglish #Mexico #documentary #water",
