If that data is accurate, it means OpenAI lost about 12 million people per day over the last week.

I\u2019ve heard that alt text should be concise, but should it also be descriptive enough to give context to the image, or is it okay to just use a focused keyword for SEO purposes? Also, is there a general character limit that makes alt text most effective, or should we keep it longer to fully describe the image?
