Skip the boring gifts - get a gift that gets you or surprise someone who shares your fandom with Displate using https://displate.com/l/upisnotjump or my discount code UPISNOTJUMP. Thanks to Displate for sponsoring the video! \n\nFallout 76 Is An Absolute Nightmare is here!\n\nI return to Fallout 76 to see if it has gotten any better. In this video I review Fallout 76\u2019s general content which was basically me walking around completing whatever quests I felt like.\n\nI will make a Fallout 76 part 2 in the future where I review each of the updates individually in full, including \u201cFallout 76 - Bitter Springs\u201d which just came out!\n\nI also touch a bit on Fallout 4: Anniversary edition in this vid. \n\nLinkz\nPatreon bros:  https://patreon.com/upisnotjump  \nInstagram:  https://www.instagram.com/upisnotjumpofficial/\nTwitter-o-fish: https://x.com/UpIsNotJump\n\nCamera work:\nCameron Lee\n\nSome special effects by: MudanTV",
