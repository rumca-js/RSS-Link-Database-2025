Marie, CIO of a fictional, forward-thinking European healthcare startup, pores over proposals from cloud vendors. Her company is on the verge of launching AI-powered diagnostics but must keep every byte of patient data within EU borders to comply with strict regional privacy laws. On her desk are slick portfolios from Microsoft, AWS, and Google, all touting sovereign cloud options in the EU. Alongside them are proposals from national cloud providers\u2014smaller, perhaps, but wholly grounded in local laws and run by European nationals. After consulting several legal teams, Marie chooses the local sovereign cloud, believing it\u2019s the safer, smarter option for an EU-based",
