Going to cross-post but I thought this would be the best place to host it since we are discussing malware. </p> <p>I have other malware on my computer so that could be how I was targeted specifically. Nothing detected.</p> <p>To start, I inquired about the Virus Total Premium API. Filled out the form on <a href=\"http://Virustotal.com\">Virustotal.com</a>, connected to someone at VT via email, they told me since I was in school, I could just send them a school email address, and they would activate on that account. I did that. It worked and still does.</p> <p>A couple days later, I get a phone call that says GOOGLE as caller ID. I pick up and it&#39;s someone saying they are from Virus Total and would like to schedule a meeting with me to discuss the premium API (Google owns Virus Total.) I agreed since I needed a specific feature that wasn&#39;t provided in the academic API. He tells me to check my email and accept the go",
