For those that haven&#39;t it give a well written history of the rise of commercial data companies and how they linked up with government intelligence agencies post 9/11. It plainly lays out how the government now has access to vast troves of information that it would either be prohibited from collecting or require warrants. This is especially concerning to me now that we have an administration that is obviously so lawless and reckless.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/panthrosrevenge\"> /u/panthrosrevenge </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1peklzg/just_finished_reading_means_of_control_by_byron/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1peklzg/just_finished_reading_means_of_control_by_byron/\">[comments]</a></span>",
