The NAS HDDs I have in the HTPC are great but too loud for an on-desktop PC. Any suggestions for good HDDs? Speed is great but most important is of course mean faliure rate.</p> <p>Thanks for any reply and with kind regards</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bobolgob\"> /u/bobolgob </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1pei8m0/extra_hdd_for_desktop_suggestion/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1pei8m0/extra_hdd_for_desktop_suggestion/\">[comments]</a></span>",
