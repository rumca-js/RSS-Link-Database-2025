But has the world changed around him? As an assistant bravely points out, there may be teenagers auditioning for his latest project who have barely heard of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/one-direction\">One Direction</a>. Appropriately, there\u2019s something old school about this series in which Cowell assembles a new boyband \u2013 but, possibly for that reason, as the familiar process of auditions, boot camps and eliminations begins, it\u2019s easy to settle in for the duration.

Soft, chewy, marshmallow-coated Rice Krispies are studded with pistachios and cranberries, chocolate and ginger, or peppermint candy cane; they\u2019re as fun to make as they are to eat, and they make a perfect little gift. To add a ribbon for hanging, cut small lengths of ribbon, then loop and knot the ends. Push the knotted end gently into the top of each ball while it\u2019s still pliable, then reshape around it, so it holds the knot securely as it sets. Alternatively, wrap each bauble in cellophane, then gather at the top and tie with a ribbon, leaving a long loop for hanging.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/dec/05/edible-christmas-baubles-recipe-rice-krispies-helen-goh\">Continue reading...</a>",
