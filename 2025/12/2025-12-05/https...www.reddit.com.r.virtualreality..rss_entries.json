Cut to now, I started using it again with no problems, and I really love everything about VR. I mostly play VRchat due to the lack of clubs I have near me IRL. Love to talk to people and be anonymous. I have a lot of space to work with in my room. That being said:</p> <ol> <li>Is it worth going to the Quest 3? (Selling my Quest 2 to go towards it)</li> <li>Are there any affordable gaming laptops that will improve my experience with my current device? I have an Acer Aspire 5 laptop (Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, a 256GB or 512GB NVMe SSD, and Wi-Fi 6 support)</li> <li>What&#39;s the deal with full body tracking? Saw some expensive ones on Amazon with mixed reviews.</li> <li>What can I do as a setup for under $1000 (with the context that I would be selling my Q2)</li> </ol> <p>Thank you!! <",

I&#39;ve seen some places offering prescriptions lenses for VR, but I had eye surgery last year so my prescription is always too strong for these sort of lenses (I have to pay almost \u00a3200 just to thin my lense on my right eye to fit in a frame!)
