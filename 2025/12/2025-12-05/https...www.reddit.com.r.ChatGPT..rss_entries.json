Yeah, it meets expectations. Plus, it lets you customize a lot, like, you want the screen closer? Closer. You want it further away? Further away, bigger. It lets you, let&#39;s say, personalize the screen to your liking, however you want. The image quality is good. I mean, you can tell it&#39;s not 4K, but it&#39;s very good. And the colors are great. For the price, I&#39;m not going to complain at all. Also, the glasses have their own sound too. They include a kind of built-in headphones. I mean, there&#39;s like an area where the sound comes out, which is a plus. And well, there are still more things I have to investigat",
