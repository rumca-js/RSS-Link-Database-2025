        "description": "Lars Gotrich | December 5, 2025\nThere's nothing easy about the laid-back cool of Air's music. On record and for film soundtracks, the French electronic duo turns distressed dreams into symphonies plucked from cotton candy clouds \u2014 sonically light, but heavy with emotion. Yet to see Air's members perform live, everything seems so effortless.\n\nNicolas Godin and Jean-Beno\u00eet Dunckel have been looking back on Air's catalog recently, extending the anniversary tour of their debut album. Surrounded by synths and keys bearing Air's block-letter logo, the band opens this Tiny Desk with \"Le Voyage de P\u00e9n\u00e9lope,\" the piano-driven, interstellar fantasia from 1998's Moon Safari. Talkie Walkie's \"Cherry Blossom Girl,\" a sweet love song with slightly sinister undertones, gets stripped back to acoustic guitar, a sparse Rhodes melody and close harmonies.\n\nOfficially released 25 years ago, Air's score for The Virgin Suicides, Sofia Coppola's first film, still captures a specific, yet universal nostaglia.",
