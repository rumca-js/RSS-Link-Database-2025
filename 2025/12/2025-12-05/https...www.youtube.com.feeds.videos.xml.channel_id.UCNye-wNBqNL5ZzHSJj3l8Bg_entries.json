Annual trade between the two countries has reached 68 billion dollars \u2014 more than five times what it was before the war in Ukraine. Since 2022, India has become the largest buyer of Russia\u2019s seaborne crude, with oil accounting for around 50 billion dollars of their total trade.\n\nIndia has also spent roughly 60 billion dollars on Russian weapons over the past two decades. In the nuclear sector, Russia is building six reactors in India and is expected to supply the fuel for them.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Donald Trump has accused India of helping to fund Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and in August he raised tariffs on most Indian goods to 50 percent.\n\nThis video breaks down the growing economic ties between India and Russia and how they\u2019re shaping global dynamics.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Yulia Shapovalova reports.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X : https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind ",

        "description": "The Pentagon released footage showing the targeting of a boat in the Caribbean last year, followed by a second strike that sparked widespread controversy in the US Congress. The report raises legal questions about targeting survivors who were unable to resist, as well as varied reactions among lawmakers.\nIt also covers the growing debate over decisions made by the US Department of Defense, including an investigation into the use of a personal phone to share sensitive information about a military strike. The content highlights potential risks to US forces, calls for accountability, and political stances supporting the continuation of military operations.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Patty Culhane reports.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X : https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDownload AJE Mobile App: ",
