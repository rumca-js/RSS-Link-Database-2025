        "description": "Once, the Aral Sea was one of the largest lakes on Earth. Today, it\u2019s a dried-up desert filled with abandoned Soviet shipwrecks, rusting on sand where waves used to hit. In this video, I travel to the Aral Sea region to see what\u2019s left, meet people who still live here, and spend the night inside a Soviet shipwreck that hasn\u2019t touched water in decades.\n\nenjoy, mike x\n\nSome other vids you should watch:\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkRw1vkk6lI&t=48s\n  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAP5fcOCChw\n\n\n\n------- \nEmail me: mike@mikeokay.co.uk\nFollow me on insta:   https://www.instagram.com/mikeokayyt/",
