They were emotional in such a soft, aching way that I actually got teary.</p> <p>Both main characters were amazing and incredibly lovable. I especially loved that Roman didn\u2019t come off as the typical alpha-male hero that a lot of romantasy writers lean into. I\u2019m not usually a big romantasy reader, but the romance in this book had me smiling so widely.</p> <p>I\u2019m planning to pick up the sequel right away, but I was wondering if you all had any recommendations for books like Divine Rivals?

Not biographies, but books about humans mixed with near-journalistic exploration into history and culture. </p> <p>Examples: </p> <p>The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down </p> <p>The Cost of Free Land: Jews, Lakota, and an American Inheritance</p> <p>Prince Among Slaves </p> <p>Infidel: My Life</p> <p>Out of the Sierra: A Story of Rar\u00e1muri Resistance</p> <p>I&#39;d especially love history books that have a narrative or human focus. I loved reading 1491 back in the day. </p> <p>I&#39;m about to be on winter break and I want to fill my brain with reading!
