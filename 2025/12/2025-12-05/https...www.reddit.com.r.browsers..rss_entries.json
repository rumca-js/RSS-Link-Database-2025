But these extensions somehow still manage to request and stream the content without any CORS issues.</p> <p>So my question is:<br/> <strong>How are these extensions \u201cfaking\u201d or bypassing CORS headers?</strong><br/> Are they intercepting network requests at the extension level and adding custom headers, or rerouting the requests through a background service, or doing something else completely?</",
