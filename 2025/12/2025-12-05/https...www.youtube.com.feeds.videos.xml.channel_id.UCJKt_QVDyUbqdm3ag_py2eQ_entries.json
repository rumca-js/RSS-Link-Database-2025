Playback using SND Player v1.51. Brainworx VST effects applied.\n\nSTe hardware has its issues and mine is not an exception. The infamous DAC whistle was removed using iZotope RX spectral de-noiser. DMA audio crackling, while not 100% eliminated, got improved dramatically after applying Exxos STE DAC CRACKLES POP FIX (additional grounding for U500 and U501 via bodge wires). STe also has very hot RCA outputs. Luckily RME Babyface Pro FS in professional +4 dBu recording reference level mode can take it without clipping.",
