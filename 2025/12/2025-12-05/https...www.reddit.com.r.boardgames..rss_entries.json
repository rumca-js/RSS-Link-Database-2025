I heard that it was similar to the Witcher Old World and wanted to hear people&#39;s opinions. I prefer co-op games so never got old world, but I am a big fan of the Witcher video games and enjoy painting minis. I haven&#39;t played many legacy games (just pandemic season 1 and about 10 scenarios in gloomhaven so far, and I&#39;ve got oathsworn ready for once I finish painting all the minis) but think the ones I&#39;ve played have been super cool. I think the card combo mechanic also sounds cool - slay the spire is my favorite board game, for reference. </p> <p>All that said, I&#39;m a bit worried about IP tie-in games with lots of minis falling flat gameplay wise. I&#39;ve heard the elden ring board game, for example, is not very good and assume that slay the spire only works as well as it does because the video game was basically just a",

And yet Medina (2nd edition), Hellas, Marracash, Nyet, etc. are close to $100 on the secondary market (if you can find them).
