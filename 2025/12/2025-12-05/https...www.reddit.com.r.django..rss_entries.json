Now that I think about it,I do not have any solid experience in developing applications using any technology. I have been interested in developing web applications from a long time but never got past the crud application barrier.</p> <p>Today I thought to change that and get some real experience in developing a web application which will be more than a simple crud application with a proper database, authentication,caching,message queues all that sort of stuff. I have a few ideas in mind which I&#39;d like to build upon. I&#39;ll be doing this after my day job during my free time,so this will be more of a side project.</p> <p>If anyone is in the same boat or wants to build something in general,please comment or shoot me a DM.</p> <p>Thankyou for reading.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",

It currently goes something like:</p> <p>Legacy ERP &gt;&gt; ODBC &gt;&gt; Flask (also onsite, different bare metal) &gt;&gt; JSON &gt;&gt; Django Command via cron</p> <p>Those upserts need to be run in the middle of the night, and since they can take a few minutes they are set up with cron to run the management commands. With a Cap&#39;n Proto system, I could get away with running (or, more accurately, streaming) these at any time. </p> <p>The JSON payloads get kinda big, and there are a bunch of other queries I&#39;d like to be able to run but I just don&#39;t because they can get deeply nested very quickly (product &gt;&gt; invoice &gt;&gt; customer &gt;&gt; quotes)</p>",
