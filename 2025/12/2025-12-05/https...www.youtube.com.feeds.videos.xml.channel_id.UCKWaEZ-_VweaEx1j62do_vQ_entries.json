        "description": "Visit Mixture of Experts podcast page to get more AI content \u2192 https://ibm.biz/Bdb9GX\n\nIs open source winning the AI race? This week on Mixture of Experts, we analyze three major model releases that dropped in the final weeks of 2025: Mistral 3, DeepSeek-V3.2 and Claude Opus 4.5. Our experts discuss what makes each model unique\u2014from Mistral\u2019s multimodal capabilities to DeepSeek\u2019s reasoning-first approach and Claude\u2019s developer focus. Are there too many good models?  \n\nNext, a provocative blog post from Theory Ventures argues Gemini 3 proves scaling laws are throwing more compute at the problem. We debate if scaling laws are a universal truth.  \n\nFinally, Amazon just blocked ChatGPT\u2019s shopping research agent from accessing product data. We discuss the business incentives threatening the agent dream.  Join host Tim Hwang and panelists Aaron Baughman, Abraham Daniels and Gabe Goodhart on this week\u2019s Mixture of Experts for more! \n\n00:00 \u2013 Intro \n02:05 -- Model launches: Mistral 3, DeepSee",
