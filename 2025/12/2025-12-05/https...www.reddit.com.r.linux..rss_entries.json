Compiling everything from source is a chore and I&#39;m in the command line way more than I would like but I have been able to still use it fine. Recently, I got Wayland working and am running Gnome just to have a traditional DE. </p> <p>I have learned so much from this experience but I want to learn more about ways I can make an ISO from what I have created so I can install on another machine. Honestly just curious if anyone else has done this and just seeking insight. I am not very experienced with tools like SquashFS, rsync, or xorriso. Any other tools out there that would help put in my goal of making a bootable ISO?</p> <p>Any advice, tricks or tips would be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Itchy_Character_3724\"> /u/Itchy_Character_3724 </a> <br/> <span><a href",

I&#39;m seeing mixed sentiment on performance and driver issues with Lunar Lake. I&#39;m currently using Garuda Dragonized on the laptop I&#39;m replacing, but I&#39;m wondering if another distro would be a better fit on the new hardware. Can anyone recommend a good daily driver distro that can also handle some light indie games and emulation but plays well with Lunar Lake?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BramdeusBrozart\"> /u/BramdeusBrozart </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1pekins/state_of_linux_on_lunar_lake/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1pekins/state_of_linux_on_lunar_lake/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I see that I could create my own Equalizer settings, but I&#39;d have to translate this rough graph from the phone to 32-band EQ by hand, and I&#39;d be making a lot of guesses.
