        "description": "Ann Padley and Jenny Millar, co-authors of The Pricing Sprint and leaders of the consultancy Untapped Pricing, explore why many companies are losing value because customers aren\u2019t perceiving their prices as intended. Drawing from their deep expertise in behavioral pricing strategy, Padley and Millar unpack how anchoring, choice architecture and decision simplicity can meaningfully shift purchasing behavior without altering a single price point. In a market defined by rising costs and limited pricing power, the next wave of commercial growth will come from understanding how customers actually make decisions and designing pricing strategies that reflect those real-world behaviors.",
