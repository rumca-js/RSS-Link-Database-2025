We\u2019ll talk through how the team ported a GameObject-only demo into a full-fledged DOTS game - one that can handle thousands of projectiles, modifiers, and enemies on screen at once. Along the way, they\u2019ll share what worked, what they learned the hard way, and what they\u2019d do differently next time.",
