I felt devastated by his descriptions of the violence and death experienced by the Palestinians that he saw in the war. He talks about how he wishes he could un-see these tragedies and I felt the same after hearing about them. He also criticizes the western world for supporting the Israelis and turning a blind eye to the atrocities. </p> <p>I also think this book does a great job of criticizing the western world for its hypocrisy in that it says all are entitled to freedom and justice, but it really only means a privileged few. In fact, the book argues that the western world is by design meant to leave out many groups of people in its ideals.</p",

I have spent a lot of time thinking about and coming up with my own interpretations of the different themes. However, I am struggling with the SA scene. It&#39;s an odd occurrence that doesn&#39;t seem to fit the general feminist or sexual freedom/liberation ideas. I understand how Shevek got into the situation but he never reflects or demonstrates remorse or even understanding of what exactly ocurred. </p> <p>Does anyone have any theories or strongly held feelings on that scene?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Boring-Oakenshield\"> /u/Boring-Oakenshield </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1peigs3/the_dispossessed_by_ursula_k_le_guin/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1peigs3/the_dispossessed_by_ursula_k_le_guin/\">[comments]</a></span>",
