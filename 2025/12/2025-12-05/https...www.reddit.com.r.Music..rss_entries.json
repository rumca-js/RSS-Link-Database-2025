I found out that some of these songs that absolutely blew up in my country / city (Indonesia/Jakarta) didn&#39;t exactly had such an impact overseas.</p> <p>An example would be Craig David&#39;s Insomnia, MKTO&#39;s classic or Iyaz&#39; Solo. You could not avoid these songs on the radio if you were in my city but I was shocked to find these were not as big as it was.</p> <p>Do you guys have any other examples in your country?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Triloo_\"> /u/Triloo_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1pf91ce/american_artists_or_their_songs_that_you_were/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1pf91ce/american_artists_or_their_songs_that_you_were/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Also I&#39;ve recently had people in my family with constant tinnitus try this, also with amazing results.</p> <p>It basically just relaxes your suboccipital muscles, leading to significant tension relief, which leads to noise reduction. It won&#39;t work for everyone neither is it a cure, but it&#39;s probably the best relief there is.</p> <p>I&#39;m just sharing this because I hate nothing more than suffering.</p> <p>Always go to concerts and clubs with ear protection, and don&#39;t listen to music on headphones too loud.

Normally it is the thing I am most passionate about and the thing that keeps me excited.</p> <p>But out of nowhere music does not hit the way it used to. Songs I loved feel flat, I get bored very fast, and even new releases from artists I usually enjoy do not do much for me. My taste is also shifting a lot but nothing feels as exciting or meaningful as before.</p> <p>It feels like I am stuck between old favorites that do not feel the same and new music I cannot fully connect to. And because music is such a big part of my life it honestly stresses me out more than it should.</p> <p>Does anyone else go through phases like this Did it eventually go away How do you deal with it when music suddenly does not feel the same anymore",
