But many voices are cut during dialogues, and the game freezes at the end of the first level, when the first boss dialog gets interrupted. The problem happens with Ares but I am wondering if this is a problem specific to the emulator or just about the pc engine CD .

The basic gameplay isn\u2019t amazing necessarily but it\u2019s solid. Being able to baseball bat projectiles back at enemies is a really nice touch. Good music, graphics, and crawling around like a worm add to the enjoyment.

I then convert that scart cable to component with a cheap bitfunx scart to component adapter. </p> <p>It works really well excessive cabling aside. </p> <p>I have an opportunity to get a Retrotink 5x-pro at a good price which would help bringing consoles to friends homes.

I\u2019m 18, and when i was younger i had a whole pack of computer games on cds that you could play. This game did not come in a pack i don\u2019t think i just had them all in one place lol. One of them was something to do with a little green alien, who possibly came to earth to teach a brother and sister math, or some other subject? I know math was involved, and there was a little girl and boy but i do not remember the relation between them. I\u2019m imaging this game with very low quality, a scene where you had to move things in a junkyard to get through it, and a playground where you did math. Any help is sooooo appreciated! It is not diggys adventure, space kids, cluefinders, abe\u2019s odyssey, junk land jam, math blaster, or mac n me. I know this is no info at the same time being a lot of info but this is all i know haha.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://",
