We look at how the relationship between Infantino and Trump has developed since then, and examine claims that the FIFA World Cup is being over politicised by both men.\n\nThe US president has threatened to move scheduled games away from Democrat cities, and the FIFA president has been criticised for creating a special peace prize that Donald Trump is widely expected to win.\n\nWhat does the World Cup really mean for Donald Trump, and how will that impact on wider America, and the fans who watch the event?\n\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.b",
