        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\n\nThe entertainment industry went through a massive shake-up early today when Netflix announced it had entered into an agreement to buy Warner Bros. Discovery for a massive $82.7 billion dollars. WBD had been shopping itself to prospective buyers in recent weeks, with rival Paramount also bidding. While the deal isn't yet finalized (and won't be until later next year), Netflix is expected to acquire WB's massive library of movies and IP, including Game of Thrones and DC Entertainment. In other news, dataminers may have found evidence of upcoming Mario Kart World DLC that may bring a Donkey Kong Bananza boss to the game. And finally, prolific actor Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa passed away yesterday at the age of 75. He was best-known for bringing Mortal Kombat villain Shang Tsung to live action in the 1995 move version, and reprising the role in later video game installments, as well.\n\n#Netflix #WarnerBros #IGN",

Terminator 2 game.\n\nTerminator 2D: No Fate from Bitmap Bureau looks fantastic and we're very excited to play it, but what about the Terminator 2 games that came before? Most are fine, but none of them can beat the weirdness of the very first Terminator 2 game ever released. Watch Eurogamer's very own T-32 Ian Higton delve into the inspirations behind the development of Terminator 2D: No Fate and find out all about the history of the weirdest Terminator 2 game ever made, which, believe it or not, was developed in the 5th worst place to live IN THE WORLD!\n\nThis video was created by Ian Higton and was originally featured on Eurogamer.\n\n#IGN #Eurogamer #Terminator2",
