        "description": "I colorized, restored, and created a complete sound design for this rare 1935 footage showing Soviet Leningrad and Moscow at a pivotal moment in early Soviet history. The film offers a remarkable look at Moscow\u2019s Kremlin, Saint Basil\u2019s Cathedral on Red Square, the Kremlin gates, Lenin\u2019s Mausoleum, monuments and parks, Stalin\u2019s residence, traditional Russian architecture, early Soviet apartment blocks, and street life with vintage automobiles, trolleys, and old droskies. The Leningrad section reveals the city as the \u201cGateway to the Soviet Republic,\u201d featuring the Imperial Palace, the Hermitage Museum, its historic mosque, and the Summer Palace at Detskoye Selo. A unique visual record of the USSR during the mid-1930s.\n\nVideo Restoration Process:\n\u2714 FPS boosted to 60 frames per second \n\u2714 Image resolution boosted up to HD \n\u2714 Improved video sharpness and brightness \n\u2714 Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)\n\u2714added sound only for the ambiance\n\u2714restoration:(stabilisation,d",
