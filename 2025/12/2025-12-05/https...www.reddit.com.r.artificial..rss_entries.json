They boost controversial posts and ones that shift your focus quickly, as well as propaganda that the company owning the platform wants you to see. And of course they tend to boost trolling and infighting in groups they don&#39;t like, especially leftist and anti-capitalist ones. Old news.</p> <p>But as AI gets better at both processing social media content and generating fake content, I wonder if it will be used for more direct mental manipulation. Like if you interact positively with a post the algorithm &quot;likes&quot;, it won&#39;t only show you more like it, it will show you something you like to give you a little dopamine or make you feel more at home with the accounts you&#39;re following, and if you engage with something it doesn&#39;t like it will do the opposite.

I&#39;m done with all my research, and I&#39;ve ironed out a handful of characters that I&#39;m interviewing from 2030. It&#39;s a very meta type of project. Regardless, I&#39;ve been working with Claude on it, and today, as part of Anthropic&#39;s AI interviewer project ( <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-interviewer\">https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-interviewer</a> ), I got flagged for an interview about my thoughts on AI. It was a surreal experience. I was being interviewed by an AI, to discuss my use of AI, where I&#39;m writing about AI and an AI character we&#39;re writing about. That&#39;s about as meta as it gets.<br/> Has anyone else had an experience like this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Herodont5",

Just dubbing in English would remove the other sounds in the video, such as music and ambient noise, so I just wanted to remove or reduce the Swedish and insert the English, leaving the rest. I used ChatGPT to guide me through the process.</p> <p>I used Faster Whisper XXL to do the translation/subtitle creation. I loaded the subtitles into Balabolka and used copious amounts of Google Fu to figure out how to add the more &quot;natural&quot; speaking models and settled on using Guy to generate the new speaking track. Then I used Ultimate Vocal Remover to separate the non-speaking audio into an &quot;instrumental&quot; file and used ffmpeg to add both the &quot;Guy&quot; and &quot;instrumental&quot; audio into the video.</p> <p>It was a fun experiment to scratch that nerd itch but it did get a bit fatiguing to listen to the same voice for each person, so ",
