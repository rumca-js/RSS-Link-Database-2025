Researchers also uncovered an unexpected role for agmatinases, enzymes that help keep this pathway in balance. Diet and gut microbes may affect aging more than expected because they produce the metabolites involved.",

        "description": "A researcher from the University of Tokyo and a U.S.-based structural engineer developed a new computational form-finding method that could change how architects and engineers design lightweight and free-form structures covering large spaces. The technique specifically helps create gridshells, thin, curved surfaces whose members form a networked grid. The method makes use of NURBS surfaces, a widely used surface representation format in computer-aided design (CAD). It also drastically reduces computation cost \u2014 a task that previously took 90 hours on a high-end GPU completes in about 90 minutes on a standard CPU.",

For those who already have elevated biomarkers, kidney problems may speed up when symptoms appear. The findings show that kidney health can change how Alzheimer\u2019s blood tests are read.
