Basically, your weapon of choice in that game.

I love to use it without any accessory, all standard. Also, this game revolutionised reload animations. </p> <p>-Beretta M9A1 (Insurgency Sandstorm): small but elegant and effective. Punchy, lightweight, my favourite pistol of all time (also &#39;cause i&#39;m italian).</p> <p>-Double Barrel Shotgun (DooM Eternal): no presentation needed: brutal, powerful, satisfying, an icon of gaming.</p> <p>-Carcano M1891 (Isonzo): i love this game, and, being italian, probably most of my total kills are with this awesome rifle.
