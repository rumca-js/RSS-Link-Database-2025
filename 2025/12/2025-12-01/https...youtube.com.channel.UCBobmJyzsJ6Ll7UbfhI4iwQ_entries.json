        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, we explore the Platform Preview in Unreal Engine and how it can be used when developing mobile games.\n\nPreviewing your game as it will appear on the final device is a critical requirement for mobile and cross-platform game content development.\n\nThere is a lack of knowledge about the Platform Preview feature in the Unreal Editor. Some people don't know it exists, others know it's there, but don't know what it can do or what its limitations are. \n\nThis talk clears all that up. We dive into what the Platform Preview can and cannot do, showcase examples where it can be useful, present new features for it in 5.6 and 5.7, and also list future developments.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#MobileGameDevelopment, #PlatformPreview, #UnrealEditor, #CrossPlatformGames, #UnrealEngine, #UE5.6, #UE 5.7,  #UnrealFestStockholm",

This session reimagines optimization as an integral part of the development process, showcasing the transformative benefits of integrating performance capture and monitoring into your pipeline.\n\nThe session shares lessons learned, emphasizing how monitoring within CI/CD workflows can help identify bottlenecks early, reduce repetitive tasks, and streamline the optimization process. \n\nThere are also actionable strategies for teams looking to modernize their approach to performance optimization, transforming it into a pro",
