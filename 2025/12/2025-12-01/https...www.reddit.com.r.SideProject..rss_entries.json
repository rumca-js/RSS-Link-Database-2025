Regular Fire Safety Drills \u2013 Ensure everyone knows how to use fire extinguishers and exit routes. 2. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS/SDS) Accessibility \u2013 Make them available and train employees. 3. Proper PPE Use \u2013 Regularly check personal protective equipment for wear and tear. 4. Incident Reporting System \u2013 Encourage reporting near-misses to prevent future accidents. 5.

It\u2019s not some dramatic transformation, but the overall feel of my skin has been better and less irritated. </p> <p>Install was quick with the included adapters, and it hasn\u2019t affected water pressure in any meaningful way. The biggest thing to understand is that it\u2019s more of a long-term quality-of-life upgrade than a miracle skincare fix. If your water has chlorine or hardness issues, it makes a real difference. If your water is already very soft, you probably won\u2019t notice as much. </p> <p>Overall, it\u2019s been a low-effort improvement to my routine.

The hardest part isn\u2019t the coaching or creating the transformation offer. It\u2019s finding people who actually need it.</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried content on Instagram and TikTok. I\u2019ve tried asking in Facebook groups. Feels like I\u2019m throwing ideas into the void.</p> <p>For those who actually got paying clients, what worked?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fluffy-Twist-4652\"> /u/Fluffy-Twist-4652 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pb1cwg/anyone_else_overwhelmed_trying_to_find_their/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pb1cwg/anyone_else_overwhelmed_trying_to_find_their/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Because it is part of our mission to help starters/builders to grow their business and we can help them through tailoring funnels. </p> <p>Aside from that, if they want other things aside from funnels, this is their choice if they want, we give them 7 days free trial to experience our App Store which aims to be a one-stop shop for businesses seeking to leverage AI to enhance their operations and workflows.</p> <p>What is the exchange for this? Time and Cooperation. To create a personalized funnel needs a better interaction with the business owner\u2014to understand the product and to know what the business owner wants and needs. </p> <p>Send me a DM so I can send the calendly where you can book for a quick meeting. </p> <p>Best regards, Claire Hernandez </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",
