I\u2019ve wanted this for a long time, and it only became affordable once offline models got fast &amp; lightweight enough (looking at you qwen3). Now it\u2019s practically free to run. You can get notifications (Slack or ntfy.sh) when something you care about or relevant shows up in a list of feeds you choose. Random examples: \u2022 a new law affecting your situation (checking gov feeds), \u2022 a security article relevant to your tech stack (if for example it\u2019s not a CVE), \u2022 etc etc etc, endless use cases. Here\u2019s an example config that triggers a notification whenever the Airbus situation is reported as \u201cback to normal\u201d: <a href=\"https://github.com/piqoni/matcha?tab=readme-ov-file#analyst-notifications\">https://github.com/piqoni/matcha?tab=readme-ov-file#analyst-notifications</a>",
