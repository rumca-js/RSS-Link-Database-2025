I want to argue that in order for fantasy to be considered marxist, it does not need to paint a picture of active class struggle, imagined in a modern or technocratic way, but that it needs to have a marxist understanding of history, meaning class struggle has to be the engine of change, of a society evolving and that the magic of the world is not only wielded by wizards, but that it lies in the bones of that engine and leads to a transcendent kind of salvation of human (or elven) kind. I also would love to read something like that. do you have examples of that kind of fantasy literature - do you have suggestions? </p> <p>tl;dr: looking for fantasy that you read and went: &quot;wait a minute, was the person that wro",

I don\u2019t want to leave too much time / amount of books in between. And especially don\u2019t dare starting a second series. </p> <p>How do you guys read series? Do you actually dare do multiple. How do you keep track without extensive note taking. </p> <p>Ps: Yes, it\u2019s silly to have these rules. I also don\u2019t start a new book if I haven\u2019t finished (or dnf) the previous.

I knew there were some books but then I looked on Wikipedia and was shocked at the amount of lore and choices for books. So I know this is a long shot but what Warhammer books if any have you read?

Which was a phenomenal listen. It is a short 10 hour adventure about a group of scoundrels called the Bastard Champions who help people out of fairytale situation in ways a main character of a fairy tale couldn&#39;t. All of this is fun, hilarious, and somehow very deep. Its a great self contained story that would have no need for a sequal... IF HE HAD NOT DROP AN ABSOLUTE BOMB OF INFORMATION IN THE LAST 3 MINUTES OF THE BOOK AND THEN HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY HE HAS MORE IMPORTANT SERIES TO WORK ON! Left me with so many questions that will never have an answer. Honestly, thats a cardinal sins punishable by death.</p> <p>In all seriousness if you havnt listened or read it you should. Its a wonderful story with an amazing trio of voice actors. A fun, although a bit dark, take on classic fairytales.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Let me explain what I mean. Fantasy series are often and usually, particularly by online forums, divided and characterised by a number of things, most notably either sub-genre (epic, grimdark, flintlock etc), or narrative structure (story driven, character driven etc). These labels can get muddled and confusing and never really properly sell you on what the series is about if you\u2019ve never heard of the series. Every fantasy has a setting. Every fantasy has characters. But to make a series really pop it has to offer something in particular. So what I want to know is which series has the coolest one sentence selling point. For example, the Witcher might be \u2018mutant monster hunter in a medieval polish world\u2019, ASOIF could be \u2018court and political intrigue in an allegorical wars of the roses setting\u2019, and gentleman bastards might be as simple as \u2018heist story in a renaissance Venice inspired city\u2019. </p> <p>Sell me some series my wonderful fantasy nerds </p> </",

It feels like a lot of worlds treat seasons as a kind of background texture that only shows up when the plot needs a dramatic snowstorm or a poetic autumn leaf moment. The rest of the time the climate just sits there in a sort of permanent late spring where people wear the same cloak for eleven straight chapters. I didnt notice it before but once I saw it I couldnt unsee it.</p> <p>The thing that pushed me over the edge was a book where the author mentioned the harvest festival three times but never once talked about planting anything. It was like the crops magically respawned off screen. And then in another series winter just refused to arrive even though the characters were supposedly traveling north.

Ive always considered myself a fantasy enjoyer, but recently I did a little head count and discovered Ive only read YA fantasy with some notable exceptions. which is fine, i enjoyed it but now Im looking for reccomendations. Ive read almost all of Brandon Sandersons books (except mistborn era 2 and the last two books of SLA). Really really love the hard magic and the extensive focus on worldbuilding and history and the science of the universe.I know it&#39;s not for everyone but the super slow buildup followed by the sanderlanche to me is so fun.

Basically how it works, is the faster it moves, the hotter it gets until it starts releasing sparks. This could be cool for arrows, for example, add a shard of this to an arrow and it\u2019ll start heating up when it gets fires.</p> <p>I would love a somewhat simple scientific reasoning for this.</p> <p>The one I have right now is: The mineral has a reaction to oxygen, when touching it, it heats up. If it\u2019s moving faster, more oxygen is touching it in a short time, so it heats up more and more. This also kind of matches how fire needs oxygen to stay ablaze.</p> <p>The issue is, I have zero clue how this would also create sparks, and I also have zero clue if this even makes sense.</p> <p>If someone could leave their own simple explanation that would be great, thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Flaming",
