The White House has never revealed what part of Trump's body was scanned and the president claimed he didn't know either. The pressure to release the results came after the president attacked Minnesota's governor, calling him the \"R\" word. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz fired back, demanding Trump come clean about his health. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed the MRI was focused on his heart and abdomen.",
