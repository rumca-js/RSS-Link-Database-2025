Many expressed frustration over insufficient law enforcement, ineffective implementation of legislation, and the continued rise in violence.\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s declaration, made on the eve of the protests, acknowledged the crisis and called for extraordinary measures to end the violence.
