The first one tells me I installed yt-dlp with pip or the wheel from Pypi and to use that to update. I don&#39;t know what that means, so I looked it up, and found that I was supposed to run one of those two other commands, but they tell me &quot;python not found; run without arguments to install from the Microsoft store, or disable this shortcut from settings&quot; with a path to disable whatever shortcut its talking about.

It automatically manages all dependencies (yt-dlp, ffmpeg, deno) and keeps yt-dlp up to date, so you can just run it and download your videos without any setup hassle.</p> <p>You can use it by filling a text file with the URLs you want to download. Right now, you can download full videos or parts of them, choose the quality, and optionally download only MP4 files.</p> <p>You can find the project on <a href=\"https://github.com/mohamedhesham1619/video-downloader\">GitHub</a></p> <p>If you find it helpful, feel free to star the repo.

Because you\u2019re not supposed to do it unless you really need to (from what I\u2019ve read). Once I\u2019ve downloaded my video, do I have to delete my cookies somehow? Remove a file? Use a command?

The audio kicks right in no problem, so I can still listen okay.</p> <p>I thought perhaps it was pulling 4k video or something, but looking on VLC it is showing it&#39;s 1080p.</p> <p>I do note that previous videos are showing the codecs as:</p> <ul> <li>Stream 0 - Video: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc 1)</li> ",
