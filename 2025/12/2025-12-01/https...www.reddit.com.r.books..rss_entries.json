The characters and world and mysteries were fascinating. I liked the development of the romance, didn\u2019t care about the sex, and prefer the straightforward adventures in Kingfisher\u2019s \u201cSworn Soldier\u201d series and \u201cNettle &amp; Bone.\u201d</p> <p>There are three other Paladin books in her \u201cSaint of Steel\u201d series, and reading the cover blurbs it looks like they more or less follow the structure of the first one. Each book focuses on a different Paladin and how they solve problems and fall in love, with Book 2 about Istvhan and Book 3 about Galen. </p> <p>And that\u2019s all fine, but I\u2019m really interested in Book 4, which is about Marguerite and Shane. Marguerite is the most compelling character from Book 1, outside the main couple Grace and Stephen, and I really want to spend more time with her. But I\u2019m not really in the mood for going through two full books of Romantasy about characters I\u2019",

I am also a registered nurse, so I was both hesitant and intrigued to read this story.</p> <p>Overall, I felt the author did a great job of portraying the era and the brutality of the Vietnam war. So many injustices were highlighted such as Agent Orange, how soldiers were treated when they came home, the lack of proper mental health care, addiction, PSTD, the horrible conditions, and of course, the lack of acknowledgement for the women who served.</p> <p>This is a work of fiction, so there were a few things that I felt took away from the realism of the story. However, I think this book has the potential to shine a light on what that time was like and hopefully give a voice to those who lost it during this war. </p> <p>This war and its repercussions defined my life in many ways. I lost 2 brothers to the effects of Agent Orange, my ",

Books don&#39;t have to be snobby literature to have these things. Pop culture &quot;trash&quot; can still be interesting in a &quot;meta&quot; sort of way.

Though I like his books because I feel he was one of the first authors to have his books focused on the lower classes. When most authors before him only wrote about the super wealthy. Out of all his books I see people often hate on Great Expectations in which I feel is a story on assimilation on trying to fit into a society that will tolerate you but will never truly accept you. I related a lot to Pip\u2019s struggles as a first generation American. Though I\u2019d like to hear why people don\u2019t like it, cause I feel I\u2019m the only one who does like the book. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Groovy-Pancakes\"> /u/Groovy-Pancakes </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1paxuye/why_do_people_hate_great_expectations/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/",
