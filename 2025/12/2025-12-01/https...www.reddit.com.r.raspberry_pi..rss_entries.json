Im hoping that someone can give me some insight into if they have had success with getting the Vision Components IMX296 MIPI sensor to work with their CM4. At one point I actually had the driver detect it with `vc-config` but I couldn&#39;t get it to work with the libcamera. I tried rebuilding the libcamera with support for the module as they instruct here but I never got it working. </p> <p>Heres the link:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/VC-MIPI-modules/vc_mipi_raspi/blob/main/docs/libcamera.md\">https://github.com/VC-MIPI-modules/vc_mipi_raspi/blob/main/docs/libcamera.md</a></p> <p>What I am trying to do is simply get a usable feed and encode it into a RTSP stream using the hardware encoder. </p> <p>I decided after failing to get it working with libcamera to simply start from zero and try again. Now, I can&#39;t even get the driver to detect the sensor. </p> <p>Anyone successfully get this working? Could really use some insights. </p",

To properly test it I&#39;m trying headless set up the rpi by imaging a preconfigured OS onto it such that the pi is booting automatically into my mobile hot spot and I can ssh into it. The problem is now if I configure the Os via the rpi imager on the first boot there existed no user and i needed to manually set up one. Therefore I then tried to manually wrote the conf files which configure the user, wifi and the ssh connection. If I did so then the pi showed a ip address when i booted but i couldnt connect to it via ssh. I&#39;m guessing that has something to do with my mobile hot spot though, since when ever i tried to ssh to an ip it simply responded with a failure message that mention that a port was closed regardless of which address I chose. Does anyone have an idea how I could fix this, or if it is even possible to connect via ssh on a mobile hot sp",
