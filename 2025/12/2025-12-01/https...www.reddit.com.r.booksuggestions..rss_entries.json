The fmc could be 35+, but not younger. I&#39;m not interested in the usual 20-something y/o cowboys or insta-love between two very young characters.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for quality writing too. Like, actually acclaimed or widely praised books. Something that people consider well-written, not just fun and steamy for its own sake. Some depth would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Extra points if it\u2019s set in the Old West.</p> <p>At least, I&#39;d like it to have that gritty ranch/cowboy atmosphere, and characters that feel like full-grown adults, mature and scarred.</p> <p>If anyone knows of any books like these, please drop them below! Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",

I asked him what he likes and his answer was: Books with real tragedy, deep melancholy. Nothing in the present, but rather in the 60s or 80s. Something that accompanies the life of a literary character over many years. Always a fucked-up life. Please help me out, I really want a good book for him but since I\u2019m not really into reading I don\u2019t really know what to look for.

I really want to read another book but tbh I feel like my preferences are really hard to come by. I want a story like the everlasting where it focuses more on the interpersonal relationships and connections. Single or dual pov with a male protagonist and a female. Prefer her to be a knight or some sort of Femdom but anything works really.

We have read through many children\u2019s novels, but she is always particularly interested in the adult books I am reading. Right now I\u2019m listening to Project Hail Mary on audio, and she joined in and is absolutely loving it. I\u2019m about halfway through, and so far it has been appropriate for her. And it made me wonder, what other adult books are technically safe for children to read? I can censor some material for her as I read it, but books with a lot of death, war, or explicit content would not work. I am excited to start reading some more books that are enjoyable for both of us! For context, I read her The Hobbit when she was 4, and she never once lost interest.

But avoiding anything that comes off like self help. I was thinking a romance where the main character is plus size and gets the guy, loves herself etc ..... But no spice lol everything seems to be spice and I would be murdered if I give my 12 year old niece an accidental spice book. </p> <p>I was looking at because I was a girl (but still might be to on the nose and not enough story). Or maybe something like dealing with dragons. I havent read it myself though.</p> <p>Thanks for recs ! </p> <p>PS - medium curse words would probably be ok, but maybe not Samuel L Jackson level if that makes sense.

Just in case it matters, I would love to read a book that has the general feel of Indiana Jones, National Treasure, or the Tomb Raider <em>game</em> trilogy from the 2010\u2019s: swashbuckling adventure, sure, but also a healthy dose of historical fiction\u2014archeology, historical ties, ancient treasure, etc. I don\u2019t care if the history isn\u2019t perfect\u2014it\u2019s fiction, after all\u2014but I\u2019m looking for that historical lens on top of the adventure. Not just buried treasure or a roguish leading man/lady. </p> <p>Note that I\u2019m using \u201chistorical fiction\u201d loosely, as I mean it more in the sense that \u201cI know Egypt didn\u2019t actually have a superpowered pharaoh that bound his soul to a powerful artifact,\u201d not \u201cthis book is set in 1462 Rome.\u201d </p> <p>I appreciate any suggestio",
