        "description": "Charles Vane was one of the most ruthless pirates of the Golden Age. Known for his defiance, cruelty, and refusal to accept the King\u2019s pardon, Vane terrorized the Caribbean with daring raids and brutal tactics. From firing a flaming ship at Governor Woodes Rogers to leading the infamous Flying Gang in Nassau, his story is filled with betrayal, mutiny, and ultimate downfall. Shipwrecked, captured, and finally hanged in Jamaica in 1721.\n\n #CharlesVane #PirateHistory #Shorts #GoldenAgeOfPiracy",
