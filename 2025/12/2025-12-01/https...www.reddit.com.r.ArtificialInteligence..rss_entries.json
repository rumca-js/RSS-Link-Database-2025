However, backprop is often criticised for lacking biological plausibility. Recently, it has been shown that backprop in multilayer-perceptrons (MLPs) can be approximated using predictive coding, a biologically-plausible process theory of cortical computation which relies only on local and Hebbian updates. The power of backprop, however, lies not in its instantiation in MLPs, but rather in the concept of automatic differentiation which allows for the optimisation of any differentiable program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we demonstrate that predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice rapidly) to exact backprop gradients on arbitrary comput",

We know that AI models are always being trained out of human generated content like content I make is human generated, including this thing. If you\u2019re using AI, I recommend you that you do not upload AI generated essays because your school can flag it and we really want authenticity. AI generated essays are considered low effort so please write everything in your own words so you do not fail class.

For example, if Anthropic decided tomorrow to open source Sonnet 4.5, how many 5090s/how much RAM would I need? I know we can\u2019t know for sure, but are we talking about needing an entire data center to run the model at the speed currently offered by the API for a single user at a time? Or are we at the point where something like 4 5090s could achieve that? GPT-OSS 120B only needs about 64GB of memory. Is GPT 5.1 double that? Quadruple?
