        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\n\nIn a recent financial call, CD Projekt may have revealed its release plans for the next Witcher trilogy. The Witcher 4 is currently in development with no definitive release date, but CD Projekt wants The Witcher 5 and 6 to follow closely behind, with the goal of releasing those next three games within a 6-year window. Developer CD Projekt RED is not known for rushing its game releases, but the team attributes Unreal Engine 5 as helping to speed up their process. In other news, a new leak of development footage from Grand Theft Auto 6 has hit the internet, before quickly being scrubbed by Rockstar Games. However, the new footage didn't reveal much, just some animation tests and near-confirmation that a bike rental service will be included in the game. Exciting. And finally, IO Interactive has its hands full with 007: First Light, but it will return to the Hitman universe with the brand-new Hitman 4 some time in the future.\n\n#TheWitcher #Gaming #IGN",

If you\u2019re not already into the genre, I doubt Cosmic Invasion will change your mind, but it\u2019s good enough to get my Avengers assembled on a lazy Sunday, kick back, and pop some baddies in the mouth.\n\n#IGN #MarvelCosmicInvasion #MarvelGames",
