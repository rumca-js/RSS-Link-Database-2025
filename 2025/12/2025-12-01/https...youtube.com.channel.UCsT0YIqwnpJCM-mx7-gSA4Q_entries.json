In this talk, I challenge the myth that AI is neutral or purely technical. AI is not just code\u2014it\u2019s culture. Technologies can carry the beliefs, assumptions, and values of its creators. And since most AI is built in the Global North, when African societies adopt these technologies, we\u2019re not just importing tools\u2014we\u2019re importing worldviews and culture that can overshadow and even erase indigenous African knowledge and ways of life. These tools are doing more than making life convenient. They\u2019re redefining what we value, how we live, and even what we consider \u201cnormal\u201d in Africa.

        "description": "Nasreen's talk critically examines key ethical challenges in Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) within Sub-Saharan Africa, including algorithmic bias, digital literacy gaps, and systemic inequities that overshadow AI\u2019s potential as a transformative educational tool. \nShe argues that providing access to digital tools alone is insufficient; students must develop critical thinking skills to enhance digital literacy and meaningfully engage with AI-driven education (UNESCO, 2023:14). Achieving this requires a shift in AI governance and policy from efficiency-driven models to ethical frameworks that empower students, ensuring AI does not exacerbate existing disparities. To address these challenges, I propose the Equitable AI in Digital Education (EQUID) framework, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 4.6 and SDG 4.7) as a capability-enhancing approach for strengthening the functional capabilities of marginalized students in Sub-Saharan Africa.

        "description": "La Dott.ssa Fantinel esplora la rappresentazione di alcuni miti nella storia dell'arte affrontando la loro evoluzione culturale. Da un rapporto con la natura simbiotico siamo passati ad una percezione di predominanza dell'Uomo sul creato per tornare, oggi, a sentire il desiderio di unire dimensione spirituale e ambiente.  Luisa Fantinel unisce la ricerca accademica a un approccio umano e sensibile. Dottore di ricerca in Storia delle Arti e con formazione in antropologia culturale e arte terapia, insegna in diversi master dell\u2019Universit\u00e0 di Padova e collabora con istituzioni come la Collezione Peggy Guggenheim di Venezia. Nel suo saggio \u201cL\u2019arte di morire (e di vivere)\u201d esplora il valore trasformativo dell\u2019arte nei momenti di passaggio e di fragilit\u00e0. Crede che la cultura visiva sia una chiave per comprendere la vita, per dialogare con l\u2019emotivit\u00e0 e per ritrovare un equilibrio tra il s\u00e9 e il mondo.

Architetto e designer, Paolo Deganello \u00e8 tra i protagonisti del design radicale, movimento che ha ridefinito negli anni \u201960 il modo di intendere il progetto. Nel 1966 fonda lo studio Archizoom Associati insieme a Andrea Branzi, Gilberto Corretti e Massimo Morozzi, portando una visione che unisce critica, sperimentazione e libert\u00e0 creativa. Nel corso della sua carriera ha collaborato con aziende come Cassina, Driade, Venini, Zanotta e Vitra, lasciando un segno profondo nella cultura del design internazionale. Oggi continua a insegnare e a riflettere sul rapporto tra etica, estetica e sostenibilit\u00e0, convinto che progettare significhi prima di tutto immaginare nuovi modi di vivere e di abitare il mondo.

Ma la poesia \u00e8 anche l'unica forma che abbiamo di astrazione, di connessione e di verit\u00e0. Cantautore, attore e scrittore trevigiano, Giulio Casale ha costruito la sua carriera attraversando linguaggi diversi, dalla musica al teatro, dalla poesia alla narrativa. Fondatore e voce degli Estra, band simbolo del rock italiano degli anni \u201990, ha poi intrapreso un percorso solista che lo ha portato a collaborare con importanti realt\u00e0 culturali e teatrali. Nel suo lavoro la parola \u00e8 un atto politico e poetico insieme: uno strumento per interpretare il presente, raccontarne le contraddizioni e cercare nuove possibilit\u00e0 di senso.
