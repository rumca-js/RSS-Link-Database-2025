She texts me back and says no that the ring she is buying is from a brand called Ringconn. </p> <p>About half an hour goes by and I go on instagram and I get an ad for this ringconn mind you I have not looked it up, searched the name or even spoke of the company name out loud, only in that text message with my friend. </p> <p>And the text message was not on a DM or facebook or WhatsApp, nothing with meta, just my regular iMessage. </p> <p>Has this happened to anyone before?? It\u2019s kind of terrifying that an ad came up with an item that was only spoken about in iMessage it\u2019s happened to me before if I have looked something up but never through text. </p> <p>Does anyone know if there\u2019s a way to turn that feature off? </p> </div><",
