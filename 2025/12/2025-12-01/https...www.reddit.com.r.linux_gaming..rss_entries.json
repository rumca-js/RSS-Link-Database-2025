The goal would change map to map. but i remember it was to arrange numbers, or place numbers in some order and thrown them into a cauldron.

It felt like an educational/puzzle title but was available via normal distro packages.<br/> Things i am certain of is the code you &quot;wrote&quot; was very restricted and if it wasn&#39;t click and drag available options into the code editor it was something very similar.

I played some lighter games like CS2 and Peak and they worked flawlessly but when I tried to play cyberpunk everything would go south, at first it froze and I couldn\u2019t use my mouse, keyboard, touchpad, anything, even the audio won\u2019t work, I had to force stop my laptop and reboot the entire machine, I tried to force it to run on proton since I saw someone on reddit recommend this when researching to troubleshoot, after that the game still freezes but at least I can use my mouse and keyboard. It\u2019s frustrating since the best games I\u2019ve ever played and I was able to finish it twice on windows. Hope I can get some advice on how to fix this problem.

It especially sucks because 343, in their infinite wisdom, punishes leaving SSBM based matches in these ~20 year old games.</p> <p>I&#39;ve already tried multiple suggested fixes (like swapping to an older proton version, deleting the old proton version and then starting up with v7, etc) but none of them fully fix the issue. At best, they decrease the frequency of, but don&#39;t eliminate, the crashing while also adding a distracting stutter to the first couple minutes of every match.</p> <p>What&#39;s also weird is that the crash rate significantly decreases after the first crash per PC restart.

I&#39;ve used these on windows to get the most out of SDR games while gaming on an HDR monitor on Windows. </p> <p>From what I understand, KDE inverse tone maps to HDR by default when HDR is enabled, but I can&#39;t find much information about if that applies to games as well, or gamescope. It looks like gamescope has a similar functionality with the flags: --hdr-itm-enable --hdr-itm-sdr-nits xxx --hdr-itm-target-nits xxx.</p> <p>Should you enable gamescope&#39;s ITM when playing on KDE, or does KDE handle the ITM for you instead of using gamescope?

So I&#39;m guessing its not able to find the epic game cloud save games? </p> <p>I did find the button &quot;sync&quot; (it says beta). But there it stops for my knowledge. I searched a few days on Reddit but no one really points out where and how you can link the epic cloud save games and make it connect.. Can anyone point",

Tired of the AI copilot and terrible optimization, and just not feeling like I have control over my own system. My issue with Linux tho is I\u2019ve heard many games with strong anti-cheat\u2019s don\u2019t really enjoy Linux. I play a wide range of games, basically anything you can think of. I\u2019m most worried about the online casual and competitive games I play with friends such as Valorant, Fortnite, and Genshin. But perhaps it may actually be a blessing in disguise if they don\u2019t work on Linux. Either way I\u2019d still like to be able to play massively multiplayer games that contain anti-cheat software with my friends. If anyone can point me in the direction of the good Linux operating systems that have the widest range of games that run natively on the system, that would be amazing. Not that i think it\u2019ll make a difference, but my specs are a Ryzen 7 5800 XT and a 9060 XT, ",

I just closed Steam and rebooted the system. I found one post on Reddit with the same issue. The windows kept spamming until I rebooted the system. Is it some bug that happened that is related to the fact that Steam uses Chromium? Or is there a virus on my PC? Basically, all I want to know is whether I&#39;m safe or not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdLeather8736\"> /u/AdLeather8736 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1paxso3/steam_opens_up_multiple_chromelike_windows/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1paxso3/steam_opens_up_multiple_chromelike_windows/\">[comments]</a></span>",
