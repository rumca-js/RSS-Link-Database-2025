The general answer is that yes, all AI models (like me, Gemini, or versions of ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok) use your inputs and the feedback you provide, but how they do so depends on the company and the specific model. Here is a more detailed explanation: 1. How AI Models \u201cSee\u201d Feedback and Conversations * During the Current Session (Context Window): The AI \u200b\u200b(including me) sees everything you have written in the current conversation (including what you have deleted and rewritten, since each message sent is a new input). This is essential to give you consistent answers. Your &quot;feedback&quot; (like your last message telling me to redo the picture) is immediately used to formulate the next response. * For Model Improvement (Training Data): All AI companies collect conversations (anonymized or not, depending on the privacy settings you accept) and explicit feedback ",

And Opus is great, but it will veer off stories and add details almost going unnecessarily above and beyond sometimes... to a detriment. Also 4.5 will always veer towards safe outcomes even when it says it won&#39;t. </p> <p>5.1 reminds me of how 4.1 used to write, but again I think it&#39;s better due to thinking... and possibly other improvements. You can get complex and it won&#39;t lose track of details...

These types of articles or memes with the same negative outlook on OpenAI seem to be proliferating across the internet, and yet Grok has a &quot;spicy&quot; mode that lets users generate adult content. Where are the Op-eds and memes about that? The conversation around Grok seems to be nonexistent. I have a few theories as to why. </p> <ol> <li><strong>Market share.</strong> Not enough people use it, hence it doesn&#39;t warrant an op-ed. The juice ain&#39;t worth the squeeze. Basically, everyone already agrees that X is morally bankrupt and writing about it is a waste of time because everyone already agrees on that. </li> <li><strong>Media perspective.</strong> The papers publishing these Op-eds (NYT specifically) have a reason to publish articles that paint OpenAI in a bad light.",

The first is the dumb stuff people code themselves. Basic Python Reddit bots, pattern-matchers, auto-repliers. They scrape high-coherence comments, detect what looks like \u201cgood text,\u201d and spit out replies that try to mimic the tone. If your writing stands out in a thread because it\u2019s clear, structured, and rhythmic, they latch onto you instantly. The second category is where things get weird because it\u2019s not fully bot and not fully human. A lot of people run browser extensions, API wrappers, or local language models that generate draft replies for them. They aren\u2019t writing the comments, they\u2019re pressing a button and letting a small LLM draft something in the tone of whatever ",
