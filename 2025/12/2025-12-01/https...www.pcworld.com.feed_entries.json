Well, you can grab an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V67STBD\">Amicool external DVD drive for just $19 this Cyber Monday</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually $29, this drive is a massive 34 percent off right now, the lowest price we\u2019ve seen so far. Even better, it comes with both USB-A and USB-C connectors, so you can plug it in whichever port you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use this nifty gadget to read CDs and DVDs, copy files, watch movies, and play games. You can also use it to burn CDs and DVDs. Though we don\u2019t use this tech as much nowadays, it\u2019s still great to have on hand.
