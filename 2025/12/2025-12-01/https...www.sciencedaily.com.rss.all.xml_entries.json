        "description": "Chimpanzees naturally ingest surprising amounts of alcohol from ripe, fermenting fruit. Careful measurements show that their typical fruit diet can equal one to two human drinks each day. This supports the idea that alcohol exposure is not a modern human invention but an ancient primate habit. The work strengthens the \u201cdrunken monkey\u201d hypothesis and opens new questions about how animals use ethanol cues in their environment.",

By freezing tissue at the instant a signal fires, researchers revealed how synaptic vesicles behave in both mouse and human neurons. These insights could help explain why most Parkinson\u2019s cases emerge without inherited genetic changes. The technique may also point to promising new research paths for therapy development.",

These phases are separated by sudden turning points that mark big shifts in how the brain is organized. The most surprising discovery is that adolescent-style development lasts into our early thirties. The work helps explain changing abilities and risks at different points in life.",
