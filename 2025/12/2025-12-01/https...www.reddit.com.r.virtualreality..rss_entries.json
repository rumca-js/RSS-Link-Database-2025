        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>Half Life Alyx released in 2020, and back then VR headsets were something of a luxury in gaming. 5 years have passed and I am wondering if prices dropped, or if there is any cheap and good vr headset to experience games on it. I&#39;m a student and don&#39;t really have much money, maybe I&#39;m able to put like 200\u20ac in a headset but not much more, the cheaper, the better. </p> <p>Do you have any vr headsets in mind? Accessible and good at the same time? Or maybe services to loan vr headsets like they do it with pc&#39;s? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheMorphine_\"> /u/TheMorphine_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pbmc0k/looking_for_the_cheapest_vr_headset_to_have_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1pbmc0k/looking_for_the_cheapest_vr_headset_to_have_a/\">[comments]</a></span",

Main goal is wireless VR with my Quest 3 headset. </p> <p>Also got a 1440p monitor, but honestly I&#39;ll probably find a way to remotely use the pc via laptop. Biggest desire is to just enjoy all those amazing UEVR and PC VR titles I had to either avoid or play with severely lowered settings.</p> <p>First games I want to retry are Alyx VR, Lone Echo 1 and 2, and Asgard&#39;s Wrath. After that are some UEVR titles without worrying about my laptop melting.

I cant imagine how the Quest 3 can be better. When I ever do upgrade I guess I will be blown away.</p> <p>This headset still holds up perfectly well. I dont really care for it being wired. It gives me perfect no delay PC performance for VR Gaming.</p> <p>Only sad thing\u2026 my headphone jack broke. So I can only use the in-built speakers of the Rift S. Luckily these are really good!</p> <p>I love the Halo design and it fits perfectly on my head and doesnt feel heavy.</p> <p>The camera tracking is also amazing. Even goes behind my head/back.</p> <p>The Resolution also being lower than modern Quest 3 or so is actually great because I think this resolution is perfect for gaming and it increases my fps compared to high resolutions.</p> <p>Skyrim VR is perfect with this and a RTX 5070</p> <p>Wha are your ex",
