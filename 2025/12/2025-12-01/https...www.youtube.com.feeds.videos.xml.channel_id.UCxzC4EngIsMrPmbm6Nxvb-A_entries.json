        "description": "I got offered a Vaonis Vespera II digital telescope back in August, and finally I get all the stuff together to make a video about how well it works. This particular telescope is the X edition which has a transparent case, for people who like to look at the inner workings of their digital devices. People who have fond memories of the iMac in the last millennium.\n\nThey gave me the telescope for free, but if you want to buy one there is this referral link that will give the channel some money if a purchase is made, so that would really help support my work\nhttps://vaonis.pxf.io/e1VX7Z\n\nIn general the manufacturer has a website where you can look at their whole range\nvaonis.pxf.io/e1VX7Z\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scottmanley",
