        "description": "The AYN Odin 3 is so powerful that the Android software ecosystem still needs to catch up.  Let's take a look at this performance king and the current state of gaming on the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.\n\nBuy one here: https://tinyurl.com/RGC-Odin3\nOdin 3 impressions video: https://youtu.be/dvXnCZQwJPQ\nAndroid handheld starter guide: https://youtu.be/I4mqgcDYZFo\n\nCorrection: with GameNative, you need to choose \"Export for Frontend\" instead of \"Create Shortcut\" if you want to export the Steam file for ES-DE.\n\nThis video includes a review unit sent to me by the manufacturer.  All opinions are my own, they did not see this video ahead of time, and no money was exchanged in any way.\n\nWays to support this channel:\nRGC merch: https://store.retrogamecorps.com\nStickers and magnets: https://www.ebay.com/str/retrogamecorpscharitystore\nYT channel membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZQiN0o7f36H7PaW4fVhFw/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/retrogamecorps\nKo-Fi: https://ko-fi.com/retrog",
