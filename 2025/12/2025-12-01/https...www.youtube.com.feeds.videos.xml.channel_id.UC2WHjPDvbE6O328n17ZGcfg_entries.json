My plan was to read through a bit of the Rust book (which I did), do a couple of challenges (which I did), and ultimately complete every single day of Advent of Code (which I didn't do). So I spent a good amount of time this year playing around with Rust, building a couple things, and just learning how it works. And there are a handful of things I\u2019ve pulled from Rust that I now implement, or are at least cognizant of when I\u2019m writing Java, or TypeScript.\n\n0:00 i tried learning rust\n1:35 Ownership & Control\n4:52 Borrowing & Shared State\n7:27 Types & Inference\n9:10 Error Handling\n10:34 Concurrency\n12:28 Enums\n14:38 everything should be written in rust\n\nIf you're a developer, sign up to my free newsletter Dev Notes \ud83d\udc49 https://www.devnotesdaily.com/\n\nIf you're a student, checkout my Notion template Studious: https://notionstudent.com\n\nDon't know ",
