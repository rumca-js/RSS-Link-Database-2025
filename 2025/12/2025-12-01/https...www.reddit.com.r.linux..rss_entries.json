To me, these seem to be duplication of existing long standing featuress (cron, fstab respectively) and seem more complicated at that so I am struggling to see the difference between them (though I noted that timers can run if their schedule was missed, I don&#39;t believe cron does this?)</p> <p>How widely utilised are these units in the real world?
