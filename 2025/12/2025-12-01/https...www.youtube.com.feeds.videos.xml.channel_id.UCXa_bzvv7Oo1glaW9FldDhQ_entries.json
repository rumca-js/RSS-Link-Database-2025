        "description": "Speaking of which, I've spoken about how gorgeous the environments look, and the same applies to the characters themselves, which animate gorgeously. And as incredible as they look and move, they pale in comparison to the music. From the main menu theme to the heroically immense trawl through New York, all the way up to the final battle with its epic overtones, it's simply one belter after another, and it deserves so much appreciation.\n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion is one of the finest beat 'em ups in years, and that's saying something, even with the pedigree of those involved. It may have some slight blemishes here and there, but if you've been looking for something to complement Absolum and deliver a more traditional retro arcade experience, this is it.",

        "description": "Ferocious is a debut indie game oozing with ambition and more dinosaurs than you can shake a shotgun at. Trapped on a dangerous mysterious island with your brother missing, you\u2019re not all alone. \n\nMercenary gangs and a military organization are up to some curious mischief that the roaming dinosaurs may have something to do with. With over a dozen guns, semi-destructible environments, and dynamic biomes, Ferocious is looking almost too good to be true. \n\nThe game releases on December 4th. You\u2019ll need a solid PC to run it as it isn\u2019t available on consoles yet either.",

However, 2025 also had its share of disappointments \u2013 games with incredible potential that fell horrendously short, either due to issues with execution, technical issues, etc.\n\nGranted, support is still ongoing for many of these titles, and they could improve significantly in the coming months and/or years. As of now, however, they're still underwhelming. Without further ado, here are our picks for the 15 most disappointing games of the year.",
