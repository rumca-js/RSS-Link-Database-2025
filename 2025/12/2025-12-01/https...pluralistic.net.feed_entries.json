Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Custom M&#38;M restrictions; Vacuum-bag dust houses; Winner-Take-All Politics; Pre-mutated products; Disney World on strike; \"Ship Breaker\"; TSA patdowns a \"homosexual agenda\"; R\u00c4T. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest.
