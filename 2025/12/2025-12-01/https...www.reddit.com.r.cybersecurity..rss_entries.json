I\u2019m struggling to find a job and honestly just don\u2019t really enjoy the actual work in this field. I was just wondering if anybody has some advice on how to break into the cyber security field. I\u2019ve been looking at masters programs that offer introductory courses for students coming from different fields. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the best way or if there\u2019s any online programs or activities that may help instead. Any advice would be helpful.

Curious of the community\u2019s thoughts on a thought experiment i\u2019ve been having:</p> <p>Say I have a reverse proxy (RP) on my network brokering a service i\u2019m running. </p> <p>I see 3 deployment options:</p> <ol> <li><p>Use two separate physical servers. One to run the RP, and another to run the service. Connected via a layer-2 switch, router-on-a-stick, and upstream firewall.</p></li> <li><p>Use a hypervisor, run the RP on the same physical server as the service, but each within their own VM. </p></li> <li><p>Use containers, run the RP &amp; service on the same physical server &amp; OS (baremetal Debian for example) and use a docker bridge network to connect the two. </p></li> </ol> <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In terms of security, i think 1 is the best, 2 is almost identical to 1 except for the threat of VM escape, and 3 is the least secure but potentially still production-viable if configured properly.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear your t",
