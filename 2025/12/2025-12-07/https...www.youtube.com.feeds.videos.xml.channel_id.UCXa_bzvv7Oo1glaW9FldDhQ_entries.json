        "description": "Is The Forsaken Hollows worth $15? I would say yes if you're a fan of Nightreign and looking for a reason to jump back in, however short-lived it may be, but your mileage will vary. \n\nThe Great Hollow isn't for everyone, and I really question how much longevity it can really offer, unless you're really inclined to embark on solo challenges with every single Nightfarer. Overall, the DLC feels like a good addition, but FromSoftware's post-launch updates will have to do some heavy lifting to make it truly worthwhile.",

        "description": "Routine has had a long and troubled road to its final release. But it has managed to be a solid experience, perhaps vindicating Lunar Software's multiple delays to ensure a game that stuck its landing on the first try. But was it worth waiting thirteen years for? Routine has largely managed to deliver on the promise it made all those years ago, bringing an excellent horror experience to the table with a solid gameplay loop woven in. \n\nYou're going to be white-knuckled and breathing heavily as you explore its world, the threat of a robot that's quite intent on beating you into a pulp forcing you to be mindful of your actions and strategic in your approach. It's challenging without being frustrating, a balance that many studios find it hard to get right. But Routine has struck that balance, and the end result is a solid title that has quite intent on seeing the adventure through.",
