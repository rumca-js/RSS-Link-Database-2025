I already tried different Proton and ProtonGE versions.</p> <p>Some more information:</p> <ul> <li>Fedora Workstation 43</li> <li>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070</li> <li>NVIDIA Driver 580.105.08</li> </ul> <p>So when I launch the game I get into the main menu, select a save state or create one, get into the loading screen with my character where I can move and then it transitions to a black screen where the world should load.

I am already a developer, a web developer to be more accurately, but I want to invest in desktop development and this is a good way to enter in this world. One of my common problems that I have is the game icon in general, the usual low resolution and the fallback icon that always appears on my DE (Gnome). These two I am trying to solve right now with a Gnome Gaming Hub approach, the idea is to works like cartridge app as a universal launch app but automatically updating the desktop entry and icons to make it easier to everyone. Maybe it could fetch proton versions and control in friendly way the command launch (like checkboxes) but this another problem.
