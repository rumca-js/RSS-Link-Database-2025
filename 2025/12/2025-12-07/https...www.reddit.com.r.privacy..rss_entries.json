Its not something I&#39;m actively worried about, more so just curious.</p> <p>As the title states, how likely is it that phone companies such as Apple or Android can spy on people through their cameras? The likelihood of a single individual being spied on is obviously extremely low, but nowadays I feel like this data could be used for Machine Learning purposes. I&#39;m aware there are strict laws and regulations around this, but they seem to mean less and less the more money is involved.</p> <p>Both companies claim to have both software and hardware locks in place, but has this ever been verified via reverse engineering or some other means?

Mimics https traffic. Currently not detectable. Probably a bit slower than VMess and Shadowsocks (?)</p> <p>VLESS - newest protocol among all, developed by XRay project, fork and a successor of V2RAY, doesn&#39;t have any built-in description, requires additional encrypted transport, TLS for example.
