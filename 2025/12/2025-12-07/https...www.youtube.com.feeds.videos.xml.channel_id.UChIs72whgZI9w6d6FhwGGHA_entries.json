Part of our latency benchmarks today include dual-GPU configurations, using one older GPU to offload some of the workload. We previously tested Lossless Scaling Frame Generation, part of the $7 Lossless Scaling software tool on Steam, for its image quality and upscaling quality. Previously, we tested LS1 upscaling alongside 2X, 4X, and 20X frame generation (the last one just for fun) as part of our tests analyzing the tool's usefulness. That also discussed usefulness outside of gaming applications. This testing uses TechteamGB's latency tester, which is open source, for analysis, marking our first departure from NVIDIA's LDAT latency tester we've previously used. We are not looking at DLSS Frame Generation or FSR / AFMF Frame Generation this time. We te",
