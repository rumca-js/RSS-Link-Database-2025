It still is: </p> <p><em>\u201cThe air filled with dust and the sound of wingbeats. The mothriders had joined the fray.\u201d</em><br/> \u2014Great Battles of Kamigawa</p> <p>I&#39;ve always found it endlessly epic and poetic. The art is gorgeous too!</p> <p>So, my point is, moths are cool. Like, really cool. We need to see more of them in the genre. Are there any good books that make use of them as fantasy creatures?</p> <p>Note: I am specifically looking for moth-like creatures or moth-like physical characteristics, not moths only used for their symbolism, which is far more common. I am also not looking for generic fantasy insects, there&#39;s plenty of those around. They can be there, as long as we also have moths.</p> <p>Books I am already aware of:</p> <ul> <l",
