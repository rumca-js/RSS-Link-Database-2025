I honestly think it&#39;s rare for people to come across humans whose opinions are backed by data and whose conclusions are highly coherent - and when we do find people like that, we tend to look up to them for their insight, expertise, and incisive thinking.

My Core Thesis: The Rise of the Entertainer I believe that traditional engineering and knowledge-based professions have no future for new graduates. The real future lies in careers centered around entertaining people and fostering genuine human connection. Here is my reasoning: 1. AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a Knowledge Depot: AI excels at knowledge-based tasks, calculations, and complex information processing. This means AI can easily handle the vast majority of routine coding, design, testing, and data analysis tasks that currently form the basis of junior engineering roles. 2.

Despite growing enthusiasm, empirical evidence on when and how to integrate visual genAI into advertising remains limited. This study investigates three approaches: (1) human expert-created ads, (2) genAI-modified ads, in which genAI enhances expert designs, and (3) genAI-created ads, generated entirely by visual genAI. Using a mixed-methods design that combines latent diffusion models, a laboratory experiment, and a field study, we evaluate the relative effectiveness of these approaches. Across studies, we find that genAI-created ads consistently outperform both human-and genAI-modified ads, increasing click-through rates by up to 19% in field settings. In contrast, genAI-modified ads show no significant improvement over human-created benchmarks. These results reveal an asymmetry: visual genAI ",

When you ask an AI for help with something, lets say a coding problem for example. If it is able to properly help with the solution and suggest the correct thing, is there any relevant reason to thank it for its work? Disregarding the moral discussion though, I moreso mean if I say &quot;thanks, that worked.&quot; Will that help future users more by reinforcing to the AI that it was a correct solution similar to how saying that on a forum would?
