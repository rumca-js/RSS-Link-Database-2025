I tend to delete files from my SSD to save space but I&#39;d still want to back those up onto the archival-focused HDD. I currently just clone 1:1 an SSD to another SSD and just accept those files as gone but of course it also removes anything deleted from the source drive onto the target. </p> <p>But now that I&#39;m going to backup my smaller SSD into a bigger HDD over time, is there a way to only do additive backups? Only ever adding folders not found in the target drive from the source drive while ignoring anything that was deleted?</p> <p>EDIT: I&#39;m on Mac and own Carbon Copy (Cloner?)

So I catalogued the exact same volume I already had done with Cathy and not only it took a huge amount of time to do it, buy the catalogue file is massive, hundreds of MB. </p> <p>So I decided to try Kadalog. Similar experience. </p> <p>I can export a catalogue of a volume into a CSV file using PowerShell, but the CSV is also quite large. </p> <p>Why is Cathy overall faster and with smaller catalogue files?
