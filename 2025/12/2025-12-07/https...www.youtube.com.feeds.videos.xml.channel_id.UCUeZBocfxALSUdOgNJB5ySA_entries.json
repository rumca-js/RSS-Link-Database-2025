        "description": "Floating or sinking is due to density, but not just bone density. The density of the human body is an average of bones, muscles, fat, other soft tissue and, perhaps most importantly in this situation, air.  As you inhale and exhale the volume of air your lungs changes your overall density which influences if you float or sink.\nSource Video: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/xymCC6pTt4w\n #diving #density #science #shorts\n\n\nPATREON:\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c \ud83d\ude80   http://patreon.com/DrBenMiles\n\nMERCH: https://www.rockstarscientist.org/ \ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c \n\nIf you are a scientist with a breakthrough idea apply here: \n\ud83d\ude80 Empirical Ventures - https://empiricalventures.vc\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Linktree: https://linktree.ee/drbenmiles\n\ud83d\udcf8 Insta: https://www.instagram.com/drbenmiles\n\ud83d\udcf2TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drbenmiles\n\nMY GEAR\n\ud83d\udcf7 Sony A7III https://amzn.to/3OWrmGd\n\ud83d\udd0e Sigma 402965 16 mm F1.4 https://amzn.to/49BNJdq\n\ud83c\udfa4 Shure SM7B https://youtu.be/lVTS_J7Xmxs\n\ud83c\udfa4 Zoom H4n Pro https://amzn.to/3OXsklB\n\ud83c\udfa4 Sennheiser AVX  https://amzn.to/4geWnBi",
