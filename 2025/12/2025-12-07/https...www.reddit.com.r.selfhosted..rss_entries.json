I know there have been variations of this/has been done before but I wanted to practice some shell scripting, so: I wrote a simple bash script that hooks into Paperless-ngx&#39;s pre-consume stage. It sends your documents (PDFs, Images, DOCX, PPTX, HTML) to a local Docling server, extracts the text/layout as Markdown, and saves it as a sidecar file that Paperless automatically ingests. Greatly improves searchability for complex documents/tables!</p> <p>Sharing this here in case it helps anyone :)</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/BoxcarFields/paperless-ngx-docling-preconsume\">https://github.com/BoxcarFields/paperless-ngx-docling-preconsume</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HighwayWilderness\"> /u/HighwayWilderness </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1pgn361/paperless_ng",

Or is it the aforementioned plus changing the ip it points to every time the subdomain comes around again cuz it\u2019s that subdomains turn to be used? </p> <p>Or is it something else that concerns rotating proxies?</p> <p>Thanks so much!
