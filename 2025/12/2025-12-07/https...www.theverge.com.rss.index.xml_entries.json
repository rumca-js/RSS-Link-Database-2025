Maybe it will be, someday, in a Skynet sort of way. But there are also lots of people trying to figure out how to use AI not as a replacement for human creativity and thinking but as a tool meant to augment those things.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sari Azout is one of those people. She's the founder of <a href=\"https://sublime.app/\">Sublime</a>, a platform dedicated to curation, creativity, and ideas. Sublime is all about taste, which makes it slightly surprising that there's a huge amount of AI powering the way it works. But to Azout, it all makes sense.</p>\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" heig",

The ubiquity of the iPhone coupled with the relative ease of development for the platform meant that smaller studios were able to get their games in front of huge audiences, leading to a great time of experimentation that unfortunately didn't last. But if you want to relive those better days, Simogo's new collection is just the thing.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You might recognize the name Simogo from more recent titles, like the noir mystery <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-revie",
