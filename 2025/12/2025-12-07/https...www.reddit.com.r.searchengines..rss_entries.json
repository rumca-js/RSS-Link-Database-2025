During this time, I would regularly Google search my photos, and at first, it would show things like &quot;no results,&quot; but now if I simply search my face, it says &quot;results are limited,&quot; or certain things can&#39;t be googled searched. Because of this, I was wondering if there were search engines that would actually pop up with information, since it seems like the free ones aren&#39;t credible? And if you do have to pay, I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;re saying &quot;we found 20 possible results&quot; just to get me to pay or if they&#39;re actually serious, which bothers me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cautious_Payment_570\"> /u/Cautious_Payment_570 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1pgcgv3/looking_for_something_tha",
