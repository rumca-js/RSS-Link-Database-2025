Gnosia is an enemy that disguises itself as a human and attacks them. It is now on the spaceship, causing everyone onboard to be suspicious of each other. The crew decides to vote on the most suspicious-looking person every day and put them into a cold sleep.\n\nIf the humans succeed in putting Gnosia to sleep, they'll win. On the other hand, if they don't, everyone on board is in danger. The right decision must be made.
