But I\u2019m trying to be open minded because the LGBT+ community have shown me so much support, wanting my country to be free and stuff.</p> <p>A while ago, I also made a new friend personally. He is a trans man. I didn\u2019t understand it at first, but he explained some things and it made a bit of more sense. I\u2019m muslim, and he explained how he was not a believer but likely Allah knows he is a man in his heart, so the wrong thing would actually be pretending he is a lady. Makes sense. I had a big realisation that day.</p> <p>Redditors also gave me some advice on how to support him.</p> <p>Anyways, it has been a few days since that post. We plan to meet up and have coffee and stuff soon. A day when I\u2019m off work. Just to talk and \u201chang out,\u201d without a big politics chat.
