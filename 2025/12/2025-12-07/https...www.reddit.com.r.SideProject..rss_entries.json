It&#39;s an AI website builder that creates complete, deployable sites from a simple description. You tell it &quot;I&#39;m a plumber in Denver, I offer drain cleaning and water heater repair&quot; and it generates a full site with proper sections, content, contact forms \u2014 ready to publish. **Why I built it:** I kept seeing small business owners either pay $2-5k for basic sites or struggle with Wix/Squarespace for weeks. Felt like a problem AI could solve. **Stack:** SvelteKit, Supabase, Gemini AI, Netlify **What&#39;s working:** The generation quality is solid. Most sites need minimal tweaking. **What I&#39;m figuring out:** Pricing model and getting in front of the right people (local business owners aren&#39;t exactly hanging out on Reddit). Would love any feedback. Happy to generate a free site for anyone who wants to test it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://Genmysite.com\">Genmysite.",
