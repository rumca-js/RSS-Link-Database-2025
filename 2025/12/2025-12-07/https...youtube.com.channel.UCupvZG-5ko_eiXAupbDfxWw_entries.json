The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is an Afghan national who worked with the CIA in Afghanistan and came to the US in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program designed to resettle Afghan refugees in the wake of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. He ultimately gained asylum this year under the Trump administration.\n\nSince the shooting attack, the Trump administration has halted all immigration from what it calls \"countries of concern\" and vowed to reexamine green cards that have been issued to people from those nations.\n\nCNN's Fareed Zakaria speaks with Thomas Gibbons-Neff, national correspondent and former Kabul bureau chief for The New York Times. #CNN #News",
