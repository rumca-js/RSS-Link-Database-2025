In November, I purchased a 15-month bundle, which was supposed to cost around \u00a315 in total, including VPN, etc. That&#39;s how it was advertised. Since then, I&#39;ve noticed that my account has been charged this amount from my card for the third time. I&#39;m curious to see if I contact them now, will they refund my stolen money (because there&#39;s no other way to describe it). </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BadUncleK\"> /u/BadUncleK </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1pgelwp/newshosting/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1pgelwp/newshosting/\">[comments]</a></span>",
