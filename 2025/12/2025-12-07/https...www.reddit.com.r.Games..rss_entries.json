It\u2019s currently in <strong>Early Access on Steam</strong>.</p> <p>Each run starts fresh, and you build your Mission Score by moving quickly, landing shots, and managing time pressure. The arenas are small, the UI is minimal, and the pace ramps up fast.</p> <p>Mission Scores from all missions combine into an Overall Score that determines your rank. The ranking system gives long-term structure while keeping the core gameplay simple: move fast, shoot cleanly, and try to beat your best results.</p> <p>Alien Grounds has been free during Early Access.

Happy Indie Sunday! </p> <p>I&#39;d just like to share a project I&#39;ve been working for a couple of months now, and just released the Steam Page last week.</p> <p>Ad Iterum is a turn-based top-down 2D roguelike set in a decaying, ever-shifting world. Flesh is fragile, but you can hack it. Enhance your body, embrace mutations, or form ancient blood pacts. Descend into the depths, scavenge what\u2019s left of humanity, and crawl back...if you can. Kill. Die. Repeat.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested you can check out the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4149030/Ad_Iterum/\">game\u2019s page on Steam</a>, I&#39;ll be posting weekly updates with art and game progress as well over there.</p> <p>I&#39;m also running small alpha play tests at the moment, let me know via in the Steam forum, or via DM if you&#39;d like to be part of it!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/iamgabrielma\"> /u/iamgabrie",
