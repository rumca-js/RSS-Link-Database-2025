It's the powerless against the super powerful as The Boys embark on a heroic quest to expose the truth about \"The Seven,\" and their formiddable Vought backing.\n\nThe Boys (2026) is the new superhero series starring Karl Urban, Jack Quaid and Antony Starr.\n\nNote | #TheBoys #Trailer courtesy of Sony Pictures. | All Rights Reserved. #KinoCheck\u00ae",
