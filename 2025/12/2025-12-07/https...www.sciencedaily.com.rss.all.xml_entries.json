        "description": "Scientists have discovered that moonquakes, not meteoroids, are responsible for shifting terrain near the Apollo 17 landing site. Their analysis points to a still-active fault that has been generating quakes for millions of years. While the danger to short missions is low, long-term lunar bases could face increasing risk. The findings urge future planners to avoid building near scarps and to prioritize new seismic instruments.",

It penetrates nails more efficiently than current drugs and kills pathogens by disrupting their energy systems. The compound also works against fungi that resist standard antifungal treatments.",
