        "description": "For nearly 20 years, I\u2019ve called out everything wrong with the self-help world. The bad science, the guru nonsense, and the advice that preys on people\u2019s insecurities. But last year, I realized I could actually build something better. In this video, I reveal the project that pushed me out of criticizing the industry and into reinventing it: an AI designed to challenge you, understand you, and help you grow in ways traditional therapy and generic chatbots simply can\u2019t.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about feeling better, but about becoming better. And if we get this right, it could transform how millions of people find purpose, meaning, and real change in their lives. Let me show you what we\u2019ve built and why I believe it\u2019s the most important thing I\u2019ve ever worked on.\n\nCheck it out here: https://purpose.app/bonus\n\nIf you are not already a member of my premium community, get access to monthly challenges and daily action steps that add up to real change here: https://mrk.mn/ZcFwvxv\n\nFREE: For practical adv",
