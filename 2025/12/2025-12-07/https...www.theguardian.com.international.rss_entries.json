One morning you awake to find new aches, or lapses in strength and memory that you could swear were not present just a few days prior. We do not literally age overnight, but as research is increasingly showing, we may not do so in a steady, linear path either.</p><p>Over the past decade a multitude of studies have suggested that ageing \u2013 at least for certain organs and bodily systems \u2013 may actually consist of long periods of stability, punctuated by inflection points or periods of rapid biological change. This shift in thinking has raised hopes for anti-ageing medicines. But it could also make us rethink our attitude to ageing in general, viewing it as a dynamic and varied journey \u2013 rather than simply a slow march of attrition and breakdown.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/comme",

Jarrod Bowen, so often West Ham\u2019s talisman, scored the goal, executing the masterplan from the narrowest of angles, perfectly executing the counterattacking strategy. Slowly but surely, still staring demotion in the face, Nuno\u2019s team look capable of fighting their way to safety.
