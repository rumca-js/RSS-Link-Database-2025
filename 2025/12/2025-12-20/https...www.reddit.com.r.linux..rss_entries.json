If they had released anything breaking they would update it there. People make the mistake of installing arch flavours like omarchy without any knowledge about the consequences that they may face in the future. Bottomline is installing a stable distro like debian, linux mint, popos, bazzite, use it until you know how to fix incase you break something, then when you are comfortable to fix when things go bad, then move to more complex systems with arch.
