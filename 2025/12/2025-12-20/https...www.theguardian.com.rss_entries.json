        "description": "<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin became the first Leeds striker to score in five consecutive Premier League games in 22 years to down a lethargic Crystal Palace, and open up a six-point gap on the relegation zone. Mark Viduka achieved the same feat in 2003, helping secure his side\u2019s top-flight status with his instinctive finishing, another achievement the latest Elland Road No 9 is aiming to replicate.</p><p>The former Everton striker cannot have imagined almost 40,000 singing his name at Christmas when he was unemployed for much of the summer. It took until mid-August for promoted Leeds to convince Calvert-Lewin this was the right place to rebuild his career and they are proving one another right, helped by the long-throws of Ethan Ampadu, scorer of the third goal.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/dec/20/leeds-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

Unsurprisingly, then, our Christmas lunch was more than a bit diverse: my father always insisted on some British and Lebanese elements, while my mother contributed French dishes and technique; west African produce was also a must, because the house would be full of all nationalities, including our African family. Not only that, but our Christmas would invariably start with a guest list of about 20, and another 20 or so waifs and strays would always then turn up in need of feeding and watering. Today\u2019s dishes were part of our regular seasonal festivities, as good in the sunshine as they are robust enough for a chilly British winter.</p> <a href",

I ended up with drenched hair and no sunglasses or bikini top</p><p>Christmas in Barbados is different. Forget snow and scarves \u2013 we do Christmas in flip-flops, sweating through church services and pretending to feel festive because there\u2019s tinsel on a palm tree. Everyone\u2019s singing Mary\u2019s Boy Child as if they\u2019re auditioning for Caribbean Idol, and someone\u2019s auntie is halfway through a bottle of Mount Gay before 11am.</p><p>But my weirdest Christmas was when I was about 19 \u2013 that magical age when you\u2019re convinced you\u2019re grown, but you still have braces. My mum had taken me \u201cback home\u201d to spend the holidays with family. I was excited because 1) I needed a break from university, 2) I could finally escape the British winter, and 3) I was ready to find a husband.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/dec/20/my-weirdest-christmas-flirting-wildly-rogue-wave-ruined-everything\">Contin",
