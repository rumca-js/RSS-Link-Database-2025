Over the first three days, the app was downloaded around 300 times and about 30 people purchased it.</p> <p>Despite having 10+ years of professional software development experience, there were still plenty of technical screw-ups. Bugs, edge cases, packaging issues, UX problems. The usual reality check. But thanks to the feedback, I fixed the critical issues quickly",

On the side, I build products and advise founders/startups.</p> <p><strong>The situation:</strong></p> <p>I can build and validate products. Fast, lean, focused on real problems.

The magic of going from idea to working app in hours is real.</p> <p>But a common mistake I see is poor system design. Projects start great, then everything feels like it&#39;s falling apart once they grow. You&#39;re stuck, afraid to change anything, buried in technical debt.</p> <p>Modularity and maintainability aren&#39;t sexy, but they&#39;re how you keep that momentum going past day 3.</p> <p>So I built sketch2prompt. It&#39;s a short planning step before you start coding, asks what you&#39;re building, what&#39;s out of scope, what you don&#39;t need yet. Then gets out of the way.

Data flows in real time between devices and users, peer to peer, always end to end encrypted. It runs on any device/OS both UI and CLI, works seamlessly cross ecosystems and doesn&#39;t degrade the quality of transferred media. Transfers between devices on the same network happen at network speed.</p> <p>Among its many built in capabilities it includes an image viewer, video player, it allows to message between devices/users for efficient collaboration, and will let you share content with users who don&#39;t have Zynk via quickly generated web links. You can also create drop links to receive data from others. Lots of small surp",
