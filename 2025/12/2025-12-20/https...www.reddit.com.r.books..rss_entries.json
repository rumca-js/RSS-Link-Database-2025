The UX on the Kindle version I got of his complete works is horrendous. The nav just doesn\u2019t work, and it also doesn\u2019t recognise bookmarks for some reason, so heaven help me if I lost my place! And while I expected the version to be large (it is the complete works, after all, and Amazon does have a \u201clarge file size warning\u201d on it), I didn\u2019t expect that it would be large because it\u2019s not optimized it for digital, so each page takes forever to load. There\u2019s other problems too, like the back button not working, and overall glitchiness.</p> <p>I\u2019m guessing that this kind of thing would be a problem with many classic works that pretty much anyone can reproduce and publish, but surely (hopefully?) someone out there is putting care into the digital versions? Can anyone help, please?</p> <p>(BTW the version I got is \u201cThe Complete Works of Charles Dickens: Novels, Short Stories, Plays, Poe",

They\u2019re interested in the sweet, quirky, (sometimes virginal) girl who falls in love with the brooding, grumpy, sexy male romantic interest who sweeps them \u2014 meaning both the character and the reader \u2014 of their feet. </p> <p>This leads me to ask, what would the male version of a romance novel look like?

Or do you let your love expand, giving yourself totally to life, giving up yourself period to what is bigger than your small, tight, selfish ego.</p> <p>It is through that self sacrifice in love that you transcend your loss and your wounds. This I think is the thesis of this novel, expressed so succinctly, so symbolically and so profoundly.</p> <p>Yet such a state of grace is a very hard ideal to reach. Striving for it, only a few of us will attain it. The key is suffering. Suffering and loss is the price to pay for enlightenment, empathy, and becoming fully human. Going in",

It talks of loneliness and longing with passion. The protagonist eventually desperately attempts to win over his love for Nastenka, although it seemed from the beginning even after saving her, he was waiting for a chance to pounce. I do think that he rambles like a mad man. However, I think my takeaways were that he wanted connection, perhaps some limerence was sprinkled in and how a brief encounter or memory can create a lasting memory, even if he rationalized he would be alone forever at the end.
