I understand with consoles it&#39;s up to 5th generation here, with an exception for the Dreamcast, which is pretty much how feel about retro gaming already. The Dreamcast is an odd inbetween thing for me that&#39;s the beginning of modern gaming, but still has a retro feel. Anyway, where does the line end with handhelds though? I know the 90s handhelds fall in the category of retro, but I feel the DS fits in the retro category too, but not the PSP.

Since I&#39;ve only beaten three dungeons, I decided to start over with a new save. </p> <p>It sucks a little because I already managed to save up enough rupees for the Bow and now I have to start over again!

I genuinely really enjoyed it. The combat is fun &amp; unique. Reminds me a bit of Castlevania\u2019s whip and Zelda\u2019s hook shot. The lite RPG mechanics were a nice touch as well. I didn\u2019t even realize I was leveling for a while bc I often get weirdly focused on just killing every enemy on screen\u2026and since they spawn infinitely I was probably just slaughtering monsters for 30 minutes straight right at the start lol. Limited spell use and collecting tools adds a nice touch of utility. The story is very minimal outside of the manual, but the cryptic nature of ally NPCs has always felt endearing to me tbh.",
