The pipeline incorporates everything from dataset management, training, evaluation, and inference. Designed originally around windows, I&#39;ve tried to make the UI as user-friendly as possible, while remaining feature-rich and incorporating advanced user options. The focus of the project was to be able to build large models on consumer cards, and utilizing both HRM and SMOE for the backbone, I believe will result in dense language models that can be delivered from everyday hardware. The program is made in such a way that the average joe could build a model with relative ease.</p> <p>Installers were built and tested on Windows 11 and Ubuntu 24</p> <p>I would love to get feedback on it, with suggestions or improvements, it&#39;s been a fun project so far!</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/Wulfic/AI-OS\">Git Repo</a>",
