The links are hosted on what seems to be a pretty reliable site, with comments for them all being generally positive (or at least, they got it working) - however I&#39;ve tried 3 different files a couple of times and each time when I try to mount the disc image I&#39;m told the file is corrupt.</p> <p>When it&#39;s downloading I can see all the RARs and a few PARs, then at the end these have vanished and I&#39;m just left with the img file (like it unrared itself). I&#39;m downloading to an external drive due to space, and it&#39;s possible that there have been interrruptions in the DL...but I would think this wouldnt be an issue and the program would make sure all the d",

The promo&#39;s promise you the &quot;Free VPN&quot; but as soon as you click that offer another one appears WITHOUT the VPN. This is not directly visible but as I look for my vpn setting I found none. The website isn&#39;t all that clear unfortunately and the FAQ section doesn&#39;t even include any VPN related articles. </p> <p>They do offer a 30 day money back guarantee and their support is nice as well as quick to reply. I will be getting the refund unfortunately because I do not feel that false advertising should be rewarded. Hopefully they will make their website clearer.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Stonxiart\"> /u/Stonxiart </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1prf7j4/take_care_when_purchasing_a_pureusenet_accoun",
