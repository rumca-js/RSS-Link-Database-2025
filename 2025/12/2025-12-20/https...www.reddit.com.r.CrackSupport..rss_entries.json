I downloaded the game through Elamigos official site without any problems.</p> <p>As far as i&#39;m aware, some mods can disable achievements, but after removing every mod i have (maps and overrides included), the game still doesn&#39;t unlock.<br/> Besides this, i also: </p> <p>- Deleted my save.<br/> - Contacted some of the mod creators to confirm none of the mods could disable achievements.<br/> - Started through steam (as a non-steam game).<br/> - Started through the .exe inside the Payday 2 folder.<br/> - Changed the shortcut to disable EOS (Epic Online Services)<br/> - Changed the Steam_emu.ini to start offline.</p> <p>If someone knows how to solve it, i would appreciate to know.<br/> Thanks<br/> (I will try to redownload the game to see if it fix the problem)</p> </div><!-",

I&#39;m using Steam Tools and I can&#39;t download any games I add, either through SteamDB or other means. They simply don&#39;t appear in my library anymore for me to try to download.</p> <p>Note: This happened after I tried to download a DLC.</p> <p>Note 2: If I try to download a free game through Steam itself, it appears in my library normally.</p> <p>I&#39;ve already tried all the common fixes like deleting DLLs, download cache, repairing the library, etc.</p> <p>It&#39;s not the common error where games in the library reappear to buy again. It&#39;s an error where no added games appear in the library.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen all the tutorials and read about everything, but I always have hope that someone on Reddit will know how to solve it haha</p> <p>Thank you very much for your attention to those who read this far, I hope you can solve it :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",
