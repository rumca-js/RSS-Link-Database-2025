It didn&#39;t get a spin-off series or a sequel or anything. It was as if it didn&#39;t exist and the voice work was outstanding: Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, Catherine O&#39;Hara, William Shatner, Allison Janney...etc. </p> <p>I got to see it at my local theater back in the day, 3 times, and I enjoyed it a lot.

So that go me wondering why his film career got stalled.</p> <p>and Yes I know he did television work during this time (Boston Legal, A Season of The Office &amp; The Blacklist), but I&#39;ve seen television actors trying to manage both television and film roles. I just wonder why Spader just became more sporadic with film.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FreshmenMan\"> /u/FreshmenMan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1pr3atq/what_happened_to_james_spaders_film_career_after/\">[link]</",
