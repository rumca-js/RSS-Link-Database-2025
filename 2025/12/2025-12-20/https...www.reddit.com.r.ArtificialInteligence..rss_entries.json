The author, a 25-year nonprofit veteran and accessibility specialist, doesn\u2019t just talk about AI in abstract terms, they show what\u2019s at stake if mission-driven organizations ignore it, and how to adopt it responsibly without losing the human touch. With relatable frontline stories, step-by-step guidance, and ethical frameworks, the book makes it clear that AI can amplify impact, but only if it\u2019s handled thoughtfully.</p> <p>This book should easily be number one in Business Leadership Training, Business Ethics (Kindle Store), and Leadership Training because it delivers what those categories promise: actionable leadership strategies, clear ethical guidance, and tools to implement change effectively.
