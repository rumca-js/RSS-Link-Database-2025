However, nobody likes programs that unexpectedly terminate, and fixing faults earlier in the development lifecycle is significantly cheaper than later, so a question arises\u2014can we check these contracts  before  the program is run?\n\nIn this talk we will show how contracts as specified in C++  can  in many cases be validated at compile-time using static analysis tools. We will talk about which contracts are amenable to such analysis, and what theoretical and practical limitations exist. To validate these ideas, we\u2019ll demonstrate an implementation in CodeQL \u2013 GitHub\u2019s extensible static analysis engine \u2013 combine",
