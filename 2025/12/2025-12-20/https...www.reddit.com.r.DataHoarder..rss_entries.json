Sync is great for convenience and multi-device access, but it\u2019s absolutely ruthless in disasters because it\u2019s designed to make every place look the same. If you delete a folder by mistake, if an app goes rogue, if ransomware encrypts your files, sync will happily propagate that damage everywhere and do it fast. The painful part is you often don\u2019t notice until the damage has already been copied to all the places you thought were your safety net.</p> <p>The mental shift that fixed this for me is thinking in terms of time travel, not copying. A real backup lets you go back to a known good point in time, which means you need versioning, retention, and something that isn\u2019t constantly writable from your everyday machine. Once you frame it that way, most home setups simplify nicely: you keep a primary working copy where you actually use the data, you have a local layer that can ",
