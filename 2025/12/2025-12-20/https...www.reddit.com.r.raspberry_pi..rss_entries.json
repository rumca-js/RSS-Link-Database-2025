I&#39;ve had Google Gemini and Perplexity AI helping with configurations in the Pi terminal and analysing error messages with no luck. Adding CUPS printers on an M1 Mac using the wireless ones showing or by IP address sees the Mac thinking it has printed while the Pi knows nothing about it - and no printing happens. I have an old Pi 3 that runs a CUPS server fine with an older Dymo printer. It is looking like it might be a 64/32 bit new/old hardware thing as the old Pi is fine.

Although this is not Raspberry Pi OS, the issue leans toward the specifics of a Pi, so I figured I would try to seek advise here.</p> <p>At first I was suspecting that it was because I installed the musl-based variant of void, but a reinstall with glibc (that I have now) made no improvements.
