And what will it take for some of the world\u2019s most powerful men accused of sexual misconduct to face consequences?\n\nThis week on UpFront Marc Lamont Hill speaks to founder of the Me Too movement, Tarana Burke.\n\nThe Department of Justice has released files related to the late convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein after mounting pressure led President Donald Trump to sign the Epstein Files Transparency Act last month. Trump, who himself has been accused dozens of times of sexual assault and misconduct, has already appeared in photos, emails and other documents in connection with Epstein, causing a rift in his base. Other business elites, academics, politicians and world leaders have also been named in connection to Epstein. While some have faced minor consequences, only Ghislaine Maxwell has been criminally convicted as part of Epstein\u2019",

He examines whether these attacks are genuinely aimed at degrading ISIL or if they are largely a show of force by the Trump administration.
