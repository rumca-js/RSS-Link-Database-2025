Books just aren\u2019t what I enjoy but I want to get back into it because my partner loves reading so I\u2019d like to read more. I finished reading Storm Front and currently going through second book in the installment called \u201cFool Moon\u201d, by Jim Butcher. Neither really grabbed my attention but still giving it a try. Storm front only caught my attention towards the end because of a plot twist but I wouldn\u2019t say I enjoyed the book as a whole. When I was young I enjoyed reading the Animorphs series and a series called \u201cChronicles of Vladimir Tod\u201d. I enjoy watching anime so I guess it\u2019s safe to say I enjoy fantasy so these are the types of books I enjoy. While getting back to reading i realized I rather listen to the audiobook version. Not sure if that\u2019s just how I enjoy it or if the two books weren\u2019t really good and that\u2019s just how I was able to get through them. Any suggestions plea",

I was walking through a book store and saw the cover and bought it for that reason alone but when I actually read it I felt like I was flipping through the memories of an old friend. Every character felt like someone I might have met before and every detail about the buildings and the scenery surrounding them felt deeply observed. Instead of feeling weighed down by all of the architectural descriptions or birdwatching moments, I found myself growing to love them. I also enjoyed the romance aspect of the book.

Granted I\u2019m only on chapter 5 but I feel like there should be SOME indication on what\u2019s going to happen but all I\u2019ve read is that there is a girl who was abused and bought an apartment and she also loves math. The last book I read (razor blade tears) literally like chapter 3 or so it was very clear what the book would be about and I feel like this one there\u2019s a lot of fluff and unimportant information.
