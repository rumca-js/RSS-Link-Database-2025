Aircraft from Jordan were also involved.\n \nIt said the operation \"employed more than 100 precision munitions\" targeting known IS infrastructure and weapons sites.\n \nPresident Donald Trump said \"we are striking very strongly\" against IS strongholds, following the 13 December IS ambush in the city of Palmyra in which two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter were killed.\n \nIS has not publicly commented. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Syria #US #BBCNews",
