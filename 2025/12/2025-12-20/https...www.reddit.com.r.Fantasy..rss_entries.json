This makes for excellent books and well rounded character arcs and worldbuilding. </p> <p>But sometimes I just want to read a fast paced book where the mc is constantly bashing up bad guys and being bashed up a bit himself. I recently wondered if that&#39;s one reason for the enduring popularity of books that contain the tropes of enslaved soldiers, mages, assassins, etc. We never lose that thrill of the fight, because the mc is constantly in danger. Rather than waiting half the book for the protagonist and his nemesis to cross swords in an epic duel, we see page after page of the mc&#39;s conflict with their captor or unwilling lord. </p> <p>It also does just increase the number of combat/violent",
