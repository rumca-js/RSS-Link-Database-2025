Earlier this year, I clustered 5 Mac Studios and it was 91% SLOWER. Everyone said clustering was stupid. But Apple just dropped a software update that changes everything - RDMA over Thunderbolt 5. Latency dropped from 300 microseconds to 3 microseconds. Now we're running trillion-parameter models locally at speeds that actually make sense.\n\n  \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Join the NetworkChuck Academy!: https://ntck.co/NCAcademy\n\n\n  RESOURCES / LINKS:\n\n  Docs/walkthrough: https://github.com/theNetworkChuck/mac-studio-cluster\n  Exo Labs: https://github.com/exo-explore/exo\n  MLX (Apple's ML Framework): https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx\n  My First Cluster Video (the failure): https://youtu.be/Ju0ndy2kwlw\n  RDMA Networking Explained: https://youtu.be/fb69FyW2KLk\n\n\n  TIMESTAMPS:\n\n  0:00 - The $50,000 AI Supercomputer\n  0:53 - What Ap",
