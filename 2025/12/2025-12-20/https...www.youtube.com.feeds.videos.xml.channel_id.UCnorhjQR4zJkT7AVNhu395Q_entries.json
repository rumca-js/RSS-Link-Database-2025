        "description": "In this video, I show you the strongest drywall patch repair you can do for high-impact areas like behind door knobs. I reinforce the patch and then door-slam test it repeatedly to prove it won\u2019t dent, crack, or fail like a normal drywall repair. If you found this video helpful, please subscribe. Hope you enjoy.
