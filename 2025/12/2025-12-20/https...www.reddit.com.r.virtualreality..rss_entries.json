Been having issues with frame rates but finally got it at a stable 90fps using H264, 150mbs bitrate and Godlike (Zephyrus G16 5090 - vbios swapped and OC), it\u2019s running smooth and looks great but I see people getting the bitrate to 400+ on H264+, but when I try, I\u2019m only getting 163mbs max, I\u2019ve tried a few different channels on the Puppis, but not all of them, is it a case of going through them one by one until you find one that allows a higher bitrate? </p> <p>And the next question, do I want higher than 150mbs for sim racing? I guess low latency is important.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wolfy2404\"> /u/Wolfy2404 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1prrc3y/puppis_s1_owners_how_to_increase_bitrate_in/\">[link]</a>",

Whats making it really hard to decide is that i can get a new psvr2 and a used ps5 for the same amount as a Quest 3 with Elite Strap. </p> <p>So for context i used to own a quest 3 before which is used to play standalone titles, watching movies and also VR sim racing using my PC but had to sell it due to financial reasons and now i am finally able to buy a vr headset again. </p> <p>So i do know how great the pancake lenses are and all that but like i mentioned i can also get a PS5 in the mix for the same price and i would love to play Gta 6 when it comes out lol. I am also looking to play PCVR too , the adapter is so pricey its like 90 aud</p> <p>SO idk what to do i do love the pancake lenses and clarity but getting the ps5 seems like more value in the long run too. Please help me out. Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Weak_",

I get motion sickness very easy and I&#39;m too grossed out to try demo units so I have never even thought about it.</p> <p>However I&#39;m a mixed media artist and I saw a friend mapping murals with VR and now I&#39;m interested. He sketched his art in procreate, and then used a headset to map his image to the wall he was painting. It eliminates the tedious work of using a grid to scale up and I&#39;m all about that kind of convenience.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering what kind of equipment and apps I&#39;d need to get this done. This is my only interest or need for it. I don&#39;t think I need anything super powerful for that (?) so a budget friendly option would be cool. I highly doubt the PSVR supports this kind of thing, but on the off chance it does I&#39;d love that so I can potentially use it for games, but my main goal is what I mentioned above. </",
