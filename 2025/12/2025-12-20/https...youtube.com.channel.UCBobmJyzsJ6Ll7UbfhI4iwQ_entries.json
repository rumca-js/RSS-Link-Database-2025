        "description": "The amount of work you can accomplish as an individual with a fashion brand or digital fashion aspirations is immense\u2014and more accessible than ever. As a digital fashion designer, whether established or aspiring, you don\u2019t have to rely on large teams or expensive tools to tell the full story behind your designs. \n\nIn this beginner-friendly session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, Zoe Anna Vanezis of Central Saint Martins college explores how Unreal Engine (and other free, easily available tools) can empower you to take your digitized garments and create rich, immersive narratives around them. \n\nAll the ideas that go into your design\u2014story, context, emotion\u2014can be fully visualized and brought to life. Find out how simple it is to bring your fashion looks into dynamic environments on MetaHumans animated with motion capture, and ultimately showcase your work in ways that once seemed out of reach. \n\nWhether you're a student, educator, or industry professional, you\u2019ll come away with a cl",
