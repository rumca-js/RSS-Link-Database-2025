        "description": "In this eye-opening TEDx talk, Jean-S\u00e9bastien Busque shares an unexpected social experiment that began with a single bathroom visit. After transitioning and experiencing public restrooms from both perspectives, he uncovered striking differences in behavior, unwritten rules, and social dynamics between men's and women's spaces.\n\nIf you'd like to contact Jean-Sebastien Busque, please visit www.jsbusque.com After 20+ years in the corporate world, Jean-S\u00e9bastien Busque reinvented his life when grief, burnout, and a gender transition made it impossible to keep pretending. Now, he is a speaker, author of \"My Apple Pie of Happiness\" and founder of Coh\u00e9rence conseil, guiding organizations and individuals from chaos to clarity with fearless authenticity! \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
