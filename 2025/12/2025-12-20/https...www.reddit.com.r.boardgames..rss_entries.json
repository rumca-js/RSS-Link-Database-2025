It\u2019s possible this is a well-known hack, but I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t think of this sooner. My son loves Fire Tower and recently got the Rising Flames expansion. While technically it is possible to fit the expansion pieces in the original box, it\u2019s difficult due to the cardboard insert\u2019s side pieces taking up room. So I removed it, cut off the side pieces, and flipped them upside down, then put all three pieces back in the box. I added some small pieces of mat board for dividers and at the ends for more stability, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. I\u2019m considering using some double-sided tape to stick the cardboard to the box walls. N",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone, I\u2019m curious to hear some honest opinions from people who enjoy board games. A few years back, board games designed specifically for couples seemed really popular \u2014 especially ones focused on bonding, conversation, or shared experiences. Lately, I\u2019m not sure if that interest is still there or if people prefer something else now.</p> <p>So I wanted to ask: Do you and your partner play games that are made for couples? What makes a couple-focused game appealing to you? Do these games feel fresh, or kind of repetitive? Would you rather just play a good 2-player game that isn\u2019t marketed \u201cfor couples\u201d? Not trying to promote anything \u2014 just genuinely interested in how people feel about this category today.</p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sad_Employ_8673\"> /u/Sad_Employ_8673 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1prdgpu/do_board_games_made_s",

So i am making it DIY</p> <p><em>If you dont know slip it in:</em> The game is about getting, in secret, a handful of phrases, words, or sentences that you have to &quot;slip in&quot; to conversation without getting busted doing it. Hence why the phrases typically are a bit unhinged, or strange, but nicely balanced to be possible to slip in under right circumstances, without being too obvious. </p> <p>So i&#39;m here asking for assistance, for phrases/words etc, i could use for my DIY cards. I will translate, so simply aid me in English. They can have whatever themes, all guests are in their twenties. Phrases could involve the new year of course, but anything goes.</p> <p>Thanks so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
