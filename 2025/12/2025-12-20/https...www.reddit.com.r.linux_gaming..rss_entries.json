Is there an official client? If not, is there an unofficial one? (I&#39;ve heard about a project called Nvidia Infinity) </p> <p>Or should i play it in the browser?

As far as I know it&#39;s because of the nvidia drivers and dx12.<br/> E.g. in Dying Light: The Beast I went from around 100fps on windows to 75 on cachyos. The game doesn&#39;t even run dx11, it crashes instantly. Same thing with Space Marine 2 - there was something like 15fps difference between windows and linux and I ended up below 60 frames. </p> <p>From what I&#39;ve heard AMD is recommended to run on linux so I&#39;ve thought about switching from 3060 TI to 6700XT (or 9060XT) just for the sake of having a smoother experience. </p> <p>Do you guys have any experience with this kind of switch? Or maybe I can tweak some nvidia settings to get better peformance? </p> <p>I&#39;m using newest KDE (I think it&#39;s 6.5) with Wayland</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

However on this new desktop I go to \u201cadd non steam game\u201d browse to the location of the .exe file, click select, but the game does not populate into the steam program selector to add to steam. I have been trying to get this to work for about 6 hours now. I have tried: fedora, mint, Ubuntu, bazzite. I have tried about 8 kernels. I have adjusted the folder permissions and ensured that the .exe is chmod\u2019ed as an executable file. Again I have never had this happen and now I can\u2019t get it to happen at all on this new desktop. I have a ryzen 5600 and and arc b580.
