        "description": "Americans spend nearly $1 trillion every holiday season. Here\u2019s a look at the businesses behind your favorite holiday traditions.\n\nFood is a big part of the season. We take you inside the businesses making candy canes from scratch and metal cookie cutters in classic holiday shapes. We also travel around the world to see how some of the world\u2019s finest holiday spices, like nutmeg and cinnamon, are produced.\n\nThe Christmas tree is one of the most important symbols of the holiday. We show how the iconic Rockefeller Center Christmas tree makes it to the heart of Manhattan and how regular-sized trees make it to your home. And no tree would be complete without ornaments. We travel to Germany, where one of the oldest glass-blown ornament businesses still stands.\n\nAnd what\u2019s Christmas without Santa Claus? To really pull off the role, people are going to Santa school to learn how to look, sound, and dance like St. Nick.\n\n00:00:00 - Introduction\n00:00:29 - Panettone\n00:10:46 - Nutmeg\n00:23:00 - ",
