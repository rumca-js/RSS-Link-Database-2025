With Dick Hallorann a major part of the story, The Shining and its sequel Doctor Sleep are very well-accounted for, but It's cosmological origins and the depth to which Welcome to Derry explores them also open the esoteric, floating door to hints about the world of The Dark Tower, the King saga around which all his other stories revolve.\n\n#IGN",
