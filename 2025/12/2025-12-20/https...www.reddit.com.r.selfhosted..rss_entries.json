I&#39;m in the process of creating a home server out of an older pc mainly to host a media server on Ubuntu. Mostly so I can easily play my own collections without having to have my main PC on all the time and probably to share with family and friends but in a few videos I&#39;ve noticed that certain people using some sort of overall server software, almost like a container where they have their media server and also various other things. I think one was called Glance. Dude had his plex in there along with a bunch of other programs, a pihole as well, I host a pihole on an orange pi but I guess it could be hosted on this new server. </p> <p>My question is, is this the better way to go about setting up a home server? Really all I wanted out of it was a media server but I guess I could also host files for myself, point one of my domains to it, etc. or should I jus stick with the original idea ",
