At the same time, it can shoot 14-bit photos at up to 30 fps with 16 stops of dynamic range, the highest ever on a Sony (or nearly any other) camera.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On the video side, the A7 V now supports 4K 10-bit S-Log3 video at 60 fps using the full sensor width with supersampling from 7K. Note that to get full-width video in 4K 60 fps mode, you must turn on a feature called Angle of View Priority that turns off in-camera noise reduction but doesn't affect quality, according to Sony. 4K at 120 fps is also possible with an APS-C crop.

The possible origins of the term \u201cwhite elephant\u201d provide one way of looking at it: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>Whether or not that story is true, it gives us one way of looking at a white elephant gift: something just useful or amusing enough that it won\u2019t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, there are plenty of other ways of interpreting this strange yet delightful tradition.",
