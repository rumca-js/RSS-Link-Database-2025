        "description": "Political labels like \u201cfascist,\u201d \u201ccommunist,\u201d and even \u201cterrorist\u201d have become floating weapons rather than descriptions, hurled and withdrawn as Trump, Mamdani, Maddow, Cheney and others rearrange themselves inside the same small club of power. When Kamala Harris and Rachel Maddow turn up at Dick Cheney\u2019s funeral, and a man Trump calls a \u201ccommunist lunatic\u201d happily calls Trump a \u201cfascist\u201d days after a cordial meeting, it exposes how empty these labels now are as markers of principle. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s resignation and apology for toxic politics, alongside her breaks on war funding and Epstein transparency, hint at something more dangerous to the system than partisan outrage: an individual stepping outside the script and exposing how much of our \u201cideology\u201d is really conditioning. The real question isn\u2019t whether someone is left or right, but who writes the roles we\u2019re all expected to play\u2014and what happens when we refuse.\n[UNPACKED]\n\nGo to https://rumble.com/premium/BRAND and join",
