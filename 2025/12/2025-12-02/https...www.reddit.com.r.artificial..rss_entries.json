She was fixing the areas that the machine thought looked like AI.</p> <p>I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m not insulted.

It\u2019s spent on repetitive workflow steps. - Ingestion: data formats vary, cleaning rules stay the same - Chunking: simple segmentation but breaks easily when inconsistent - Metadata alignment: structural drift forces manual fixes - JSON validation: mechanical corrections to model output - Eval setup: repeated patterns across every project - Tool contracts: predictable inputs and outputs - DAG wiring: same templates, different logic - Logging and fallback: always required, rarely complex</p> <p>These steps repeat because they aren\u2019t deep-skill tasks, but they hold the system together.
