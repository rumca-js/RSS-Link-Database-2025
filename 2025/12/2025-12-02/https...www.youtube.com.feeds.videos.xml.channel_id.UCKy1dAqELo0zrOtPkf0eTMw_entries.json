        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe Helldivers movie has found a director in Justin Lin. Lin has experience with big franchises, helming several Fast and Furious movies and Star Trek Beyond. Helldivers has become one of Sony's most important gaming properties, with Helldivers 2 becoming its biggest-selling Sony title on PC, and being one of the few Sony-published games on Xbox. In related news, Helldivers developer Arrowhead has enlisted the help of Sony PC port specialist Nixxes to help trim Helldivers 2's file size on PC. Currently, the game takes up a massive 154GB of space, but a beta version now comes in at around 23GB. Arrowhead is planning to roll out the space-saving update once it completes testing. And finally, Xbox has revealed its December Game Pass lineup, with Mortal Kombat 1 leading the way. Sci-fi horror game ROUTINE will also launch on Day 1 on the service.",
