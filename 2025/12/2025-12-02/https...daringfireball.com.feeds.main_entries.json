The app is intended to track stolen phones, block them and\nprevent them from being misused.</p>\n\n<p>The government also wants manufacturers to ensure that the app is\nnot disabled. And for devices already in the supply chain,\nmanufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates,\n<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/india-orders-mobile-phones-preloaded-with-government-app-ensure-cyber-safety-2025-12-01/\">Reut",
