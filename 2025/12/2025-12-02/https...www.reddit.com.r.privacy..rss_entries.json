While I take some cuts for convenience (using apple devices, using a few social media, etc.), I&#39;m very locked down and probably better off than 99% of the population.

I like seeing good numbers (VO2 max, cardio recovery) go up and take good care of my body. As such, I use the apple watch to collect biometric data like heart health, breathing, sleep, etc. to keep track of my body. Now Apple claims that your data is kept private unless you choose to share it with others (doctors, research studies), in which case you&#39;re data is made anonymous, but at the same time, this is Apple. They&#39;re probably better for privacy than some mainstream tech companies, but they&#39;re still bought out by the government and advertisers. Is ",
