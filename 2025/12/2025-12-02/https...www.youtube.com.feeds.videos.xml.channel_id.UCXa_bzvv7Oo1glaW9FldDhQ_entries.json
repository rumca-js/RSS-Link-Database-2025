        "description": "the PS5 version of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 stands tall alongside the Xbox and PC versions. It delivers a decently optimized experience that remains faithful to Asobo\u2019s vision. \n\nDespite a few minor differences in texture loading and world streaming responsiveness, the game offers a near-identical level of fidelity - making it another successful port of a previously Xbox exclusive to Sony\u2019s platform",

        "description": "On PS5, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is imperfect, occasionally obtuse, and sometimes rough around the edges. It\u2019s also the closest PlayStation players have ever come to the real sensation of flight. \n\nDid my living room transform into a metaphorical cockpit? Partially, DualSense\u2019s underwhelming implementation can\u2019t replicate a HOTAS setup, with some readability issues genuinely holding back the experience. \n\nYet, the world, the weather system, and the slowly blossoming sense of mastery make MSFS 2024 utterly absorbing. It\u2019s more than a technical curio now. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 is a journey, one that nudges you persistently, whether you\u2019re casual or veteran, toward your own piloting zenith.\n\nXbox provided a PS5 code of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.",

        "description": "If there was any way to deflate someone before The Game Awards, it's with the words, \u201cNo new Witcher 4 content.\u201d Sad but true. After last year's surprise trailer, CD Projekt RED will be content to sit back and enjoy the show (and maybe even net that Most Anticipated Game award).\n\nThat doesn't mean we don't have plenty of other details to keep us busy, like the fact that The Witcher 4 isn't launching next year, according to studio co-CEO Micha\u0142 Nowakowski. Was it that obvious, especially after the company said we wouldn't see it until 2027 at the earliest? Probably not, but development is proceeding as planned since it entered full production last year.",
