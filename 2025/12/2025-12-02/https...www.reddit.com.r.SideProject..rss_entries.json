I spent the last 2 months creating a solution to a problem I deal with everyday, and it&#39;s a product I fully believe in. The problem is everyone nowadays is so quick to write off new companies. So those of you who have hit the milestone of getting your first customer-- how did you do it? I know if people actually try my product they will love it. So the issue now is getting people to try it on the free tier and hopefully spreading the word.</p> <p>For context, I built a 3rd party connector to Notion that connects to your Outlook and pulls contacts and emails as they arrive. It puts all contacts into a database- each row is a person, and all emails appear within that contact&#39;s page, in order. It has saved me hours of manually tracking relationships in Notion, and acts as a lightweight CRM that is automated instea",

It got me thinking about building something that tracks progress in a calm, unobtrusive way without becoming a productivity system. I\u2019m still at the early exploration stage, mostly sketching ideas and seeing what feels useful rather than trying to finalise anything. Sharing it here because this community often approaches projects with genuine curiosity instead of rigid expectations. It&#39;s enjoyable to experiment with concepts without feeling compelled, especially when the inspiration comes from ordinary, everyday experiences.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SithEldenLord\"> /u/SithEldenLord </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pc4hwj/examining_a_minor_concept_inspired_by_something_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32",

It reaches 170\u2013185\u00b0F consistently and heats up in around 15 minutes, which is better than most home units I\u2019ve tried. The heat feels clean and even, and I sweat more in 20 minutes at home than I ever did at the gym.</p> <p>Build quality is solid. The panels are heavy, the interior feels premium, and nothing looks or feels cheap. Once assembled, it\u2019s sturdy and doesn\u2019t creak or shift. Setup took me and a friend about 90 minutes.</p> <p>Overall user experience has been great. I use it four to five times a week, and it\u2019s noticeably improved sleep and recovery. It\u2019s not a budget sauna, but the performance and quality justify the price. If you want a reliable, high-heat home sauna without going into ultra-luxury pricing, Salus is worth considering.</p> <p>You can use code RAY10 to get a 10%",

I picked random business problems and tried to make them less painful. There was no real plan, just curiosity.</p> <p>My first setup was for a small gym that needed follow up messages to go out automatically. Then a dentist\u2019s office. Then a real estate agent. None of it was flashy work, just cleaning up tasks nobody wanted to do.</p> <p>After a few months, referrals started to snowball and suddenly this little side project was pulling in around $5k a month. I still feel like I am making it up as I go, but I learned a few things:</p> <ul> <li>Solve one annoying problem for someone you know</li> <li>Keep the tech simple so people actually use it</li> <li>Charge for ongoing support instead of one time builds</li> <li>Watch their real workflow instead of what they describe in meetings</li> </ul> <p>It is wild how much demand there is for basic automation.

I also never knew what to cook and or a good recipe. </p> <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I built an AI that takes your ingredients, cravings, or even your &quot;mood&quot; and generates a custom recipe instantly. It also creates an image of the dish so you know what you&#39;re aiming for, then saves it for future use.</p> <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Ingredient-based generation (reduces food waste)</li> <li>Dietary filters (Keto, Vegan, etc.)</li> <li>Voice input for when your hands are messy</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s live on the App Store now. I\u2019d love to get your feedback on the recipe quality!</p> <p><",
