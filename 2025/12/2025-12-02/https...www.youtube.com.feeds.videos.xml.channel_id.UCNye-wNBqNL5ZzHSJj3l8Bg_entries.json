As the world's biggest producer of cobalt, the DRC is a part of the chain that fuels electric vehicles and renewable energy worldwide. Miners in the DRC face dangerous working conditions and earn, on average, a few dollars per day to supply the multibillion-dollar industry.\n\nEagle is caught in the middle when unrest grows among miners who accuse foreign buyers of underweighing and undervaluing the cobalt they extract. Once a miner himself, can Mujinga navigate demands from the miners while maintaining relations with foreign buyers?\n\nCobalt Miners is a documentary film by Arthur Nazaryan, Neild Brandvold, Mike Shum and Qinling Li.\n\n#documentary #cobalt #renewableenergy #mining #DRC #congo #energy #humanrights #aljazeeraenglish #aljazeera #africa",
