I want to lean into your expertise and ask what certs if any have you found most beneficial to study and receive in your field? What books or resources would you suggest I study or use that you wish someone had told you before getting into this? I am currently going from software engineering to my masters in cyber and I want to set myself up for success. So any advice or guidance will be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advance. I know the question will probably be &quot; what do I want to do with cyber so ill say it now. I want to protect networks and companies from attackers and maybe do pen testing to learn how to reverse engineer viruses and programs to better protect those companies. what route best supports this path?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ScarSuperb2563\"> /u/ScarSuperb2563 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://w",
