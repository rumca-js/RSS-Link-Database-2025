I have played it locally close to 300 gameplays (+900 players) and I think it\u2019s in the right place to show it to the world. Most games are 2-3 players I think its the sweetspot.</p> <p>Overview: It\u2019s a 2 to 4 player push-your-luck game where each turn you must choose:</p> <p>Drink the potion yourself\u2026 or choose who to gift it to.</p> <p>Games last around 10\u201315 minutes, so it\u2019s easy to try a few rounds.</p> <p>What the Game Feels Like</p> <ul> <li>Very quick turns</li> <li>Bluffing and second-guessing</li> <li>\u201cDo I drink this\u2026 or give it to yo",
