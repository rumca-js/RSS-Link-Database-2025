The inevitable Erling Haaland smashed through the 100-goal barrier and a Premier League record. Phil Foden scored his second brace in four days. City raced to a 5-1 lead before an hour was even on the clock only for Fulham to come agonisingly close to parity by the end. All of it culminating in one of the highest-scoring matches in three decades of the Premier League. Not bad.</p><p>Full value for money was achieved before half-time as City imposed themselves on their hosts with ruthless timing. Erling Haaland had come into the game on 99 Premier League goals, but had drawn a blank in his past two league matches. With just five minutes gone and bearing down on Bernd Leno, after being played in by Phil Foden, it appeared the wait was swiftly over. But in the most unusual of occurrences, Haaland calmly wrapped a shot beyond the Fulham keeper but watched stunned as the ball hit",

But they are also uplifting, in a confusing kind of way, like being told to dress for sun even when the clouds are black.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/dec/02/tom-sandberg-life-photography-vibrant-world-norway-henie-onstad-kunstsenter-oslo\">Continue reading...</a>",
