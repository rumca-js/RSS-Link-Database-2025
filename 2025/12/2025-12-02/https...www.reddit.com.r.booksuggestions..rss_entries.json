Something along the lines of a stalker from their pov and the stalked. Something where we don\u2019t know who the stalker is but get their pov. Maybe even a 0lot twist. But i need something to hold my attention and make me not want to put the book down. I recently read lights out by navessa allen but im looking for something where its not so easy! Steamier the better, but keep the plot ofc! I dont care if FxF or MxM or MxF, whatever it is i\u2019m down to read it. If it\u2019s not even humans but some fantasy, i\u2019m listening! Please tell me there is a book! Published or written on some random website. I need that book please.

In the last two years, I have read and loved the 3-body problem trilogy and both the Foundation and Empire cycles, especially due to the plot complexity, the sense of &quot;scientifically likeness&quot; pervading the novels (being a physics student, this is making things really interesting to me) and some relevant thoughts hidden (or obvious) between the lines.

A lot of YA books seem to be fantasy which he doesn&#39;t seem into (although he did love the Harry Potter books). He used to love all the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books as they were funny and relatable but he&#39;s read them all and is a bit too old for them anyway. These are the only books I&#39;ve seen him devour cover-to-cover in a couple of sittings. He read one of the Rick Riordan books but it didn&#39;t inspire him to read more.

I love when one of them is obsessed with their partner but absolutely hate slow burn unless it\u2019s written well and I\u2019m sucked into the plot. And I love me some spice (don\u2019t care how much as long as it\u2019s not like 90% of the novel).</p> <p>I also mostly read thriller / horror when it comes to non-web novels and have just started dipping my feet into fantasy and romance, so maybe some dark elements would be nice but not a strict limit, I\u2019m open to suggestions!</p> <p>pls recommend me your favourite books that will leave me gagged and gripping my sheets!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chubuns\"> /u/chubuns </a> <br/> <span><a ",

I DNFed the first WoT book, I think it was just that it feels very... not adult? Like, I don&#39;t <em>need</em> violence and sex but I hate when we&#39;re all pretending humans don&#39;t bleed and aren&#39;t banging.</p> <p>I just picked up a couple more books over the past month that maybe focused more on emotion but seemed mostly like they didn&#39;t really have a story or a thought-provoking/interesting world. I also tried the third Foundation novel (I read the first two), but I really couldn&#39;t get into it because it was lacking emotion.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been craving actual character-driven stories with emotional depth and romance but within an interesting wider world. The most immediate example is something like Avatar but with more romance (I know it&#39;s a cartoon but bear with me). I&#39;d also love if it was M/M romance :)</p> <p>Thank you for any suggestions</p> ",
