As Ive gotten that setup up and going starting to think about the next stage of data backups. My overall data usage is not as high as many others here but Im sure it will continue to grow into the future and this strategy may change with budget constraints in mind, but for now and for some time this has capacity.</p> <p>Ive done some reading about various backup plans such as 3-2-1 and 3-2-1-1 and have thought up the below flow.

I also have an old Intel i7 3770K PC that can function as a backup destination, also with 30 TB of disk space.</p> <p>At first I wanted to run Unraid on the backup machine as well, however I&#39;m having issues choosing the correct backup software. Many of them archives the files into zip or tar files, which I don&#39;t want. I just want raw files, and my destination array is already NTFS with data on it. </p> <p>At this point I&#39;m wondering if it would just be easier to let the backup machine run Windows 10 and have GoodSync (which I do have a license for) do its timed backup of the Unraid server. Somehow it just feels too complicated running Unraid on both machines, considering my backed up data on the target machine already is on a NTFS partition.</p> <p>Anyone have a better recommendation?

Some websites this messes with the formatting, and its also a pain if I want to archive many or all pages on a website. Its also an annoying amount of work to name and sort the pages in a way that will make them easy to find in the future.
