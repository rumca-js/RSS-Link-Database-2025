Reason: I like to dwell in the worldbuilding of a fantasy series, and don&#39;t want it to end too soon. Trilogies are fine but they are too short for me to really enjoy the fantasy world of which they are built. As such, I like long series.</p> <p>You may recommend me any series, so long as it is 5 books long. So far, I only read a song of ice and fire and wheel of time, both of which I enjoy very much. But I am fine to any long series, so long as they are in the fantasy genre.</p> <p>I will prefer it not to be for children like the chronicles or Narnia or YA. I prefer adult series, though the characters don&#39;t have to be morally gray. I don&#39;t mind series with clear cut good and bad characters. Feel free to recommend your series and tell me why I should read it.</p> <p>Series can be ongoing (Not yet completed) like a song of ice and fire o",

I know this sounds like a contradiction, because I mentioned GRRM, he just happened to do it so well. So I\u2019m willing to consider exceptions, but would prefer to stay away from that. </p> <p>By Tolkien inspired, I mean a setting similar to middle earth.

While I can find many lists of what trigger warnings are present in the series, it does not specify how many times they occur.</p> <p>Is anyone able to quantity roughly how much child sexual assault is in the series? I do not recall it being prominent at all, but I am also fortunate enough to don&#39;t require the trigger warning so it could easily escape my memory. If anyone can say roughly where it occurs would also be helpful, but I don&#39;t expect that by any means.<",

But after reading them, I completely fell in love, with the characters, the world, and the grimdark atmosphere of The First Law.</p> <p>Earlier this year, in October, I finally got the chance to complete my journey through the standalones and the Age of Madness trilogy. And what can I say Joe Abercrombie writes characters like no one else. You want to know more about them, see things from their point of view, understand how they feel, and predict how they\u2019ll react.
