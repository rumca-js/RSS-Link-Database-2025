That&#39;s happening a lot more with people my age, and by extension future users. But the normies? Every post I see from the normies in regard to the Steam Machine is <em>excitement</em>.

It&#39;s been a few months since I started thinking on switching to Linux, I&#39;ve made my researches and already been using it a bit on other computers, but not my main one.</p> <p>I wanted to ask for some tips from people that already use it. I know Proton on Steam is already an amazing compatibility layer and almost all games work on Linux, and like 99% of the games I play are from my Steam library, so that&#39;s not an issue. What I wanted to ask was, is there an issue with other games/programs?</p> <p>I know games that use kernel-level anticheat are hard to play or even unplayable, so in that case I would need to have a dualboot, and also, are there any issues with software? Most of the programs I use already work on Linux natively (Blender, Godot, etc...) But for example I use RPGMaker MZ to develop my game, my friend tested it and he managed to make it work with Bottles, same with Photoshop, but he didn&#39;t <em>really</em> used ",
