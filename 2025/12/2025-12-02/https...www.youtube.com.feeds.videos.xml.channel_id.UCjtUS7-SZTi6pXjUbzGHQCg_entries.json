What if solar panels could generate twice the power for a fraction of the cost, making them cheap enough that you'd actually want them on your roof? This is a solar cell made with both perovskites and graphene, the record-breaking result of a collaboration between three Aussie teams. This perovskite cell initially had an efficiency of 16.65%, behind the 20% efficiency range of standard silicon. The introduction of graphene, though, almost doubled that initial figure to 30.6% \u2026 all while cutting production costs by 80%. How is this possible? And more importantly, when might these actually end up on your roof?\n\nWatch Why Thorium is About to Change the World https://youtu.be/bz4aTO6M4Ho?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5OiQ\n\nVideo script",
