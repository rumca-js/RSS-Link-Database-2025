        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, Josh Grant gives a look at what it takes to develop and publish a game in Fortnite by building a first-person shooter payload game from scratch.\n\nFrom an empty project all the way to the publishing stage, you\u2019ll be surprised how easy it is to stand up a game by yourself. \n\nJosh breaks down each step along the way, including rapid prototyping of game logic and level design, building immersive environments, setting up custom UI, creating retentive game loops, and making attractive thumbnails. \n\nThere\u2019s no better time than now to learn how to develop your game in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)!\n\nLearn more about UEFN here: unrealengine.com/uses/uefn-unreal-editor-for-fortnite\n\n#GameDevelopment, #FirstPersonShooter, #UnrealEditorForFortnite, #UEFN, #Fortnite, #UnrealFestStockholm",
