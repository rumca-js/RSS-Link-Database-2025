It's a powerful message to those who are often demotivated by \"Hey, It's not possible for you.\" Throughout the talk  the speaker says about the magic of 'WHYNOT ME\" Neha Karthikeyan, a thoughtful and determined student who loves exploring new ideas, writing, and finding meaning in everyday moments. Neha believes that \u201cimpossible\u201d is just a word \u2014 and today, through her talk, she hopes to remind us that most limits only exist in our minds. Her goal is to make us rethink how we see challenges and maybe even find the possible in our own impossible.

I Costituenti, consapevoli della necessit\u00e0 di parlare a un popolo reduce dalla guerra e in larga parte analfabeta, lavorarono per creare una Costituzione scritta con parole semplici e comprensibili.\nTra loro, il latinista e partigiano Concetto Marchesi cur\u00f2 la revisione linguistica insieme a Piero Pancrazi e Antonio Baldini, applicando regole essenziali: frasi brevi, poche subordinate e vocaboli di uso comune, per evitare il burocratese.\nIl risultato fu un testo chiaro e accessibile: 9.300 parole, 1.357 vocaboli diversi, dei quali oltre il 92% appartiene al vocabolario di base dell\u2019italiano. Come rilevato da Tullio De Mauro, questa scelta ha reso la Costituzione immediatamente comprensibile a tutti, contribuendo alla sua fama di \u201cCostituzione pi\u00f9 bella del mondo\u201d, forte e limpida nel linguaggio.\n\n Alfonso Ce",

A woman with acne scars wants to feel seen again. A burn survivor wants to feel like himself again. What looks like \u201cenhancement\u201d from the outside is often healing taking place on the inside.\n\nDr. Sahiba traces beauty from ancient civilizations to today\u2019s world of filters, fillers, and AI-driven perfection exposing the illusions that empower and the illusions that harm. She breaks down the science behind modern aesthetic medicine, highlighting how regenerative treatments don\u2019t just reshape features, but restore confidence, identity, and dignity.\n\nAs AI and augmented reality begin to blur the boundaries between illusion and reality, sh",

Rather than treating motivation as a temporary boost or a burst of inspiration, he uncovers the scientific truth: motivation doesn\u2019t come from outside-it comes from identity.\n\nThrough relatable examples, he explains how two people facing the same situation react completely differently, not because of talent or skill, but because of how they see themselves. He breaks down how perception shapes emotion, how identity shapes effort, and how shifting the story we tell ourselves can completely shift the energy we bring to any task.\n\nFrom treadmill tricks to emotional reframing, from observing your inner dialogue to rebuilding your sense of self with logic and compassion, Saurabh offers practical tools that redefine motivation at its core.\n\nHis message is simple but powerful:\nyou don\u2019t need more discipline, y",

        "description": "Dr Sara Rizvi, a renowned sociologist and educator, reflects on the systemic problems faced by the elderly in her TED Talk. She noted that after studying an old age home in Pakistan, most residents suffered from loneliness, sleeplessness, and other mental health issues due to the lack of accessible primary and tertiary healthcare. To bridge the gap between the older and younger generations and address these issues, she proposed solutions such as weekly intergenerational activities, internship programmes, and integrating time with the elderly into the school curriculum. In a survey she conducted, she discovered that although the youth face different challenges from the elderly, they still demonstrate empathy towards older generations. She also highlighted the potential of our generation, believing that we can break down the barriers faced by both Gen Z and baby boomers. She concluded her talk by elaborating on Muhammad Ali Jinnah\u2019s famous quote, \u201cUnity, Faith, Discipline,\u201d explaining h",

        "description": "In this powerful TEDx talk, national cyclist Fatima Tahir shares her journey from a 10-year-old girl limited to an egg-and-spoon race to becoming a forerunner for Pakistani women in sports. She reflects on the challenges, societal pressures, and the ongoing repercussions that female athletes face. Fatima mentions drawing strength from sports icons like Sania Mir, Hajra Khan, and Samina Baig; she recounts her accidental start in cycling, the difficult setbacks, failed exams, injuries, federation politics, and the moment her dream almost came to an end. But with the courage and strength of her family, Fatima rose again to become a national junior champion, and later she founded the Falcon Triathlon Club. Her message is clear: when one generation chooses trust over fear, the next finds the courage to change the world. Fatima Tahir is an International School Lahore Alumna and 19 year old athlete on a mission to inspire young girls in Pakistan to run, cycle, and follow their dreams. With a",

He talks about how environment, culture, and spirituality affect mental health by talking about his childhood, which was misunderstood but full of imagination, the strict demands of medical school, and the harsh realities of psychiatric practice in Pakistan. Dr. Hotiana talks about the problems that come with stigma, the flaws in outdated systems, and the need for empathy and honest communication. He does this by drawing on his own clinical experiences and those of his mentors and spiritual leaders. Dr. Hotiana illustrates that bridging generational divides necessitates humility, connection, and comprehension among spirituality, mentorship, and science.\n Dr Usman Hotiana is the Head of the Psychiatry Department at Rashid Latif Medical College and a graduate of King Edward",
