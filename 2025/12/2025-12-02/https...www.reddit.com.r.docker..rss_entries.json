It creates 2 containers: ocsinventory-db (which is the OCS database) and ocsinventory-server. The only problem was that I ended up forgetting to configure it to start on its own if the VM restarted, and when the VM restarted, I saw that when I ran the command: docker ps -a it was only showing ocsinventory-db, but even so, when accessing the OCS URL it was working normally. It&#39;s as if his Docker had turned into a &quot;ghost&quot;. Does anyone know what it could be and how to fix it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gabriell_Luna\"> /u/Gabriell_Luna </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",
