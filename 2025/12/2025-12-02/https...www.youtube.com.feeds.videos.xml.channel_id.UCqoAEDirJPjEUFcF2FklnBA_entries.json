        "description": "Can you listen to a picture of the universe? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice welcome back Chandra X-ray Observatory data-sonification expert Kim Arcand of the to explore how translating cosmic data into sound lets us sense the universe in entirely new ways. \n\nWe break down what sonification is and why it helps both sighted and non-sighted people interpret information hidden in invisible wavelengths like X-rays and infrared. From reconstructing images through sound to rethinking how we perceive radio signals in movies like Contact, Neil and Chuck trace how these translations shift our understanding of space itself.\n\nWith Chandra\u2019s razor-sharp resolution, we explore how it is perfect for studying black holes, pulsars, and high-energy cosmic events. We break down stellar explosions, the bizarre behavior of Eta Carinae, and how 3D-printed nebulae help scientists analyze structures like the Homunculus.\n\nLearn about the power of sonification for detecting patterns, color-ma",
