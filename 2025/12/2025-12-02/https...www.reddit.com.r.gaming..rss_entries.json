It is just a clean idea that makes everything smoother. But very few games copy it even though it works every time.</p> <p>For me it is the quick heal system from Bloodborne. Small risk, fast reward, no long menus. It keeps the fight alive.</p> <p>Another one is the ping system from Apex Legends. Clear. Simple. No need for voice chat. Every team game should have something like that.</p> <p>I think every gamer has at least one small mechanic like this.
