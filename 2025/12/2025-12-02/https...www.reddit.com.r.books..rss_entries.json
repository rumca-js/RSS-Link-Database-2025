Romantasy and &quot;spicy romance&quot; have exploded in popularity, and while there&#39;s nothing wrong with erotic content, I&#39;m seeing more and more titles with very loose structure, weak worldbuilding, or rough prose becoming bestsellers because of their explicit elements, while craft-heavy fiction struggles to get comparable visibility unless it also leans into smut. It feels like the market increasingly rewards quick dopamine hits over narrative quality, possibly as a side effect of TikTok-driven publishing.</p> <p>One thing that stands out is the labeling problem. A lot of heavily explicit books are shelved or marketed simply as romance or fantasy romance, without any clear indication of explicit content. This means readers, especially younger ones, can easily stumble into material that&#39;s far more graphic than expected. I&#",
