Today, the core of the AI build-out is driven by the most profitable, cash-rich companies on the planet: Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, NVIDIA, Broadcom, and the hyperscalers. These firms have actual products, real demand, and business models that already scale.</p> <p>What is similar to the Dotcom era is the valuation stretch and the expectation curve.

Inspired by this success, researchers have explored adapting these methods to speech by discretizing continuous audio into tokens using neural audio codecs. However, existing approaches face limitations, including high bitrates, the loss of either semantic or acoustic information, and the reliance on multi-codebook designs when trying to capture both, which increases architectural complexity for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce FocalCodec, an efficient low-bitrate codec based on focal modulation that utilizes a single binary codebook to compress speech between 0.16 and 0.65 kbps.
