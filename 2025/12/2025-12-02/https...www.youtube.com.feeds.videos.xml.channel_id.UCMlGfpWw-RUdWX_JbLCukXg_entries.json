Discover the Power of Ownership-Aware Profiling - Alecto Irene Perez - CppCon 2025\n---\n\nWhen it comes to memory profiling, there are two questions that most people care about: \n \n -  Why is my program using so much memory? \n -  And, how do I make it use less memory?\n\nEven with tools like valgrind, massif, or heaptrack, these questions can be challenging to answer. This talk introduces a new ownership-aware method for memory profiling, which directly ties allocations to objects under the RAII model. \n \nOwnership-aware profiling allows for direct measurement of the size of all non-trivial objects allocated over the lifetime of a program, without manual instrumentation of the code. \n \nIn this talk, I explain the basics of memory profiling; I describe how to make memory profilers  object-aware  by tracking deallocations that occur during destructor calls; I present an open-source tool for ownership-aware profiling; and finally, I p",
