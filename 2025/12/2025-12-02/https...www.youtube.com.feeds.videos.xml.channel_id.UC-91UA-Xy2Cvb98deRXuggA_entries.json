        "description": "Job interviews are cooked. Completely done. And nothing proves it better than a LinkedIn recruiter melting down because a candidate dared to interview at more than one place. A woman accepted a better offer, and this guy acts like she triggered a supply-chain collapse because she didn\u2019t treat his offer like a blood oath.\n\nIn today\u2019s video, we break down the absurd fantasy world where companies can ghost you, delay you, underpay you, and juggle 40 candidates at once \u2014 but you choosing the best job is \u201cunprofessional\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful.\u201d It\u2019s peak LinkedIn logic.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt like the hiring process has turned into a rigged reality show where the rules only apply to you, this one\u2019s for you. Interviews aren\u2019t just broken \u2014 jobs are cooked.\n\n#RecruiterCringe #LinkedInLunatics #JoshuaFluke\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Support my content because corporate sponsors rarely do! \n https://www.patreon.com/joshuafluke\n\n\ud83d\udd25 Need a resume/cover letter?

        "description": "LinkedIn recruiters have entered their feral era, and apparently the rest of us are just here to survive it.\n\nOne recruiter says they reject candidates because their voice sounded \u201cdry.\u201d Another says your name has the wrong number of syllables. Then someone else says you\u2019re \u201cmysterious\u201d if you don\u2019t post your entire medical history and social security number on LinkedIn.\n\nAt this point, you don\u2019t need a resume \u2014 you need a branding team, a dialect coach, a nose-flute solo, and a vowel-optimization strategy just to get a phone screen.\n\nIn this video, we break down the latest wave of recruiter meltdowns, featuring:\n\nThe guy who demands you \u201csound excited\u201d over the phone, even though the job description sounds like prison with Wi-Fi\n\nThe study claiming your name determines your career destiny (sorry Tate, you should\u2019ve been born a Noel)\n\nThe recruiter who rejected a senior data architect because his LinkedIn profile looked like a national security threat\n\nAnd the absolute 5-D chess follo",
