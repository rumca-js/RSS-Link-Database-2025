RED has long been one of the top choices for big-budget productions, offering a combination of image quality and flexibility that's unrivaled by most consumer cameras. They're also wildly expensive, topping out at around $45,000 on the high-end, putting them far out of reach for most everyday projects. But now, Nikon is promising to take the most unique part of RED - the file format that powers its incredible imagery - and offer it at a fraction of the price.</p>\n<p",
