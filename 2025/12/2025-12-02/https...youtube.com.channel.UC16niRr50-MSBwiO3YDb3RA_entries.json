        "description": "Today, the UK's secretary of state for justice David Lammy has confirmed plans to get rid of jury trials for crimes with sentences of less than three years.\n\nThe reforms to the justice system include creating \"swift courts\" under the government's plan to tackle unprecedented delays in the court system. Serious offences including murder, robbery and rape will still go before a jury. Lammy has said the reforms were \u201cbold\u201d but \u201cnecessary\u201d. Adam is joined by home and legal correspondent Dominic Casciani.\n\nAnd, amidst all the noise around last week\u2019s budget you may have missed the prime minister's suggestion that he will accept all the recomendations made in a report that criticised the UK\u2019s nuclear power industry as expensive and \u201coverly complex\u201d.\n\nThe man who wrote it, John Fingleton, tells Adam about what he found and what he thinks it tells us about the UK\u2019s approach to regulation.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#B",
