Elizabeth talks about the law of naval warfare & the law of armed conflict and how this act might be considered a war crime, & that there could be legal consequences for Secretary Hegseth. She also talks about when she expects to hear from the US Supreme Court on their ruling over the President's tariff actions. Elizabeth speaks with Joe Mathieu and Amara Omeokwe on the late edition of Bloomberg's \"Balance of Power.\"  (Source: Bloomberg)",
