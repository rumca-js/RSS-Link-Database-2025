        "description": "A visit to the wave lab to learn about how hurricanes affect coastal structures.\n\u2699\ufe0f Check out SendCutSend for custom parts fabricated from your CAD: http://sendcutsend.com/practicalengineering\n\nEngineering is a balancing act; we need structures that are both strong and safe, but also affordable, easy to occupy, and maybe even architecturally pleasing. Using knowledge gained from tests like this helps us get a clearer definition of the edges of the problem we\u2019re solving.\n\nHuge thanks to Dr. Dan Cox and his team of researchers at Oregon State University for inviting us to film this test.\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-hurricane-vs-tiny-house\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us. It is hosted, written, and produced by Grady Hillhouse. We have new videos posted regularl",
