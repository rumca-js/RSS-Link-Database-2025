        "description": "Archaeologists excavating the ancient Roman city of Gabii have uncovered a massive stone-lined basin that may represent one of Rome\u2019s earliest monumental civic structures. Its central placement hints that early Romans were already experimenting with dramatic public spaces centuries before the iconic Forum took shape. The site\u2019s remarkable preservation\u2014made possible because Gabii was abandoned early\u2014offers an unprecedented look at how Romans adapted Greek architectural ideas into powerful symbols of politics, ritual, and identity.",

        "description": "Some white dwarfs in rapid binary orbits are far hotter and larger than theory predicts. Researchers found that powerful tidal forces between them generate enough heat to inflate their sizes and change their orbital behavior. This leads the stars to interact much sooner than expected, potentially triggering dramatic cosmic events. The new model may offer clues about the origins of type Ia supernovae.",

        "description": "As the last Ice Age waned and the Holocene dawned, deep-ocean circulation around Antarctica underwent dramatic shifts that helped release long-stored carbon back into the atmosphere. Deep-sea sediments show that ancient Antarctic waters once trapped vast amounts of carbon, only to release it during two major warming pulses at the end of the Ice Age. Understanding these shifts helps scientists predict how modern Antarctic melt may accelerate future climate change.",
