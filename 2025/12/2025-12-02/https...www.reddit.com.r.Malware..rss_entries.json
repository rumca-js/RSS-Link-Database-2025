        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Since most common modern malwares are more stealth malware that doesnt make it obvious that the computer is infected, Im considering using Sandboxie inside VM inside Sandboxie, so I get triple seatbelts for suspicious files? Does anyone else do this? Maybe could change OS in VM too so if your PC use windows your VM would use Linux and vice versa so their malware would need to work on both OS on top of bypassing VM + Sandbox. Or run VituralBox inside HyperV Or that would make PC too slow so tails is better. With how common VM is used to sandbox suspicious programs I would assume advanced malware developers would note that and make it a bypass for it by default if they even put effort into making malware at all. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/West_Bar_1151\"> /u/West_Bar_1151 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1pc292n/sandboxie_inside_vm_inside_sandboxie_triple/\">[l",
