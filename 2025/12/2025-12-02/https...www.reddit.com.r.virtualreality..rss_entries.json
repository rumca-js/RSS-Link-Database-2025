I was thinking about getting Thief Legacy VR on Thursday and thought it would be smarter to buy it on PC VR, as I\u2019m also planning to get a Steam Frame down the line. My problem is, my PC is hooked to the TV in the living room and is usually occupied in the evening. I would really love to start steam VR with my PS VR2 without the need to switch to the pc on my tv and set all up with my keyboard and touchpad. I know I could just use my quest 3, which would be even better for clarity, but I usually find the Quest 3 to be lacking the comfort and 3D Overlap of the PS VR2. Also Thief is probably a very dark game and I\u2019d like to take advantage of OLED. So is there a way to start Steam VR for PS VR2 easier ? Can the PS Button be programmed to start Steam VR ? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DNY88\"> /u/DNY88 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

He specifically mentioned wanting a meta quest but didn\u2019t say what kind, and when I search up the latest ones these are what pop up. Any advice is appreciated.
