Here&#39;s a little backstory:</p> <p>The last weekend my grandfather passed, and one of the things I got to keep (mainly because nobody else wanted it/could use it) is his laptop. He was a patient man, or at least must have been to still use this thing, it&#39;s a dual core Celeron, 4gb ddr3, HDD (the hardest part for this I guess). My question is if it&#39;s possible to install any distro to keep it alive and somewhat functional? I want to explore this path before scrapping the components or use it for a kubernettes cluster.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tuqui77\"> /u/Tuqui77 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1oaaxbz/i_need_some_distrogidance/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1oaaxbz/i_need_some_distrogidance/\">[comments]</a></span>",

For years, I have been trying to make Linux my daily driver. I would not call myself a Linux expert, but I am comfortable working in a Linux environment and solving most problems on my own.</p> <h2>My Linux Journey</h2> <h3>Early Attempts</h3> <p>My first try was with Ubuntu on an old Dell laptop. It was painful: audio and Wi-Fi issues everywhere.</p> <p>Later, I bought a Samsung laptop (i7 11th Gen) and gave Ubuntu another chance. This time audio worked fine, but Wi-Fi and Bluetooth were a disaster. I could not even listen to a song without interruptions.</p> <p>I switched to Linux Mint hoping for a better experience. The same Wi-Fi and Bluetooth issues appeared again. I managed to improve things a bit, even installed i3 for tiling, but I was not convinced. I did not want to spend hours configuring everything from scratch, so I returned to Windows.</p> ",
