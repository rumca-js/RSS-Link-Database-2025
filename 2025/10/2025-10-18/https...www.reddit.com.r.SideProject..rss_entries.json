I built Prep and Craft, a site that helps you create custom meal plans in seconds, using whatever ingredients you have at home. </p> <p>Here\u2019s what it does: 1. Generates balanced meal plans based on your preferences or random if you\u2019re adventurous. 2. Lets you select ingredients you have at home and generates meals based of your selections. 3. Creates an automatic grocery list so you can shop once and be done. 4. Works on desktop or mobile so no app download needed.</p> <p>Right now, it\u2019s free and still improving. If you meal prep or wish you did, I\u2019d love for you to give it a try and tell me what you think. If you have any suggestions that",
