        "description": "The US National Transportation Safety Board issued their final report on the implosion of the Titan Submersible in 2023, it's available here with a lot of supporting documents, some more interesting that others.\nhttps://data.ntsb.gov/Docket/?NTSBNumber=DCA23FM036\n\nThis follows on from the Coast Guard report issued in August.\nhttps://www.news.uscg.mil/News-by-Region/Headquarters/Titan-Submersible/\n\nThe things I find most interesting are their discussion of data forensics, trying to recover data from cameras and computers that were found in the wreckage.\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scottmanley",
