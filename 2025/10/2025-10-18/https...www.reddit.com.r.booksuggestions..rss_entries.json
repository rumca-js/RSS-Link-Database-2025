I saw really good reviews but I&#39;m currently stuck on the third chapter and struggling to keep going. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s cause I&#39;m in a book slump or this book is just slow going at first. </p> <p>Have you read it? And if you have, what do you think about it? Should I keep going? </p> <p>NO SPOILERS PLEASE! &amp; thank you \ud83d\ude0a </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OkPurple8619\"> /u/OkPurple8619 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o9j6jv/the_devils_by_joe_abercrombie/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o9j6jv/the_devils_by_joe_abercrombie/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m going on a weekend getaway to the coast. I am looking for a book that is light reading (no heavy themes like death or grieving). I was thinking something with a haunted ocean vibe but nothing too gory or dark, for example no serial killer type stuff or abuse. I am not opposed to a missing person type situation as long as it is not too graphic but it definitely does not have to be that topic. Something with a mystery/ghost vibe would be nice, kind of like a Nancy Drew but for adults. Also, I prefer nothing part of a series but i am open to a series recc though if it really fits my description. I do like fantasy, mystery, classics and historical fiction but am open to other genres. I prefer a linear story with out flashbacks but it isn&#39;t 100% necessary if something really fits what i am looking for. I&#39;d love it to be something gripping that I don&#39;t want to put down. Does this bring a book to mind for anyone? Thanks in advance! </p> <",

I would like to know if you can recommend me books that deal with madness, forbidden love (if it&#39;s LGBT, even better), public scrutiny, and that sort of thing. I&#39;ve been very interested in the topic since I learned about Ophelia from Hamlet, I hadn&#39;t read Hamlet until a few days ago and I&#39;d like more books with similar themes. I would appreciate it if you could recommend classic or Victorian-era books. Not necessarily with all the things I mentioned, but at least dealing with madness and scrutiny.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Apprehensive-Bat7522\"> /u/Apprehensive-Bat7522 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o9ibs1/something_to_read/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o9ibs1/something_to_read/\">[comments]</a></span>",
