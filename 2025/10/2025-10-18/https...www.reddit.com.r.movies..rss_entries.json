I&#39;ll give you an example. Just today I watched the Darjeeling Limited, and it was apparently criticized for the metaphor of the fathers luggage that they carry around representing the emotional baggage they hold, and it really is obvious and I feel really dumb not getting things like that, because I know I would appreciate the movie 10x more if I was able to pick up on those ideas. Is there any way of bettering or improving this ability? I wanna see movies more as art, not just entertainment.</p> </div><!-- ",
