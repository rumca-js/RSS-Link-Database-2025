These centers consume huge amounts of electricity, forcing utilities to build new power plants (many still fossil-fueled) and upgrade old infrastructure. Those costs are being passed down to consumers, meaning higher bills for the rest of us.</p> <p>AI might be the future, but it\u2019s burning a lot of power to get there. Do you think this is a fair trade-off or are we all paying the price for Big Tech\u2019s ambitions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AIMakesCha",

I will formulate a question at the end of this text. I will then pose this question to another AI. This other AI will then answer said question, and I will subsequently post the answer as a new prompt for you. You will then formulate a follow-up prompt based on that answer, which I will then post again to the other AI. In this way, a conversation between you and the other AI will emerge. Should it pose a question back to you, you are free to answer it in your prompt as well.

I&#39;m a consultant who specializes in primary expert interview-based research and strategy. Today, a client ran either the interview transcripts or the interview recordings from my current effort with them through one of today&#39;s leading LLMs and asked it to evaluate my performance and provide coaching for improvement. The client then proceeded to forward this AI evaluation to my project sponsor. Honestly, the whole thing feels very f&#39;d up.</p> <p>The output of the LLM evaluation was detailed in a sense, but frankly lacked the significant elements of human interactions and nuance, especially when dealing with interpersonal communication between parties. Not to toot my own horn, but I have been doing this type of work for 15 years and have conducted 1,000s of these interviews with leaders and executives from around the world in the service of some of the largest and most successful organi",

Don\u2019t care to use it and will never use it. I\u2019m just as productive as many people who do use it because I know more than them. Will I get fired someday? Probably.

I would rather get fired and still keep my skillset, than to get fired and have been outsourcing all my thinking to LLMs for the last 3-4 years. Skills matter. Always have and always will.
