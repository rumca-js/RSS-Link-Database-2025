        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>You can do it. I believe in you. My parents are the reasons for me wanting to commit suicide last year. I have a complex relationship with them. My mom is an enabler that let my depression get worse and let me rot. She doesn&#39;t want me to change for the better. I thought she already accepted me as her son when she said her sorry for bringing me to this world. But turns out she&#39;s still very much believe that I&#39;m going to hell. My dad is also the same. But at least he still let me get out of here and be successful so I can cut my relationship with them. They also help paying my antidepressant albeit reluctantly.</p> <p>I am not for the night life. I have nothing really wild that I&#39;ve done. I don&#39;t do drugs, I don&#39;t smoke, I don&#39;t drink and I don&#39;t really like going to parties. But they say that I&#39;m too &quot;free&quot; now just because I&#39;m trans and an atheist. I could only laugh to that.</p> <p>I was just listenin",
