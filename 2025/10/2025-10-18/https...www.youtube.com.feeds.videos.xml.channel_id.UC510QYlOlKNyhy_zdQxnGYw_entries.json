        "description": "Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day \u2014 but how did it all begin? In this first episode of our new series on the Rise and Fall of Rome, we explore its legendary founding, the age of kings, and how a small settlement on the Tiber became the heart of an empire.\n\nWe\u2019re trying something new with this episodic format \u2014 your feedback means a lot!
