We have made a EMF cloth enclosure around the pi5s enclosure (solved heating issues, that was a whole thing), and we also used an exacto knife to physically damage the wifi antenna without harming the rest of the board. I can turn off the system from checking wifi and Bluetooth at boot, but I left those changes uncommented for now as I want to test the shielding. </p> <p>I used to be able to test the wifi dbs with either the cat command or wavemon. Was previously able to get -86 dbs wifi signal. I don&#39;t remember if anything else has been changed software wise, but when I came back to the pis recently, I can&#39;t get either command to show ANY mention of the signal strength. It shows the tx-power as 31 and all the other wlan0 info, but no signal strength number at all (n",

So i got excited to get and make it for my friend, who only uses his smart tv with horrible adds during music and videos.. So I followed the steps through the guide and ofcourse it did not work (kinda feeling I fell for it) the video showed a Headless setup. But this thing just does not want to connect to my wifi. Made sure the wpa file was correct, ssh file is there, ssid/wpa2 key is correct, reinstalled lite x32 and x64(really want this one since the lightweight app) Tried multiple guides but still I end up with no wifi connection and in sudo raspi-config i end up with S1 wireless lan error. Also set locality to my country. Anyone who might can help or guide me? Im a beginner is this. Thanks a bunch guys!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ClitRaptor\"> /u/ClitRaptor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https:",
