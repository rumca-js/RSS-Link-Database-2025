As Tom elucidates in <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review\">Eurogamer's review of the device</a>, it is many things at once. Marketing will tell you that it is 'an Xbox'. The reality is that it is a PC, of course, albeit one with an Xbox interface grafted on. It's something of a Frankenstein's Monster in that sense, though like the monster it is also hardy and functional. One can see the case and audience for it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/whatever-it-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-makes-me-pine-for-xboxs-distant-heyday\">Read more</a></p>",
