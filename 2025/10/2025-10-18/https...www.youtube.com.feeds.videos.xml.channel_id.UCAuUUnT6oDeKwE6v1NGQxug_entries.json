        "description": "The rapidly evolving field of protein design is revealing solutions to some of the world\u2019s greatest problems, whether it's blocking a virus, breaking down a pollutant or creating brand-new materials. In conversation with TED\u2019s Whitney Pennington Rodgers, biochemist David Baker explores his team\u2019s Nobel Prize-winning work using AI to design new proteins with functions never before seen in nature \u2014 achieving breakthroughs that have fundamentally changed the future of science.
