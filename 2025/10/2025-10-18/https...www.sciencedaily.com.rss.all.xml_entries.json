Over 10 years, patients lost far more weight and required fewer medications. Experts say surgery continues to offer survival advantages even in the age of potent obesity drugs.",

The breakthrough enables the production of thousands of identical mini-brains at once, making large-scale testing and research possible. This leap could revolutionize how we study brain development and screen drugs for side effects. The discovery opens new paths to understanding and treating disorders such as autism and schizophrenia.",

Scientists say these results should reassure those using calcium to prevent osteoporosis, though more research is needed across broader populations.",

While the innovation could reshape structural design, researchers still face challenges in balancing weight and strength while developing new testing frameworks.",
