It's been more than a week, and 18 bodies have yet to be handed over. The group is calling for heavy machinery to retrieve the remains. It accuses Israel of purposely hampering the search, while Israel insists Hamas is dragging its feet. All the while, the lives of Palestinians in Gaza depend on the return of Israel's dead. So, will Israel resume the war? And is the US prepared to give it the green light? \n\nPresenter: Tom McRae\nGuests:\nOri Goldberg -- Israeli political commentator and journalist   \nXavier Abu Eid -- Political analyst and former PLO communications director\nMehmet Celik -- Editorial Co-ordinator at the Daily Sabah, an English language newspaper in Turkiye\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www",

Where were they held? The torture, even the accusations of sexual abuse, this is all very much downplayed,\u201d Doyle told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cBut of course, for Palestinians, it\u2019s extremely real, very raw, and it just shows so much how the coverage and the political debate in the United States and Europe and in other countries, has gone that there is always this focus on what happens to Israelis and less so as to what happens to Palestinians.\u201d\n\nDoyl",
