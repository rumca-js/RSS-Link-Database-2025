An old colleague of mine thought that it would be funny to encrypt one of our old zip files. He is not willing to share the password, the only information I know is that it is a hexadecimal color code. I tried a few thing, but I just can&#39;t crack it. Unfortunately I am very stubborn and I don&#39;t like to give up.</p> <p>So I really need some help with it. If you have any specific tips, or know a way please tell me. If you message me, I can share the file. Me and my other colleagues offer 12 USD to anyone who can crack it.</p> <p>Thanks :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Frosty-Letterhead-37\"> /u/Frosty-Letterhead-37 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_the_ripper\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1o9pe9u/zip_file_cracking/\">[comments]</a></span>",
