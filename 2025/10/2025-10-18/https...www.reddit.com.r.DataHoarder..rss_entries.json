I went from a 12TB drive to a 112TB Unraid server</p> <p>I&#39;ve been a Datahoarder for over 5 years now and it&#39;s my biggest hobby these days. I started off with a 12TB Western Digital drive in my main PC and spun up Plex on it. I didn&#39;t leave my PC on 24/7. I&#39;d just use Plex when I wanted to. </p> <p>Fast forward a few years and I ran out of storage on that hdd so I swapped in a 16TB drive I used to use as backups. I probably filled that up I imagine.</p> <p>I ended up building my first NAS last year with older hardware from spare parts. I upgraded my main build from a 8700k to a 7800x3d and used that 8700k for my NAS. I added in two 12TBs and one 16TB drive to it. I started off with Windows 11 + Stablebit Drivepool for a month or so then I wasn&#39;t so into it so I swapped to Unraid. Switching to Unraid was probably one of the best decisions I&#39;ve mad with my server experience.</p> <p>I sp",

Perhaps it is an inside thing and one would want it to remain so, for the culture or whatever, but I am very curious about the whole ISO and I suppose particularly the Linux ISO thing. On multiple occasions it seemed like it was used as sort of an ironic code word for something. And when they are actually the object of discussion people tend to emphasise that they are - in fact - referring to Linux ISOs, as if it has a different meaning by default.

Basically: whenever someone dies or gets unreachable, their family have to rummage through emails, bank accounts and paperwork. I want to provide a simple digital vault where people can store essential info (insurance, contacts, accounts, etc), which can be safely shared with trusted people when required, no longer than when that person is dead or unreachable. I am not building a product but just trying to validate the concept. If you have ever had to deal with someone\u2019s affairs after their death, I would appreciate your feedback: Would something like this be useful to you or someone you know?What would make you trust such a system?Do you have a better approach to this?I am not posting links just looking for honest feedback before building something.
