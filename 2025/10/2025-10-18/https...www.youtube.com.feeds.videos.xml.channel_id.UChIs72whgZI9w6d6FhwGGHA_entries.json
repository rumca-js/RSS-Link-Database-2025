At times, these technologies serve their purposes well; DLSS in particular has gotten a lot better with its transformer model and FSR has substantially improved with version 4. We have a lot of criticisms of the fake frame technologies -- especially benchmarking them on normal charts -- but they do have a place in some situations. Now, we're looking at Lossless Scaling and Lossless Frame Generation (sometimes called Lossless Scaling Frame Generation, or LSFG). This tool is highly versatile and does more than just upscaling for select games (and frame generation), but we're really only focusing on those two core use cases today.
