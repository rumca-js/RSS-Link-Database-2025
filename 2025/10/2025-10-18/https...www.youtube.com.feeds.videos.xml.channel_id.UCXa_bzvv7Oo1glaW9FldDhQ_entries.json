        "description": "Despite arriving four years after the original, the sequel picks up about a year after Murai's betrayal and the destruction of the Dark Dragon Blade. Between the events of Dragon Sword and The Vampire War, a comic in which Ryu fights against the vampire fiend Crimson, the Dragon Ninja had kept busy. \n\nAt the latter's end, Momiji reveals that the Black Spider Ninja Clan is heading to Tokyo. It's unknown exactly why, but being directly opposed to the Hayabusa Clan and having dealings with Fiends (which spurred their own hunt for the Dark Dragon Blade in the first game), Ryu is keen to know what's going on.",
