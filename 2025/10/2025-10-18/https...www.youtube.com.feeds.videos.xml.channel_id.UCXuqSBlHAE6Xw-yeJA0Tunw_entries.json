Head over to https://lmg.gg/pK4Wi and check out their Codex R2 AI desktop!\n\nSuddenly LTT Labs has a SECOND environmental test chamber at their disposal! I really don\u2019t think Linus expected to win the auction when he put in his lowball bid -  but there\u2019s a couple problems. The manufacturer went out of business years ago, the chamber hasn\u2019t been powered on in a decade, and it\u2019s been stored outside in a surplus yard for years! This should be quite the adventure.\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://linustechtips.com/topic/1624976-they-auctioned-this-40000-test-chamber-for-1000/\n\n\u25ba GET OUR MERCH: https://lttstore.com\n\u25ba GET EXCLUSIVE CONTENT ON FLOATPLANE: https://lmg.gg/lttfloatplane\n\u25ba GET A VPN: http://www.piavpn.com/linus\n\u25ba SPONSORS, AFFILIATES, AND PARTNERS: https://lmg.gg/partners\n\nPurchases made through some store links may provide some compensa",
