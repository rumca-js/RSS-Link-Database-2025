Watching Black Phone 2 crystallizes what its director does well and what he\u2019s struggled with over the course of his career, and is perhaps the most cogent example of why Derrickson has become the patron saint of \u201cpretty good\u201d horror movies. Let\u2019s take a look at why Black Phone 2 just misses out on being the next great horror classic.",
