Since YouTube is very strict about piracy related videos very few talk about how good each one is for pirated games. Some say it is Lutris and some say Heroic is better for them. I have tried both and got both good and bad results from both. But just to keep in mind I kinda don&#39;t know wtf I am doing for most of the time I configure wine related stuff...</p> <p>So I wanted to ask y&#39;all: What launcher do you think is the best for such games and which one is better at running and installing them. And finally what Proton version is the best for most games?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mustafa_Shazlie\"> /u/Mustafa_Shazlie </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1oaa69l/heroic_or_lutris/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming",

I have Proton, Wine, Easy Anti-Cheat Proton all downloaded. I am using the launch parameter: echo &quot;%command%&quot; | sed &#39;s/fellowship/fellowship-launcher/&#39; | sh . Which did make it start he launcher and said initializing but when that finishs nothing else happens. It just doesn&#39;t open. No black screen or anything, 0 indication the game even attempted to start beyond that. I seen someone added -dx11 and that worked for them but that just gives me an error saying it needs direct X and shaders to launch . I&#39;ve even tried using Lutris which I just get a error saying it cannot find the executable.

I&#39;m trying to migrate to Linux, but after trying several times to dual boot and several errors occurring, I gave up doing it this way.</p> <p>Well, the only thing that stops me from switching completely to Linux is the issue of playing with my friends, we play League of Legends and Rainbow Six, two games that you can&#39;t use on Linux due to anti-cheats. Would it be viable to use a Windows virtual machine within Linux to run these games whenever I want? I believe my PC would handle it just fine.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mysterious_Age_175\"> /u/Mysterious_Age_175 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1o9jdfp/is_it_viable_to_use_a_windows_vm_to_run_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1o9jdfp/is_it_viable_to_use_a_windows_vm_to_run_games/\">[comments]</a",
