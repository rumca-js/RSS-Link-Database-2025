It was thrown up in the 1870s by <a href=\"https://bradfordlocalstudies.com/samuel-cunliffe-lister/\">Samuel Cunliffe Lister</a>, and for more than a century was one of the great industrial palaces of the north.

Forests of buddleia cover the concrete floors, and fox trails wind through the weeds.</p><p>Peer through steel grille",
