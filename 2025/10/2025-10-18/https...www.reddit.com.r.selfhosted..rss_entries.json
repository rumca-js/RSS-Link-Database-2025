The tutorial I found on YouTube involved doing port forwarding through my router. I&#39;d like to mention that the server isn&#39;t up 24/7 since I set it on my personal PC, so I turn it on whenever my friends want to play. So, I started wondering if there was a way to keep my network secure, since I have never done port forwarding, I want to take this opportunity to learn a little more about this topic. So I&#39;d love to hear some tips on how to achieve this.</p> <p>Ps. I plan to buy one of those cheap Lenovo ThinkCentre to have a device dedicated to this, but for now I want to work with what I have.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/snow_edge\"> /u/snow_edge </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1oa1p7e/security_tips_for_my_self_hosted_gaming_serv",

However, I noticed multiple other services begin to slow down, specifically Overseerr (requests take two clicks to &#39;accept&#39; and then the page resets as if I never accepted, slow load times, won&#39;t load connections to sonarr/radarr), nextcloud loading VERY slowly unless I access it locally, and the same for OpenWebUI which doesn&#39;t load locally at all. Portainer is also slow to load through my domain. Wondering if its affecting nginxproxymanager, or all of those containers, and if there is any way to run the gmessages bridge without killing these services as I&#39;d REALLY love having that bridge working. Any help would be greatly appreciated!! If it matters, I&#39;m using a synapse bridge with postgres databases for each of these bridges and the main matrix synapse container.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

I also have another NUC with the i9, 64GB ram and 4TB NVME.</p> <p>The NUC is running Proxmox and i would like to use the NAS as a media server for Jellyfin, Nextcloud, maybe a password manager but i think i might run that on the NUC instead, now i am not entirely sure what is handy to run TrueNAS bare metal on it or to run it virtualized on proxmox with HBA passthrough. OR skip TrueNAS all together and let Proxmox handle the storage?</p> <p>The other thing i would like to use the NAS for is to backup the VMs that are on the NUC. The NUC is used as my primary lab where i build proof of concepts etc.</p> <p>I could not really find a conclusive answer when to pick one of the other so hopefully someone can give me a little push :D</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/us",

I have have a tor guard account, mostly idle, but i got a great deal on it 2:I have tailscale setup and running, IF i do need a VPN, does this do it for me? 3:I have an easynews account, will this get me what i need as far as files/access? 4:is there an easy way to link to trakt?, do i need trakt? what is the operation for &quot;collecting&quot; media and having it automatically keep everything ,moving (this is probably an easy issue, i&#39;m just new here)</p> <p>5:should i setup a vlan for the stack? (i am very new to self hosting) i would prefer doing everything the <em>best way</em> from the beginning, instead of rebuilding when i learn about a better path) everything will be on the local networ",

No need to create another one. The group would share self hosted home lab setup and exchange ideas with others who are new to the self hosting world. Software should not be behind a paywall in 2025. There is an abundance of free software that can be self hosted that can benefit humanity for free. Examples include productivity self hosted apps for time tracking, solidtime. Note taking apps like Obsidian. Budget and financing apps like Firefly III and Abacus. Also this can be a good way to take control of our time and move away from big tech apps that use our data and make us addicted to their apps like slot machines in casinos.</p> <p>Contact me via email: [<a href=\"mailto:fullstackmicrosoft@gmail.com\">fullstackmicrosoft@gmail.com</a>](mailto:<a href=\"mailto:fullstackmicrosoft@gmail.com\">fullstackmicrosoft@gmail.com</a>)</p> <",
