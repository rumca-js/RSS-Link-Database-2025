Sorry if this is not the right place, but I&#39;ve got a game that I played once a very long time ago and I need to find its name and hopefully play it once again. I can post this in another sub if it&#39;s more appropriate.</p> <p>Bit of a background: I played this game in an arcade game store when I was a kid long long ago. I accidentally entered a different menu after entering the coin and, in panic, clicked on an entry that took me to this game (instead of the actual game I wanted to play). Admittedly, I played it for less than 5 minutes before losing the game and ever seeing it again; I&#39;m afraid I have little recollection of its details.</p> <p>The game was 2D, character was throwing what looked like large white snow balls. The character was moving from left to right and I cannot remember if there was platforms to jump on. The closest game I found was Snow Bros but in it you make snow balls and don&#39;t shoot large snow balls.<",
