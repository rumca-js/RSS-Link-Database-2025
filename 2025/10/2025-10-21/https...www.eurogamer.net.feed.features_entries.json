But Pragmata is an interesting case. Each time Capcom has presented it, the publisher has teased a small glimpse of what the game might be - meagre but enticing at the same time. Back in the summer, we saw its unique mixture of hacking and shooting presented in a very stripped-back demo. A few months later,<a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/depth-player-expression-and-years-of-iteration-pragmata-director-interview\"> we saw a tiny bit more</a> - but no matt",

For example, I played so much of PS Vita/PS3 arcade racing game <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/motorstorm\">MotorStorm</a>: RC that it was part of my personality for a month or so, and I'd negatively judge people who weren't spending every waking moment knocking milliseconds off their best Time Trials. I have that obsessive trait in me, then, but at other times I just enjoy the feeling of a game, the vibes, the essence of having a great time. This is my relationship with <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden\">Ninja Gaiden</a>. No doubt some people will go all-in on Ninja Gaiden 4, a game that practically begs to be mastered and used as a showcase of skill, but I've always seen the series as less of a test of ability I don't have and more as a finely-tun",
