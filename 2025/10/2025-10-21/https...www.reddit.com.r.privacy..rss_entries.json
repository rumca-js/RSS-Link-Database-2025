Well that\u2019s not sufficient. Adding a \u201cDelete after 1 hour\u201d checkbox doesn\u2019t make an app private, it just adds a timer to a risky workflow. True privacy means the app never gets access to your data in the first place.</p> <p>We have built powerful cloud tools, but they came with hidden costs of data exposure, compliance headaches, and user distrust. The browser has now become strong enough to do what we once needed servers for. By processing data locally, we can build tools that are fast, free, and fundamentally private using technology like web assembly. </p> <p>Let me know what you think ",
