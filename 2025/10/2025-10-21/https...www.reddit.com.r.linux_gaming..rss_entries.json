The download page says Steam is not supported with it, is that really true? I mainly want to see if I can get old games like BF3, DFBHD, AOEII or CoD4 to run under Linux. If these worked, I would migrate my laptop to Linux. The alternative would be &quot;CachyOS&quot;, one I also hear often about.</p> <p>And can it do homestreaming? I&#39;ve tested it on the Vega 7 APU already and while the quality is noticeable its pretty well playable. Buying a GPU for less than 50 \u20ac is a goal but not priority for my AM4 build, I try to get something like a RX 470/80 4 GB but people want insane prices for them. I could get a R9 290 for 20, but likely thats again too old for support they don&#39;t even get drivers anymore.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Systemlord_FlaUsh\"> /u/Systemlord_FlaUsh </a>",

OBS is reading the card, and so is my desktop in the display settings, but no video is being shown.</p> <p>Is there a workaround for this? If not, what would be the suggested replacement capture card? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TransFatWitch\"> /u/TransFatWitch </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1oc2k81/need_help_with_capturing_my_desktop_feed_for",

I have some experience with Linux on my laptops, but I&#39;ve never formally installed it on my desktop before (uses an AMD processor and Geforce RTX 3060 GPU). I&#39;m leaning towards Linux Mint for this application.</p> <p>It&#39;s seems feasible now given the progress Steam has made and all of my PC games are exclusively on Steam.</p> <p>My main question, which is why I am reaching out to all of you. I have my computer set up so that the OS is installed on an NVMe SSD and I have a larger SATA SSD that I use for games and bigger files. In preparation for what I&#39;m doing I&#39;ve also backed up key files (documents, pictures, etc.) onto that SSD as well. Would it be possible for me to somehow get Linux installed/running in my NVMe SSD and then somehow import my Steam library over",
