But I can\u2019t find that game anymore.</p> <p>What I remember: - the theme was mountainclimbing - it was semi coop, I think? - there were equipment cards - oxygen was important - the stand at Essen was in hall 3, I think somewhere in the back half - although I enjoyed it, I didn\u2019t buy it - we played with 2, but it was also playable with 4</p> <p>I\u2019m sure this is a long shot, but i have faith in the wisdom of crowds for these kind of questions. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Chevalric\"> /u/Chevalric </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ock240/help_me_find_a_game_title/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardg",

Prefer the hirelings so much more.</p> <p>Betrayal at House on the Hill currently my solo game, though when my partners around we would play a scenario or two</p> <p>Bedlam at Neverwinter Played 3 times, loved it so much. Wouldnt mind somethin like this but more.</p> <p>Games that scare me: Mage Wars Me and my partner got mage wars for really cheap a few months ago but the rule book and components scared us from even playing it. </p> <p>We are both very heavy dnd people and would love if the game had a fantasy theme but overall maybe mid level mechanical complexity with focus on decision making and story.</p> <p>If yall have any reccs",

We played it slowly, maybe sometime it took more time than it should to remember all the rules. After the game we discovered that this game transforms into ticket to ride 1901 - and is now playable without the campaign. Yesterday I was putting grey stickers and replacing some badly put colors with what was left. I see I will also need to discard tons of cards and on the website there are further instructions to discard more cards which were not included in the instructions. Also such things as puncher and companies will not be needed anymore. My question - is there a box for left overs somewhere accessible to buy? I am not a collectioner, and even though this was a great game, I am not sure I want to keep not usable things anymore and have this heavy box to play trains or take it wit",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi, looking for recommendations for a new game to play with a group of five or more. We have played a lot of Catan and all the extensions, but getting a bit bored with it. Carcassonne, Splendor and Azul are good but some can\u2019t be played with five people. I have Wingspan and enjoy it, but find it a bit boring due to lack of being able to interact or directly compete with other players and also limits players to four. I have Flip 7 but it is too basic. I like a little spice (blocking, trading etc) to keep things interesting. Any thoughts? Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jerhfx\"> /u/jerhfx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oc07ne/searching_for_new_game_for_5_plus_players/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oc07ne/searching_for_new_game_for_5_plus_players/\">[comments]</a></span>",
