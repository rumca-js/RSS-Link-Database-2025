        "description": "Honestly, even if Escape From Duckov is successful by virtue of the competition or lack thereof in the PvE space, I'm hoping that Team Soda continues to expand on the title, adding new maps, weapons, mechanics, progression systems, and more. \n\nThis kind of development alongside community interaction and listening to what players want while sticking to a concrete vision has resulted in some truly incredible games over the decades. Here's hoping that it achieves even a fraction of that success, quacking all the way to the bank in the process. If Tarkov could inspire something like this, then I can't wait to see what Escape From Duckov inspires in the indie space.",
