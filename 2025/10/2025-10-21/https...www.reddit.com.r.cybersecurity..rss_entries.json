        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi guys, so someone I know well got a ransomware attack from DragonForce on their small business. They were able to restore all the data even though DF encrypted everything, and they found out that they got through 1 personal computer, which they shut off and didn\u2018t start again. Now my question is, how can they prevent in a first step another attack? They won\u2018t pay but they need immediate protection against a new attack. What\u2018s a standard way of DF they use and how can they close this way? They already changed all passwords. Thanks for your help, much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive-Yak-8835\"> /u/Competitive-Yak-8835 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1oc8act/dragonforce_ransomware_attack/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1oc8act/dragonforce_ransomware_attack/\">[comments]</a></spa",
