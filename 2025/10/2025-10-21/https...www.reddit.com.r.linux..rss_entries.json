But looking at the comments, a lot of people don\u2019t seem to like the idea - and I really wonder why?</p> <p>For example, macOS has been immutable for a decade thanks to <strong>System Integrity Protection (SIP)</strong>. To bypass it, you have to reboot into Recovery Mode and disable SIP manually. For normal users, that&#39;s perfect - there\u2019s no way to accidentally replace a system library with a compromised one.</p> <p>I honestly don&#39;t understand why Windows (as most popular OS for users) doesn&#39;t have something similar. People click through every &quot;Run as Administrator&quot; prompt without thinking (because they pop up so often), so it must be trivial for malware to replace or tamper with system files.</p> <p>But let&#39;s get back to more serious systems - I&#39;m pretty sure that newbie Linux users often do",

It has 12 programmable keys on the side. In Windows, I&#39;ve been using a very old version of Logitech&#39;s official software because at one point, they made changes that broke how I use the mouse.</p> <p>So the short version is: Is there a program that I can program all of the buttons on my mouse to do what I want? The G600 has 3 main mouse buttons, the wheel scrolls up and down, as well as being able to be pressed down and left and right tilt, below the wheel, there are two more buttons, and then on the side where the thumb would be, there are 12 more.</",
