I know there&#39;s a lot of sites for uploading PDFs but I never uploaded anything so I don&#39;t have any idea how those sites function. I want to know what do you think is the best for my use case:</p> <p>-I&#39;m talking about books which children use in school so they are not for general purpose reading -The website should ideally not require an account for people who want to download books -I would prefer if I could have an account which I use for uploading so I can send people a link to my account and they can find which books they need -Surface web -Easy to use since mostly schoolchildren and their parents who might not be tech savvy will want these books</p> <p>I&#39;m also open to self hosting if there are any projects that fit my use case and I can keep myse",

This mainly comes in the form of users being upset, impatient, and demanding when the site that they use FOR FREE does not immediately update when new stuff comes out or when the site has problems. Maybe this is the result of a community formed around the basis of not paying for things but it is really disheartening. </p> <p>I mean what is the long term plan in this regard? Do you believe harassing the uploaders and admins by hurling insults and slurs is going to make them more enthusiastic? There is a strange irony that on a lot of official forums full of paid users I often see a ridiculous amount of positivity to the point where legitimate criticism is drowned in a sea of toxic praise.
