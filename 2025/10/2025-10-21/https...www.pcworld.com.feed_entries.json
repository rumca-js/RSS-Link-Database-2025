So, it might be another month or so before you see a bunch of great monitor deals. Here\u2019s a preview: An MSI 27-inch OLED gaming monitor, and one that\u2019s much faster than usual, for $130 off. Today you can <a href=\"https://us-store.msi.com/MAG-271QP-QD-OLED-X28\">get it for $519.99, straight from MSI itself</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MAG 271QP looks more or less like all the other 27-inch OLEDs out there, with a fairly typical frame and 2560x1440p resolution. But at 280Hz refresh, complete with AdaptiveSync support, it can handle much faster competitive online gaming than some of the other deals in this price range.
