OpenAI demoed this feature in Gmail where an employee asked the chatbot to polish an email he was writing to a colleague. Naturally, a prompt bar will also appear when you open a new tab, and you can open a sidebar where you can converse with ChatGPT at any time.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"2cc92e9a7ed4414aa82a07d7045a1a4a\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com",
