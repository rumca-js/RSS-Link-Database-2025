Adam is joined by politics and investigations correspondent Joe Pike to discuss whether political pressure is building for him to give up the property.\n\nAnd, Boris Johnson has been giving evidence at the Covid Inquiry about the impact of the pandemic on children and young people. He told the inquiry that he \u2018probably did go too far' with lockdown rules for children, and that the rules were at times overly complicated.\n\nAdam speaks to BBC Education Editor Branwen Jeffries and BBC Verify\u2019s Ben Chu.",
