Its overreliance on TikTok clips of rubbernecking strangers is in very poor taste</p><p>In July 2023, 17-year-old Charlie Cosser attended a party in Warnham, West Sussex. Like many parents of teenagers, Martin and Tara Cosser were happy that their son was going to a gathering at a private house, rather than on a potentially rowdy night out in Guildford, Surrey, as he had originally planned.</p><p>Tragically, the Cossers were wrong. A fight broke out on the party\u2019s dancefloor, and Charlie was stabbed three times in the chest by Yura Varybrus, who was 16 at the time. Charlie\u2019s catastrophic injuries included a cut to his aorta, which led to internal bleeding and cardiac arrest. The many harrowing moments recalled here include Charlie\u2019s sister, Eloise \u2013 now 18 \u2013 listening to her brother\u2019s heart beat for the final time, before his life support was turn",

First to amble into view is Noah Caluori, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/20/noah-caluori-england-debut-autumn-steve-borthwick\">Saracens\u2019s new whiz-kid</a> who has just announced himself with five tries on his first Prem start. He nods a polite greeting and looks every inch a sporting thoroughbred that any national coach would covet.</p><p>A couple of minutes later a more familiar face appears. It feels faintly bizarre to be bumping into Joe Marler when, on your television, he is sitting in a Scottish castle with Claudia Winkleman but, hey presto, that\u2019s the magic of showbiz right there. One minute you\u2019re propping for England, the next you\u2019re attempting to out-think Stephen Fry.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/",

Here\u2019s how to check</p><p><strong>What\u2019s the problem?</strong><br>\n My prickly pear (<em>Opuntia</em>) cactus is developing raised brown patches on both sides of the stem that are spreading, though the plant is still growing. Should I be worried?</p><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br>\n Those circular brown patches are a classic sign of corking. This is a natural process in many cacti, which causes the lower stem to gradually harden and turn brown, like the bark on a tree. It usually starts at the base and slowly works its way up as the plant matures. While the rough texture can look alarming, it&nbsp;doesn\u2019t harm the plant. However, because corking can be confused with a fungal infection or pests such as scale insects, it\u2019s worth a closer look. Scale insects will appear as raised, uniform bumps that can be scraped off, whereas corking is part of the stem tissue itself and cannot be removed.</p> <a href=\"http",
