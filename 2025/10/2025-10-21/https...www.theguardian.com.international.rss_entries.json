(Which sounds unrealistic, but you can actually buy a fixer-upper in Kirksville for less than $30,000)</p><p>The idea is that we are watching behind the scenes documentary footage shot by Nick, who provides a forlorn voiceover: \u201cI wish I never filmed any of it.\u201d At first, the new house seems the perfect setting f",
