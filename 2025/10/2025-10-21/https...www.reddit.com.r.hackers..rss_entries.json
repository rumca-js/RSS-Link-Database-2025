        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello. I started my journey in the cybersecurity study recently. I was finishing a room on TryHackMe and came up with a question: if a port scan is executed (for instance with nmap), it could scan open ports in a specific device or multiple devices in a network. However, for this to happen, the user must be connected to that network, otherwise only the public IP would be visible (and thus scannable). In the real world scenario, how can one gain access to a computer? Since only the public IP address is known, mapping devices, scanning ports and executing exploits will not be executed from \u201coutside\u201d. What am I missing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thejoker099\"> /u/thejoker099 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1oco8wy/question_regarding_nmap_and_exploits_on_local/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1oco8wy/question_re",
