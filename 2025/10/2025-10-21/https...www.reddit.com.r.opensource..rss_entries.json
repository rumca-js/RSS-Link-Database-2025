Many startups are even building entire businesses around open source projects \u2014 offering managed services, integrations, or enterprise-grade support.</p> <p>At the same time, we\u2019re seeing debates around sustainability, licensing models, and whether open source developers are getting fair recognition and compensation for their work.</p> <p>How do you see the balance evolving between open source freedom and commercial growth?
