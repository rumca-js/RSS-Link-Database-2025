I set it up correctly and it became apparent Nord started throttling my download speed once they detected it was torrent traffic (I watched the speed go from 20MB/s to 2MB/s pretty consistently when I restarted the container)</p> <p>So I decided to use the SOCKS5 proxy instead, it&#39;s good enough for my Linux ISO torrents, so I&#39;ve been using that for a couple months without too many issues. Some torrents however just never start. My Sonarr reports many seeders, not many leechers for some torrents and yet when it hits Deluge, absolutely nothing.</p> <p>I&#39;d like to get this working so I can reliably have something requested and auto-downloaded as right now it&#39;s a little hit-and-miss. Any ideas, or do I just need to sack NordVPN off and go with something else?</p> <p>P.S. I use deluge as I&#39;m used to it, I&#39;m not averse to moving ",

I seed a <em>lot</em> of legitimate torrents, mostly Linux distros and open-source software, etc. Tails, Debian and Arch ISOs in particular get absolutely slammed by a huge range of Chinese IPs that just constantly download, over and over and over.</p> <p>So I got a list of all the IP ranges assigned to China by getting a list of all the Chinese-assigned ASNs and their IP ranges. This resulted in a list with 8692 CIDR ranges. However, qBittorrent wants a different format, so I whipped up a quick little Python script to convert from CIDR ranges to a Start IP - End IP range format. Here&#39;s the code in case anyone wants to do something similar:</p> <p>```python</p> <h1>!/usr/bin/env python3</h1> <p>import ipaddress</p> <p>def main(): with open(&#39;ip.lst&#39;, &#39;r&#39;) as inlist: with open(&#39;ipconv.dat&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) as outlist: for line in inlist: inaddr ",
