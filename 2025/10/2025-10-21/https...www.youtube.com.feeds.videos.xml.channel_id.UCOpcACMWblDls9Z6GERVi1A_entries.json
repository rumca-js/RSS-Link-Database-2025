        "description": "It's time for the Honest Trailer for The Thing (1982)! We love this movie, and if you don't, you might be a shapeshifting alien. It's got everything: Kurt Russell, John Carpenter, flamethrowers, autopsies gone wrong, killer sled dogs, guys being dudes, aliens being guys, and an ending so ambiguous, we're STILL debating who's who and what's what. Throw it on on a cold night and thank us later, just make sure you're not watching the remake...\n\nVoice Narration: Jon Bailey the EPIC VOICE GUY (@epicvoiceguy on all socials)\nTitle Design: Robert Holtby\nWritten by: Spencer Gilbert and Lon Harris\nProduced by: Spencer Gilbert\nEdited by: Kevin Williamsen\nPost-Production Manager: Emin Bassavand\nManager, Video Operations: Tiffany Tse\nPost-Production Specialist: Rebecca Castaneda\nVP Content: Max Dionne\n\n#honesttrailers #entertainment #parody #trailer #thething #johncarpenter",
