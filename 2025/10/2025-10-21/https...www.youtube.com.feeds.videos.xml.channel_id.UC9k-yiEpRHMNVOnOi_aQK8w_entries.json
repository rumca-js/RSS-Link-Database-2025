A woman who was nearby says when she saw the baby alone she notified hotel staff and called 911. By the time deputies arrived, hotel personnel said the baby had been left unattended for 56 minutes. The dad told cops that \"they lost track of time and did not realize how long they had been gone,\" the police report says. The parents have been charged with child neglect.",
