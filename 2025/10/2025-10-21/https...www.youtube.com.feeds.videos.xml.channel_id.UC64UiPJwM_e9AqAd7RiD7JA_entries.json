It was a stunning achievement, paving the way for routine supersonic flight and earning Yeager the prestigious Collier Trophy and a place in the history books. Yet strange as it may seem, Yeager may actually have beaten to the punch a full two years earlier by a German jet pilot during WWII. And stranger still, it happened completely by accident. \n\nIn the 1930s and 40s, as aircraft began flying ever faster and higher, pilots began encountering a disturbing phenomenon. At speeds above 600 km/h, their controls would freeze up and the nose of their aircraft would suddenly pitch down, sending them into a lethal, unrecoverable dive. This problem, known as compressibility, was a particularly acute in high-performance fighters like the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, which during fli",
