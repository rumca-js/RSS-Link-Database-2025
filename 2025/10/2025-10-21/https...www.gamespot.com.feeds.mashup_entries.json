This complexity, however, doesn't mean the series is without formula. By and large, this formula generally consists of taking a tortured or doubting protagonist, placing them in the titular town covered with fog, and allowing the monsters of their mind (or cults) to envelop them to help them discover or face their transgressions. It\u2019s a setup that\u2019s worked time and time again for Konami, and it\u2019s what gamers have come to expect from the beloved series.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">And yet, I find that Silent Hill works best when it takes more risks with that established formula.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Take, for example, the premise of the fourth entry, Silent Hill 4: The Room.",
