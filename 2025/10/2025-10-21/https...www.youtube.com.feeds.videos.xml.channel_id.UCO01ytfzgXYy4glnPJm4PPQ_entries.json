        "description": "Today on The Matt Walsh Show, it seems that many people have already forgotten about the case of Iryna Zarutska, who was stabbed in the neck by a career criminal on the light rail. But forgetting about her story is exactly what they want. Today, I have an update on the case that makes that clear. Also, have an increasing number of \"far-right\" young people discovered a new affinity for monarchy? That's what the media is claiming. If it's true, there's a reason for it. I'll explain. And I'm being attacked for saying that intolerance is a virtue. Is that true? Well, obviously it is. I will double and triple down as usual.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:32 Opening\n02:18 - 17:02 Have You Forgotten About Iryna Zarutska? They Want You To.
