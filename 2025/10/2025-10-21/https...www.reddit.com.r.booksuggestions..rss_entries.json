It\u2019s not a traditional self-help book but more like a nourishing place to land when life feels too heavy. Drawing on Haig\u2019s own experiences with depression and anxiety, the book contains personal stories, philosophical musings, quotes, and introspective fragments of wisdom. Each page feels like an intimate conversation with a friend who has been through darkness and found small, meaningful ways back to light. At its heart, The Comfort Book is about acceptance, resilience, and mindful living. It invites the readers to search for comfort in being imperfectly human, in slowing down, and noticing the ordinary moments that give life meaning. It\u2019s the kind of book you don\u2019t rush through; you return to it whenever you need reassurance that it\u2019s okay to simply be.</p> <p>Perfect for coffee or lunch breaks and just for ",

I love thrillers and mystery but I have insane pattern recognition and sometimes get discouraged when I can figure things out early on in the story. I will read biographies, especially if the person is overcoming childhood trauma, cults or poverty. I have read some classics and enjoy them if the story is captivating enough. Some examples of books I have read is The Bone Season series, The Glass Castle, Hidden Pictures, The Stranger Beside Me, Catcher and the Rye and Where the Crawdads Sing. </p> <p>I am totally in a slump right now as I have just finished reading the Bone Season series again since I picked up the writers preferred texts and the newest 5th book..
