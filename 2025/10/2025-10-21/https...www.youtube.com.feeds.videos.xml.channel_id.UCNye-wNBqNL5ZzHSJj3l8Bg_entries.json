Trump has stressed Hamas must disarm, but the Palestinian group has linked giving up its weapons to the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our we",

Netanyahu right now doesn\u2019t have much freedom to do what he wants,\u201d he told Al Jazeera, noting the high-level US delegation now in Israel to apply pressure.\n\u201cThey are going to sit on Netanyahu and not let him sabotage the agreement.

Vance said the truce implementation was \u201cgoing very well\u201d but stressed that reconstruction and security must come first before deciding Gaza\u2019s long-term governance. Witkoff described the US-led ceasefire coordination centre in Israel as a model for future peace efforts. Kushner said progress was being made on retrieving Israeli captives\u2019 remains and praised coordination with the UN on aid delivery. Vance ruled out any US troops in Gaza and said Hamas must disarm, adding that lasting peace would take time and patience.\n\nFollowing the press conference, our reporter in Amman, Nour Odeh, said Palestinians were omitted and their suffering under rubble went unrecognised.\nThe focus remained overwhelmingly on Israel, including security, captives, and objections to international participation in Gaza stabilisation.\nMessages from the conference ",
