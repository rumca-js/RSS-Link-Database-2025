The Game Is Releasing on the 13th of november and you can wishlist it now on steam or here: https://gsght.com/c/x3rn5o\n\nFor todays stream myself (The Spiffing Brit) will be playing the game with @RTGame @PotatoMcWhiskey and @mscupcakes as we attempt to complete a bingo sheet of objectives in game as fast as possible. Now I have sunk a lot of hours into this game so I think I should easily be able to take on all 3 other players at the same time! But there is only one way to find out and that is with this stream. \n\nAnno Steam Description: \nIn the latest installment of the award-winning Anno strategy franchise, it\u2019s your destiny to shape the Roman Empire in the year 117 AD. As governor, will you encourage economic growth or expand your rule through dominance? Lead with rebellion or unite a diverse culture? The cost of peace is yours to decide.\n\nBEC",
