        "description": "Carvana (a rising, 40 billion dollar online car Reseller) is a complete disaster of debt financing and family conflict. When a Father and Son control two separate, yet interwoven companies, while selling billions worth of stock almost every single day, (as they target the poorest people in the nation for loans they will likely never pay back)... important questions need to be asked about what is legal, what SHOULD be legal, and why were letting it happen.\n\nCarvana is a double bubble behemoth in the used car sector, with (in my opinion) broken economics and a doomed business model. Lets talk to about. \n\n\n\nWant a VPN???
