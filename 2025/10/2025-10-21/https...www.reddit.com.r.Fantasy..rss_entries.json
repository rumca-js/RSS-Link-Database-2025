I found parts of myself on these pages in the character of Alice Law, but quickly realised that she is an extreme representation of the types of people who enter academia with the single goal of becoming the greatest researcher in the world. This personality trope works well with the story that could have been in Katabasis, but unfortunately the storytelling lets down the delivery of this critique. </p> ",

The character building is good and makes me worry for what comes next for these characters because I do care for them. The world building and magic are also interesting, both in what it can do and how its gained and the world building behind it and I think the magic has potential to expand more in the coming books as well. The majority of the plot here was politics so a lot of set up here as well which I think will pay off in the next book so generally I enjoyed it and am mostly excited to see what the next boo",

Green Rider&#39;s are the King&#39;s elite messengers who are frequently killed in the line of duty. The dying Green Rider asks Karrigan to continue his mission to deliver a letter to the King.
