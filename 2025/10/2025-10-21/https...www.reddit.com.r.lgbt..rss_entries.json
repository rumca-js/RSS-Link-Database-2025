Our relationship has been good, all things considered, but lately there\u2019s something that\u2019s been really confusing me.</p> <p>For a while now, she\u2019s been making jokes about me being \u201cpassive\u201d or things like that. At first, they didn\u2019t bother me much because they were kind of her own inside jokes; it\u2019s not my kind of humor, but as long as she was having fun, I didn\u2019t really care. The problem is that over the past few months, those jokes have become more frequent \u2014 even in front of our mutual friends and acquaintances. Sometimes she makes drawings of me that make me really uncomfortable, or she uses humor that feels childish to me, like calling me her \u201csubmissive uke\u201d (yes, in that tone).

She had been in and out of relationships, was currently single/lf love (she had been going on about how she really wanted to find someone). At the bar we ran into another girl \u201cK\u201d who liked girls who also happened to be single so we introduced them\u2026</p> <p>They gave each other a look of utter disgust and that was that. Merk explained to us that two butches don\u2019t go together; the other girl was quite manly and also dressed like a dude. </p> <p>Is it the norm for these types to not go together or just Merk\u2019s preference?

I find being gay as a blessing. I get to look at the world from another angle. I dont have many gay friends and I kind of feel isolated in the community. Maybe being a single gay man in big Melbourne also makes me feel that way!</p> <p>Please take care of yourself!

I\u2019ve spent years fighting myself and i feel like im finally coming to terms and accepting myself for who i am.</p> <p>Over the past year i have been hinting pretty aggressively to my parents that im gay.

I know that well because they\u2019ve said many times in conversations with other people that \u201coh if one of my kids turned out that way i\u2019d still love and support them, pushing them away for a preference is stupid\u201d. </p> <p>Only issue is im getting tired of hinting and im eager to come out \ud83d\ude24",
