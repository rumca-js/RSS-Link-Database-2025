I originally built it for myself since I run several custom servers / NAS setups some are on older versions of Windows that don&#39;t support SMB over QUIC, and others are Linux/Unix-based, which don&#39;t have a great way to mount directly into Windows as a proper drive letter. I know that for a Windows-to-Windows setup I could have just used a VPN, but I really didn&#39;t want to deal with the network-wide slowdown that comes from tunneling all traffic through a VPN. I just wanted to securely access my files whenever I needed to, without having to connect and disconnect from a VPN every time. I also looked into WebDAV, but it&#39;s slow and not encrypted by default so that pushed me toward using QUIC, building the server in Rust, and implementing chunking and concurrent stream control for performance.
