Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice answer fan questions about a black hole\u2019s dying gasp, lunar eclipses, and the meaning of nothing. \n\nWhy don\u2019t we see a lunar eclipse every month? What happens when a black hole reaches the end of its life? Could the Big Bang itself have been a black hole explosion? Learn about how Hawking radiation accelerates, the runaway evaporation of dying black holes, and why their final \u201clast gasp\u201d would light up the universe in gamma rays. \n\nIs \u201cblack hole\u201d the right name for it? Should we call it a \u201cblack omega star\u201d? We explore the limits of spacetime and causality. Could our universe be influenced by the gravity of a parallel universe? Could the universe \u201csplit\u201d to prevent paradoxes if time travel were possible? Neil recalls Stephen Hawking\u2019s time travel party and why the laws of physics might forbid going backward in time.\n\nWe discuss Jupiter\u2019s protective gravitational shield, entro",
