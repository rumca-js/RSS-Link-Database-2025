Would it be possible to scrape a steam profile for the amount of total achievements? If the profile has a rare achievements showcase as pictured. And can I do it this way? I tried other ways like the steam api but that would require checking every game on an account and going through all achievements that way and this seems like an easier option.<br/> Can this be done, and is it allowed?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",
