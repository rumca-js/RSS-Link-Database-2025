I was holding out hoping that valve would drop Steam OS for desktop before W10 EOL but alas that hasn&#39;t happened. I&#39;ve gotten fairly familiar with using it on my steam deck over the past few years so I was hoping to find something similar. As with most people the amount of flavors around is kind of overwhelming and im not sure what I should go with, but am more than willing to learn and tinker as needed. This will be used almost exclusively for gaming. I may need to dualboot windows for programs that only work there for non gaming things. Any advice and recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Somehow I have managed to dual boot windows and Linux while secure boot is still enabled. I am currently on CachyOS, and I have NOT followed the guide to enable Secure Boot as described on their wiki. However, I previously ran Nobara and Bazzite and both worked fine with Secure Boot also. </p> <p>Now, I am not certain I am secure booting into my Linux side, however I know for a fact I am on my windows side as any games that require secure boot enabled for anti-cheat still work perfectly fine. When I switch back and forth between Linux and Windows, I change nothing in my bios. All I have ever done, each time I switched distros, is wipe my Linux drive and reinstalled the new distro of choice. I could probably do this again with another distro and all works fine. </p> <p>I am beginning the think it might be something specific to my motherboard but I do not know. </p> <p>So to the title, wha",

Steam didnt really start the games on my old drive, with some help from chatgpt I added some pointers on a local drive and got the games to start, but i never was able to make the mods load. Pc gaming without mods is for me a no go so i just went back to windows. That was half a year ago. Now win10 is pretty much eol, so i gotta think about what to do. I stilm have dual boot activated and can load up my linux. Does anyone know why my mods didnt load? Do i have to format my drive and reinstall all games and then it works?
