        "description": "Apple is reportedly developing the next-generation AirPods Pro, expected to feature the new H3 chip for improved sound and lower latency. A version of the AirPods Pro 3 with integrated IR cameras may also debut next year, potentially using the H3 chip, though it\u2019s unclear if it will retain the \u201cPro 3\u201d branding or launch as AirPods Pro 4. Apple is also working on AirPods 5, likely adding health sensors like temperature monitoring and enhanced AI features, but not a heart-rate sensor.",

        "description": "Apple is gearing up to refresh its other product categories following the iPhone 17 series debut. The Cupertino-based tech giant could introduce three new products as soon as this week, as per a journalist. Among the expected announcements may be a new 14-inch MacBook Pro powered by an M5 chipset. The same processor is also reported to make its way to the upcoming iPad Pro. Meanwhile, an updated version of the Apple Vision Pro is also said to be on the cards, although it will be more of an incremental upgrade than a true successor.",
