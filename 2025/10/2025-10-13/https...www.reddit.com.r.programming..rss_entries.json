        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey there! I&#39;ve built a Python project that uses data, stats, and a few clever tricks to simulate the result of a football match between two teams (national or league). The bot works by analyzing the last games of each team, taking into account things like wins, losses, home and away performances, and even the relative strength of their leagues. It then calculates a custom score for both sides and predicts whether Team A will win, lose, or draw.</p> <p>There are two main modes:<br/> \u26bd <strong>Team vs Team</strong> \u2013 compare any two teams and get a simulated match result.<br/> \ud83d\udcca <strong>Team Stats</strong> \u2013 see detailed performance stats for a specific team.</p> <p>And if you want full automation, there\u2019s also an <strong>Auto Mode</strong> that scans all upcoming games, predicts every result, and sends them straight to a Discord channel through a webhook. It even saves all the data (match results, odds, percentages, etc.) into <code>.txt</code> fi",

You may have heard of the Cline AI agent and perhaps even used it. This week, I wanted to use this tool for a project. I then purchased a certain amount of credits. However, I accidentally enabled automatic payments without realizing it. As soon as I noticed, I immediately tried to disable it by navigating through all the pages. But by that time, the system had already deducted nearly $44 from my account. Anyway, I immediately reported this to the customer support team. And I am now sharing the subsequent correspondence with you transparently. (I am not sharing this to sensationalize the situation; on the contrary, I am presenting it for your consideration so that you can be cautious before using this service.)</p> <p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/1Xg3K66\">Images</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Malefic",

The dataset is built from over <strong>218 historical sources</strong> spanning <strong>1500\u20131850 London</strong>, including court records, literature, newspapers, and personal diaries. That\u2019s over <strong>500M characters</strong> of messy, inconsistent, and often corrupted historical English.</p> <p>Standard tokenizers fragment archaic words like \u201cquoth\u201d and \u201chast,\u201d and OCR errors from scanned documents can destroy semantic coherence.
