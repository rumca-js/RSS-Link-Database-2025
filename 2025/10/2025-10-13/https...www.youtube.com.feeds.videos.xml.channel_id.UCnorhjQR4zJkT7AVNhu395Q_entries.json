        "description": "We tested four of the most popular toilets from Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, ranging from $99 to $499, to find out which one actually performs best. From flush power and golf ball tests to bowl cleaning and spray coverage, we put each toilet through real-world challenges. If you\u2019re shopping for a new toilet, this toilet comparison and flush test will show you which one is truly worth your money. If you found this video helpful, please subscribe. Hope you enjoy. Cheers! \n\nWelcome to the Forever Home Series! That's right, i bought a new project house and I'm tearing it apart. I\u2019m bringing this 1974 home back to the studs and completely reconfiguring the space so it makes sense for my wife\u2019s forever home. I\u2019ve missed renovating this way. This series will be a comprehensive guide for homeowners and DIYers, offering a rare, behind-the-scenes real life look at every step of the renovation processes from the initial demolition to the final reveal. \n\nDo you need help with your renovation project? \ud83d\udc46",
