Your options for fan control are basically:</p> <ul> <li>Manual PWM tweaking through sysfs (fun at 2 AM when something overheats)</li> <li>Ancient scripts that work until your kernel updates</li> <li>Vendor-specific tools that only work with their hardware</li> <li>No visual feedback, just guesswork</li> <li>GPU passthrough to a VM or that HBA, which you cant monitor anymore</li> </ul> <p>None of the solutions scale well when you have multiple systems.

My server always transcodes streams and seems to do well. However, whenever I initially start a Live TV stream, there is a lag. Once it corrects, streams will usually play for quite a while (1 hour or so) until they freeze, requiring a restart of the stream. </p> <p>My ffmpeg logs do not show any strange errors. My CPU usage appears ok. According to HDHomeRun, most of my streams have 80-100% strength/quality.</p> <p>I am curious if anybody else encounters this issue? Trying to rule out if it is bug-related or perhaps due to something deeper with my network.</p> <p>Any feedback would be great!</p> <p>Thank you,</p> <p>-RoR</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Reape",
