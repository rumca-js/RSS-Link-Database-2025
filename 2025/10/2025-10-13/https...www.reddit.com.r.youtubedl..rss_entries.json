There are many videos I wanted to save for later, and I found this tool for members-only video downloads: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sathishshan/79b850c8cb14190c37d199a564611bd6\">https://gist.github.com/sathishshan/79b850c8cb14190c37d199a564611bd6</a></p> <p>I of course intend to download these for myself, not to upload or otherwise profit off of someone else\u2019s content. Question is: does Youtube suspend accounts merely for downloading private videos? Or only if you do downloads in batch? Are IP bans also considered? I could of course record the screen rather than downloading, but for 100 videos of 1 hour each\u2026 it\u2019s too much. The membership I was gifted expires in 3 days, so what should I do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Reia621\"> /u/Reia621 </a> <",
