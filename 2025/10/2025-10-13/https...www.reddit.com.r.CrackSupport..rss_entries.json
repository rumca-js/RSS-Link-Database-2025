But it&#39;s not on Steam yet, and I don&#39;t want to pay 30 bucks to just have ONE COPY (i cannot play on two devices). So I tried bypassing the licence key system. I got a download link, but a licence key is still required. </p> <p>So my question is, do you buyed the game and do you have a valid licence key to give to your fellow players, or is there a way to bypass this licence key activation and download the file anyway. Here is the link :</p> <p><a href=\"https://download.subwaybuilder.com/download/windows?licenseKey=he7hge6y7yegoi8eyuw7-utrji6yy8wvcn&amp;filePath=Subway%2520Builder%2520Setup%25200.5.5.exe\">https://download.subwaybuilder.com/download/windows?licenseKey=he7hge6y7yegoi8eyuw7-utrji6yy8wvcn&amp;filePath=Subway%2520Builder%2520Setup%25200.5.5.exe</a></p> <p>he7hge6y7yegoi8eyuw7-utrji6yy8wvcn is a licence key i tried for fun, but",
