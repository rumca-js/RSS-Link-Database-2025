The Jared Leto-led movie pulled in $33.5 million at the domestic box office during its opening weekend, lower than Leto's 2022 flop Morbius, which earned $39 million domestic in its opening weekend. Globally, Tron: Ares sits at just over $60 million, and faces a steep climb to earn back its $180 million production budget. In other movie news, Channing Tatum says his solo Gambit movie was a little too much for Disney. The movie was going to be an R-rated rom-com andwould've featured \"mutants having sex.\" Gambit was stuck in development hell and eventually dropped, but Tatum was able to finally put on the Cajun accent for Deadpool & Wolverine. Tatum is also featured in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday. And take a peek into a four-park family vacation at Universal Studios Florida, Universal Islands of Adventure, Universal Volcano Bay, and the newest park, Universal Epic Universe.\n\nPresented by Universal Orlando Reso",
