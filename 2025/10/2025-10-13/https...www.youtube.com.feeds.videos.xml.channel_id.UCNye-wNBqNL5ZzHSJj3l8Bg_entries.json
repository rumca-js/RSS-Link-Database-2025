It's an \"incredible triumph\" they worked together, he says.\nTrump said that in Lebanon, \u201cthe dagger of Hezbollah\u201d aimed at Israel has been \u201ctotally shattered\u201d.\nNow \"it will be the golden age of Israel\", Trump adds, as well as the \"golden age\" for the whole region.\nThe speech was briefly interrupted by a left-wing Knesset member who was quickly intercepted by security.\nTrump has been praising several members of his administration for securing the ceasefire, including Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind ",
