Imagine that it organises a general strike, nixing much of the UK\u2019s economic activity for three months.

The Australian midfielder impressed when she featured last season and there were high hopes for her going into this campaign, but four games glued to the bench have been followed by 54 minutes as a substitute across the following three matches. Brighton were, by their own admission, tiring towards the end of their 1-0 defeat and Cooney-Cross\u2019s ball-carrying and front-foot approach caught the eye as the Gunners tried to extend their lead. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a drop-off [in] minute 60 or 75 and intensity goes down in games and space becomes bigger, the gamechangers can make a real impact, and that\u2019s 100% what Kyra did,\u201d said Slegers. \u201cShe capitalised on the spaces and the fatigue and the opposition",

Four hours of wrestling with it in the heat later, I hated camping. Next, the adventure holiday for single-parent families.
