The next day, my mom came to me crying, saying she hadn\u2019t been able to sleep, that she was worried about me, but that she loved me. She also said maybe it was \u201cjust a phase,\u201d and together with my dad they asked if I had a boyfriend. They added, though, that if I did, they wouldn\u2019t want to meet him at home\u2014only maybe at a restaurant or somewhere else\u2014and that I shouldn\u2019t tell my grandparents.</p> <p>Since then, we\u2019ve never mentioned my sexuality again. It\u2019s like it was erased.</p> <p>Now I live in another city, and I finally have a boyfriend I truly love, someone who makes me happier than I\u2019ve ever been. But I feel that to be fully happy\u2014and out of respect for him\u2014I need to tell my parents about our relationship. The thing is, I have no idea how they\u2019ll react after all this time.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll accept it",

No I\u2019ve never been on a date with a woman, or kissed anyone. Now that I\u2019m in college, I find everyone else already has some kind of experience. I\u2019ve heard many comments from women that they avoid people who\u2019ve never been in a relationship, and people who are bad at kissing. A few of my friends have joked that they feel bad for the first girl I kiss, because I\u2019ll be bad at it. I\u2019m really shy and introverted. I\u2019m also not sure good looking, I\u2019m not ugly, but not the kind of girl someone would go for. Perhaps I\u2019m overthinking, but I don\u2019t think dating is for me. I think I\u2019m too late in the ballgame. People still tell me I\u2019m young. But when everyone else has already dated before, I feel out of place. I want to date a woman one day, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll disappoint them. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
