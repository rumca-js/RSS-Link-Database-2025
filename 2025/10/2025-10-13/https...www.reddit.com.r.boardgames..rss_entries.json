I</p> <p>I\u2019m curious about the <em>idea</em> of hosting murder mystery games as a creative side hobby (just collecting opinions).

Or if the Don&#39;t Starve board game introduced a new item or monster that doesn&#39;t exist in the video game?</p> <p>I&#39;d be curious to know if anyone is aware of a case like this.
