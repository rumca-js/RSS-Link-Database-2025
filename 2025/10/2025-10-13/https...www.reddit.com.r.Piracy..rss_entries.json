There are many videos I wanted to save for later, and I found this tool for members-only video downloads: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/sathishshan/79b850c8cb14190c37d199a564611bd6\">https://gist.github.com/sathishshan/79b850c8cb14190c37d199a564611bd6</a></p> <p>I of course intend to download these for myself, not to upload or otherwise profit off of someone else\u2019s content. Question is: does Youtube suspend accounts merely for downloading private videos? Or only if you do downloads in batch? Are IP bans also considered? I could of course record the screen rather than downloading, but for 100 videos of 1 hour each\u2026 it\u2019s too much. The membership I was gifted expires in 3 days, so what should I do?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Reia621\"> /u/Reia621 </a> <",

The technician said they had to replace the entire board since it couldn\u2019t be fixed and it was like 300 Brazilian Reais (wich go for about 55 USD$).</p> <p>When the TV came back, the interface looked <em>different</em>. Not the same webOS layout it had before. It\u2019s similar, but missing some of the original apps and menus (like the web browser and most of the apps in the appstore). It almost feels like a downgraded version of the old system.</p> <p>Everything technically works, but I\u2019m concerned that the new software could be modified or unofficial, since the repair wasn\u2019t done by LG directly. I know it might sound paranoid, but I can&#39;t trust smart TVs since i&#39;ve watched &quot;The Boys&quot; from Amazon+, and this TV is in my mom\u2019s be",

So far I just use YouTube music or Spotify to search for songs then i&#39;ll download them on Nicotine+ and then play them through Strawberry but this is very tedious.</p> <p>I wish I could just search through something like Spotify etc. that then click play, it finds the song, automatically downloads as a flac file then plays it locally on my music player (I don&#39;t mind what).</p> <p>I know I could just get Tidal for browsing and downloading but I would still have to download them after playing which is still a bit tedious, any thoughts? Surely there is a way to do this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/83yWasTaken\"> /u/83yWasTaken </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1o57hza/searching_songs_through_music_streaming_service/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1o57hza/searching_songs_through_music_s",

Someone\u2019s uploaded a different show for that episode. So I wet to find that episode on a few different sites, attacker, Luna etc and the same wrong episode has been uploaded. Why do most free sites have the exact same uploads? And is there a site that will have uploaded the correct episode?
