I keep on getting the wsl is not updated error and I have tried everything from uninstalling/ reinstalling wsl , updating wsl, disabling and enabling the wsl/ hyper v feature\u2026 literally everything!! I downloaded older versions of docker to to see if that would work. Strangely thats giving me a different error that says unexpected wsl error and some bullshit. I am just so fucking tired of this, can anyone please help with some helpful advice? Please im about to go nuts\ud83e\udd2a </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HistorianOk3996\"> /u/HistorianOk3996 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1o57ve7/wsl_needs_update_error/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1o57ve7/wsl_needs_update_error/\">[comments]</a></span>",
