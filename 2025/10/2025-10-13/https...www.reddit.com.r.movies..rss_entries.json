Not just simply good, but amazing movies.</p> <p>A man commonly singled out in this category (where a director is not a household name but their own movies are absolute classics and not only to cinephiles) is the great Sidney Lumet. I&#39;d like to proffer another filmmaker in this category: Peter Weir.</p> <p>Retired now, but he&#39;s one of the greatest Australian film directors ever. An underrated GOAT in my book, with a distinctive auteur sensibility. Quite a few of his movies possess an ambivalence with a slight otherworldliness to it.</p> <p><strong>Picnic at Hanging Rock</strong> (1975) is a masterpiece, arguably the best Australian film of all time. For those who are unfamiliar, it&#39;s about what happens when a girls boarding school takes a field trip to an unusual but scenic volcanic format",
