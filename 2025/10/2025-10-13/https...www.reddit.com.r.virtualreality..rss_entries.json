I got tired of watching them on my epson projector and want to try watching in a VR helmet because Im pretty sure it will be better.</p> <p>Can a VR helmet properly decode and display something in native MVC 3D format? I think that would look better than the squashed down SBS versions, and, I can easily rerip the discs and obtain the files in the original unsquished native 3D format. </p> <p>If yes, is there a preferred VR device for this, or doesnt it matter?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for schooling me on this one </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Murky-Sector\"> /u/Murky-Sector </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1o5stq8/which_vr_helmet_for_native_mvc_3d/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/c",

(Chose this headset because it&#39;s the only one using an HDMI, laptop only has HDMI connected to DGPU.) It&#39;s an omen max 2025 with Intel 275hx and a 5080. So plenty of horsepower for the CV1. I&#39;ve got roughly 60%-70% headroom in games but the stutter is similar in every game. It&#39;s almost like objects are jittery. Sometimes it gets progressively worse. I&#39;ve tried a million things so far. Made sure the sensors and HMD are running on separate USB root hubs. Optimized the system overall and am running only essential background apps. No overlays. Great temps. Good timespy score. I even utilized AI to try to help narrow it down. The literal only other thing I can think of is I get kinda high Nvidia driver DPC latency, around 3.1ms. But I also kinda don&#39;t want to install a 3 year old driver on my 2025 laptop if I can avoid it as I play a lot of new/recent game",

Cause when i tried psvr2 the reprojection on some games like re5 was really annoying, everything was blurry when turning my head. Now that I ordered the BSB2 and read complaints about persistence at higher brightness level, i am wondering if its similar.
