        "description": "For all the success that Battlefield 6 has had \u2013 this many millions estimated to have been sold, that many concurrent players on Steam \u2013 there's one aspect that's stuck out like a sore thumb for some players. If you and many others have outright ignored, lost in the bliss that is multiplayer (even with its idiosyncrasies and flaws), then it's probably for the best. The campaign, the series's first since Battlefield 5 in 2018, isn't very good according to some players.\n\nIt's ironic, in a way. Battlefield 2042 received extensive criticism for dropping any semblance of a story mode and still charging $70 for it. Along comes Battlefield 6, the biggest title in the franchise yet, and it's receiving flak for what's essentially a dull campaign. Boiling down the argument into \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don't\u201d is easy enough, but the point still stands: Whether Electronic Arts includes it or not, the campaign should be fun. So is it? As the saying goes, your mileage will vary.",
