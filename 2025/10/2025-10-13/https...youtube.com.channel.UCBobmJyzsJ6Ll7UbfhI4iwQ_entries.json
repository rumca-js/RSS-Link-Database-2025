Now, more than 360 million mods have been downloaded across consoles and PCs, and iconic brands like Power Rangers are going in-game via premium mods.\n\nThis session dives into the technical and creative strategies that made this cross-platform leap possible, including leveraging Unreal Engine 5 to integrate in-game mod discovery and management. Thomas Williamson of Grove Street Games and Shahar Sorek of Overwolf explain how they maintained platform security, integrated user generated patches, and leveraged Zen Loader for optimal mod packaging. \n\nAttendees gain insights into building cross-platform compatibility, the challenges of maintaining a unified experience across different devices, and how this approach empowers game studios and creators to foster strong UGC ecosystems. This session is ideal for develo",

Automation leads to consistency, and consistency can be used to measure the impact of specific changes or catch regressions. \n\nThere\u2019s a few different ways that tech artists can lead the charge in automating this process, and in this talk we discuss options for automating performance testing from quick and easy to robust, configurable, and extensible.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#TechArt, #PerformanceTesting, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestBali",

From running into performance bottlenecks to unexpected engine behavior, knowing how to efficiently identify, validate, and resolve these issues is critical for maintaining a stable production.\n \nIn this session recorded at Unreal Fest Bali 2025, Thomas Sheppard shares Prismatic Studios\u2019 approach to problem identification and solution, covering strategies for gathering data, recognizing patterns, and avoiding false assumptions. He then takes a look at validation techniques, using profiling tools and debugging methods to confirm issues before implementing fixes.\n \nNext, Thomas discusses risk assessment and resolution strategies, focusing on minimizing disruptions when making changes to the codebase. Using real-world examples, including both Unreal Developer Network (UDN) cases and challenges the studio has faced in client projects, he shows how to diagnose and solve complex issues effectively.\n \nWatch fo",

He also gives an insight into how the studio uses Unreal Engine for production, with animation taking place in Maya and UE used for setdressing, lighting, and VFX.\n \nChristophe then introduces a series of custom tools M2 created to streamline the export of assets from Maya to Unreal Engine, and also tools for automatic shot management, including for building levels and sequences automatically based on Shot Grid data.\n\nHe explains how to leverage level streaming and sub-sequences to make a per-shot pipeline in which artists can work together easily, and demonstrates how the studio\u2019s rendering is handled through Unreal Eng",

And yes, these models are carved in the real world by artists wielding chainsaws! \n\nThe session also walks through the process of taking photogrammetry data from a drone, processing it in RealityCapture, and turning it into an accurate site model. \n\nStart with a solid design and all the right ingredients in place, and it all comes together using innovative landscape architecture plugins to shape natural playscapes, sometimes spanning beyond 20 acres. \n\nNewsome concludes by bringing it all into Twinmotion to create immersive, highly realistic visuals and animations. It\u2019s a fast, flexible workflow that combines real-world accuracy with creative freedom.\n\nLearn more about Twinmotion here: twinmotion.com\n\n#RealityScan, #Twinmotion, #Photogrammetry, ",
