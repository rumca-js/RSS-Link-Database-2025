        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve noticed that over the past ten years, old trends have been coming back; in fashion, like the wide 501 Levi\u2019s jeans, in TV shows and movies that try to capture the atmosphere of the 80s, like Stranger Things, for example, and many others. Well\u2026the same thing is happening in gaming, where pixel art has recently become especially popular, and more and more games are paying homage to old titles by using this retro style. But if old trends are returning, I\u2019m wondering, why isn\u2019t vector arcade game graphics making a comeback like pixel art is?</p> <p>Honestly, just writing about this topic fills me with nostalgia when I think of old games like Red Baron (1980), Star Wars (1983), and others I used to live for back in the day. While I\u2019m typing this, I can literally hear \u201cUse the Force, Luke\u201d in my head \ud83d\ude02. And honestly, I\u2019m surprised that almost no one has made a proper homage to games like these. Sure, there are a few indie titles like Asteroids Recharge",
