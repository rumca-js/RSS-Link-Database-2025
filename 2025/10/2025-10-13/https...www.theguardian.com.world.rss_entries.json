All this makes the failure of the government witness \u2013 Matthew Collins, the deputy national security adviser \u2013 to set this out in three separate witness statements given to the prosecution even more surprising.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/13/muddle-over-semantics-or-pressure-from-china-collapsed-",
