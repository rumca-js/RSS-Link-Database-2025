        "description": "A team of international physicists has brought Bayes\u2019 centuries-old probability rule into the quantum world. By applying the \u201cprinciple of minimum change\u201d \u2014 updating beliefs as little as possible while remaining consistent with new data \u2014 they derived a quantum version of Bayes\u2019 rule from first principles. Their work connects quantum fidelity (a measure of similarity between quantum states) to classical probability reasoning, validating a mathematical concept known as the Petz map.",
