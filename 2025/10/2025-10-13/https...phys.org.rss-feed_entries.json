        "description": "Weather forecasting is a powerful tool. During hurricane season, for instance, meteorologists create computer simulations to forecast how these destructive storms form and where they might travel, which helps prevent damage to coastal communities. When you're trying to forecast space weather, rather than storms on Earth, creating these simulations gets a little more complex. To simulate space weather, you would need to fit the sun, the planets and the vast empty space between them in a virtual environment, also known as a simulation box, where all the calculations would take place.",

Over this time, the two massive star systems slowly merge together, their gravitational pull drawing them closer. At the heart of each galaxy lies a supermassive black hole, an object containing millions or even billions of times the mass of our sun. After the galaxies merge, these two black holes should eventually find each other, settling into orbit around their shared center of gravity. The result is one of the universe's most extreme phenomena, a supermassive black hole binary. But to date, none have been found.",

The new approach, termed ALFA Nanobody-guided Endogenous Labeling (ANGEL), solves a long-standing problem of high-throughput screening for nonfluorescent small peptide knockins. Results were published in Nature Chemical Biology on August 29.",

The concept involves altering an alien world's atmosphere, temperature, and surface conditions to resemble Earth's environment, such as adding oxygen to the air, creating liquid water on the surface, and establishing a stable climate.",

        "description": "Magnetotelluric (MT) data, which contain measurements of electric and magnetic field variations at Earth's surface, provide insights into the electrical resistivity of Earth's crust and upper mantle. Changes in resistivity, or the ability to conduct an electrical current, can indicate the presence of geologic features such as igneous intrusions or sedimentary basins, meaning MT surveys can complement other kinds of geophysical surveys to help reveal Earth's subsurface. In addition, such surveys can play an important role in improving understanding of the risks space weather poses to human infrastructure.",
