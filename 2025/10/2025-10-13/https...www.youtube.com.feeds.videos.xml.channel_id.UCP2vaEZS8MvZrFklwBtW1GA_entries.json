        "description": "Bathroom sink sanitary tee tips\u2026I set the tee about 21 inches off the concrete so that after the tile it\u2019ll be at roughly 20 inches. I use Ironclad Cleanfit nitrile gloves to protect my hands from the primer and cement, I like these gloves for tile work as well. About 3 to 4 revolutions of the primer on the pipe/fitting followed by 3 to 4 revolutions of cement make this a solid solvent weld. Many thanks to Ironclad for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#plumbing #bathroomremodel #homerenovation #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
