A few questions I\u2019m hoping someone can clarify: \u2022 Do any London datacenters offer colocation for individuals, or do I have to go through a reseller or managed provider? \u2022 What\u2019s the typical monthly cost range for 1\u20132 kW power and 10 Gbps unmetered (or high-limit) bandwidth? \u2022 Any tips or gotchas for first-time coloc users (contracts, VAT, access rules, hidden costs)? \u2022 Any recommended providers or websites to compare colo options in the UK?</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen mentions of places like ServerColocation.uk, Netwise, and Norwich DC, but I\u2019m not sure ",
