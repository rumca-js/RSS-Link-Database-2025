It\u2019s been a while since my last post (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1mw4pvn/argo_a_tiny_cm5_carrier_pcb/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1mw4pvn/argo_a_tiny_cm5_carrier_pcb/</a>) and I have since been working on the v2 which I\u2019m happy to say fixes all issues from v1! </p> <p>The project did get slightly delayed due to the typhoon and thus factory and shipping issues but that\u2019s all resolved now! </p> <p>I\u2019m happy to say that the board now survives being unplugged from USB-C power in (which it struggled with before) and no longer suffers from a Low Voltage error provided you are using an adequate power",
