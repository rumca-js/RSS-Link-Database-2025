Was it as good as <strong>The Checklist Manifesto</strong>? No, but it&#39;s still good. 7\u00bd stars, rounding down to 7. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</p> <p>Gawande organizes it in 8 chapters - the Independent Self, Things Fall Apart, Dependence, Assistance, A Better Life, Letting Go, Hard Conversations and Courage, with an epilog. And yes, it does have citations of a lot of reference materials. He wouldn&#39;t be a surgeon or physician without them. But, this is also a very personal book for Gawande. It talks about his grandmother-in-law&#39;s decline and death, about his patients, friends, his grandfather and father. And their deaths. So, yeah, it isn&#39;t ligh",

It\u2019s not a manual, but it\u2019s filled with ideas that, if applied, can bring more joy to your children\u2019s lives. It\u2019s a book that made me reflect on my relationships and how to make my loved ones feel truly cherished</p> <p>As with any book in this genre, I wouldn\u2019t advise treating it as an instruction manual or the Bible. However, if implemented and followed, some ideas can bring more pleasant moments to your children\u2019s lives.</p> <p><strong>4. \u201cThe Woman Who Went to Bed for a Year\u201d by Sue Townsend</strong> is one of my favourite books this year and my entire life.
