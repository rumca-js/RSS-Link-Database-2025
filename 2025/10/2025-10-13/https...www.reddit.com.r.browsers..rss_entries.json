It was great, but unfortunately, the project has been shut down.</p> <p>I have a list of browsers that I&#39;ve tried and their main drawbacks for me personally.</p> <ol> <li>Firefox is slow. It has one advantage: extensions. But the fact that it is so slow compared to Chromium-based browsers makes me hesitate when choosing. (I know there are forks like Iceraven, Fennec, etc., but I don&#39;t trust them. If I&#39;m wrong, please let me know in the comments). Or, if you know how to configure and optimize Firefox, please let me know as well.</li> <li>Brave is a decent browser. But it has one major drawback: the worst translator in the world. On my PC, I use the TWP extension from GitHub and translate pages instantly. But their built-in translator, which is used on Android, is crap. If it had a decent page translator, I would choose it.</li> <li",
