Going from the stats in in Prowlarr NZBGeek has around 40% more successful grabs than NZBFinder. But I dont know if NZBFinder is getting stuff the NZBGeek is missing. Even with these two indexers, I still have trouble finding the home improvement TV episodes my wife is after. Should I look at adding other indexers or am I just wasting my time and just run with NZBGeek?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnInOz\"> /u/JohnInOz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1o5wdyq/how_many_indexers_for_my_arr_stack/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1o5wdyq/how_many_indexers_for_my_arr_stack/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I managed to get a few NZB indexer accounts through friends, so I&#39;m covered on that end. Now I need to pick a provider.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been reading through old posts here and Eweka keeps coming up as a community favorite. But I noticed the prices mentioned in those older threads were around \u20ac2.99/month, and now when I check their site it&#39;s more like \u20ac7-8 range. Has something changed, or were those just promotional deals?</p> <p>My plan was to try Eweka for a month to see how it performs, then keep an eye out for Black Friday deals in case there&#39;s something better. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?</p> <p>A few questions:</p> <ul> <li>Is Eweka still considered top-tier at the current pricing?</li> <li>Should I wait for Black Friday or just grab a month now to get started?</li> <li>Do I need a block account from a different backbone right away, or can",
