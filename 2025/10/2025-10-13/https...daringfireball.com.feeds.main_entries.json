It really was a great app. Back in 2017, when version 2.0 arrived (just six months after 1.0), <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/11/10/clips-2-0\">I described it as</a> \u201cthe single best example of a productivity app designed for iOS\u201d. I stand by that. Clips was a very ambitious app that really pushed the state of the art in iOS UI design forward in so many ways. The general knock on iOS has always been that it\u2019s a platform for content consumption, not creation. Clips was <em>all about</em> creation.</p>\n\n<p>But for as many great ideas as Clips contained (and debuted), it clearly never clicked with the public. There was something essential missing: a use case. <a href=\"https://thatrandoma",
