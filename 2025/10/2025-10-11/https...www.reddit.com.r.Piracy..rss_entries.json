        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Recently ive been having a problem with ytrevanced, the videos would stop after about a minute with an error in the screen besides the performance and overheating ive been having since i started using it. I tried repatching and it didnt work so i said why not tey og youtube with ads. To my surprise perform3and overheating issues are not present at all! Its so snappy and my phone doesnt warm up at all, only problem is the ads and not being able to turn the screen of of exit the app without my video stopping. But honestly not having my phone over heating is a big plus and i think ill keep using it despite the ads and all. Curious to know your experiences and if there is a way to have revanced without the performaand overheating?
