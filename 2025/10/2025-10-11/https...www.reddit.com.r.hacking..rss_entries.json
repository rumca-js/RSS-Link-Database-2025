I feel like I\u2019m stuck I want to learn so much about everything I can and end up stunting myself from actually learning anything. I\u2019ve always loved WiFi/radio frequency hacking and all the cool lil gadgets like rubber duckies and m5sticks hackrf etc. basically anything portable that has a function. Always thought things with antennas looked pretty cool. I love networking as well like servers, routers, stuff like that. Exploit development/malware development. I love it all and I can\u2019t seem to stick to one thing long enough to actually learn. Any recommendations for moving forward specifically more into the wireless hacking world. I do need to get more into hackthebox and tryhackme. I do know command line and a decent amount about Linux.</p> <p>Edit: also find cyberdecks so cool especially portable networks or radio specific builds.</p> <p>Sorry for the long post",
