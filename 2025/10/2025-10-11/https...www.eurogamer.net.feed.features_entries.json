I enjoyed it enough that I wasn't wholly convinced Yooka-Replaylee - a &ldquo;remastered and enhanced&rdquo; version of Playtonic's 2017 collectathon throwback - could do enough to warrant a return. But after a couple hours tootling around its overhauled worlds, I'm happy to be back, even if it does feel like some of its deliberate old-school charm has been lost along the way.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-replaylee-brings-big-improvements-to-the-retro-throwback-but-loses-some-of-its-old-school-charm-along-the-way\">Read more<",

This week, Marie gives her Sims a holiday; it sounds like Kelsey could use a holiday from <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong\">Silksong</a>; Alex revisits Clair Obscur ahead of Game of the Year discussions, and is quickly reminded why he loves it; Matt revisits <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares\">Little Nightmares</a> 1 and 2 while trying to work out why LN3 feels off; Bertie moves house; and Tom loses his frog hat.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-nightmares-getaways-skonging-frog-hats-and-unpacking\">Read more</a></p>",
