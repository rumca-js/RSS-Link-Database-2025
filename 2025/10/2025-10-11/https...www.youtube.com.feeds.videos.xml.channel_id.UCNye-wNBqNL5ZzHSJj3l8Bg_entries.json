Demonstrations let by so-called Gen Z youths have been protesting for weeks, growing from anger over power and water outages into a wider movement opposing the government. The United Nations says at least 22 people have been killed in the unrest; the government disputes that figure. The president has dissolved his cabinet and appointed a new prime minister, but protesters say that\u2019s not enough.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Ali Hashem reports.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\n Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n#Madagascar #MadagascarProtests #MadagascarUnrest #MadagascarArmy #GenZProtests #MadagascarCrisis",
