So many game genres and categories are a more specific version of an existing game genre. This is good. If you are looking for a specific genre, you can go in the specific category, and if not, then the broad one.</p> <p>My issue is that most &quot;specific genres&quot; have slowly been given the role of their broad parent. Which means now you have 2 categories that fulfill the same role, and have to sort through a bunch of unrelated stuff to find the games in the specific genre. There&#39;s other similar offenders too that share their &quot;new definition&quot; with a brother rather than a parent. I&#39;ll give examples in a bit. Many of the offenders can be given the excuse &quot;well this game is a [genre] game&quot; and be technically correct because of the meaning of the words, but incorrect in the spirit of the genre.

The game would play just like chess however when you moved your piece to claim your opponents piece the game would then zoom in and turn into a fighting game and you determine who&#39;s piece is removed from the chess board by fighting it out mortal kombat style.
