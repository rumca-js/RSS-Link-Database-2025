I have looked everywhere for guides/walkthroughs that show you how to dial in the settings and timings for the OSSC for the best profile for each console, but all the guides from people like WobblingPixels and FirebrandX (and any other profiles I find) are usually 4+ years old and have been made for the 0.X firmware and for hardware versions pre-1.8. I have tried to do my own tweaking using things like the <a href=\"https://junkerhq.net/xrgb/index.php?title=240p_test_suite\">240p Test Suite</a>, but I am curious if there are online resources I missed that could help me get the best image quality possible (mainly for SNES, GC and Wii).
