        "description": "Mutable is an Unreal Engine plugin for creating character customization systems, enabling dynamic changes to characters and other assets during gameplay. While it's primarily used for character customization, Mutable is adaptable to other dynamic content like vehicles, weapons, and props.\n\nIn this talk you'll learn what Mutable is, how to use it, and most importantly, how not to use it. You'll find out how to take the most advantage of it, and how to avoid the most common pitfalls. The session concludes with a review of real projects that are currently using Mutable, pointing up the different use cases of Mutable and also the lessons learned during development.",
