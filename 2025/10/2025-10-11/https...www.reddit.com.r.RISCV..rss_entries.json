While it can seem unimpressive, its for automotive, and for strategic autonomy of the supply chain of chips and software. As some of the car industry in EU had to stop production back in 2019, because they lacked chips for 10-20\u20ac for a car for 2-60.000\u20ac, this is part of the response. Likely also to defence.<br/> It can run Linux. It will likely also means more or all software of the European car-companies will move to risc-v, as then they only have to maintain one software know-how, no vendor lock-in or royalties, and they can scale it. So also a bost to the eco system as a whole. The project has exceeded expectations and will also pave the way for HPC.<br/> So more important than it seems. It also seems to be an enabler for bigger chips, and this chip could also be used for other apps than automotive. They say more funds are needed to take on Arm, Intel and AMD. :-)<br/> Likely this. Cortus now has both smaller 32 bit micro",
