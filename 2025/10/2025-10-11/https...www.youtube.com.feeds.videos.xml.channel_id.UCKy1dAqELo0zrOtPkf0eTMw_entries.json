Conquest is the home of iconic all-out warfare where tanks, jets, and attack helicopters turn the tides of battle. This mode often features the largest player count, and these decrease any time a player is killed without being revived. Lives also decrease due to captured objectives; for every objective under one team\u2019s control, the other team loses one life every couple of seconds. When a team\u2019s lives hit zero, the battle\u2019s over. \nBattlefield 6 is available now for PlayStation 5 (PS5), Xbox Series X|S, and PC (Steam).",
