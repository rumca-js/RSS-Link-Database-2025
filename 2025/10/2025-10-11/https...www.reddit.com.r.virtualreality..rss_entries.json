I remember seeing demos years ago and thinking it looked like something straight out of sci-fi<strong>,</strong> being able to walk through your favorite game world instead of just pressing a stick. Lately, I\u2019ve been eyeing the Omni One, but I\u2019m trying to be realistic before I spend that kind of money. If you own a VR Treadmill, do you still use it regularly or has it ended up collecting dust? I know the novelty can wear off fast for some people, especially when setup and calibration start to feel like more effort than fun. But I\u2019d really love to hear from those who\u2019ve stuck with it, what keeps you coming back? Also, I noticed a few cheaper listings floating around on Alibaba that claim to offer similar setups. Has anyone tried those or are they just knockoffs that look good on paper? I\u2019m trying to figure out if it\u2019s actually worth it for long-term use or just one",

Assuming Pimax being European wont change prices due to component fees, But maybe subject to an import fee do they ship from china?

I don&#39;t get motion sickness, which is awesome, but I did get headaches for the first couple weeks. I was really uncomfortable with the headaches and the default strap, but I still played for hours because it was that fun. Getting the replacement strap was really nice. I use Meta Link wired, and it works most of the time, just a few times I had to reset the app to get it to load. Definitely not as bad as people say, especially as a free option.</p> <p>I&#39;ve completed Half-Life 2 + Episodes and Alyx; loved them, probably going to remain at the top of my list of VR games. Half-Life 2 was my first time completing the game, and it was my first time playing the episodes. The controls were a bit frustrating, but the games were otherwise fantastic. Half-Life Alyx is on my top ten list of favorite games on any platform. I&#39;ve tried most of the games people on here recommend, ",
