The original cut was soooo good - everything was <em>just right</em> but in the DC they overexplain everything and kill the pacing of the movie somehow.</p> <p>On another note, the Justice League 2017 sucked so bad it should have never been made, but ZSJL&#39;s stretched 4h+ runtime was just <em>okay</em>. Like, it&#39;s wayyy better than JL, but still not great. The story was so drawn out, and the slo-mo in every scene was just so uninteresting/uninspired (sesame seed falling from the trucker&#39;s burger, Lois putting down her coffee cup). As one reviewer put it, &quot;You could cut an hour without affecting the plot even a little.&quot; Also, why format a film for IMAX full knowing it would be released on the HBO streaming service. (Disclaimer: not hating on ZS, it&#39;s just my opinion)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nobod",

But for some reason, someone thought that using Believer in the trailer Murder on the Orient Express (2017) was a good idea for a period piece mystery film, set in the 1930s.</p> <p>And that song did not work in the trailer at all. It was way too modern for a film set in the &#39;30s and it was a weird song choice as well too for that trailer. That was definitely a weird moment during that period, before we even had slowed down songs in movie trailers.</p> <p>I give a special shout-out to Suicide Squad (2016) using Queen&#39;s Bohemian Rhapsody too and that was because the trailer was such a huge hit, WB hired the company that edited the trailer, to re-edit the movie as well. And it certainly didn&#39;t help the movie&#39;s quality at all lol.</p",
