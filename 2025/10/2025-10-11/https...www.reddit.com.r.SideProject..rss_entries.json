It sounds like one of those &quot;too good to be true&quot; things, but it&#39;s completely genuine and straightforward. People always overlook this because they think there&#39;s a &quot;catch&quot; somewhere but there really isn&#39;t.</p> <p>As an example of Bonus Arbitraging, here&#39;s one of the ways you can literally make $20 in 2-3 minutes by arbitrage:</p> <p>Here are the very simple steps:</p> <ol> <li>Sign up for the <a href=\"https://gemsloot.com/?aff=shg\"><strong>Gemsloot platform</strong></a> <em>(use this link for the bonus)</em>.</li> <li>Navigate to the SoFi Plus offer for $30 (you can search for &quot;SoFi Plus&quot;).</li> <li>Click the offer, create an account, and subscribe to SoFi Plus for the month for <strong>$10</strong>.</li> <li>Once subscribed, Gemsloot will pay you out ",
