Until now, I\u2019d mostly been working with traditional databases like SQL-based systems or MongoDB. Out of curiosity, I started exploring and realized how much potential vector databases have, especially for AI-related work.</p> <p>While working on my AI project, I came across how vector databases can really change the game for things like semantic search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and context-aware systems.</p> <p>Compared to normal databases, vector databases don\u2019t just look for exact matches , they understand meaning.<br/> For example, in a traditional database, you can query something like \u201cfind all users named John.\u201d But in a vector database, you can search based on similarity or intent - like \u201cfind products similar to this one\u201d or \u201cfind documents related to this topic,\u201d<br/> even if the exact keywords don\u2019t match. That makes them a lot more powerful for AI and search applications in real",
