I\u2019m looking for suggestions on what to read. I love love love watching movies, especially when they help me understand myself a little better and I can relate to them. When they can put into words exactly how I feel when I can\u2019t. I\u2019m looking for that same feeling in books. I watch movies because I have a hard time understanding my emotions, and it helps me feel a little less crazy and a little more understood. Knowing someone felt what I felt and felt those emotions so strongly that they were able to make a movie out of it brings me comfort. Please recommend ANYTHING.

She delves fairly deeply into specific information about the things that were important to people. She goes into clothing, medicine, food, tools, even building and farming technique. </p> <p>She does NOT focus on politics, the lives of politicians, wars, assassinations, famous people, rich people,............
