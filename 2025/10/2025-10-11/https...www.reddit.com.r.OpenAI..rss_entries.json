Honestly the tech enthusiast in me is super intrigued with such a technology.</p> <p>But what\u2019s been sticking with me more, though, is the ethical side. Right now, people are having fun making memes or funny videos of celebrities and sure, it can be entertaining. But is it really okay? And once this tech gets better and easier to use, it won\u2019t just be celebrities, it could be anyone around you\u2026 or even yourself.</p> <p>Imagine AI-generated videos of everyday people being shared without consent. The potential for misuse is huge, and I don\u2019t see any serious regulations anywhere. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want AI videos of me floating and I doubt most people would.</p> <p>Feels like we\u2019re entering the wild west of AI, where what\u2019s fun today could turn into serious problems tomorrow.

I have tried to surf into Internet in order to solve them but there is few documentation and forums in speech to speech models discussions and official docs.

From there, in a recursive way you get a complete model that is able to generate text as output. In gpt realtime model, as the input can be directly audio tokens, how was it trained?
