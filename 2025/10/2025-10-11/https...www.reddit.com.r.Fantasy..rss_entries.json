For those of you who have not read her, Slatter is a master of short story fantasies, and through short stories, she created an amazing universe she calls Sourdough--there are witches; vampires (of a sort); magical creatures; people going about their daily lives, only to be pulled into circumstances beyond their wildest imagination; and people who seek out the extraordinary. Slatter then wrote several full length Sourdough novels, and they all are good. Her prose is fantastic (my number one criteria for favorite authors) and leans toward dark stories.</p> <p>The C",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the region I\u2019m in or something but I\u2019ve not been able to find a definitive answer on what exactly a fantasy-thriller is. What defines the genre? What are the expectations of that genre? What example literature is in that genre? Do fantasy thrillers have the same amount of worldbuilding as your generic fantasy story? How long do they tend to be? I\u2019m going to assume it\u2019s similar to Fantasy-Romance, in that it\u2019s 50-50 fantasy/thriller. But again, I\u2019m not certain since I haven\u2019t seen any videos or articles on what defines this genre. It sounds like a fun genre to try my hand at writing, but if I don\u2019t know the rules and ins and outs of it, if it even is a genre, it becomes difficult to actually craft a story with it. If anyone could answer those questions that\u2019d be great :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Upbeat_Tea_1461\"> /u/",

Why would they be able to speak human considering that 99.9 percent of them never even have a chance to speak with any, most of them have never even seen a human. So if they are only among themselves, why would they retain the ability to speak human even if they did once speak it? Some of the raiders that live near the border might have some use for human language, but I doubt even this since they seem to simply kill any humans they see and do not talk to them. They dont do any trade or anything l",
