I have an LG 27gs95qe woled that sets a peak of 600 in windows and KDE. This is the level read from the monitors edid. It has a peak sdr brightness of 276 nits. W11 recognizes this and by default the KDE HDR calibration has this as default as well. It says &quot;50&quot; by default when you do it but setting 276 keeps image exactly the same. In games like KCD2 and Alan Wake 2 in notice the sky is to bright. All over exposed. Turning down the max sdr brightness setting does not fix this. It just makes the entire image darker. So there is no way to get around it. Cyberpunk by default comes off brighter than W11 as well but I can calibrate around it with the settings available in game for the most part. Using Wayland HDR flags in steam. It&#39;s like HDR is allmost there but that last peak brightness level is t coming across. Stalker 2 Iv noticed this as well. ",

I&#39;ve been considering finally biting the bullet and transitioning my Windows 10 gaming rig to a Linux machine with VFIO passthrough. My current PC has a Ryzen-3900x and RTX 3070. My motherboard is an x570 MEG ACE which lacks any APU support. Part of me is really wishing I just got a different motherboard at the time lol. I bought it before I know about any of this really. My main dilema is that since AM5 is now settling in, the price of AM4 hardware is realy coming down in price. Like a Ryzen 7 5700G would last a long time still... I wanted the APU because I want something with mid-level power to run Linux and Linux games, and let Windows have my Nvidia card. However I was also considering just switching to AM5, however I don&#39;t really like wasting perfectly good computer hardware. I&#39;m gonna have to buy another motherboard either way to achieve my goal. </p> <p>I already use Linux for work/sc",

So far I&#39;ve been enjoying Bazzite (Plasma) and am considering switching over to it full time from Windows, but I have a major problem preventing me.</p> <p>If I&#39;m playing a game and adjust my volume level, all audio will cut out; game, desktop, everything. Doesn&#39;t matter if I use the fn key on the laptop or the volume knob on my external keyboard. Happens in both Steam games and Lutris installed ones. It seems random how many times I adjust the volume when it cuts out, but it seems anywhere from upwards of 5 button presses.</p> <p>I found a temporary, but annoying bandaid fix: if I go into the audio settings and switch from &#39;Play HiFi quality music&#39; to &#39;Pro Audio&#39; and back again, audio comes back. If I exit the game entirely, audio also comes back, including a blip sound effect from when I had been adjusting volume.</p> <p>edit: Just tried my USB sound card with headphones to see if the issue popped",

I feel like i&#39;ve tried everything, raw mouse input, vsync off, -vulkan flag, using the linux runtimes in the compatibility section. and it all either doesnt work or the compatibilities make my game shit the bed HARD to where it litteraly robs me of my cursor and forcing me to switch to a different tty to find the pid and kill it. But this is the best part ! Proton works absolutely flawlessly, so much better than the native linux builds, an absolute dream. BUT valve doesnt let VAC work in proton so i cant play multiplayer. I have also had this issue on other computers aswell running fedora. Im so over this it makes it geniunely unplayable. If i left any other crucial details out let me know. at the very least ",
