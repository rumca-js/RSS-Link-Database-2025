        "description": "Born in France to Tunisian parents, 4Mrok is an emerging voice in the fusion of poetry, music, and visual art. His latest music video, \u201cBleu Ciel\u201d (*Blue Sky*), taken from his second EP *\u201cEntre Joie et Peine\u201d* (*Between Joy and Pain*), blends deep emotion with social consciousness. The project, part of a larger artistic journey titled *\u201c\u00c9tranger\u201d* (*Stranger*), reflects 4Mrok\u2019s dual identity \u2014 *from France, made in Tunisia* \u2014 and his belief in the enduring power of humanity.\n\n\u201cBleu Ciel\u201d was inspired by the suffering of the Palestinian people and created using AI-assisted visual storytelling, combining technological innovation with artistic sensitivity. Through evocative imagery, Gringo\u2019s direction, and Ra3D\u2019s atmospheric sound design, the video becomes more than music \u2014 it is a call for empathy, unity, and hope, reminding viewers that even in dark times, the blue sky of humanity still endures.",
