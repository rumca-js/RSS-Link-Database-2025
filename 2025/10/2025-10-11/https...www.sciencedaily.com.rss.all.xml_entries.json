The amber, found in the Holl\u00edn Formation, preserved a diverse range of insect species and plant material, revealing a humid, resin-rich forest teeming with life.",

The art likely marked territories and migration routes, revealing social and symbolic sophistication. Artifacts found nearby show early Arabian peoples connected to distant Neolithic communities.",
