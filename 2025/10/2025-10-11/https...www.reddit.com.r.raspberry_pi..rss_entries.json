As I obviously don&#39;t need a permanent monitor once its setup, I was thinking to use a KVM switch so I can just toggle between my gaming machine and the Pi. I tried to set it up today and I could not get the Pi to recognize the monitor. Eventually will be running 2 monitors but I only have 1 hooked up now as that&#39;s all I had cables for. Has anyone set theirs up like this before and have any tricks? I tried different cables, even connected directly to the monitor to make sure I didn&#39;t fry the pi&#39;s micro hdmi ports. Is this even possible or should I just suck it up and upgrade to a 5 or 500+?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Comm_Pic\"> /u/Comm_Pic </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1o3r0yf/anyone_got_a_pi_4_setup_on_a_kvm_switch/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry",
