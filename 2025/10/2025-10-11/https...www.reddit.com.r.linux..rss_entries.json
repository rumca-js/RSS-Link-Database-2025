The reason for this choice is that I do alot of emulation and it makes sense to have a distro that supports this out of the box, plus they now have a built-in desktop for it. With that being said, I wanted to know if there&#39;s anything I should prepare beforehand such as files or any useful tidbits of information before I make the switch. I&quot;ll probably run it off a usb stick as a trial just in case there&#39;s any catastrophic issues and if all&#39;s well I&#39;ll run it off my ssd.</p> <p>Anyway, is there anything I should consider before switching over?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Windows 11 looks pretty good. Dark mode. Windows updates aren&#39;t actually annoying? For me rarely happens. Maybe because I tinkered the settings around a bit, ( completely forgot what I did ), to do it at night when im not using it. My windows command prompt had a cool wallpaper image background with transparency. And also it as cool color coat. Not just black and white because I use wsl which auto changes font. Windows also is a bit confused, I personalyl think everybody switched like during windows 10 and never tryed out windows 11. The ADS are sometimes on office or browser when you sign into your microsoft account. But other then that. No such thing as ADS, at least traditional ads, like you are not watching a video or something, or a random pop up on your screen, unless you are on your browser or office or some other microsoft application. The command prompt actually had all the basic linux commands because when I downloaded git, it added it. ",
