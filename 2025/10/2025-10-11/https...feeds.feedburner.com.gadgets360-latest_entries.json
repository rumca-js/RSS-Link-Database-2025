        "description": "The iPhone Air is an incredible entry into the new iPhone line-up, featuring a featherweight design that packs a punch. The design is solid and you can trust the strength, while the display is stunning with a 120Hz refresh rate. The performance is Pro-grade with an A19 Pro chip under the hood, offering a truly breezy experience. The single camera sensor is capable, though it leaves much to be desired. The battery can last up to a day, but you can buy the iPhone Air MagSafe Battery to extend its life. At Rs. 119,900, the iPhone Air is a solid entry in the premium smartphone category.",
