        "description": "Let\u2019s uncover the secrets of the NATO phonetic alphabet! \ud83c\udf0f And you can get an exclusive NordVPN deal + 4 months extra here \u2192 https://nordvpn.com/robwordsvpn It\u2019s risk-free with Nord\u2019s 30-day money-back guarantee! \u270c\ufe0f\n\nThe NATO phonetic alphabet is not a phonetic alphabet and wasn't invented by NATO. However, it has a fascinating story to tell. It is the result of years of linguistic experimentation in the wake of the violence of World War II. So let's explore its development, from ALFA to ZULU.\n\nIn this episode, we'll uncover the surprising story of how this alphabet \u2013 used by everyone from pilots to police officers \u2013 came to be. And look at the strange words that almost made the cut.\n\nThank you very much to Derby Aero Club at Derby Airfield for kindly allowing us to film.
