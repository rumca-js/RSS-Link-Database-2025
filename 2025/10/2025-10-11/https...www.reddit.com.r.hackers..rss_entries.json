        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Back in 2022 my phone was stolen. They somehow guessed my phone password and changed my recovery email to my icloud to some outlook account that isn&#39;t mine that I don&#39;t know the password to. And obviously my sim card with my phone number on it was in the phone when it was stolen. So ever since then l&#39;ve been locked out of my icloud and all my social media accounts because they changed the recovery email on everything. What do I do? How can I hack back in either to the recovery outlook email or my own icloud? Or any of my social medias? Would anyone be willing to help me please like tell me what to do or something </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/babienut\"> /u/babienut </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1o3ztjf/i_have_a_situation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1o3ztjf/i_have_a_situation/\">[comments]</a>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Sometimes I go to log in to my banking app and I type in my credentials and i push enter and it takes me right back to the log in screen, like if its asking me to log in twice in a row. Sometimes it does that to me like 3-4 times in a row. Im beginning to think that each time it asks me to login is a different person that has my phone cloned or has access to my screen somehow. And when im looking at certain websites I will get a notification about a message in a group chat or a notification saying Discord Needs to Download Additional Files or something to that effect. Only when im looking at those websites Anyone else experience this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cold_Air_6304\"> /u/Cold_Air_6304 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1o3y5qb/apps_asking_me_to_login_twice_especially_my/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments",
