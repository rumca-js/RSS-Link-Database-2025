        "description": "After the US-East-1 Amazon Cloud Hub mega crash... a major portion of the internet was rendered temporarily disabled, in one of the largest outages ever recorded. \n\nThe mistake (and subsequent down time as a result of lackluster precautions) illustrate just how fragile the online world has become, where a few large companies now control a disproportionate amount of traffic and hosting, to a degree where even basic daily necessities can be rendered useless by a single oversight. \n\nHyper consolidation creates single points of failure in a system where failure, is extremely dangerous. \n\n\n\nWant a VPN???
