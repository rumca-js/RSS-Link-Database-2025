Admittedly, this confusion may be because I don&#39;t know how forwarding actually works, a fact the criminal is readily taking advantage of. As you can see <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/0HHJ5oN\">here</a>, the sender line looks completely legitimate while the &quot;recipient&quot; is funky looking. Is this an uncomplicated abuse of the way forwarded emails are notated or is it more complex?

My experience on EPS tools is vast and I have handled multiple tools such as Crowdstrike, SentinelOne, Symantec, EDR, XDR, Trend Micro, Carbon Black and integrating them SIEM solutions such as Splunk and SOAR. I also have experience in Data Protection tools such as Titus and Vera. Recently I have ventured into Security Assessment Frameworks with DET and OET testings. Is there any open positions that someone can refer me with the above experience. Kindly do let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Karthik_58\"> /u/Karthik_58 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1oduxym/open_positions_in_endpoint_security/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1oduxym/open_positions_in_endpoint_security/\">[comments]</a></span>",
