        "description": "LinkedIn used to be for professionals. Now it\u2019s where CEOs write diary entries that sound like failed TED Talks. One\u2019s watering grass for engagement, another\u2019s charging employees for snacks, and one startup holds silent dinners because \u201cfun is a distraction.\u201d\n\nOh, and a CEO literally got fired for helicoptering at a company party. Yeah\u2014this is the professional platform.\n\nIt\u2019s Facebook for executives who think metaphors are leadership.
