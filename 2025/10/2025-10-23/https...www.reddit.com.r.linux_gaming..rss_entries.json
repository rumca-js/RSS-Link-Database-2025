One of the features I really enjoyed was the remote play so that I could play my games from my work laptop during lunch or the steam deck while docked on the living room tv. In july I built a new desktop, but decided to go for linux since the steam deck showed me that all the games I want to play are able to be properly run in a linux system.</p> <p>I&#39;ve installed <code>EndevourOS</code> and it has been a really good experience so far. I&#39;ve installed <code>steam</code> through <code>pacman</code> and all the games I wanna play run perfectly with no issues. I didn&#39;t customize the system and only installed a handfull of programs that I like with a couple of programming languages, so it&#39;s pretty much still the default <code>EndevourOS</code>. The only problem I had is that when I tried remote play it didn&#39;t work proper",
