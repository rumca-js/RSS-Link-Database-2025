        "description": "Between the drip-fed live service content and no new updates on a confirmed new entry, Halo fans are wondering what\u2019s next. Many have played all the entries included in the Master Chief Collection multiple times over, and Halo Infinite just isn\u2019t the cup of tea everyone wanted. \n\nThat leaves a bit of a gap: Halo 5. Halo 5 remains the only game in the series that isn't on the PC. It\u2019s not on the MC Collection and is stuck within the Xbox ecosystem. \n\nIt will be 10 years old soon, but its multiplayer is active and still holds up to this day. The campaign on the other hand, may be best played with a partner, or skipped altogether. Still, I can\u2019t help but want a Halo 5 remaster for PC. It would certainly help tide whatever is coming on the horizon for the series.",

        "description": "Bloodlines 2 is a mess, plain and simple, which I couldn't really recommend to anyone, especially at its asking price. Even if you\u2019re a fan of the genre, it\u2019s best to wait for a discount on this one, though even that\u2019s a hard recommendation to make.\n\nBloodlines 2 teases a world full of mysteries, but never delivers the tension or satisfaction needed to make uncovering them feel rewarding.",

        "description": "The Outer Worlds 2 is a landmark achievement and It takes everything from many of the hallmarks of other games in the genre, and improves virtually everything across the board. \n\nThough some improvements are more incremental, but things like the Flaws system and the expansive dialogue options, as well as the much improved gunplay, feel like major steps forward. Arcadia features some beautiful, open landscapes and some of the funniest, most interesting characters we\u2019ve seen in some time, and the combat and exploration are some of the best in the genre. \n\nIt\u2019s among the best western RPGs in the past few years and firmly places the franchise as one of the best in the business.",
