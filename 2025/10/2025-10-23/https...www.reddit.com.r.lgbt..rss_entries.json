My lesbian older sister had opened up her marriage about a year ago and has been loving it. I was excited to open up to her about my new experience. Essentially, I was seeing a man (30, bi) who introduced me to another woman he was seeing (24, also bi) and we all hit it off extremely well. Absolutely incredible conversational and sexual chemistry among the three of us. When I told her about this, she was being very cold and distant. I was a little hurt by this and told her that we\u2019re on the same team now (by both being queer and polyam) and she was very offended by my remark. She basically said that we live two completely different lifestyles and she didn\u2019t approve of the man \u2018picking\u2019 the women out in this relationship. I assured her that it was all very mutual and although I respect her concern for the gendered power-dynamics, that the man\u2019s ple",

I didn\u2019t have friends or role models then, so I\u2019d often observe them and try to learn how to have their lifestyle and style by speaking and acting like them.</p> <p>Looking back, I remember that my interactions with them were often awkward, and I sometimes caught myself staring at them. I recently had this realization that maybe that could have been a kind of attraction and now I\u2019m wondering if that means I might be gay.</p> <p>I\u2019ve never imagined doing anything sexual with guys, and I\u2019ve always been interested in girls.
