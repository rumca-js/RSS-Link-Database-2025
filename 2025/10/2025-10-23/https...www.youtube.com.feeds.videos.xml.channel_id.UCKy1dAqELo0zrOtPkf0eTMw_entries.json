        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\n\nAccording a report from Bloomberg, Xbox's recent layoffs and game cancellations were due to a lofty profit margin goal set by Microsoft. Currently, the gaming industry standard is around 17%-22% profit margins, but Microsoft has allegedly pushed Xbox into hitting a high 30% profit margin. The goal was apparently set around the time Xbox was completing its acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023. In other news, Borderlands 4 is off to a great start for Gearbox and publisher 2K Games. The game is reportedly outpacing Borderlands 3 in terms of dollar sales in its first month of release (it's worth noting that Borderlands 4's different editions are more expensive than Borderlands 3's). Borderlands 4 also debuted as the number one premium title for September. And finally, Elden Ring's Switch 2 port has been delayed. The Tarnished Edition, which includes the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, has been pushed to sometime in 2026.\n\n#Xbox #Gaming #IGN",

The sluggish first act and lack of enemy variety make it a bit of a slog at certain times, but once its story of political intrigue kicks in and the new flaws and perks system gets its claws in you, it can be quite hard to put down. All these improvements put The Outer Worlds 2 that much closer to being the Fallout: New Vegas successor we hoped this series would be, and that\u2019s worth getting excited about.",

        "description": "Spoilers follow for Gen V Season 2!\n\nAfter a wild eight episodes, Gen V Season 2 wrapped up its run with a game-changing hour that certainly puts a third season in doubt. Don\u2019t worry, Godolkin U fans: There\u2019s hope for more, which we\u2019ll get into in a moment, as well as the whole future of The Boys universe and how this ties into the Prime Video franchise, directly setting up the final season of The Boys\u2026 and maybe, just maybe, Homelander\u2019s fate as well.\n\nThe episode is mostly taken up with Thomas Godolkin (Ethan Slater) going a little nuts in order to cull the lower-tier Supes from the Godolkin U campus and power himself up enough to be able to puppet Homelander (Antony Starr). Of course, Marie Moreau (Jaz Sinclair), Emma (Lizze Broadway), and the rest of our Gen V faves aren\u2019t about to let Goldolkin kill their classmates\u2026 leading to a battle royale that will determine the direction of The Boys universe from here on out.\n\nWatch the video for a full breakdown of the Gen V finale, \u201cTroja",

        "description": "Once Upon A Katamari reviewed by Charlie Wacholz on PC, also available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 1 & 2.\n\nI couldn\u2019t stop smiling as each melon, shoe, playing card, traffic cone, and house satisfyingly snapped into place on my whirling clump of stuff as I rolled across time and space. The only time Once Upon A Katamari broke my delirious grin was when it tickled my ears with riffs so funky the bassist practically reached through my TV\u2019s speakers and slapped a stank face out of me (and that\u2019s meant as a compliment). This appropriately ostentatious, energetic return is the best the Katamari series has been since the PlayStation 2 era. With cleverly implemented tweaks to the ever-satisfying gauntlet of rolling delights, a stellar soundtrack, and offbeat charm in spades, there will always be room on my hard drive for Once Upon A Katamari.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
