I prefer good writing over plot and subtle magic and story over crazy powers and world ending dangers</p> <p>For reference what I like: </p> <ul> <li><p>the Kingkiller Chronicle are my absolute favorite books and nothing ever came close writing and story wise for me. I reread it countless times. This also ruined a lot of fantasy books for me I&#39;m afraid.</p></li> <li><p>Assassin&#39;s apprentice by Robin Hobbs. Beautifully written, untropey and realistic in the right spots. </p></li> <li><p>Brandon Sanderson books: I read the storm light archive and mistborn.

I am from a developing country that is very far from modern western ideals of democracy, freedom, tolerance and all these fancy things. Also, some trigger warnings. I will be mentioning rape, sexism, racism, etc. present in fantasy.</p> <p>While browsing through reddit, I&#39;ve found many posts where people complain that fantasy novels contain too much offensive things like oppression, sexism, racism, homophobia, all kinds of violence, etc. Also, people seem to view mass murder, war crimes, destruction, all types of ends of the world as something mild compared to rape, child abuse and some other things.</p> <p>It makes no sense on the first glance, but it is understandable, I think. I feel it comes from our everyday experience. Average person doesn&#39;t live through genocide, mass murder, destructions, but lives through pain, misfortune, sometimes criminal assault, verbal and physical abuse.",

I don&#39;t mean to disparage the writer (from my proverbial mom&#39;s basement) but compared to top tier fantasy books (in my opinion) I&#39;ve previously read like Joe Abercrombie, Robin Hobb, Sanderson and Robert Jordan it&#39;s not even close to the same level of sophisticated storytelling. Like I had issues with Robert Jordan&#39;s writing style at times but the world building, character development and lore has kept me coming back to the WOT many times. So I&#39;m hoping that as this series continues I can get a deeper appreciation for it but based on the first book, I&#39;m not hopeful.</p> <p>SPOILERS FOR BOOK 1 BELOW</p> <p>",

I really loved the second and third books but I cannot understand why did Caduan, Nura and Zeryth all developed black veins and turned crazy due to accessing deep levels of magic resulting in their deaths, but Tisaanah and Max did not. I know most likely it is because they are the FMC and MMC, but T and M wielded the Lejara\u2019s multiple times, caused severe destruction, constantly accessed their deep levels of magic and .. nothing? While everyone else that accessed that magic lost their sanity and developed spiderwebbed marks on their skin and around their eyes? </p> <p>Anyways, I don\u2019t know if there is something I missed for this to make sense. I just needed to vent. I was really hoping that Caduan and Aefe would also have their happily ever after but at least it was a very poetic ending for them \ud83d\ude2d</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",
