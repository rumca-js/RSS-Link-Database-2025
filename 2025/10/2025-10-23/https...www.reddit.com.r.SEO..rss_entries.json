Our franchisor&#39;s ad agency first tried P-Max on Google, which also had poor performance. They are now aggressively pushing everyone to move to Facebook/Meta advertising instead, since Google is so expensive now to compete on. The Meta results have been horrid. Most people won&#39;t answer/respond, and if they do, they have no recollection of even inquiring about our services. We&#39;ve turned on SMS confirmations, which has helped weed some of those out. We are a B2B services business, and I don&#39;t think that non-intent-based advertising works for us. The agency swears that meta is the best option.
