Tried On the Edge of Gone, The Dinosaur Lords, and the first Pern book, and none of them clicked. My first thought was to pick books simply based on those who have lots of good ratings. Most of the ones I\u2019ve found have movie adaptations I\u2019ve already seen. I could start the mistborn series, that\u2019s been on my radar but idk. I worry the same thing will happen when I spend $30 on it, read the first few pages, then lose interest and waste my money. If this helps, my favorite series was Eragon, and my favorite media franchise period was Godzilla. No, I am not reading the movie novelizations in that series.
