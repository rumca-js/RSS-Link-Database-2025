But then, we aren\u2019t heading to the usual hot, heady holiday destinations of Spain or the south of France, but boarding a train to north-east Europe. For me, it will be a journey of more than 1,000 miles \u2013 via Amsterdam, Berlin and Warsaw to Vilnius \u2013 visiting some of the coolest capitals in the north. At least in terms of temperature.</p><p>As England sweltered this summer, and Spain reached a hellish 46C, it made sense to head away from the heat on what is now fashionably being called a \u201ccoolcation\u201d.
