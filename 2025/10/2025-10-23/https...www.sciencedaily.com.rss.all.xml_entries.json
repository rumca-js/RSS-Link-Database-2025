The treated animals showed better memory and healthier brain structures. The cells seemed to protect the brain indirectly, possibly through anti-aging signals in the blood. The findings suggest a new, personalized path to slowing brain aging.",

The findings challenge BMI as a reliable indicator of health and suggest new imaging-based approaches to assessing cardiovascular risk.",
