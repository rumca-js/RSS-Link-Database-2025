I was thinking to buy a Barebone Minisforum N5 Pro and buy myself an all-in-one NAS + server. It has a nice CPU to also self-host some LLM, the small ones. </p> <p>I have the opportunity from my job to buy some old hardware that they are going to throw away. This is a Zbook G8 Mobile Workstation with a i7 - 11850 H inside and 32 GB of ram.</p> <p>It&#39;s not that bad as a day to day laptop, I&#39;m also a software engineer. With this choice, I was thinking also to go for the laptop which would be between 100-150 \u20ac and a UGreen NASync DXP4800 Plus (maybe add more ram in the future).</p> <p>Of course this laptop is from 2021 (?) and also doesn&#39;t have a GPU, but only the integrated one. The purpose of the server would be to host some JellyFin, Immich and Personal dev docker containers. I guess I&#39;d just go and install a debian or ubuntu in there just for the sake of it anyway.<",

I&#39;ve started using the step-by-step guides on the Marius Hosting website for a couple installs this month. I&#39;ve noticed that Marius&#39; instructions always recommend creating a folder at <strong>Docker &gt; [APP NAME] &gt; data</strong>, and storing all the content for that app in that <strong>data</strong> folder. For some apps, this makes sense. But for others, like Booklore or Audiobookshelf, it doesn&#39;t. If I were using a folder located somewhere in the <strong>home</strong> folder, I would be able to add new content by just uploading it in the Synology Drive client, of by mounting the NAS as a network share in Finder. But the <strong>docker</strong> folder just doesn&#39;t show up in Finder or the Synology Drive sync client. So instead, I need to drop new ebooks into a fold",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi gang, I&#39;ve been looking to get into selfhosting for the last two years and have finally dug into it. I&#39;ve set up a little homelab, spun up some services on docker, and am using tailscale to connect to my server from anywhere, no problem! Was a lovely first success, but now I&#39;m hoping to share some of these services with friends and family. Looking into it, I&#39;ve been meaning to get a domain for email anyways, and hosting a website, so I picked up my lastname .com from cloudflare. Pointed that at my nginx proxy manager, and pointed my proxy manager at my services. Except- the ip address I&#39;m pointing it at is of course the ip address of my whole house, not just my homelab server. Is the only way to resolve this buying a static ip address from my ISP for 5$ or more a month? Not sure how everyone else hosts their services on the open internet.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dang",
