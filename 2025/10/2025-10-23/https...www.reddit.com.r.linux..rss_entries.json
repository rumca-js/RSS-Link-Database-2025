My laptop is quite old and has Intel Core I7 7XXX something. I have been thinking of getting a new PC build and I wanted to ask how is Intel&#39;s support for Linux?</p> <p>This might sound stupid as my current CPU is already Intel. But since my CPU is quite old so this might not be accurate for newer CPU models.</p> <p>I was thinking to get AMD as it has more open-source (or i guess so) drivers. But looking at benchmarks at Build Cores, Intel seemed more suitable for my personal usage. So will newer Intel models like Core Ultra cause any problems on Linux? Or will it be as smooth as it is now for my old CPU?</p> <p>note: ik this kinda looks like a low effort post but it is 1 AM here lowk...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mustafa_Shazlie\"> /u/Mustafa_Shazlie </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

I had issues with Windows 10 and its slow processing power on my then 8 year old machine. It was an i7 3rd Gen I think it was... and Windows 10 was slower than molasses on it. It ran Windows 7 like a dream! I couldn&#39;t use it with Windows 10, so I switched to Linux full time on that day. I&#39;ve been using Linux full time since 2018. </p> <p>I went with Linux Mint because I liked the way it looked (very much like Windows 7 which I loved BTW). So, I used Linux Mint (18.3 to 19.3) for about 18 months and living in the terminal about 50% of the time doing updates with it and editing files with vim and what not, I decided I&#39;d give Arch and a Tiling Window Manager (TWM) a go. In February of 2020 I started using Arch Linux and have been using it ever since. I tried a few TWMs within about a 3 month period. At one point I had i3, qtile, AwesomeWM and xmonad all on my PC",

I want to share a two-month-long, insanity-inducing debugging session - part cautionary tale, part comedy - so you can have a quick laugh and hopefully avoid making the same mistakes I did.</p> <p>For the past couple of months, I\u2019ve been maintaining and experimenting with DebDroid, a project I built to repurpose older Android devices into portable desktops and lightweight home servers.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that, unlike Termux, DebDroid runs a near-native Linux userland based on glibc, not a minimal runtime. This means it behaves much more like a standard Linux system, but it also encounters more frequent compatibility issues with the Android host. You can think of it as LXC for Android, or like a version of Kali NetHunter adapted for general-purpose use.</p> <p>My original goal for DebDroid was to get <code>sshd</code> (the OpenSSH server) and <code>gpg</code> working reliably, since both tend to run into issues in a plain, manually-m",
