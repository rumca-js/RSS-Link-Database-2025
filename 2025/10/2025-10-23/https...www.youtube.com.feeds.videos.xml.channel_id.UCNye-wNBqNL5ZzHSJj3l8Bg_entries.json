        "description": "After months of blockade and starvation in Gaza, Israel allowed a new United States venture - the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) - to distribute food. Branded as a lifeline, its sites quickly became known by Palestinians and dozens of human rights groups as \u201cdeath traps\u201d.\n\nFault Lines investigates how civilians seeking aid were funnelled through militarised zones, where thousands were killed or injured under fire.\n\nThrough the testimonies of grieving families, a former contractor, and human rights experts, the film exposes how GHF\u2019s operations replaced UNRWA\u2019s proven aid system with a scheme critics say was designed for displacement, not relief. At the heart of this investigation is a haunting question: was GHF delivering humanitarian aid - or helping turn breadlines into killing fields?\n\nCREDITS\n\nGaza:\nDirectors of Photography: \nHussien Jaber \nBilal Salem\n\nProduction manager: Hasan Mashharawi\nProducer: Ashraf Mashharawi\nProduction services: Media Town\n\nUS & UK: \nDirector and Prod",
