        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>\u200bI had a discussion about the risks of using public Wi-Fi. My point is that standard threats like basic Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and sniffing unencrypted traffic are mostly neutralized by updated browsers, OS patches, and ubiquitous HTTPS usage. \u200bMy two main questions are:</p> <p>1)\u200bIf a user uses these security measures (updated everything, HTTPS), is the only unknown and potentially successful attack vector left a zero-day vulnerability in the OS or browser? Or are there still simpler, non-zero-day methods for a hacker on the same public network to compromise a fully patched and HTTPS-protected device?</p> <p>2)\u200bIs a VPN truly essential for security on public Wi-Fi, or is its necessity overstated by vendors? Since most of my traffic is already secured by HTTPS (TLS), what specific, high-priority, non-zero-day threat does a VPN actually defend against in this scenario?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

I am trying the room &quot;Blue&quot;, which uses the EternalBlue (ms17_010) exploit and a reverce_tcp payload. I can use the exploit and payload, get nt authority/SYSTEM access to the target and even upgrade the shell to meterpreter.</p> <p>However, when trying to migrate to another process, as instructed in the room, I can&#39;t do it. I always get the same error: core_migrate: Operation failed: 1300. I have tried different processes, restarted my VM, my computer, terminated and initiated the target and it simply won&#39;t work. Have any of you been through this? Any idea on how to solve it? Thanks.</p> <p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/w4i1b8219vwf1.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=717f65b0ed0fb4f74b100657169e3c1e7595c257\">https://preview.redd.it/w4i1b8219vwf1.png?width=407&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=717f65b0ed0fb4f74b100657169e3c1e7595c257</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",
