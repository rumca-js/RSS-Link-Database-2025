In August 1889, a worn-down pitcher for the Pittsburgh Alleghenys named James Francis \u201cPud\u201d Galvin, so nicknamed for his once-devastating ability to reduce hitters to \u201cpudding\u201d, was in need of a spark. He was 32, his right arm a rubbery relic <a href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/IP_career.shtml\">of nearly 5,000 innings pitched</a>, his career on the fade. Then came salvation in a syringe.

We assess their chances of turning things around</p><p>The Ravens\u2019 season is on the brink. Coming out of a bye week, Baltimore are 1-5 after a miserable start partly because their roster has been ripped apart by injuries. Next up are the Chicago Bears, who have come into some form. Beat the Bears, and the Ravens <em>could</em> turn the year around<em>.</em> If they lose, and they fall to 1\u20136, their season is effectively over, a huge disappointment for a team with genuine Super Bowl aspirations a few months ago. Below, we look at the factors that have hurt the Ravens \u2013 and the chances of those factors changing for the better.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/23/the-ravens-doomsday-clock-inches-towards-midnight-will-their-season-survive\">Continue reading...</a>",
