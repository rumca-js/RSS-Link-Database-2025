The new Baseus Picogo AM31 is a standout for so many reasons, not least of which is its absolutely tiny size\u2014and right now <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5B4GQFP/\">it\u2019s on sale for just $35.99 on Amazon</a>. That\u2019s a hefty 28% discount off its usual $49.99 price and the first time it\u2019s ever dropped this low!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I say this power bank is tiny, I\u2019m not joking. It\u2019s literally smaller than a credit card, measuring just 3.4 x 2.3 x 0.5 inches and weighing just 0.3 pounds. But it\u2019s not like it\u2019s tiny at the expense of everything else. This Baseus Picogo is magnetic and compatible with any MagSafe phone or case, plus it\u2019s Qi2 certified for up to 15W of wireless charging. It also has a USB-C port on the side that provides up to 20W of faster charging.",
