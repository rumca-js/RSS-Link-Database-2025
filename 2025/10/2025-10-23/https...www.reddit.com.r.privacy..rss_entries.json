Part of my digital minimalism lifestyle was switching to a Nokia 2780 and carrying my smart phone separately....I&#39;d sim swap occasionally but usually just hotspot from the Nokia for any smart phone needed things. Now, privacy has taken a higher priority, so I&#39;ve been pressing for my contacts to use Signal and probably 80% of my conversations and 95% of the important ones happen through Signal.</p> <p>My nokia 2780 can&#39;t run Signal. SMS is insecure. Basic browser that can&#39;t run extensions.</p> <p>Is there any middle ground, or should I just continue using a locked down smartphone?</p> <p>Curious if anyone else has crossed both of these worlds before.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GeoSabreX\"> /u/GeoSabreX </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1oehz5l/privacy_dumb_phone/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",

I ran into an issue where right after I hit &quot;verify email&quot; to get a link and create the addy account, my ProtonMail got restricted and sent a system email &quot;Your Proton account is currently restricted from registering on third-party services&quot;. My only options given to lift this are upgrading the account (can&#39;t without privacy) or adding a recovery email or phone number (removes anonymity of the account). I&#39;m thinking of using a personally identifying email with Privacy since I&#39;d already be trusting them with my legal name (on my credit card) and this would solve all my issues, but I don&#39;t really want to do this. Any advice/ideas? Thanks.</p> </div",
