From the delicate arc of her braided hair in motion, to the painstaking textures of battered iron and bloodied blades, each element has been sculpted, refined, and painted with the same obsessive attention to detail that has come to define our craft.\n\nA hero of the Mortal Realms rendered in full 1:6 scale, Neave Blacktalon, The God-King\u2019s Assassin is a divine example of crafting myth into matter, and fury into form. \n\nPre-order now: https://wetanz.com/neave-blacktalon\n\nFind out more and see all today's Warhammer Day 2025 news at Warhammer Community: https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/art",
