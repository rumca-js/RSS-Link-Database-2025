The standard JavaScript/TypeScript error-handling mechanism \u2014 <code>try/catch</code> \u2014 lacks type safety and makes it difficult to track which parts of the code may throw errors. To solve this issue, a common approach is to use <strong>Result types</strong> for error handling. A Result type explicitly represents both a success value and a failure error.</p> <p>When it comes to Result type libraries in TypeScript, <a href=\"https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow\">neverthrow</a> is the most well-known and widely used option. Recently, more comprehensive ecosystems such as <a href=\"https://effect.website/\">Effect</a> have emerged, but if you only need to handle Result types, these can feel like overkill.</p> <p>In this article, I\u2019ll discuss the limitations I encountered while using <code>neverthrow</code>, how t",
