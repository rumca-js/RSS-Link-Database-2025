But otherwise I&#39;m looking at playing on my flat screen. </p> <p>If I play on my modern TV what&#39;s the most cost effective way to get decent video without lag?

I am terribly technologically illiterate. I am 34 years old and grew up without consoles or a PC at home- so, old enough to recall longingly gazing at shrink-wrapped copies of Phantasmagoria. As an adult, I&#39;ve become interested in playing this game and others like it. I have a modern laptop that is not terribly powerful that I use for school. Could I somehow use this to play these games? Do I have to have a PC? Is there an approachable guide that I haven&#39;t been able to find? Thank you in advance for any help. </p> </div><!",

But now? I\u2019m just chilling, soaking in every single note of these OSTs. It\u2019s been such a wild ride rediscovering these games and really appreciating the incredible work that went into the music.
