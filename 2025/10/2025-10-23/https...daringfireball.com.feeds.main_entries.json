As more tech companies began building\nA.I. chatbots to keep up, they needed large amounts of data to\ntrain their A.I. models\u2009\u2014\u2009data that SerpApi had already gathered.</p>\n\n<p>Practically overnight, a class of companies like SerpApi\u2009\u2014\u2009known\nas \u201cdata scrapers\u201d\u2009\u2014\u2009found a new business selling data scraped\nfrom Google to companies looking to train their A.I. chatbots.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the internet message board Reddit decided to fight\nthe data scrapers.
