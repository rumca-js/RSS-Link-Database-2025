I&#39;ve never had any raspberry pi but after researching about it, it seems there&#39;s a case called &quot;Argon Eon NAS&quot; where I can install a raspberry pi 5 and also two hard drives 3,5&quot;. That&#39;s amazing and it is exactly what I want.</p> <p>The drawback is that it is quite expensive to me, around 180\u20ac for the case plus 90\u20ac for the raspberry 5 + the hard drives.</p> <p>I was wondering if you would have any other idea to get something similar or if that option is actually worth it.</p> <p>Notice what I would like to do is having a device with internal 3,5&quot; hard drives, 2 is fine to me, and also I&#39;d love having an operative system such as libreelec where I can have cover art. It&#39;d be a great plus if I could also play things in 4k and even having an output for CRT TV in case I want to watch 4/3 old content. </p> <p>Many thanks for your f",
