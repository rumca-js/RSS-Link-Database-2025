For a while, you\u2019re living in two worlds. And then because we\u2019re human comes the urge to find someone to tell and share that joy with. </p> <p>When this happens with a TV show, there are often people around you, or huge communities online, that you can chat to about it and generally vent your obsession to. </p> <p>But there are so many more books in this world, not to mention they\u2019ve been produced for a hell of a lot longer - and the nature of reading means you might just be getting into a series published 20 years ago that nobody else is chatting about much anymore. And while it\u2019s easy to find companionship to obsess over something like ACOTAR or Fourth Wing, when it\u2019s a lesser-known property, obsession can be a lonely place. </p> <p>You just want to shout OMG THIS IS SO ",
