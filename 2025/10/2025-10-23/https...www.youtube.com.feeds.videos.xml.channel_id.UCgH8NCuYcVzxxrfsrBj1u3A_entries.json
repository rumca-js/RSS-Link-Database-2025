        "description": "I've come home for one night from being on tour with The Darkness and I wanted to talk about Ace Frehley, whose death was announced last week. We had a misunderstanding last year. At the time it was described as a 'feud'  (much like the recent coverage of my opinions regarding Yungblud).  It wasn't that and we talked about it. I still have regrets though. \nThe full Rock News Desk report can be found here: https://youtu.be/-UyccVYAMTI?si=eoj07owGE_wE3181\n\nTo see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK in January and February, find details here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nTo see The Darkness on tour in Europe and the USA: https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/\n\nMy Patreon is here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nThe latest Darkness album \"Dreams On Toast\" is here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvic",
