I have a built a simple tool which makes docker containers to get attached to whatever custom bridge network you create. Not limited to docker bridge network. So, now you can make your docker containers talk with LXC containers, VM&#39;s in other bridges. Not limited to docker network(docker - docker communication)</p> <p>It uses linux networking(veth, namespace, bridge). It&#39;s like a wrapper. Soon, Im planning to bring in IP allocator to do the DHCP&#39;s work. What do you guys think.. Is it an useful tool?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Historical-Trip7378\"> /u/Historical-Trip7378 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1odp664/attach_docker_containers_to_custom_bridges/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1odp664",
