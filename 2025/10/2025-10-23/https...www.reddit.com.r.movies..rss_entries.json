The movie\u2019s message was super meaningful and the sunglasses gimmick worked. I liked the secondary lead and even though I guessed the woman would be an antagonist, her heel turn was still entertaining. I also loved the movie\u2019s style and I especially loved how all of the advertisements looked when Nada looks through the glasses. What do you think of They Live?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Creative_Eye7413\"> /u/Creative_Eye7413 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1odpr2k/i_watched_they_live_for_the_first_time_and_loved/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1odpr2k/i_watched_they_live_for_the_first_time_and_loved/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;m on the third, and the cast of supporting characters is amazing. </p> <p>Jeff Goldblum has his first movie role in Death Wish from 1974 as a gang member who is involved with a rape/murder that sets up the whole premise of the series. Death Wish II (1982) has Laurence Fishburne, also a street gang member. Death Wish 3 (1985) has Marina Sirtis (Counselor Troi from Star Trek: TNG) playing a scared wife/rape victim of a good guy in a bad neighborhood, and Alex Winter (Bill, from Bill &amp; Ted) plays a street gang member. </p> <p>As far as I know, these were always B-movie grade releases, but it&#39;s fun to see actors I recognize from higher level productions in movies like this. I still have 4 and 5 to go, so who knows what I&#39;ll find next. </p> <p>Are there other examples of movies like this that set up young actors for better future roles?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",
