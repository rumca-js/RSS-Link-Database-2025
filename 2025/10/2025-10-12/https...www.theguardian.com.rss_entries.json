Like Alabama\u2019s 13 other prisons, Easterling largely prohibits media access, but allowed the documentarians to film its annual volunteer-run barbecue, a sunny day in which incarcerated men, most of them Black, ate fresh roasts to live music and sermons. On camera, men danced and smiled. But off camera, many more told a different story \u2013 horrific beatings, unreported stabbings, unimaginable violence swept under the rug and appalling conditions that \u201cain\u2019t fit for human society\u201d. Cries for help emerged from inside the sweltering, filthy dorms. When Jarecki approached the voices, a prison official shut down filming, claiming that it was unsafe for him to speak to the men without a police chaperone.</p><p>\u201cIt was very clear that",

Her signature look was shirts and ties, snappy waistcoats and baggy trousers, an idiosyncratic version of menswear that was somehow both elegant and goofy. It was part Beau Brummell and part Charlie Chaplin. \u201cBorrowed from the boys\u201d does not do it justice; she made it entirely her own.</p><p>The charm of her wardrobe was that it was exactly her. She was a world-class beauty who didn\u2019t lead with her looks. A quiet subversive who, in the most cookie-cutter of Hollywood eras, dodged the stamp of the machine and chose to live her life her own way. It was never about menswear as power dressing. With a sunny smile, she broke all the rules of celebrity dressing with the disarming sweetness and quiet intelligence that she brought to her screen personas.</p> <a href=\"",
