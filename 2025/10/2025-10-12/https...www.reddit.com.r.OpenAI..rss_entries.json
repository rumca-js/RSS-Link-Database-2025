I created a customGPT that summaries important mails every hour and gives a summary of my calendar once a day amongst other things. I understand that I need to put some code into Actions (under customize tab) for this CustomGPT to work.</p> <p>Our Enterprise mail system is Outlook Mail. I can see the connectors in overall settings, but if I want CustomGPTs to chk my mail, apparently I need to put some code into actions. Has anyone accomplished something similar with ChatGPT Enterprise version. </p> <p>I am able to just write a simple a query in chatgpt and use my connectors but not so easy with CustomGPT. I would really appreciate if you all could direct me towards any reading material on how to do this or suggest ways. Please do know that I am a newbie to tech.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Realistic-Bath-",
