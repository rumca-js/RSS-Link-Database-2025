About his \u201cgreenlights\u201d and \u201credlights\u201d.</p> <p>In general, it was not bad. I really enjoyed the part about McConaughey&#39;s early years. All the stories about his father were simultaneously funny, controversial, and instructive.</p> <p>But the other part\u2014about his life as an adult, I didn&#39;t find quite impressive. There was too much preaching, and some facts were even a little unbelievable, as for me.</p> <p>And I also didn&#39;t read it, but listened, because I knew that Matthew had narrated it by himself, so I wanted to hear the book from the author&#39;s mouth. However, I was truly disappointed\u2014too much acting for my taste.</p> <p>It would be fascinating to hear your thoughts about this book. Did you find it interesting?
