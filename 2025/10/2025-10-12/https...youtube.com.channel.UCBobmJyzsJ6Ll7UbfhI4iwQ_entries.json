By leveraging large language models (LLMs), developers can create a model that understands these guidelines and assists developers in creating behavior trees or state trees that accurately capture military doctrine within the Unreal Engine Game AI framework, including real-world scenarios for training.\n\nBy building on research from the University of Central Florida and utilizing behavior tree examples from the robotics industry, we can make the authoring of behavior trees for individual agents and multi-agent systems more efficient and realistic, and less labor-i",
