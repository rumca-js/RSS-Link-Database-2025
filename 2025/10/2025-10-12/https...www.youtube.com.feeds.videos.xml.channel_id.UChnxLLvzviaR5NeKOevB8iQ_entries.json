All tracks except You were started in NYC, where the initial ideas were formed and nurtured while exploring the city. The final stages of polish came in the week that followed back home.\n\nStems from the M8 tracker were then exported and final mixing + polish was done in Ableton.\n\nMastered with Ozone 12.\n\nThe download of this album on Bandcamp comes with the completely bundles for this album for the M8 tracker, which means you can load these songs in their 99% finished state and explore them on your own, if you want.\n\nMuch of the bass sound design was done leading up to NYC, which became this pack on Gumroad here: redmeansrecording.gumroad.com/l/pjrcj\n\nHuge thanks to everyone who ",
