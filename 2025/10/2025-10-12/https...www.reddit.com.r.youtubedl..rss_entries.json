I updated yt-dlp and it seemenly fixed the issue. But now, the downloaded videos just dont play. Since I didnt have ffmpeg installed I assume that could be the cause of it. </p> <p>So I downloaded ffmpeg through <a href=\"http://ffmpeg.org\">ffmpeg.org</a> and created a path for it in my computer, but I am still getting the same error messages whenever I try to download a video (and the videos still don&#39;t play). I tried using the --ffmepg location command but it simply doesn&#39;t work. </p> <p>The Warnings I get are:<br/> &quot;Warning: ffmpeg not found. The downloaded format may not be the best available.
