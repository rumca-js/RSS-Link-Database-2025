I&#39;m currently leaning on the cobra hyperspeed (I can check how to get this up and running on openrazer) and the g pro x superlight 2. I just need some dpi controls and possibly key binding support. Price for the hyperspeed is ~$90 while it&#39;s $107 for the superlight 2.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jdog320\"> /u/jdog320 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1o4o7xf/good_mouse_that_has_config_software_on_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1o4o7xf/good_mouse_that_has_config_software_on_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I am on an amd 5800x CPU and amd 7900xtx gpu. 1 generic 1080p monitor, 1 samsung 4k monitor and 1 gigabyte 4k oled (240hz). On windows, the monitors with their cables worked fine without issues.</p> <p>My GPU has 2 displayports and 2 hdmi ports. So the two 4k monitors are on dport and the 1080p one uses hdmi. If all monitors are set to 60hz, it all just works. The moment i try to bump one to 75/100/120/240hz, the whole screen freezes. I have to reset my PSU and start all over again. I removed the hdmi cable and tried with the two dports, and it works! I can use 240hz on my oled. </p> <p>Thing is, im really used to my 3-monitor workflow. And its really hard to go back to 60fps gaming when you&#39;ve had the taste of something higher. Is there a way to get this to work? I considered unplugging the hdmi when i start gaming but that just feels neutering my setup. Is there something I can do to make this work?</p>",

I was stuck with black screen after seizure warning when i launched game again. I tried diferent proton versions and saw that the proton 10.0-2 beta pushed me through seizure screen to copyright screen but then it was stuck. So i reinstalled the game and did the first run with compiling shaders on 10.0-2 beta and it worked i played for a few hours with no issues (i tinkered a bit with better graphic settings after playing for a while did that borke shaders?). But next day after reboot i ended up with the same problem - black screen after seizure warning. How should i compile shaders so the game will work everytime? Or is there proton command to not save shaders and recompile them on every launch? I know that my GPU is weak but i had no performance issues on low settings.</p> <p><code>OS: CachyOS x86_64</code>",
