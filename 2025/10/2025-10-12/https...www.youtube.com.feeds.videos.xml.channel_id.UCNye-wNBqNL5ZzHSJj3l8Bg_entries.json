        "description": "More than a thousand anti-immigration protesters have gathered in Amsterdam ahead of the Netherlands\u2019 upcoming general election. Despite a 40 percent decline in refugee arrivals this year, immigration remains a deeply divisive issue. Demonstrators voiced concerns over housing shortages, with some claiming that policies favouring refugees leave local residents disadvantaged.\nOthers criticised the rhetoric in Dutch politics, warning that the increasing normalisation of anti-immigration language in parliament fuels fear, hate, and violence on the streets. Organisers of the rally insisted they are neither racist nor extremist but want their grievances addressed. The protest reflects broader tensions in a country grappling with housing crises and shifting political attitudes towards migration.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Step Vaessen reports from Amsterdam, the Netherlands.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www",

Once-thriving communities are now unrecognisable, and much of the civilian infrastructure has been dismantled. Residents face severe shortages of food, water, and shelter, forcing many to walk for kilometres carrying their remaining belongings. The scale of destruction, particularly in major urban areas targeted during previous Israeli ground offensives, is described as unprecedented. Life in the city\u2019s centre has been transformed beyond recognition, leaving families struggling to rebuild amidst the ruins.\nSome trucks carrying desperately needed humanitarian supplies have entered Gaza. \nThere's been a scramble for aid by Palestinians, who've been starving for months. \nUnder the ceasefire agreement, about 600 are expected to enter the strip every day.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019",
