Does this mean that faster-than-light travel is real? If not, what explains the phenomenon the telescope just observed? And how could information travel faster than light, for real? Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09737v1\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPE",
