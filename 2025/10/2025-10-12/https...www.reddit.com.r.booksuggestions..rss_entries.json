These fall vibes are making me want to read some good romance fiction like this. It doesn&#39;t have to be the average romance. It can be toxic, sexual, lovey dovey, or anything you&#39;re interested in. I just want to let my mind escape and read something like this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AllTheHubbubb\"> /u/AllTheHubbubb </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o4twu5/emogoth_love_story/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o4twu5/emogoth_love_story/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Currently I&#39;m reading plum island and I&#39;m liking it so far. I think there 8 books in the john corey series so I&#39;ll read those but i like having my next book/series ready to go when i am done. I like the edgy wise cracking cop character.All suggestions are appreciated, and if you read the john corey series tell me what you thought with no spoilers please.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LincolnMaylog\"> /u/LincolnMaylog </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o4co5q/books_like_the_movie_die_hard/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o4co5q/books_like_the_movie_die_hard/\">[comments]</a></span>",
