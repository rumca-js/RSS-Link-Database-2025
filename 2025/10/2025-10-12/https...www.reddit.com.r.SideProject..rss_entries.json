Although I initially focused on reporting meta tag issues, I expanded the feature set to include internal and external link highlighting, as well as other content analysis and page speed reports.

Right now this quests are basic and not personalised.</p> <p>Main idea on website is: every morning it automatically drops &quot;quest&quot; page which will be till 3pm user time and then you can access to dashboard where you see your streak and history and mark your quest as completed. It&#39;s very simple system and somehow works on me. I built it because I struggle to stay active and social, and I wanted something that pushes me gently seek discomfort. But behind idea is real psychology explained in book.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019m looking for <strong>people</strong> to try out the early version and tell me what they think \u2014 honest feedback.

I have some spare time and already helped a nationwide e-lerning page to grow as ambassador, but now I am looking for a role where I can more actively change the project or impact immediately. Not too much in-depth-tech since I am not a programmer but I&#39;m still comfortable with a PC and I&#39;d say that I could learn basic things pretty quick. I have a lack of experience in entrepreneurship and therefore don&#39;t see the point of me wasting my time trying to create something out of thin air, but I would love to help someone else and gain experience from it. Depending on the project I could look into it and see what I can contribute.
