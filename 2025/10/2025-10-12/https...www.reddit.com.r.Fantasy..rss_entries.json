Here goes my top 5 (I included some sci-fi, pls don&#39;t hate me but come on, both included have lots of fantasy sensibilities. Plus I also did not repeat any authors):</p> <p><strong>1. A Storm of Swords - A Song of Ice and Fire 3 (George R. R. Martin)</strong>: What&#39;s left to say about it? Best fantasy novel ever. In fact, one of the best novels ever written. Perfect in every word. It has deep, great characters, fantastic pacing and some of the greatest twists ever put to page. It&#39;s the only SFF novel that I&#39;d give a perfect 10/10.</p> <p><strong>2. Dune: Messiah - Dune 2 (Frank Herbert)</strong>: I have no idea why I love it so much, especially since most fans think this as one of the weakest books of the series, but it JUST WORKS for",
