We might play by lantern light, so avoiding too much reading is probably a good idea. Also don\u2019t want too many fiddly small components, since we\u2019ll likely be playing on a wooden picnic table with a towel over it or something, and don\u2019t want to lose any pieces. The other players pick up rules pretty quick and have played some heavier games, but I don\u2019t expect there will be many heavy games that fit into this category lol.

I found this strange, because when scanning other cards they lead to the website with the song. The cards seem to have a song not acknowledged by Hitster as on of their songs, but still plays.
