ChatGPT suggested that making it a heading (like an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>) might help with accessibility.</p> <p>Is that actually a good idea? Would it make things clearer for screen readers, or would it just mess up the heading hierarchy and confuse users?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Environment_7201\"> /u/Ok_Environment_7201 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1o4hw8t/does_it_make_sense_to_mark_a_cta_as_a_heading_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1o4hw8t/does_it_make_sense_to_mark_a_cta_as_a_heading_for/\">[comments]</a></span>",
