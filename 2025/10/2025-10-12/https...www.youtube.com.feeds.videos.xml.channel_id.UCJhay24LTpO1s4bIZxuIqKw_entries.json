For other ecosystems, it's \"the air you breathe\" and pervasive in the language. This process can also happen via tooling, which affects the way we work and interact. As a final thought, this process occurs at the collaboration level and design level, which nudges the way we end up producing our total system, the finished product.\n\nIn this talk we'll go consider a variety of technologies and we'll be able to look back ",
