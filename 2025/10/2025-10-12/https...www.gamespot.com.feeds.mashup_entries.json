Borderlands 4 supports Shift codes, and the ones that can be redeemed for Golden Keys will let you open the unique Golden Chests found in Belton's Bore, The Launchpad, Carcadia, or The Lockaway.</p><p>Each code you redeem will give you Golden Keys that can be used to unlock a treasure chest of rare goodies in the game or new cosmetics that you can apply to your Vault Hunter. We'll be keeping track of Shift codes and the games you can redeem them in, so you can check back often for updates.</p><div data-embed-type=\"toc\"><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com\">hide</a>]</span><ul id=\"toc_list\" class=\"collapse in\"><li><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com\">Borderlands",
