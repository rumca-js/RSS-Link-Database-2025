        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone, I&#39;m excited to share our game Cursemark. We&#39;ve been working hard to bring it to life. The two main ingredients in this soup are the spellcrafting and the exploration. For the spellcrafting, you unlock a bunch of different skills permanently, and choose your loadout before starting a run. Then during a run, you find Runes that you can slot into those skills to modify them in crazy ways. And for the exploration, the whole game takes place in a huge hand-crafted world. So you&#39;ll be finding secrets, unlocking shortcuts, and upgrading and changing things.</p> <p>Trailer: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg4p6Ptx2gs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mg4p6Ptx2gs</a><br/> Steam Page: <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219180/Cursemark/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219180/Cursemark/</a></p> <p>If it looks cool give the demo a try and let us know what you think.
