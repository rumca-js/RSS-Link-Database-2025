I didn\u2019t know anything about torrenting back then but as I\u2019ve spent time on this subreddit I\u2019ve seen a lot of posts and comments warning against uTorrent and to use qbitTorrent instead. I was wondering if there\u2019s a specific way to uninstall it or if it\u2019s as simple as dragging it into the trashcan lol. I\u2019m not very tech savvy so he set everything up for me.

Another weird thing is reddit says this thing on that computer about too many api requests then I have to either turn on vpn, sometimes flush dns or renew ip to get it to work..sometimes those work. I dunno it has me scratching my head. I can still dl on my new gaming computer but I&#39;d rather use this one.
