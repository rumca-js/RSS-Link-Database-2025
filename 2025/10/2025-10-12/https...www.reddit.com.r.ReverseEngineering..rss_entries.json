I had a old ass android(htc sensation) laying around in my house and took off the front vga camera to possibly use, but cannot find any data sheets or anything about it online. I know the camera is super small and I could get away with a bigger one, but thought it would be a fun project to try and use it instead of trashing it. I just had 2 questions anyone know how I can get it working and anyone have experience/advice reusing old phone cameras/parts for other projects. I have the phone in it&#39;s entirety just no battery might use some janky set up to turn it on.</h1> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/West_Celebration1859\"> /u/West_Celebration1859 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.maxbhi.com/front-camera-for-htc-sensation-xe-z710a.html\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/c",
