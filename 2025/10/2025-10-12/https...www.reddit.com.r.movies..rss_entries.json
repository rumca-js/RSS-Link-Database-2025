It\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting for over a decade.</p> <p>Sucks it\u2019s not ending the show but I think it has potential if they bring some of the og writers back like they did for the first film.

I guess the latter is more found in adaptations of Jules Verne\u2019s stories and Tintin and some steampunk but not much beyond that. The french colonial empire as a whole isn\u2019t as popular in movie world as its British rival i guess so that might be a reason.</p> <p>So anyway whats yours?

I\u2019m looking for a film that captures a similar vibe. Something visually striking, and full of symbolism and themes.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the catch: I\u2019m a high school English teacher, and I\u2019d love to use it in class with my honors-level seniors. So while I\u2019m looking for something thought-provoking and a bit edgy, it still needs to be school-appropriate: no nudity or sexually explicit content. Rated R is okay if it does not have nudity/sexually explicit content. It should also be a film that would interest teens. </p> <p>For context, we started the semester by analyzing the Black Mirror episode \u201cNosedive,\u201d and I\u2019d like to end the term with another piece of media that invites strong discussion and analysis.</p> <p>Any recommendations for films that strike that balance between artistry, symbolism, and classroom-appropriateness?</",

There is also some movie that represent other things quite well but does not fit in the seven sins category such as Insomnia representing Guilt.</p> <p>What movie would you guys pick as the best representation for each sin?</p> <p>PS: Decided to not include Se7en in any of the list because its just too on the nose.</p> <p>Edit: Decided to do a thread best picks to compare with my original list:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Gluttony</strong>: <ul> ",
