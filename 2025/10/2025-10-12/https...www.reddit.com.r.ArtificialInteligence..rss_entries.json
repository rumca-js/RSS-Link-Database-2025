He investigates a topic suggested by someone on X then plays back his understanding to them. I am curious about an evolving standard called MCP (Model Context Protocol) which could radically simplify the way AI tools are built and used. Hence, my rhetorical question is: \u201cWhat is MPC, how does it work and how important is it?\u201d. Here\u2019s my Baddiel style response.</p> <h1>What is MCP?</h1> <p>The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between their data sources and AI-powered tools. - Anthropic</p> <p>Think of MCP as the USB-C of AI. Instead of needing a separate charger for every device, we have one universal standard. MCP works the same way: one protocol lets AI connect to any data source, whether that\u2019s a local file system, a PostgreSQL database or GitHub.</p> <p>MPC comes in two parts:</p> <ol> <li>The specification: rules for ho",
