        "description": "If you like this video and would like to see more like it, make sure to subscribe to @eurogamer on YouTube. \n\nBaby Steps is a devious climbing simulator and story-rich arthouse treatise on the millennial condition from noted scamps Devolver Digital, and the sort of game that should arguably come with a health warning for people with high blood pressure and a disclaimer about broken controllers. \n\nIt's also one of the funniest games in recent memory. But it's no joke that it's a serious GOTY contender, worthy of comparison to Hideo Kojima at his subversive best: and the parallels to Death Stranding are striking. \n\nThis video was created by Jim Trinca and was originally featured on Eurogamer.\n\n#IGN #BabySteps #Eurogamer",
