It is indeed a form of censorship and I oppose it, but it probably wouldn&#39;t pass this year, It&#39;s made little progress this year, and NetChoice and the EFF are trying to judge it. Not to mention, unlike the last Congress, we are in an entirely new presidential administration now.</p> <p>Now you know KOSA is unlikely to pass due to little progress (source: I checked S.1748, the bill&#39;s number), privacy and freedom concerns, and the push to stop it, what about the SCREEN Act? It&#39;s not likely to pass either, as it&#39;s also made little progress this year and has privacy concerns. Checking the bill, S.737 and H.R.1623, they&#39;re still stuck in the drawing board. It&#39;s been 8 months, still no progress on the SCREEN Act. Not likely to pass either. don&#39;t expect it to.</p> <p>And what about COPPA 2.0, or CTOPPA?

I got in contact with some bio family and learned that my sister is not in contact with any bio family (and for good reason, my bio family is nuts). I told my bio aunt that I wanted to send my sister a letter and what does she do? Find information about her and basically give me her address. This made me REALLY uncomfortable but I acted like it didn\u2019t.</p> <p>Later, I searched for the website that is just giving out my sisters information and guess which website it was? FastBackgroundChecks. It had literally EVERYTHING on there for FREE. This freaked me out because she does have kids and allegedly our birth mom was abusing her. This puts her and her family in danger. Using the email that the website claimed was her current one. I contacted her to let her know about the situation.

Her video is a guitar cover with ~300 views. It was recommended as a &quot;mix&quot; playlist. Her name isn&#39;t anywhere on the channel. We talked on and off for years after we broke up, but haven&#39;t talked in a couple years. She only has two videos from 11 years ago and it looks like she abandoned the account. I had no idea this channel existed until now and I wasn&#39;t subscribed (I subscribed).</p> <p>I just checked YT again and she&#39;s still there, top of the home feed on the app.</p> <p>Feels incredibly creepy and obtrusive. I have other friends who actively post videos and have never had their videos recommended. </p> <p>I thought that I was taking all of the proper privacy steps, but then something like this happens. Alphabet doesn&#39;t have access to my contacts, but I&#39;m assuming she isn&#39;t as privacy focused. Anyone else experience",

Recently, my university\u2019s Ethernet system (supplied by a company called Velocity) has banned my device from connecting to the dorm room Ethernet. I was temporarily able to fix this my changing my Windows PC\u2019s MAC address, but I believe the system rechecks every one and a while and is identifying my PC some other way.
