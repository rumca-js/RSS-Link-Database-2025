Combined with the overarching mystery of the rifts and the tug-of-war between ideologies, the sequel is promising a more engaging and high-stakes narrative filled with the deep role-playing systems fans crave.",

        "description": "Ninja Gaiden 4 sharpens its blades, dials up the combar, and weaves swiftness and verticality into every action - Team Ninja are unleashing a sequel aimed squarely at reclaiming its legacy following Ninja Gaiden 3\u2019s mixed reception. \n\nAs combat philosophies evolve with lethal precision and traversal mechanics expand with newfound style, the result - following a partnership between Team Ninja and PlatinumGames - is a modernised vision for the legendary series. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t erase Ninja Gaiden 3\u2019s mistakes as much as answer them, restoring mechanical bones and visually arresting flesh to be dissected anew by the game\u2019s dual protagonists. \n\nNinja Gaiden 3 attempted accessibility, but Ninja Gaiden 4 counteracts successfully with depth that is both inviting and intimidating. Ultimately, this sequel is more recognisably Ninja Gaiden.",

        "description": "Yooka-Replaylee, as promised, is the \u201cdefinitive\u201d version of Yooka-Laylee in almost every way. The presentation is a significant step up, and many of the more annoying aspects of the original are either downplayed or revamped. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s still Yooka-Laylee at its core, which means dealing with uninspired platforming sequences, so-so bosses, unfunny dialogue and worlds that feel more cobbled together than anything else. That may appeal to a strong contingent who loved the original despite its flaws, and might make for a stronger sell to those previously wary, even if it\u2019s far from an amazing platformer.",
