Then streaming it to your headset. You would use ARMGDDN for this. Quest VR is ran directly inside the headset itself and your PC is not involved (except for downloading in Sideloader)</p></li> <li><p>There are Platform exclusives - PCVR is it&#39;s own thing, same with Meta Quest and then PSCVR2 (Playstation).

Also hate Meta so I don\u2019t really want to buy it for that reason either.</p> <p>Are there other headsets that I should be considering. I\u2019d prefer a ceiling of around $800(USD), but can go up to $1k if need be but prefer not to. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LowRiskHades\"> /u/LowRiskHades </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m looking for a PCVR headset preferably under 1750AUD (~1150USD). It would probably be used for action games as opposed to sims. I would also like to get into the lighthouse ecosystem but it not a must. The pimax crystal light seems like a good choice although I&#39;ve heard mixed reviews about tracking and QA. The vive pro 2 is relatively cheap here but I&#39;ve heard it doesn&#39;t really hold up by today&#39;s standards. The index or index controllers are not options because it is not sold here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

It makes such a difference! Not having to take the headset on off on off to test things. This is the way it should be!</p> <p>I know they are getting on a bit Meta - but lots of us still have an Intel Mac - and I was very disheartened to see there was no Intel download for this great bit of software for a mac. Might you consider compiling a version for Intel Macs please? There are a lot of us still out there and we want to develop.</p> <p>I like developing on my old mac. It has a big screen ,is virtually silent.

Later in the evening, I was supposed to call my girlfriend, regular calls are really important to her.</p> <p>But something strange happened. At some point, I completely lost track of time and reality. I became so deeply immersed in the game that I actually forgot I was playing. It\u2019s hard to describe, it felt like I wasn\u2019t on Earth anymore, but really out there, exploring distant planets. Then, suddenly, something snapped me back to reality, like waking up from a dream.</p> <p>I looked at the clock, it was 1:45 a.m. I had been playing for almost seven hours straight without taking a single break. My girlfriend is understandably upset, and honestly, I\u2019m shocked myself.
