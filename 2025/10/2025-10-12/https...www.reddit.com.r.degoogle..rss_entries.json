My thoughts are: if many people use the same Instagram credentials to access the platform, wouldn&#39;t this end up confusing the algorithms and preventing the individual identification of each person? For example, if more than 50 people with different characteristics use the same username and password to access Instagram, wouldn&#39;t this confuse the algorithms and make it difficult to identify or profile each of them individually? Do you know if this would be possible, or if anyone has already done an experiment along these lines?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Head-Mud_683\"> /u/Head-Mud_683 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1o4snd2/would_a_collective_action_be_possible_to_try_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1o4snd2/",
