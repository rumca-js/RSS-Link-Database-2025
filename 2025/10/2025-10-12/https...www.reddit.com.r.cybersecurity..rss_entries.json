Is getting a CEH/Pen-test certification worth it. I have a background as a Computer Technician by which I was self taught since a kid. Ran a computer repair business (successfully) until I was 14 and then stopped as it was hard to manage school and run a repair business. I never had any certifications and I don&#39;t have a degree. As of right now the best I have it a few certs from Google-Coursera in Python, Linux and the Cybersecurity Cert (which gave me more certs for each course completed. I have 2 left). To be honest, these Google certificates didn&#39;t feel helpful and more of a refresher if anything. Plus, when I use to work security, I had experience with working with SIEM software",
