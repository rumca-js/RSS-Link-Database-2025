I know the difference between Firefox based and Chromium based browsers is pretty noticeable. I use Brave too and it\u2019s way faster compared to Iceraven, so I don\u2019t really mind if it\u2019s Chromium based as long as it\u2019s still privacy focused.</p> <p>What I\u2019m looking for in a browser: \u2022 Supports extensions \u2022 Privacy focused, no telemetry or data collection bs \u2022 Open source \u2022 Clean simple UI \u2022 Doesn\u2019t force an account for sync \u2022 Lets me use custom scripts or CSS tweaks \u2022 Not bloated or heavy \u2022 Gets updates often but still stays stable<",
