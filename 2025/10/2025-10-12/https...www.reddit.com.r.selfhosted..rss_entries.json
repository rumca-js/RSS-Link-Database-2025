I have tried and tried to add the address into prowlaar which i get a response of it cant be a https: address even if i have ssl check marked. If this is even possible.</p> <p>Second is radaar. It is refusing connections both from the webgui and prowlaar. Not sure what i am missing here.</p> <p>Both are in docker containers and say they are running.

But considering I am only about 60% through my collection and have virtually filled a 5TB drive, I am considering whether to start compressing or look into a larger NAS. I am currently planning on going for a 4Bay with 4X 22TB Drives in RAID1. But want to ensure I am not going to run out of space in the future. </p> <p>This is likely to only give 44TB worth of space, which I know is a significant amount, but I am also planning on using the same NAS to host nextCloud and get rid of GDrive for my family. </p> <p>So what are your thoughts on compression and if you choose to compress, what settings do you tend to aim for in Handbrake to lower filesize with minimal quality loss?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

Often when self-hosting, you have to juggle a number of app secrets and credentials. I&#39;m building Envie, a self-hostable solution.</p> <p>Envie helps you manage secrets with one simple CLI. You can store your variables into environments and group them together for better organization. Everything is encrypted on the client-side and self-hostable.</p> <p>You can run any command with:</p> <p><code>envie exec &lt;environment&gt; &lt;your-command&gt;</code></p> <p>to use your chosen environment and start a shell with your command.This makes it easy to integrate Envie with any self-hosting setup.</p> <p>There is also a self-hosting guide for it: <a href=\"https://web.envie.cloud/guide/self-hosting/host-with-docker\">https://web.envie.cloud/guide/self-hosting/host-with-docker</a></p> <p>Thanks, hope some of you find it useful!
