Researchers found that the South Pole-Aitken Basin formed from a glancing northern strike, revealing deep materials from the Moon\u2019s interior. This discovery sheds light on how KREEP elements gathered on the near side, driving volcanic activity. Artemis astronauts may soon uncover samples that rewrite lunar history.",
