I was planning to use HSTS016l-F 10A but i placed order twice and the seller(s) i bought from 2 different stores kept disappointing me as they failed to post it out , causing me to burn 4 weeks of my semester, hence why im using the WCS1800.</p> <p>I also wonder if i can power up the WCS1800 by using my raspberry 3 model b+ 5V terminal. Any comments is greatly appreciated and helpful as I am nearing my FYP deadline as I have to also do data collection and analysis. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Medical_Candidate670\"> /u/Medical_Candidate670 </a> ",

I&#39;ve tried to connect my RPi5 to the DP inputs via micro-HDMI to HDMI and then HDMI to DP adapters, but they don&#39;t display any video.
