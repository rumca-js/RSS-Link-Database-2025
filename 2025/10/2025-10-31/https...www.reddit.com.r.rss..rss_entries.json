I have been having the same issue for 3 days now so I&#39;d like to ask if anyone knows a solution I haven&#39;t tried: </p> <p>I use Feedbro to avoid having to use Youtube directly, I have some feeds I follow and watch the videos in the Feedbro interface. 3 days ago, instead of playing the videos, they showed an error message: &quot;Error 153 - Configuration error in the video&#39;s player&quot;.</p> <p>Solutions I have tried that have not worked:<br/> - Uninstalling and reinstalling Feedbro -&gt; in case I had an outdated version.<br/> - Deleting all of my Youtube cookies -&gt; worked for 1 video, then never worked again, no matter how many times I deleted them.</p> <p>Differences in use since it worked:<br/> - I added some specific feeds, that are playlists inside Youtube -&gt; I doubt this has anything to do with it, since the problem is in ALL feeds no matter what, and they worked fine for around 2 days before this all happened.</p> <p>I h",
