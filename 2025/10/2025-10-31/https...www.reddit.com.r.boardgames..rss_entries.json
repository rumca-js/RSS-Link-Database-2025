I haven&#39;t seen the concept of hidden scoring too often so I thought it could be a cool twist.</p> <p>But now I heard from several sides that they prefer to see their scoring so it is easier to adapt to the opponents.

Does this have a name like werewolfparty or roleplaywolf ? Funny guesses asides, I&#39;d be happy if someone knows about this, or even has a template for a game. Basically day&amp;nights scripts+power with a game win-cons. I might love to host it for 15-20 people if I find enough about it. </p> <p>To the interested, what I can recall from my fadding memory: </p> <p>&quot;During the day, everyone took on a role with a job and backstory \u2014 for example, I was a baker, connected to some characters and not to others.
