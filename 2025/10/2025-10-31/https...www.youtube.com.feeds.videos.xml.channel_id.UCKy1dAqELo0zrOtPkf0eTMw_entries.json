In the Menace cinematic trailer, watch Republic Marines and Pirates clash in a derelict factory, before the dead on both sides get absorbed and repurposed by the insidious lifeform plaguing the wayback system. \n\nIn Menace, lead a strike force of marines, misfits, and miscreants in the Wayback system, a lawless frontier far from the core worlds, beset by pirates, warlords, morally bankrupt corporations, and fractured local governments who struggle for dominance. Aboard the TCRN Impetus, players will lead an ensemble cast of colourful characters who will lead their forces, whether that\u2019s fielding mechs, tanks, or infantry squads.\n",
