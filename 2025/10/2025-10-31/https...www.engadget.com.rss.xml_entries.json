In this episode, Devindra and Engadget&#39;s Igor Bonafacic try to figure out why 1X made the Neo look like a murderbot, as well as the future they see for home robots. Also, we discuss last week&#39;s AWS outage and our over-reliance on a single cloud provider, as well as Apple&#39;s rumored push for OLED devices in 2026.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Devindra also what\u2019s with John Gearty, a former Apple Vision Pro engineer, about the state of Apple\u2019s headset and the world of XR.</p><div><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:200px;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://iframely.publishing.yaho",

Today\u2019s models are brighter, sharper and more flexible, making them a practical upgrade for movie nights, gaming sessions or backyard screenings. Whether you want a compact projector that fits in a backpack or a full 4K setup for your living room, there\u2019s something to match nearly every space and budget.<br><br>Modern projectors handle far more than films. Some are tuned for low-latency gaming, others run built-in streaming apps and many can mirror your phone or laptop without extra cables. Improvements in LED and laser lighting mean better color accuracy and higher brightness, even in rooms that aren\u2019t completely dark. Combine that with lighter designs and quieter cooling, and it\u2019s easy to see why a projector can replace or complement a traditional TV.<br><br>We\u2019ve tested projectors across categories and price ranges to help you find the right one, whether you\u2019re aiming for a po",
