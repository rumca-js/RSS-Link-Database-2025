What I like about it is that it&#39;s told in this humorous way (I hate prose that&#39;s pretentiously poetic and that takes itself too seriously), while still being a serious story, that it&#39;s multi-pov, that there is a diverse cast of characters and that though the story is high-stakes, it&#39;s still more small-scale. The stakes have large scale implications but the books focus on the characters, it leaves all the political intrigue to the side (or for the Nikolai-duology, haha). Also, I like that it&#39;s not the traditional heroes journey stuff. The books I&#39;m looking for don&#39;t necessarily have to feature morally grey characters, I just want them to not tell the typical &quot;heroes journey, save the cat, have the semi-interesting political strategy meetings, fight the war&quot;-type stories.

Maybe we\u2019re holding some of those now, without realizing it. When I think of stories that already feel destined to last, <em>The Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> comes to mind immediately. It\u2019s one of those novels that refuses to fade each decade gives it new meaning, new relevance, as if it keeps waking up with us. And Khaled Hosseini\u2019s books <em>The Kite Runner</em>, <em>A Thousand Splendid Suns</em> still leave me wordless. There\u2019s a quiet humanity in the way he writes love, loss, and forgiveness. You close the book, and somehow it\u2019s still there sitting with you, reshaping how you see compassion. Even <em>Harry Potter</em>, for all its cultural noise, feels strangely enduring. For so many of us, it was the first story that made reading feel like home that rare kind of wonder you don\u2019t outgrow, just return to differently",

Lady Serenya, caught in a web of ancient oaths and ruthless power plays, strives to build a living citadel that defies time and embraces her rhythm. Bound by love, betrayal, and a mysterious legacy, she must protect all that is hers and lead the Sapphire Legion through shadows that threaten to consume. Within whispers in the marsh and the rising song of stone, this tale is a journey of a woman&#39;s ambition, courage, sacrifice, and destiny.</p> <p>The epic is set among towering mountains, shifting sands, and enchanted realms. The mist-wrapped Tabore-Bane, where rivers snake through shadowed marshlands and ancient mountains guard whispered secrets, here destiny is not a gift but a burden.",

The best series I&#39;ve read that is sort of like this is the prison healer series by lynette noni</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Br0oklyn_Baby\"> /u/Br0oklyn_Baby </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1okgknz/enemies_to_lovers_but_both_r_heirs_of_warring/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1okgknz/enemies_to_lovers_but_both_r_heirs_of_warring/\">[comments]</a></span>",
