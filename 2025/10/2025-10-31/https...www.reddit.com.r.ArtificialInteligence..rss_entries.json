Read the following summary with a focus on on-the-loop and in-the-loop concepts.</p> <p>The article provides an extensive analysis of the concept of <strong>de-skilling</strong> caused by new technologies, particularly the rise of <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong> and large language models. It explores the historical precedent for this anxiety, referencing Socrates&#39;s concern about writing leading to forgetfulness, and modern examples such as physicians using AI for colonoscopies and engineers relying on calculators. The text argues that while some skills are lost, this often leads to a <strong>re-skilling</strong>, where individuals develop new, often more abs",

An example I&#39;ve experienced recently is Amazon&#39;s Kiro, using anthropic, being really great at complex coding tasks, but being pretty terrible at UI (just my experience).

Specifically what I&#39;m interested in is research into which use cases AI is not suitable for precisely because it is unpredictable, how these might be classed by both the requirements and the risk/impact, maybe where the tipping point is ie if AI gets good enough it&#39;s still beneficial even though it&#39;s unpredictable because it&#39;s still better than existing methods or processes.
