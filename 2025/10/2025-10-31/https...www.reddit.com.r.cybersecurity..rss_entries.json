I recently graduated with a Master\u2019s in Cybersecurity Engineering, and I\u2019ve been actively applying for entry-level roles like: \u2022 Cybersecurity Analyst \u2022 SOC Analyst \u2022 IAM Analyst \u2022 Cloud Security Associate</p> <p>But I\u2019m honestly frustrated \u2014 on LinkedIn and Indeed, so many of the listings seem fake or inactive (ghost jobs). Either they\u2019re just keeping a \u201ctalent pool\u201d open or it feels like they\u2019re collecting resumes for future use. The few genuine listings are almost always for senior roles that ask for 5+ years of experience.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been focusing on jobs within the U.S., but since opportunities for true entry-level roles are so limited, I\u2019m now considering looking in Europe (especially Germany, Netherlands, or other EU countries).</p> <p>If anyone here has experience or advice, could you please share: \u2022 \ud83d\udd39 How to find real job postings (that c",

I have a masters degree in cybersecurity (OMSCY GaTech), CCNA, MCSA (Windows Server), CEH, eJPT and BTL1.</p> <p>I have been following the advice and roadmaps since I was in University to get into cybersecurity. The general consensus was that to break into cyber one should have basic IT knowledge, networking, servers, operating systems, maybe some scripting, then security basics, and then a specialization into defensive/offensive. And the golden &quot;Cybersecurity is not an entry level job so you must have some experience before you can break into a cyber role.&quot;</p> <p>I did all of that",
