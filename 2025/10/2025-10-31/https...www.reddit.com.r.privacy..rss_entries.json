It&#39;s like a corporate mitm proxy, except it doesn&#39;t require a custom CA or a managed system. It&#39;s fully trusted out of the box.</p> <p>That to me is just insane. Browsers should be some kind of warning telling you that you&#39;re connected to Cloudflare (US), DDoSGuard (Russia), etc.</p> <p>I would argue it&#39;s even worse than ISPs, because while ISPs can see which IP you are connecting to, they can&#39;t peer inside the connection.
