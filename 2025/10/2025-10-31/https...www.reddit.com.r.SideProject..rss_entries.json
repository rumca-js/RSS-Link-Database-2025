Personally, unless there is the needs, I would never consider working with anyone as my co-founder, due to personal issue, however this has caused me to be very alone while working on my projects. Unfortunately, many people around me are not interested in these sort of stuffs. </p> <p>My mission is to build an Internet that is better, free from private equity and much more. However, many people feel that this is too complicated or couldn\u2019t understand the meaning behind it. Which is why, I am looking to connect with other entrepreneurs that is also programmers, and looking to build better products, so we can connect and share feedback with each other. </p> <p>This is not a promotion, I don\u2019t have anything to sell here. I am just looking for connection, so we can build together with each other. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=",

It has no logins or accounts, and all your data stays private, syncing securely with iCloud through CloudKit. Everything happens on your device, so it feels fast, personal, and completely yours.</p> <p>If you appreciate apps that blend beautiful design with a privacy-first mindset, I\u2019d love for you to check it out and share what you think.</p> <p><a hre",
