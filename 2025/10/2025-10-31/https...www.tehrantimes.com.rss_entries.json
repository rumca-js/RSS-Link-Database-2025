Born to a French father and an American mother of Lithuanian Jewish descent, Hequet grew into adulthood with the haunting legacies of World War II coursing through his family: a grandfather who fled anti-Semitic terror, an uncle who parachuted into France with the 101st Airborne on D-Day, and a father who survived the Nazi Mauthausen concentration camp. Such intimate narratives of resistance shaped his lifelong dedication to confronting oppression and cultivating empathy rather than indifference.",
