Learn more about MSI's Black Friday discounts here: https://msi.gm/S2E1BB30\n\nOne of PC gaming's most infamously poor ports, it has been left to the modding community - and increasingly more powerful hardware over the years - to get the game into an acceptable state, to the point where RTX Remix support is now in a position to transform the game into a path-tracing showcase.

Path tracing support is in its infancy, but it's already looking fantastic. \n\nSupport Modder xoxor4d: https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d\nGTA 4 Path Tracing will be made publicly available here (when ready): https://github.com/xoxor4d\n\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:01:26 GTA 4's Poor PC Legacy\n00:07:37 Path Tracing in GTA 4\n00:14:36 Conclusion",
