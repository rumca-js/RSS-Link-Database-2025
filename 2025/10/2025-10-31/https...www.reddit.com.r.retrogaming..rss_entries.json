And for those who\u2019ve used their UV printing service, how did the print quality and durability hold up over time? I can\u2019t seem to find any more meaningful information/reviews regarding their printing process aside from what\u2019s available on their website. </p> <p>Appreciate any insight or photos if you\u2019re willing to share! </p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

With me beating Revelations Persona (PS1) last week, I don&#39;t have a set game that I&#39;m going to play. If I do find some free time and get interested in playing, I&#39;ve been thinking about revisiting Batman Return of the Joker on Game Boy. It&#39;s quite different from the NES version and I actually had a great time playing it as a kid despite it&#39;s flaws.
