        "description": "At Unreal Fest, Voice to Visuals brought together Unreal Engine\u2019s most powerful animation tools to show how expressive performances can come to life in real time.\n\nUsing Take Recorder, Sequencer, MetaHuman Animator, Live Link Hub, and Performance Capture Manager \u2014 the demo showcased end-to-end performance capture and playback inside Unreal Engine.\nFrom voice-driven lip sync to real-time retargeting across diverse characters, and even dynamic character swaps for humor and storytelling, this workflow demonstrates a new era of speed, creativity, and flexibility for animation, games, and virtual production.",

        "description": "Over the past year, we transformed the rendering, animation, and streaming pipelines in The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo to consistently hit 60 fps on a PlayStation 5. This talk discusses the strides we've taken in converting the renderer to an asynchronous model and offloading work from our sequential named threads, where the various tasks involved in streaming, simulating, and rendering a frame can run in parallel, allowing significant increases in scene complexity without limiting performance. Come and gain practical insights into achieving high performance without compromising visual fidelity, focusing on game thread, render thread, and GPU optimizations for The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo.",
