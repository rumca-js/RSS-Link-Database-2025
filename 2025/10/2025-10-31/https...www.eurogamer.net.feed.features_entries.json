Well, not quite, but The S&eacute;ance of Blake Manor certainly has a lot of them. This might seem like a strange place to start when talking about developer Spooky Doorway's brilliant new supernatural detective mystery, but it actually says quite a lot about what makes it so good.  Here, a fun historical footnote - that jack-o'-lanterns were originally carved from turnips - is turned into a feature, as glowering turnip faces leer from shadowy corners and sit in ghoulish formation along the sweep of an imposing staircase. In the grand scheme of things, a minor detail - but it's also one that lends this spooky deductive yarn an air of historical authenticity that sells its supernatural premise so much harder.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-seance-of-blake-manor-is-shaping-up-to-be-one-of-my-favourite-games-this-year",

        "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Final-Sentence-4.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>I don't have a penchant for typing-games and often actively avoid them. When most of your nine-to-five is spent typing, the idea of competitively typing isn't the most appealing of pastimes. Though, neither is playing Valorant, yet I still did that for years on end. So, when my friend sent over the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2413950/Final_Sentence\">Final Sentence demo</a> with the caption \"this is a bit of you\", I didn't know what to expect (other than something mildly horrifying, as is usually the case).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/final-sentence-is-proof-that-theres-no-greater-horror-than-typing-under-pressure\">Read more</a></p>",

More specifically, I've been thinking about <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review\">my Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a> - the five-star review I wrote for Eurogamer. It plagues me. Because to be blunt, I'm not happy with how it sits. I don't think The Veilguard is a five-star game and definitely don't think it's BioWare's best game. To have suggested such a thing has haunted me for 12 months, particularly <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio?\">as new information about Veilguard's troubled development</a> has arisen and we've learned how a <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer",
