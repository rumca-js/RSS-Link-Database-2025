        "description": "Once Upon a Katamari isn\u2019t just another remaster or remake of an older title, but the first new console entry since 2011. The quirky arcade-puzzler returns with its signature ball rolling mayhem, now wrapped in a time-traveling premise. \n\nIt\u2019s up to the Prince to roll through different eras collecting objects, people, and whatever else gets in his way to put time back together. The era-hopping structure lets players roll across themed stages, from ancient civilizations to futuristic skylines, each packed with new objects and strange surprises to collect. \n\nIt\u2019s classic Katamari, just bigger and more varied than ever. Once Upon a Katamari is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch for $39.99 and you\u2019re not going to want to miss it if you\u2019re a fan of the series.",
