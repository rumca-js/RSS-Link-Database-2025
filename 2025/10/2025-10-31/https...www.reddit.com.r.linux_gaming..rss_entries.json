So far the only downside I found is that installing certain things is obviously a bit more troublesome but nothing I couldnt deal with so far. Also without being able to use dnf I couldnt install additional codecs which made the preinstalled Firefox quite annoying to work with at times, but it didnt annoy me enough to look for a workaround, so probably that isnt as much of a problem too. Worst case I could just replace it by a Flaptak install of FF (which should come with the codecs missing in RPM Firefox). </p> <p>Anyway, so far most problems I had where minor at worst. But how about gaming? Will there be any big issues with Kinoite (as I prefer Plasma DE for gaming)? I know Bazzite is based on Kinoite too, but I prefer pure Kinoite to keep bloatware at a minimum.
