The studio fired between 30 and 40 staff members from offices in the United Kingdom and Canada earlier this week. The terminated employees were reportedly attempting to unionize when they were let go.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings\">Bloomberg</a> broke the story, and added that all of the fired employees were part of a private trade union chat group on Discord.

Finally, though, the time has come, and The Simpsons season is starting on the evening of Saturday, November 1. And it's one of the biggest Fortnite takeovers we've ever seen, with a Simpsons-themed battle pass, and entirely new cel-shaded map for Battle Royale, and a totally revamped loot pool--all for a season that lasts just a month.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">So, yeah, there's <em>a lot</em> going on here. Let's run through everything we know about so far--which is a lot, because Epic let a bunch of influencers play the new season and they've been sharing their content. Just keep in mind there's likely to be plenty of surprises in store as the season goes on.</p></p><br/>    ",

There are practical reasons for this, to be sure: Computer games often require one hand on a mouse, the other on a keyboard. There are a ton of keys that are simply out of reach.

The player, known as Terns on X and Canada in-game, documented the climb throughout the season, posting the milestone on social media this week.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The achievement, however, doesn\u2019t mean much tangible at all. Fortnite caps meaningful rewards around level 200, and higher levels don\u2019t grant extra items, bonuses, or skill advantages. The main payoff is appearing on a <a href=\"https://fortnite.gg/stats\">leaderboard</a> and having something to brag about--though even that isn\u2019t respectable.

Yes, Nintendo had already released a wide variety of Game &amp; Watch devices, but the Game Boy featured swappable cartridges to make it feel like a home console in the palms of your hands.

The Game Boy Color made its debut in 1998 in Japan, and brought with it a fancier screen, a staggering number of colors for the time, and a punchy sound from its speaker.</p><p><strong>More Nintendo best lists</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-snes-games/1100-6496256/\">Best SNES Games</a></li><l",
