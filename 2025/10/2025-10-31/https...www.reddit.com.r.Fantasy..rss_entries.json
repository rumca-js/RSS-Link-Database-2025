I&#39;m uncomfortable reading that sort of thing, and want to find more books with fantastic writing and engaging stories.<br/> In example: I love Lord of the Rings, and the Stormlight Archives, but didn&#39;t finish the Wise Man&#39;s Fear by Patrick Rothfuss, because while the story was great, it was far too explicit for me.<br/> I&#39;m currently reading The Royal Assassin by Robin Hobb.

It&#39;s been recommended, but feels rather intimidating.<br/> I&#39;ve read bits of Terry Pratchett&#39;s Discworld.</p> <p>In the past I&#39;ve read a <em>lot</em> of middle grade fantasy, but am looking for something geared more to adults.

It can also be to escape from some prison place, for example, to climb a wall in a pit or to swim to escape an island.

The humor can be a bit subtle but Sapkowski lets the reader in on the joke.</p> <p>It&#39;s a shorter novel and goes quick.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cosmic-Sympathy\"> /u/Cosmic-Sympathy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1okhpkm/review_of_crossroad_of_ravens_by_andrzej_sapkowski/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1okhpkm/review_of_crossroad_of_ravens_by_andrzej_sapkowski/\">[comments]</a></span>",

John Gwynne is an author I&#39;ve been interested in for a while, as love the idea of norse/nordic themed epic fantasy with a ton of action.</p> <p>But the problem is... I am currently unsure if I should start with The Bloodsworn Saga, or his Faithful and the Fallen series. </p> <p>I&#39;ve heard very conflicting opinions on each series, some say Bloodsworn is better than Faithful, others say the opposite, I&#39;ve even seen some people say they absolutely hated one series, but thought the other was great. </p> <p>But what do you guys think, which one will be the better reading experience for somebody who has read ZERO of his books? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Kangaroo_Mafia\"> /u/The_Kangaroo_Mafia </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1okhgzn/which_john_gwynne_series_should_i_read_first/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

People said it had an interesting world and that the first book is a favorite for a lot of fantasy fans, so I decided to give it a shot.</p> <p>At first, I really enjoyed it. The beginning was gripping \u2014 the night felt truly horrifying, people barely surviving, and Arlen was such a compelling character. I was hooked on what would happen next: him running away and creating wards for himself running away, and accuracy defending himself from these demons. It really set the stage for some cool character development and dark, intense storytelling.</p> <p>And then\u2026 it switched POV to Leesha, and I completely lost interest. Suddenly, the book felt like a totally different story. The wards, the demons, the horror \u2014 all of that disappeared. Instead, the focus was almost entirely on a 13-year-old girl\u2019s virginity. Like\u2026 what? How did the book do a 180 from dark fantasy with survival and",
