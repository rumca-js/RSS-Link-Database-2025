So what makes it such a timeless tune?</p><p>Fifty years ago this very day, Queen released Bohemian Rhapsody as a single. By the time it reached record stores it was already familiar to many, having received extensive radio play by the likes of Kenny Everett (\u201cExcuse me while I scrape myself off the ceiling,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4p1-5q_IIA0\">was Everett\u2019s reaction</a> after its first spin). So the song climbed the charts quickly. Within a month it had gone to No 1, where it then sat for nine weeks, from the end of November to the end of January. And Bohemian Rhapsody has stayed lodged in pop music\u2019s collective consciousness ever since. It\u2019s a song so instantly familiar that you only need to hear that first multitracked vocal smear of \u201cIs this the real life?\u201d to replay all five minutes and 55 seconds of it in your head. You\u2019re probably doing it right no",
