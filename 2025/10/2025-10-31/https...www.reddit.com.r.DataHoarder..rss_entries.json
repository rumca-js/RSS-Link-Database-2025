Lots of folks on this sub and elsewhere have vouched for the 1M2\u2019s excellent quality, but I haven\u2019t heard much about the Envoy Ultra. It has a \u201c4.0TB OWC Aura Pro IV PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 2280 SSD\u201d inside of it, which seems to have roughly parallel performance to the Samsung 990 Pro, but what I want to know is whether there is an actual advantage to going with the 1M2. The Envoy Ultra has a cheaper over-all price, the same speeds, and is actually IP67 rated, so it\u2019s extremely weather proof. Is there a thermal advantage to the 1M2? Could that be the reason so many folks on this sub have opted for going DIY instead of saving some cash and grabbing the pre-built Envoy Ultra?
