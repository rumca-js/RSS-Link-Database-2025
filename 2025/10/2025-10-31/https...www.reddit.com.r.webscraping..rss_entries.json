The game now is all about consistency across layers. Anti-bot systems are correlating your TLS/JA3 fingerprint with your Canvas rendering (GPU level) and even with the physics (biometrics) of your mouse movement.</p> <p>The full guide is here: <a href=\"https://pydoll.tech/docs/deep-dive/fingerprinting/\">https://pydoll.tech/docs/deep-dive/fingerprinting/</a></p> <p>I hope it serves as a useful resource!
