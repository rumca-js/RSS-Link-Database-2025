This campaign isn\u2019t noteworthy because it is new, but noteworthy because it is an ongoing threat. </p> <p>The malware is an initial access tool\u2014its primary purpose is to get onto devices to run a backdoor. Access to the device and network is then leveraged by a ransomware gang to target the network. Based on our tracking and discussions with others in the community, we know that the malware is leveraged by the Rhysdia ransomware gang. </p> <p>In the current form of the campaign, the actors are using search engine ads to direct users to webpages imitating Microsoft Teams; however, over the last few months, we\u2019ve also seen them use ads for other common and popular software, such as PuTTy, WinRAR, and Zoom.
