I find there to be a somewhat regressive underlying message on the role of women in caregiving. Atul brings his Indian grandfather as an ideal in aging. However he doesn&#39;t go into the fact that the women, and really only the women, of the family would cook and clean and care to keep his 100+ year old grandfather going. And this message continues in his examples. The &quot;role&quot; of daughters in caring is mentioned but not the role of sons. Then the book goes into how dual income families have made it harder for women to care for the elderly. I found this somewhat disturbing. Women don&#39;t cherish these roles but are expected into them without options. The truth is that there is no good solution. Majority of humans are scared to die and want to keep living even when it&#39;s hard to do so for them and for others. It&#39;s core instinct and cannot be overridden. Huma",
