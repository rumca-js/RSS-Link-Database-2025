Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, finally caught fire after a year of near misses, bulldozing through her opponents to win a title in Ningbo, China that solidified her spot in Riyadh among the eight best players in the world.</p><p>Just as significant as Rybakina\u2019s qualification, though, was its consequences for the player she usurped. Mirra Andreeva, the 18-year-old prodigy who won WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells this year, had seemed like a sure bet to qualify in singles for the finals. Her failure to do so underscores the fact that this year has been the toughest and most competitive women\u2019s tennis season in years.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/31/womens-tennis-thriving-on-the-cou",

        "description": "<p>Add an international flavour to Bonfire Night with these gooey American campfire favourites that also work well under a hot grill</p><p>What\u2019s Bonfire Night without some toasty, gooey marshmallows? And it\u2019s only right to have them in a s\u2019more, the American classic that\u2019s also now part of the festivities over on this side of the pond. Digestive biscuits are typically the go-to, but I like to add extra flavour, depth and texture by using ginger oaty biscuits instead. These are quick to put together and don\u2019t require any chilling. Ideally, the s\u2019mores would be made over a real fire, but a blowtorch or hot grill will do the job, too.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/oct/31/ginger-biscuit-smores-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi\">Continue reading...</a>",

        "description": "<p><strong>(Polydor)</strong><br>On her self-deprecating, viscera-flecked sixth record, Florence Welch picks apart the compulsions and contradictions of fame</p><p>The title track of Everybody Scream provides a suitably striking opening for Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album. A sinister organ and a choir of voices harmonise in the style of a horror theme, replaced in short order by the sound of screaming and a stomping glam rock rhythm; instead of the shouts of \u201cHey!\u201d that traditionally punctuated a glitterbeat in the 70s, there are distaff cries of \u201cDance!\u201d and \u201cTurn!\u201d Its sound offers a corrective to the notion that whenever the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner appears as co-producer in an album\u2019s credits, as he does here, it means the artist in question is striving for tastefully hued indie folk \u2013 the sound he brought to Taylor Swift\u2019s 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Ed Sheeran\u2019s Autumn Variations and the mistier moments of Gracie Abrams\u2019 The Secret of Us.

They are defensively disciplined but also have the ability to push forward and cause problems. Everyone expected as much from Walker, who has been one of the best right-backs in world football over the past decade, but it could have been difficult for Hartman, coming from the Eredivisie, to settle into a newly promoted team and face some of the best wingers in the world. The Dutchman has stuck to his defensive tasks supremely well but the task of marshalling Bukayo Saka and Eberechi Eze will be a true test. Regular assi",
