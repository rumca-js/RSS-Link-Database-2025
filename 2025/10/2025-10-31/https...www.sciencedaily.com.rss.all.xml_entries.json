        "description": "Scientists discovered that a blood molecule called CtBP2 may play a major role in how we age. It helps regulate metabolism and appears to link aging across the entire body. Lower levels are tied to poor health and faster aging, while higher levels are found in longer-living people. The finding could lead to simple blood tests that reveal how healthy or \u201cyoung\u201d your body really is.",

In a massive international trial, heart attack and stroke risk dropped by 20% regardless of BMI. The benefit seems tied not just to slimming down but to deeper biological effects on inflammation, blood pressure, and vessel health. Researchers say this could expand who qualifies for the drug.",

New satellite data and advanced simulations show that the morning side of the magnetosphere carries a negative charge, not positive as long believed. Researchers from Kyoto, Nagoya, and Kyushu Universities found that while the polar regions retain the expected polarity, the equatorial areas flip it entirely.",
