        "description": "In 1976, during Lebanon\u2019s civil unrest, a group of unidentified individuals carried out one of the most remarkable bank operations in history. They accessed the British Bank of the Middle East in Beirut by entering through a neighboring building, reportedly using advanced tools to reach the vault. Over the course of several hours, they carefully removed an estimated $20\u201350 million worth of cash, gold, and valuables, equivalent to over $200 million today. No one was ever identified, and the case remains unsolved, making it one of the most mysterious financial disappearances of the 20th century.",
