The goal is to optimise a 2D convolution for different platforms as far as possible and demonstrate the results.</p> <p>I already have a Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a Raspberry Pi 4, so I thought I&#39;d pick one of those to represent the General Purpose Processors. I have a Tang Nano 20k to represent FPGAs. So now I am looking for something GPU/TPU like that could add to the Raspberry Pi to represent GPUs/Hardware Accelerators as well around the same price point to keep it fair.</p> <p>Now I don&#39;t know if this exists, so apologies if it doesn&#39;t. I saw the Google Coral as a potential option, but it appears to sell at around 70 bucks, which is much higher than the Pis and the FPGA, so not necessarily a fair comparison anymore. I could adjust for price, but I",
