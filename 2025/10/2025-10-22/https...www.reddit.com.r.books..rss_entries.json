The cure does not grant immortality, people can still die from terminal illnesses if they contract them, or by means of physical harm/violence which would kill anybody, but the cure does stop the aging process. So if you get the cure at age 25, you will live the rest of your life looking the same as you did at 25 with none of the visual signs of aging or associated musculoskeletal degradation.
