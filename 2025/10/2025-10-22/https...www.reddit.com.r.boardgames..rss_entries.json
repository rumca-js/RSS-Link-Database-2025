We end up always liking the games, so it&#39;s nothing bad. But recently, I suggested we should pick the game next time so that we can replay some of the games that we loved and only got to play once. They all liked the idea of having more opinions on what to play next.<br/> I would just text and ask every time, but I feel like it might be the same person or two picking all the time.

Most explanations I\u2019ve seen say that your federation token can be flipped to advance to the last spot on the track or to purchase the advanced tech tiles. But this is a bit confusing. When you upgrade to a building that lets you research, you also get a tech tile. So flipping the federation token in this case would let you get both. Not an \u201cor\u201d scenario. The only thing I can think of is that when you spend knowledge to research you are only going up the track but don\u2019t get to purchase anything. So am I missing something or is this correct?</p> <p>I also saw that you can purchase an advanced tech tile if you\u2019re on the final spot of the track.
