I have spoken with several people who study automation engineering and \u201cclassical robotics\u201d (cybernetics, motion, mechanics, etc.), and when I mentioned that I was interested in cognitive and developmental robotics, they all looked at me as if I were naive, as if I didn\u2019t really know the world of robotics. One guy even said, \u201cOh, so you think you\u2019re going to do stuff like in sci-fi,\u201d lol.</p> <p>Anyway, do you know this field? What do you think about it? Is it worth specializing in such a complex and niche area in the future, especially if one doesn\u2019t want to stay in academia? I\u2019ve noticed that currently there are still relatively few labs working in this area, probably also because it requires significant costs and a wide range of interdisciplinary knowledge.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",
