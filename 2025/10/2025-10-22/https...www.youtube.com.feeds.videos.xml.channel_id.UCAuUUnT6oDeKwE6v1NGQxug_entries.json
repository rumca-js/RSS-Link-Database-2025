        "description": "The world relies on manufacturing, and manufacturing relies on heat \u2014 a massive contributor to global carbon emissions, responsible for a quarter of the world's fossil fuel use. Energy entrepreneur John O'Donnell has figured out a better, cleaner way to generate the heat we need to make the stuff we want. Learn how his team turned simple bricks and iron wire into a powerful, unconventional \"heat battery\" that could deliver industrial heat at scale without the emissions \u2014 and why he thinks electrified industrial heat is the next trillion-dollar industry.",

These are questions studied by Anil Seth, Professor of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience and the University of Sussex. Anil and Chris reflect on the limitations in describing the brain as a \u201csupercomputer,\u201d the ethical and morally grey areas of technological advancements and brain computer interfaces, and how hallucinogenic drugs affect consciousness.\n\nFollow\nHost: Chris Duffy (Instagram: @chrisiduffy | chrisduffycomedy.com)\nGuest: Anil Seth (Instagram: @profanilseth | LinkedIn: @anilseth | Website: https://www.anilseth.com/) \n\nLinks\nBeing You: A New Science of Consciousness\n\nSubscribe to TED \nInstagram: @ted\nYouTube: @TED\nTikTok: @tedtoks\nLinkedIn: @ted-conferences\nWebsite: ted.com\nPodcasts: ted.com/podcasts\n\nJoin us in person at a TED conference: https://tedtalks.social/events\nBecome a TED Member to support our missio",

        "description": "Imagine this: you walk into a room, and your dog is on a video call with their fellow canine friends. Computer scientist Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas thinks the notion of a social internet for animals is not far off. She explores what happens when animals control their own technology \u2014 from parrots making friends online to monkeys choosing their favorite audio tracks \u2014 and shows how this technology transforms our understanding of animal consciousness.
