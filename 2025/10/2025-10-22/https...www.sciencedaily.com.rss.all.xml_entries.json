Psyllium, probiotics, and magnesium oxide also showed benefits, while common fiber and senna advice fell short. The guidelines emphasize self-management and high-quality evidence, offering practical tools for patients and clinicians alike.",

The two proteins together create stubborn clots that damage blood vessels and spark inflammation in the brain. These effects appear even at very low concentrations and disrupt the blood-brain barrier, paving the way for neurodegeneration. The findings highlight a potential new therapeutic target for early intervention.",
