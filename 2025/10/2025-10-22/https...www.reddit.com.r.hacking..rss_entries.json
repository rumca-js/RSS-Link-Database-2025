During the summer they did the Summer of Making, where you&#39;d get a shell for every hour spent coding and could get a ton of amazing prizes.</p> <p>Now they&#39;re doing Moonshot, where you can even win a Hackathon place in a Hackathon in orlando! Join via moonshot.hack.club/971 and send it to your friends so they can join as well.
