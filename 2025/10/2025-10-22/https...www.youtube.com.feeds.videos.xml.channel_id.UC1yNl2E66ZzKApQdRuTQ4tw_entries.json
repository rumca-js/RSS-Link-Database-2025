Stay fully informed on events around the world with Ground News.\n\nA group of astrophysicists (which does not include Avi Loeb) says they have found evidence of unidentified aerial phenomena in old photographic plates dating back to before the time of the first satellites. The observations are difficult to explain with any known phenomenon and fit best with being of artificial origin. I forgot to mention it, but both of these papers have been peer reviewed. (Though it seems they have been rejected from the arXiv pre-print server.) \n\nPaper 1: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-21620-3\nPaper 2: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ae0afe\n\n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c h",
