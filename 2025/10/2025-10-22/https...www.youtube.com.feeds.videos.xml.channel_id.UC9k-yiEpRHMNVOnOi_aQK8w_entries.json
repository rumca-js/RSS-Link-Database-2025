Police rescued the dad but little Xavier was found dead. In a stunning turn, police say due to \"severity\" of this case, they arrested dad Brandon Padilla-Aguilera, initially booking him for murder. The murder charges were dropped and the dad is now charged with vehicular manslaughter and child abuse/endangerment. He has pleaded not guilty.",
