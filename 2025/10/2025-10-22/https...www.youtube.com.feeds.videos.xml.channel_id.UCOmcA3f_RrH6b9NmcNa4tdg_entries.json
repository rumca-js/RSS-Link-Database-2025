How easy is it to migrate your digital life from Apple to Android? CNET video producer Carly Marsh swapped her iPhone 12 Mini for a Motorola Razr 2025 to find out.\n\nProducer's Note: I reached out to Motorola about the issue I was having with transferring my iPhone messages to the Razr. Their advice was to factory reset the Razr and try the transfer again. When I did this, on the third try seen in this video, it yielded the same results. Motorola also said an update is coming to their Recorder app on the Play Store, and that a future version will support iOS Voice Memos.\n\n00:00 Today I switch from Apple to Android\n00:17 Android's promises\n00:34 Why having an iPhone is kind of culty\n00:54 Why I'm ditching my iPhone for an Android Razr phone\n01:20 Telling my family I'm getting rid of my iPhone\n01:28 A warning from an iPhone user married to an Android user\n02:",

Google, Qualcomm and Samsung are working together to incorporate AI into AR/VR via Android XR, eventually building a line of smart glasses. That whole project begins with this Galaxy XR headset, now available for $1,799. It aims to extend Android and Gemini into new forms and feels as much like a stepping stone as an actual product.
