Going to the theatre meant The Sound of Music or My Fair Lady. Then it was decided I would switch to school in England. So, at 13, I arrived at Westminster school. It was 1968, and the world opened up.</p><p>I went to see a school production of Waiting for Godot in French in a small room with a little stage, and I was sitting at the back. Musically, I was pretty sophisticated \u2013 I already knew about all the psychedelic music that had been happening. I\u2019d seen the Mothers of Invention. I\u2019d seen lots and lots and lots. But I didn\u2019t know there was stuff like this. I suddenly became aware that, just like in music, there was a whole new world out there.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/oct/22/the-play-that-changed-my-life-waiting-for-godot-re",

Neither name stuck, but by 1970, these figures were fixtures of the western political landscape. It helped that hijacking planes was easy. Bag checks, metal detectors and frisking at airports were proposed, only to be dismissed as overkill.</p><p>The result was a lethal carnival of transnational terrorism that peaked in the 70s, when commandeering a plane was as much a rite of passage as backpacking to Kathmandu for some countercultural types. Spanning four continents and drawing on sources in a dozen languages, Jason Burke\u2019s survey of this set combines a flair for period detail \u2013 sideburns and aviator shades, berets and Beretta pistols \u2013 with impressive digests of Arab and Iranian history.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/22/the-revolutionists-by-jason-burke-review-from-hijackings-to-holy",
