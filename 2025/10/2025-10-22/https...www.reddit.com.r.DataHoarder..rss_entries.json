Max out all storage slots on it with SSDs (is there much benefit to using SSDs instead of HDDs). And run a NAS specialised OS on it (like TrueNAS, Unraid OS etc). He also wants to use RAID 5 configuration (Is this feasible). </p> <p>So, I need a server, storage, OS and configuration. I want some more knowledge setting up a NAS from people here.

I just need to know how to do it, does anyone have a good link or step by step to be able to do this? Ill be using my old gaming computer a Intel 10850K, ASUS - ROG STRIX Z490-E GAMING 32gb of DDR4 3200, Intel Arc A770 if that has anything to do with streaming with the plex server. I also want to set up a RAID, and need hard driver recommendations, I will be booting off of a NVME, but want to buy new drives for the Raid open to whatever you recommend.</p> <p>Also super new to the plex server thing is it possible to remotely stream from my server if say I was on vacation?</p> <p>BTW I have newly installed Fiber 1Gbps up and down, another reason I never tried this before as I was stuck with crappy internet and poor upload speeds.</p> ",

I have theorized a system where stashapp points to my NAS where the most current media and the symlinks of older media are present. By automatically mounting bluerays to the correct directory you could continue to see old media on the stashapp frontend and be able to view them simply by inserting the correct blueray into the player. Symbolic links would do the rest. What do you think? Am I delusional or would this be doable? For now it&#39;s all theory, I still have to do some tests. It would be nice to have a direct implementation on stashapp so that if the correct blueray is not present in the player, stashapp itself warns the user to insert the correct disc, perhaps communicating the name chosen during burning.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Event-6258\"> /u/No-Event-6258 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"",
