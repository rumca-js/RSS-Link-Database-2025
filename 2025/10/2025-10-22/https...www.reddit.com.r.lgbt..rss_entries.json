I also may be ranting so you have been warned.</p> <p>Over the past few years, I&#39;ve noticed a frustrating trend of cis women who call themselves allies seemingly treating gay men almost like pets. Expecting them to share the exact same tastes or only liking them if they engage in a stereotypical &quot;yaaaaaas&quot; gay man caricature. It really bothers me how shallow it comes across and homophobic the subtext is. Like I&#39;ve seen quite a few women get the &quot;ick&quot; at masculine presenting gay couples. And that just frustrates me cause I see that and the subtext is &quot;Awwww you guys are cute so long as you show a certian kind of femininity that doesn&#39;t outshine me. You&#39;re a good pet, not an equal.&quot;. And its such bullshit, I can&#39;t even imagine how it is being on the receiving end of that.</p> <p>",

It linguistically separates me into a different &quot;tribe&quot; when I use the politically correct labels. I sound &quot;woke&quot; and they stop listening. I grew up with the word queer as derogatory. But it simplifies the conversation tremendously. And I think there is power in flipping the connotations of a word. </p> <p>I am a recovering conservative. One of my children is in the community and has helped reshape my understanding. Most of my friends are still conservative and religious. I seek out these conversations to show a different truth, not change their minds. When I talk about the many LGTBQIA+ people who have been kind to me in my life, it offers a counter-narrative to what they have been raised with. But when I use the &quot;alphabet soup&quot; as they call it, the point gets lost entirely.</p> <p>This question is not meant to be divisive",
