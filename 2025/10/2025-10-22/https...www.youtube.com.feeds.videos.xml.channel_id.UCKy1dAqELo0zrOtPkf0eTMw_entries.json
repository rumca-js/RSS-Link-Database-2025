        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nHot off the heels of their ASUS collab, the ROG Xbox Ally X, Xbox president Sarah Bond has said that the next Xbox will be a 'premium' console/PC hybrid with a 'very high-end, curated experience.' This has lead many to speculate that the next Xbox following the Series X and S will be considerably more expensive, akin to high-end gaming PCs (a mid-range gaming PC already costs upwards of a thousand dollars). In related news, the price of Xbox development kits has gone up, but considerably more compared to retail consoles. Series X and S dev kits are now selling for $2,000, up 25% from $1,500. And finally, Xbox Game Pass Wave 2 for October has been revealed, and The Outer Worlds 2 leads the pack.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Xbox",

There\u2019s the important details you\u2019d need to identify it by \u2013 simple combat with big super attacks, peacocking bad guys of all shapes and sizes, the subway, casino, and elevator stages required by law to be in games like this \u2013 but none of it feels distinct or special, and the parts in which it's passable get held back by wonky unresponsive controls and maddening difficulty spikes. Revival suggests reinvigoration, but this feels more like exhuming a shambling corpse.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

        "description": "Pokemon Legends: Z-A reviewed by Rebekah Valentine on Nintendo Switch 2, also available on Nintendo Switch 1.\n\nPokemon Legends: Z-A finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokemon\u2019s 3D era. Lumiose City may not be visually thrilling, but exciting Pokemon encounters, well-written characters, and amusing side quests still make it fun to explore while also serving as the ideal vehicle for a more intimate and emotionally mature Pokemon story. Z-A\u2019s total battle system overhaul from turn-based to action also works surprisingly well, managing to be intuitive for series veterans and engaging to play casually while introducing all sorts of intriguing possibilities for deeper, competitive play. And while Z-A could use a little performance help on the Switch 1, it\u2019s a marked improvement from its predecessors and significantly better if you\u2019re playing on Switch 2. After several years of putting the controller down with a deep sigh at the end of a Pokemon review, it sure is refreshing",
