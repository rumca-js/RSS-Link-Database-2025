First released in 2009, the colorful strategy game was an instant hit, adding to developer PopCap's enviable lineup of time-wasters like <em>Peggle</em> and <em>Bejeweled</em>. And now it's been newly remastered so you can relive those days on modern consoles. The updated <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>, dubbed <em>Replanted</em>, is still a great game that stands the test of time - and it's also a depressing reminder of just how badly EA fumbled this franchise.</p>\n<",
