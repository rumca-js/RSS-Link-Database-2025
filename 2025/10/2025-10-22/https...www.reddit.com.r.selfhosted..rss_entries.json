From what I can see, Playit.gg is the best option to avoid portforwarding. I also have AMP Control Panel. Myself and my buddies typically play on a mix of Xbox (me) and PS5 (My buddies). So I&#39;d need a Bedrock Server, on my Unraid Server, via Playit.gg and Amp. Is this possible?</p> <p>If there is a better way of doing it, I am all ears, these are just the options I&#39;ve come across (through my hourrrrssssss of research and failed attempts).</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/delpierro99\"> /u/delpierro99 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1odg3ss/minecraft_unraid_server/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1odg3s",

I currently run jellyseerr, radarr, sonarr, lidarr, prowlarr, jellyfin, sabnzbd, and jellystat. What I want is software that notifies me / tags / automatically deletes (if desired) media that has already been watched by the requestor on jellyseerr, and has been inactive for X days. I want these settings to be customizable because I\u2019m hesitant if I really want it to automatically delete content. Ideally it would show my it\u2019s watch status and days of inactivity and ask if I want to delete it.</p> <p>I have read a bit about maintainerr and janitorr. I like that maintainerr is interactive and has a nice GUI but it seems like it\u2019s more for a plex environment. Janitorr seems like it may be what I want but not as polished. Not sure if either of them meet all my requirements.</p> <p>Can anyone weigh in on this and give me some recommendations? </p> </div><",
