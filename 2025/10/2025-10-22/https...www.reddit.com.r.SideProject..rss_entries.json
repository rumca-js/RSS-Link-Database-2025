I built this because it costs a lot to use other analytics tools like Plausible. They are great but I cannot afford $9 for a site. If you are not making $ and have multiple products up and running, it costs a lot. Google analytics is free but not privacy friendly. That&#39;s where Microlens comes in. It starts with $5 and you can track unlimited web sites. It is working great for me but I am the only user for now. How can I bring more traffic to it or sing ups? I want some people to try it with free trial as it helps me find bugs.

We were constantly building admin panels, dashboards, and customer portals for clients. Every time, we started from scratch - even though most projects were quite similar.</p> <p>That pain led to a side project within our company. I thought, <em>why don\u2019t we build a drag-and-drop builder so our clients could create their own apps?</em> And that\u2019s how the initial idea of <strong>UI Bakery</strong> was born.</p> <p>Of course, a lack of focus and a \u201cservice business\u201d mindset didn\u2019t help. We made tons of mistakes along the way - but eventually, we managed to turn it into a profitable product business.</p> <p>Time flew by, and by the end of 2022, everyone was hyped about ChatGPT. I remember reading a post on Twitter saying: <em>\u201cIf your founder isn\u2019t experimenting with AI, your company won\u2019t exist soon.\u201d</em> I took that as a sign to act.</p> <p>That\u2019s when my <strong>second side project</st",

It is an uptime monitoring tool built specifically for e-commerce websites.<br/> I kept noticing how fragile most e-commerce systems are. One small issue in your hosting and the whole store goes down. Yet most store owners don\u2019t notice until it\u2019s too late.<br/> There are already plenty of uptime tools, but they\u2019re mostly built for devs. I wanted to build one that\u2019s simple, clean, and focused on e-commerce workflows.</p> <p><strong>What it does</strong></p> <ul> <li>Monitors your store and checkout flow in real time</li> <li>Sends alerts when something breaks (email + SMS)</li> <li>Tracks uptime and response time in a neat analytics dashboard</li> <li>Lets you generate quick uptime reports</li> </ul> <p>The idea is to make monitoring accessible for people w",

The idea came from how frustrating it is to find stable, low-latency live TV streams, especially when your internet isn\u2019t great. I wanted to create something clean, fast, and simple that just works. Right now it loads channels in a few seconds and works smoothly on mobile browsers too. It\u2019s still in development,</p> <p>So I\u2019m really looking for feedback from anyone who\u2019s interested in streaming tech or UI/UX, what do you think about the layout and overall speed? Any features you\u2019d want added? I\u2019m happy to share how I built the backend and handled bandwidth optimization if that\u2019s useful to anyone here.
