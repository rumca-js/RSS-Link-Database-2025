I&#39;m native spanish speaker and I want to buy Fourth Wing. The problem is that it has really good reviews in the original language and I don&#39;t want to buy the translation and sacrfice the pure essence of the book. What do you guys suggest me about this. Is buying a translation risky for this kind of book?</p> <p>My English knowledge is basic to good.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Quiet_Sea932\"> /u/Quiet_Sea932 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1odkjtx/fourth_wing_english_or_spanish/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1odkjtx/fourth_wing_english_or_spanish/\">[comments]</a></span>",
