        "description": "Chet Love, a Republican commentator and managing partner at Cornerstone Group, joins Al Jazeera live from Washington. He says the US government system is 'broken,' blaming both parties for repeated shutdowns and the failure to pass a proper budget. Love argues that Congress members shouldn\u2019t be paid during shutdowns and criticizes Democrats for pushing health care spending without proper funding. He adds that Republicans are focused on lowering energy costs and that the current state of US politics suffers from 'entrenched leadership and gerrymandering.'\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\n Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n#USPolitics #GovernmentShutdown #Congress #Republicans #Democrats #AlJazeeraEnglish",

Trump opened their remarks to reporters with a statement of optimism, while acknowledging that a ceasefire has been difficult to achieve. \u201cRegarding Ukraine-Russia, we thought it would be a little bit easier. That\u2019s turned out to be tougher than the Middle East,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe Middle East was supposed to be the tough one, and we\u2019ve solved that puzzle, but this one will get solved also.\u201d Rutte, meanwhile, heaped praise onto Trump, telling the US president that NATO hopes to \u201cbasically deliver on your vision of peace in Ukraine\u201d.\n\nAl Jazeera's Alan Fisher joins live from Washington DC.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.in",

Most egregiously, the Palestinians are not a part of this deal unless it is through semi-covert negotiations with Hamas. They are not heard. Their interests are not adequately represented,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThat said, this is the only game in town. Neither the Israelis nor Hamas were capable of bringing Israel\u2019s genocidal campaign to a halt. Netanyahu lacks the political resolve. Hamas lacks a raison d\u2019\u00eatre for lack of a better term, except for the struggle.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFo",

On June 8, 2024, Israeli special forces disguised as Palestinians carried out a covert operation in the Nuseirat refugee camp, aimed at rescuing four captives held by Hamas. At the same time, the Israeli military launched heavy air raids, and the two-pronged attack targeted private homes, public markets and alleyways full of civilians.\n\nAt least 274 Palestinians were killed, and hundreds were injured. This film presents witness accounts of the horror that day, revealing the speed and intensity of the attacks, the lack of safe passage and the bloody aftermath. Witnesses describe how their families, wives and children were threatened and some killed before their eyes, in a rare snapshot of a day that devastated a whole community.\n \n#nuseirat274 #palestine #israel #hamas #Gaza #AlJazeeraWorld #documentary",
