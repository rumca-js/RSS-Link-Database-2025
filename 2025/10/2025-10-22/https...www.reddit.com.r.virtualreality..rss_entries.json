I use Open Composite and OpenXR toolkit to get it to work, and VD is rightly set up to VDXR. Yet when I launch my steam game, it doesnt work. By that, i dont mean it crashes, or anything like that, it simply launches the games normally (without VR), as if I didn&#39;t have VR setup. So I dont really know what to do to get it to work...

While I&#39;d sometimes see black borders at the very edge of my vision if I turned my head quickly, the overall image kept a good framerate and overall clarity.</p> <p>Recently, I borrowed a Quest 2 to get back into PCVR, specifically for Alyx and Skyrim VR.

I can clearly see compression artifacts. As I suspect, this is likely because the image has to be encoded on my PC, transferred over the network and then decoded by t",

I\u2019d also like to use it for <strong>PCVR</strong> since I\u2019ve got a <strong>4090 GPU</strong>, and I want to play demanding games at high quality on either headset, but I\u2019ve heard the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have great PCVR compatibility yet.</p> <p>So, what would you go for?

Every game I play in is at least 90% kids, which is fine, but also not the type of people I want to play with. Are there any discord servers for adults who play VR games?
