(Yes, free. From Nintendo. We&#39;re shocked too, but we&#39;ll take it.) The update, which arrives in November, adds Fierce mode to make the game more challenging for those who want it. We don&#39;t know exactly what that will look like yet, but a higher difficulty level is a welcome addition to a game that is, for many players including myself, absolutely delightful but much too easy. It may not reach <em>Pikmin 2</em> heights still, but maybe we&#39;ll see enemies respawn?&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBtBDFzu9ZA?rel=0\" style=\"top:0;left:0;width:100%",
