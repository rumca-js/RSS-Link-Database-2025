I loved the first 3 and really liked BSC, but The Heroes for me was just so engaging and raw in a way that I&#39;ve never seen before in a standalone book. The plot is tight and was so condensed it had this intensely claustrophobic feeling the entire time.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have mainly read mainstream fantasy the last couple of years. Things most people know (with exception of Lord of Mystery). And i wanted to find out about some indie titles. Specificly online published free fantasy works. I can imagine that among the thousands, if not millions of stories that floats on the various self publishing sites, that there their own gems. Would like to explore it a bit. Best of course would high fantasy with interesting magic/power system. I like those the most. But i do enjoy ones that are outside the norm too.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sythrin\"> /u/Sythrin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1od288q/recommend_me_some_online_self_published_stories/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1od288q/recommend_me_some_online_self_published_stories/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Like they&#39;d go out of their way to help strangers not expecting something back. I really got tired of the MC who&#39;s just evil, cold, calculated, anti hero and that type. At first I enjoyed them but I quickly found them repetitive.</p> <p>The MC don&#39;t need to be a literal saint that would help everyone, but they also must have a moral compass and mustn&#39;t turn a blind eye on those in front of them.</p> <p>Things I like in a novel that I&#39;d like to see but not required. 1-The MC should have some stakes in the book, like they shouldn&#39;t be able to defeat anyone or win everytime. 2-I really love side characters, so I really want to see some well fleshed out side cast. 3-Preferably not litrpg or system based. 4-Preferably not reincarnated or isekai. I&#39;d prefer if they were native to the world.</p> <p>Thanks in advance. As I said those points aren&#39;t require",

From the outset I found Aru hard to like, especially because she tells many lies to her friends in an effort to be popular and fit in. I don&#39;t mind a flawed character, but this was too much, and made it difficult to identify with her. Then it turns out that Aru is a demi-god who is daughter of a god from the Hindu pantheon, and she is half-divine. This kind of thing will sou",
