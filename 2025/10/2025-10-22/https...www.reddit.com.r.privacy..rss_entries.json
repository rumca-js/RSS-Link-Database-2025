Felt weird so started googling and everything points to potential scam. I still have small hope that it&#39;s legit because recruiter is still responding to my messages but feeling very doubtful. </p> <p>I sent them a photo copy of my full driver license, so they have that plus address, email, name, phone, and last four digits of SSN. And resume of course. </p> <p>Luckily not full SSN and didn&#39;t do any type of payment transactions.</p> <p>But still quite a bit of personal info, so just wondering what should I do next, if anything? Report stolen license to DMV? My guess is going to be used for identity theft. </p> <p>Thanks for any help. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",
