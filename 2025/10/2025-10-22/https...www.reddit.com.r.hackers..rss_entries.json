I am also working on an open source project aimed at addressing some of these challenges, but I am not here to promote it. I am here to listen.</p> <p>From your own experience: - What parts of your workflow cause the most friction or burnout? - Which problems keep you up at night, alert fatigue, tool bloat, data overload, or something else entirely? - How much do issues like poor visibility, disconnected tools, weak evidence tracking, or static policies slow you down?</p> <p>Based on surveys like the SANS research series and academic papers, I am seeing recurring themes around data volume, alert fatigue, fragmented tooling, and disorganized reporting, but I would really like to validate that with first hand experience from people in the trenches.</p> <p>My goal is simple, to gather real world insights that can guide an open source",
