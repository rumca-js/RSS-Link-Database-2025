But even then, while travelling, carrying around a telescopic controller is a hassle, cause it&#39;s not pocket-friendly at all, so I was looking for a more compact, pocket-friendly controller. I recently saw on Twitter about the M4 snap-on controller, pretty small and perfect to use for travelling. If anyone else has any other recommendations like this, then pls do let me know.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/darth0001\"> /u/darth0001 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1od3bbc/i_am_pretty_hyped_for_abxylute_m4/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1od3bbc/i_am_pretty_hyped_for_abxylute",

They didn&#39;t call and inform me because they had a sister property that was a 20 minute drive away, and the would accommodate me. I told the manager twice that I only picked the hotel because it was literally across the street, and I didn&#39;t reserve a room at Hotel Eastlund or the Hyatt fast enough. </p> <p>Long story short, I found a hotel with a room within walking distance, but the manager at the Inn refused to provide documentation, images, or let me see any damages for travel insurance, which is his right.
