Social media, news feeds, and streaming platforms are all optimized for user retention, engagement, and ad revenue, and this, most of the time, comes at the cost of the users well-being.</p> <p><strong>Solution?</strong></p> <p>This is why I felt inclined to build a centralized place where you control what you consume. Social media feeds, news sources, email newsletters, everything converges in one space, on your terms. Prioritising user control over lock-in, prioritising user choice over endless slop.</p> <p>The app is not live yet, but I do have a waitlist if you want to be kept updated.</p> <p><a href=\"https://openfeeds.app?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=introduction\">openfeeds.app</a></p> <p>But mostly I just wanna know what&#39;d make a tool like this actual",
