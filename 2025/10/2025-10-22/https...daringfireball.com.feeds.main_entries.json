Driver had\nundertaken the trilogy with an arc in mind for Ren that inverted\nthe journey of Darth Vader. As the trilogy evolved, it didn\u2019t play\nout that way. Driver felt there was unfinished business for Kylo\nRen, or as he was known before turning to the Dark Side, Ben Solo.</p>\n\n<p>Soderbergh and Rebecca Blunt outlined a story that the group then\npitched to Kennedy, Lucasfilm vice president Cary Beck and\nLucasfilm chief creative officer Dave Filoni. They were\ninterested, so the filmmakers then pulled in Scott Z. Burns to\nwrite a script. Driver calls the result \u201cone of the coolest\n(expletive) scripts I had ever been a part of.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe presented the script to Lucasfilm. They loved the idea.
