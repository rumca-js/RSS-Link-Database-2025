Since I mostly use linux I&#39;ve put it on there as the main operating system, everything works well except for the battery life.</p> <p>From what I&#39;ve gathered it&#39;s in performance mode where the dedicated gpu is receiving power at all times. So I tried setting it to Hybrid via supergfxctl, yet the dedicated card is still active. The integrated gpu serms to not be exposed to the system as a valid display adapter. </p> <p>Apparently, Armoury Crate offers a setting to switch it to Hybrid and allow me access to the iGPU, but dual booting Windows and checking that gave no results either. Either the interface changed a lot and it&#39;s under a different name there or I&#39;m looking in the wrong place. </p> <p>As of right now I&#39;m stuck on what to do to get it set up properly, any help is greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

After a good few hours of debugging I found that the lib32-amdvlk was the source of this problem, likely related to the fact that AMDVLK was <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMDVLK-Discontinued\">discontinued about a month ago</a> and subsequently taken off the Arch repos. I wasn&#39;t aware of this at all, and for some reason had AMDVLK as my only 32-bit Vulkan driver, so it was simply a matter of installing <code>lib32-vulkan-radeon</code> and then uninstalling <code>lib32-amdvlk</code> and everything was back to working fine, with no noticeable difference in performance. I&#39;m not sure if this is a problem on any other distros, but if anyone else on Arch has come across the same problem I hope this helps. Happy gaming!</p> </div><!-- SC",
