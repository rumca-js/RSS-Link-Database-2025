        "description": "<p>Liverpool banished the spectre of a fifth successive defeat with a five-goal rout of Eintracht Frankfurt plus several ticks on Arne Slot\u2019s wish list. There was set-piece prowess, two assists from Florian Wirtz, ruthless finishing and, most importantly of all, that winning feeling again as Liverpool brought their losing streak to a shuddering halt.</p><p>Slot\u2019s team conceded first yet again but that, and a subdued 45 minute display from Alexander Isak, were only minor complaints on a night when the Premier League champions rediscovered their edge. Their head coach deserves credit for several bold moves that underpinned a sizeable improvement and ensured all three of Eintracht\u2019s Champions League games this season have finished 5-1.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/22/eintracht-frankfurt-liverpool-champions-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",
