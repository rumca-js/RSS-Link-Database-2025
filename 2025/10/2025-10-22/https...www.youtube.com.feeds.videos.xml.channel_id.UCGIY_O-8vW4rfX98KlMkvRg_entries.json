        "description": "Mariooo, where are you?\n\nOne day, Luigi received the unexpected news that he'd won a huge mansion! Overjoyed, he called up Mario and invited him to celebrate the exciting news. But after arriving at the mansion and searching for Mario, who should have arrived first, Luigi is attacked by a ghost! After being saved from danger by Professor E. Gadd, Luigi expresses his panic that Mario is nowhere to be found. Luckily for Luigi, this professor has the perfect tools for the occasion! Now, armed with the Poltergust 3000 and a Game Boy\u2122 Horror gifted by the professor, Luigi must explore the frightening mansion to find Mario in this action adventure game originally released for the Nintendo GameCube\u2122 system in 2001. Shine your flashlight on ghosts to surprise them, then suck them up with the Poltergust 3000. When ghosts try to run away, the trick is to quickly tilt the stick in the opposite direction and back again repeatedly to weaken them.\n\nVisit Nintendo.com for more info: https://ninten.d",
