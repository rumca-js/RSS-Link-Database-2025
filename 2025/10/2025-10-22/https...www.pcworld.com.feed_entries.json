Today, Best Buy is offering a 15-inch HP laptop with 16GB of memory <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/product/hp-15-6-full-hd-laptop-amd-ryzen-7-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-natural-silver/JJGH2LXT99\">for just $449.99</a>\u2014a nice $350 off its retail price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The HP 15-FC0307DX is definitely on the lower end of specs, especially since the AMD Ryzen 7 5825U processor and DDR4 RAM are a little long in the tooth. But that older processor is still packing 8 cores and a surprisingly capable integrated graphics setup, and 16GB of RAM is nothing to sneeze at, especially paired with 1TB of SSD storage. That should be more than enough to handle all your Windows 11 basics and plenty of web browsing, plus some light gaming on th",

One of my favorites is the Eufy SoloCam S220 security camera, and today\u2019s an excellent day to snag one because <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ55JZ4S/\">it\u2019s 40% off on Amazon</a> (now $59.99, was $99.99). Be sure to clip the on-page digital coupon for that extra discount!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing the Eufy SoloCam S220 is a breeze. You just have to pick a spot, screw in the mount, and snap the camera into place. Then all you have to do is pair it with the Eufy app on your phone, connect it to your Wi-Fi network, and done! No wires or batteries to fiddle with either thanks to the built-in solar panel that keeps it powered day after day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that\u2019s all done, it captures super-cl",

Pan/tilt models, like the all-new Tapo C615F KIT, can monitor much more ground, but their high voltage requirements usually mean they must be hardwired to your home\u2019s electrical system, putting severe constraints on where they can be installed unless you hire an electrician.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not the case here: The Tapo C615F KIT not only runs on a 10,400mAh rechargeable battery, but it also comes with a large solar panel that can keep that battery perpetually topped off. Voila! You can mount this camera/floodlight combo just about anywhere its panel will be exposed to the sun. The $250 Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight Camera (Battery) is probably its closest competitor, but that unit has a fixed-position 2K camera and a solar panel is a $50 option.</p>\n\n\n\n",
