I looked through some recent posts on Discord and things seemed stalled. I made a negative post, nothing out of line, the worst I said was calling it vaporware. I got a nice reply explaining why I was wrong, and I meant to go back and look into it more. I was seriously considering buying a founders edition this week, but when I went to Discord I found I&#39;ve been banned from the server! I posted almost this exact message to their reddit, and it was removed within minutes. If they&#39;re not open to any discussion, then I guess I&#39;m not ordering after all... And if they&#39;re actively removing anything that&#39;s critical, then people should be aware their forums are biased. </p> <p>",

I know this Reddit is more about VR, but I think it&#39;s still very interesting for people that have a VR headset. I recently got my hands on the new <strong>Meta Ray-Ban Display</strong>. As someone who lives and breathes this stuff, I had to know: is this the next big step in wearables, or just an expensive, overhyped gadget?</p> <p>After spending a lot of time with it, I&#39;ve compiled my detailed thoughts. This isn&#39;t just a spec sheet rundown; this is about how it <em>feels</em> to use this thing in the real world.</p> <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The Meta Ray-Ban Display is a genuinely fascinating piece of future tech with moments of pure magic. The private display and the Neural Band gesture control feel revolutionary. However, it&#39;s held back by some bizarre software limitations, a bulky case, and an acquisition process that makes it a product strictly for hardcore early adopters right now. ",

I recently bought a Meta Quest 3 and also purchased the official Link Cable because I thought that was the best way to connect it to my PC for PCVR gaming. But now I keep hearing people say that the best experience is with Virtual Desktop (or Air Link) and that I should get a dedicated 5 GHz or 6 GHz Wi-Fi router just for that. Here\u2019s my situation: I already opened the cable and can\u2019t return it now. I\u2019d honestly rather just use the cable if I can still get a good experience. I\u2019m hearing that cable connection can be worse than wireless for VR, which is confusing. I\u2019m totally new to PCVR, so I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m missing something.</p> <p>Here are my PC specs: CPU: Ryzen 7 5700X GPU: RTX 4060 Ti RAM: 32 GB DDR4 Storage: 1 TB NVMe SSD OS: Windows 11</p> <p>This is a pretty new build, so I assume it should be strong enough for PCVR ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey, I&#39;m a pretty new VRChat user, using Quest 2 with VIVE Ultimate tracker 3+1 package, PCVR. I was wondering if there was a headset that supports or has integrated face/eye tracking, compatible with the trackers and mainly PCVR, good to use with other games like H3VR and games. Also wondering, is face tracking worth it? I personally think my trackers were worth, not sure if face tracking will also be. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sharkgorawr\"> /u/sharkgorawr </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nxln71/faceeye_tracking_headsets/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nxln71/faceeye_tracking_headsets/\">[comments]</a></span>",
