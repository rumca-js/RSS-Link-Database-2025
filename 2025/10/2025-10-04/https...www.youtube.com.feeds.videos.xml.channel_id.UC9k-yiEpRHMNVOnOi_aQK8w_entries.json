        "description": "In May 2005, then-8-year-old Shasta Groene and her brother, 9, were kidnapped by convicted serial killer and child molester Joseph Edward Duncan after he murdered their family. The kidnapping sparked a nationwide manhunt until Shasta, the sole survivor of the atrocity, was found months later. Now, 20 years after the tragedy, Shasta speaks to Inside Edition Digital about her new book, \"Out of the Woods\" and the tragedy that altered her life forever and what her days are like now.
