The film shifts between power fantasy, cautionary tale and sci-fi thriller, but never fully locks into one. That might bother some people, but for me it worked.</p> <p>It gives you space. You can just enjoy the momentum, or start noticing what sits underneath. Identity, ambition, control, addiction. It doesn\u2019t explain much, and that\u2019s what I liked about it.</p> <p>The film doesn\u2019t pretend to be deep, but something stays with you. Not loud or dramatic, just a quiet weight that builds over time.</p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t call it a masterpiece, but I\u2019d still be interested in seeing more from that world.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve seen it recently, how did it land for you?

I just randomly decided to watch it and wow, what an emotionally powerful movie. The kind of movie that leaves you thinking about it far after the credits roll. It leaves a pit in your stomach. I guess as a kid the emotional nuances of great movies don\u2019t really grab hold of you. I feel like I watched it for the first time.
