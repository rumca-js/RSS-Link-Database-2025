One sold used cars, the other distributed brake pads and spark plugs. Both issued debt rated AAA. Now their bonds are trading at cents on the dollar\u2014and Wall Street is pretending not to notice.\nIn this video, we dig into down the bankruptcies of Tricolor Holdings and First Brands Group to understand what they reveal about private credit, and why supposedly safe securities are starting to look a lot less safe. We\u2019ll look at hidden leverage, double-pledged collateral, shadow banking, and the growing disconnect between risk and reward in today\u2019s credit markets.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\n",
