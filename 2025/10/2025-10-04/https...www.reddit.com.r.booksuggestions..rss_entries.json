This isn\u2019t your typical dry economic history it\u2019s a raw look at how capitalism grew out of chaos: pirates, alchemists, and con artists, long before it put on a suit and called itself an economic system.</p> <p>The book argues that capitalism didn\u2019t just create new markets it created a new type of person: cold, calculating, and driven by schemes. It draws a direct line from 17th-century hustlers pitching wild projects to today\u2019s crypto bros and startup founders, and the comparison is unsettling. What stuck with me is the book\u2019s explanation for why our economy feels both innovative and predatory. It\u2019s not a bug it\u2019s a feature. The system was built by visionaries and exploiters, and that tension has been there from the start.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",

These are the ones I&#39;ve listened to already:</p> <p>Top 10: Red rising series, Stormlight archive, Sun eater, Wheel of time, First law, Realm of the elderling, Project hail mary, Gentlemen bastard sequence, The faithful and the fallen, Mistborn,</p> <p>Other series/stand alone in no particular order: Rest of the cosmere, Bloodsworn, The devils, Song of ice and fire, Of blood and bone, The green bone saga, Sword of kaigen, Babel, Broken empire,</p> <p>I enjoyed all of these books apart from maybe babel, so not too sure about reading anything else from that author.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",

So as a kid I loved the May Bird trilogy, which is basically about a girl that gets trapped in the underworld/like a ghost world? and anyway it\u2019s about her trying to escape and she travels all across the ghost world and it\u2019s a little scary but has a lot of great characters and it was my favorite. I guess I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any suggestions for like a kinda scary adventure book for like adults? I think what I really liked about the book was the world/world building so maybe something with really good world building. Sorry if this is too specific, I completely understand if no one has any suggestions I just thought a similar book would be cool to read. (Also wasn\u2019t sure which flair to use, but I think fantasy is the closest to what I was thinking). Thank you for reading if you did!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hldiet1400\"> /",
