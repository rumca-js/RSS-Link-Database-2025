They\u2019re a boon to both desktop and laptop users. While portable monitors might not reach the large screen sizes of conventional displays, they offer other advantages: They are relatively inexpensive, easy to connect, and, best of all, easy to transport \u2014 whether that\u2019s to a different city for work, or to a different room in your house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the widespread availability of these displays and the ability to manufacture them cheaply has resulted in some questionable brands on the market. Often the quality of these monitors can be sub-par. That\u2019s where we at PCWorld come in. We\u2019ve tested multiple models and can separate the best portable monitors from the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our list of favorites below will help you find the right portable monitor for you.
