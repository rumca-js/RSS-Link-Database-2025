But would like to better scale our risk and compliance programs. Maybe a bit of TPRM as well. </p> <p>For risk it looked like drata was limited to FAIR or &quot;custom Monte Carlo&quot;. Navex seems to have a nist 53 RA that has me interested. We don&#39;t specifically need that but I want a decent Risk product. I didn&#39;t hate dratas version of FAIR but I&#39;d want to enhance it quite a bit with custom fields. </p> <p>I&#39;m hearing drata might be better for evidence collection, automation but i don&#39;t have fedramp to worry about. Other navex seems better? </p> <p>Any other perspectives on how these 2 compare? </p> <p>In this market especially, would either be more marketable for my next gig? Id prob grab dratas cert but navex doesn&#39;t offer one. </p> <p>I do like supporting a Portland brand over San Diego. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello \u2014 quick question for the community: I often turn on Bluetooth in crowded places (market, hotel, school) and keep my wireless earbuds connected. I\u2019ve heard claims that having Bluetooth on in public can let attackers \u201chack\u201d you. Is that true or false?</p> <p>Can someone explain, in simple terms, what the realistic risks are (e.g., eavesdropping, device takeover, pairing attacks) and what defensive steps I should take to reduce risk, and what tools are used to do this?</p> <p>Also \u2014 if you can, please list the <strong>research / defensive tools</strong> used by security professionals to test Bluetooth in a lab environment (I\u2019m studying with Kali Linux). I\u2019m only asking for defensive/educational purposes and will not use anything on other people\u2019s devices or networks without explicit permission.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ChemistImpossible694\"> /u/ChemistImpossible",
