By silencing key genes, EZH2 drives chaotic cell divisions and fuels metastasis. Blocking EZH2 restored stability and prevented cancer cells from traveling to distant organs. This discovery opens the door to new therapies that may finally tame this aggressive disease.",

The findings also show that obesity and body mass index significantly influence mortality, and that each additional risk factor compounds the danger.",
