        "description": "Schluter DITRA-HEAT thermostat installation tips\u2026I connect the ground braid to the Romex ground with a wire nut. The 12/2 Romex wires go into the Line terminals, hot goes into L1 and neutral into L2N. The heat cable wires go into the Load terminals and the sensor wires feed to the C and D slots.
