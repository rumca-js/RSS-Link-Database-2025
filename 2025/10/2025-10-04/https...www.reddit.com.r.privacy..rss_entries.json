My boomer/gen x dad is dead set on keeping our Ring camera, even after I\u2019ve tried multiple times to explain why it\u2019s not the best choice for privacy. He insists we need it for safety, and every time I bring up switching, I get the same usual pushback like \u201cthe government already knows everything,\u201d \u201cwe\u2019ve got nothing to hide,\u201d \u201cthey can\u2019t do [bad thing], it\u2019s illegal,\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s too much work.\u201d It\u2019s become really frustrating. </p> <p>So, I\u2019m looking for any existing security camera alternatives that are easy to use (on iOS), set up, and maintain. Preferably something that doesn\u2019t require IT skills (I read through a couple posts here that talked about DIY stuff for example), though I don\u2019t mind it as long as there are any videos/guides I can follow. </p> <p>The most important thing is that it\u2019s simple for him to switch to, with an easy learning curve (I\u2019ll need to pitch this to him and convince him first, so anything I can sell him on is a plus).",
