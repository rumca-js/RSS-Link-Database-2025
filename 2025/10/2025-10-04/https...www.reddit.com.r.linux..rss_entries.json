        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So Gnome had always been the enemy to me, almost as bad as windows for promoting their wayland future and foreign interfaces. Always preferred floating wms like fluxbox and icewm and xfce4 for adhering to a traditional metaphor of the desktop. But it turns out, if you install Dash to Panel and Arc Menu and tune a few settings you can make Gnome traditional. Also, wayland wasn&#39;t that bad. Didn&#39;t see a way to give the file manager or terminal emulator a traditional menu system but it was usable and I was able to fix this up in I think 20 min. I could actually see myself using gnome if I needed to with these plugins. I could see my family using it too. Sure I&#39;ll stick to xfce and fluxbox for now but Gnome... not as bad as I feared it. I hadn&#39;t touched Gnome since Gnome 3 first came out many many moons ago.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kyleW_ne\"> /u/kyleW_ne </a> <br/> <span><a href",
