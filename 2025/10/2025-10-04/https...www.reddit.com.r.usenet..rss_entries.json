Just recently in the magazines and comics groups I\u2019ve been seeing a ton of files coming over with a .cne extension and the word \u201cIRap\u201d afterwards and the letter XO or ZO. Is that someone spamming the group, or is it intended to be an actual file? Most of the files are incomplete as well. Any info on this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Parking_Bet\"> /u/Parking_Bet </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ny5g3u/posts_with_unusual_kinds_of_files/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ny5g3u/posts_with_unusual_kinds_of_files/\">[comments]</a></span>",
