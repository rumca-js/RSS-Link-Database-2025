I&#39;ll summarize it and say that I much preferred the 1818 text as the revisions and added text to the 1831 version felt a bit off toneally, pacing, and didn&#39;t fit with the darker aspects of Frankenstein&#39;s narrative.</p> <p>There&#39;s not much else I can say that hasn&#39;t already been discussed a thousand times over. But my literary love for Frankenstein as a gothic horror masterpiece has solidified itself and became stronger on my second read through. I haven&#39;t felt as strong of emotions as reading other gothic texts as I have with this one. The way Shelley was able to describe the pitfalls, empathy, tragedy, and selfishness of the Monster, Frankenstein, and other major characters added so much to the overall themes. Also, I forgot just how beautiful and descriptive the prose was for anything involving nature and the vari",
