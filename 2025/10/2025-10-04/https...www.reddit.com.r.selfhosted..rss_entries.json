Using a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/srcreigh/2bc8687aace702698d4b8b0b51637bc5\">small python script I wrote</a>, you can use mitmproxy to filter out ads from the reddit API.</p> <p>This method is the result of a full day&#39;s worth of testing and tweaking, so please be nice :)</p> <h2>Disclaimer</h2> <p>This is very new method, and may not work and may cause issues.</p> <p>Some people get different API response shapes. The addon works for me but doesn&#39;t support other API shapes yet. The addon is simple python code so you can try to fix it for your API shape and maybe share the result.</p> <p>This temporarily broke the home feed on my account once.
