My GPU is an AMD RX 5600 XT and my CPU is an AMD Ryzen 5 3600. Due to Denuvo lockouts, I&#39;ve only been able to test GE-Proton10-15 and GE-Proton10-17.</p> <p>Every time I digivolve or de-digivolve a Digimon, there is a moderate chance that one of two possible crashes occurs, either during or within a few seconds of the (de-)digivolution animation playing: 1) The game screen turns yellow and freezes. The computer no longer accepts any input. Other windows will continue playing audio for a few seconds before they also stop. The only way out of this is to force power off the computer. 2) All three of my monitors glitch out. Everything stops for a few seconds before returning. All three monitors stay glitched out but the game does continue to run in the background. Sometimes all three monitors will go black, with squares made of random red, green, and blue",
