Back in the day I used Google Reader (RIP), then moved to fully algorithmic news apps, and for a while I was getting most of my \u201cnews\u201d from X and YouTube feeds. It always felt like I was stuck inside a filter bubble.</p> <p>By chance, a failed side project left me with a bunch of web-crawling tools. I repurposed them into a topic-subscription news app. Instead of following publishers or feeds, you subscribe to topics\u2014anything from a specific company like <em>OpenAI</em> to broader things like <em>natural disasters in Oregon</em>. The app filters for high-signal, strongly related items and sends you push notifications for the important stuff.</p> <p>It\u2019s still super bare-bones (just me and a few friends have tested it) and stability isn\u2019t great yet. But a friend suggested I invite more people to try it.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested, please join the Discord Server <a href=\"https://discord.gg/nXhPcnZgws\">https://d",
