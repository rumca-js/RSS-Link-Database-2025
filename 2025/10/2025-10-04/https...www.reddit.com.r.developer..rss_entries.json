I know I\u2019m late, but better late than never, right?</p> <p>Next semester I\u2019ll have to make my final year project, so I\u2019m planning to learn Flutter. Mainly to build the FYP, but also as a fallback plan in case I need to start earning or freelance. Later on, I want to move towards ML or Data Science once I\u2019ve got some base.</p> <p>For people already in the field, how\u2019s Flutter doing these days? Can you actually get a job or freelance projects with it if you\u2019re good enough? Or Should i go towards fullstack web dev (Not my First option for fyp because its gonna take alot more time to learn, and maybe alot more saturated but Flutter has less opportunities? , I am clearly confused) ?</p> <p>Would love to hear some honest advice from devs or seniors who\u2019ve been in the same spot.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",

That&#39;s pretty scary but AI is not supossed to process something itself because of its simple architecture of educated guessing, the reason we even made computers is because the our brain&#39;s neural network is a guesser not a calculator, it still has the element of chance and by making AI&#39;s handle alot of the computer work, were removing its main selling feature. It&#39;s not all bad though sense AI could understand complex structures that cannot be understood by hardcoding things, like knowning whats in an image, voice to text, understanding paragraphs and digesting information that is too complex, etc. What I want tell you basically is that AI is not ",
