I looked on Amazon (since it&#39;s the one shopping service I have an account for) and saw some for sale that were reasonably priced, but I was curious if there might be somewhere else to turn to. Especially with the games, some of the old games (like Pokemon and LOZ Majora&#39;s Mask) can be pretty pricey. Can anyone give me some advice on where I can go for a better deal?

My 12 year old son just read Ready Player One and is super into Joust and interested in 80s games in general now. I\u2019d love to get him something he can play when he\u2019s at his grandparents. </p> <p>Ideal system would plug into their TV using hdmi, have two controllers so he can play with his sister, and be loaded with old games. I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Atari or NES or whatever. And I\u2019d love it to be plug-and-play - no loading ROMs or reconfiguring or Raspberry Pi-ing. Also: on a bit of a budget so nothing over $100 ideally. (And $50 would be better). 20 games are fine, I don\u2019t need 1,000. </p> <p>What\u2019s my best bet?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bkdyt\"> /u/Bkdyt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1nxikkl/best_allinone_system_",
