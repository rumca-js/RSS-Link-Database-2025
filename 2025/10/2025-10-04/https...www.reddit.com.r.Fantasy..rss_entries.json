I don&#39;t have anything against this in theory - especially as someone who works in marketing - but there are some issues here:</p> <ol> <li>We have to assume that every reader means the same thing when they use the term &#39;cosy fantasy&#39;.</li> <li>There are always going to be books that don&#39;t reach the right audience when they&#39;re marketed under a larger subgenre umbrella, missing the readers who might have loved it but don&#39;t think they like books that are labelled as cosy fantasy. Sometimes because they should never have been marketed under that subgenre in the first place\u2014but there are so many books and only so much time to market them all in.</li> </ol> <p>This is all to say that",

The world of Tamriel is one of the most interesting and beautiful fantasy worlds I\u2019ve seen created. It feels well balanced and thought out for a fantasy world. But that\u2019s before I even dived into the lore. Oh my word the lore of this game is so, so fascinating. The metaphysical part of the lore. The cosmology of the universe, the pantheon of gods. The history of the lands and races. Epic battles and wars. Unique cultures and mythologies. Lore and history that is not definitive but instead could be open to interpretation just like our real world history. It\u2019s unique take on certain common fantasy tropes. It\u2019s all so well made. Now video game universes can be cool but they often pale in comparison to settings/worlds that appear in books. But I honestly believe The Elder Scrolls is right alo",

The way she described the tents, the colors, the strange illusions, it was the closest thing to dreaming with my eyes open. I could almost smell the caramel in the air and hear the crackling of torches. later I got a similar feeling with *Uprooted* by Naomi Novik, when the forest felt alive and threatening but also strangely beautiful. I think that\u2019s my favorite part of fantasy, those rare moments where the setting itself feels like it has a pulse, like it\u2019s more than just a backdrop. for me, those worlds are the ones I end up revisiting again and again.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/W00den_Spoon4\"> /u/W00den_Spoon4 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nxqp7v/which_fantasy_setting_made_you_feel_like_you_were/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comm",
