I wanted a single app that could handle all my tasks. So, I set out to build PrioSpace with a few key objectives in mind: it would be <strong>free forever</strong>, have <strong>no hidden paywalls</strong>, be <strong>open-source</strong>, and <strong>fully private</strong>.</p> <p>Today, this project has surpassed 450 stars on GitHub. Consequently, I have developed a stable version and released it on the App Store, incorporating additional themes, automatic startup for Macs, and significant bug fixes.</p> <p>I\u2019m delighted to hear your feedback and suggestions. Your contributions on GitHub are greatly appreciated.</p> <p>Try it out: <a href=\"https://prio.space/home\">https://prio.space/home</a><br/> Upvote on Product Hunt: <a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/products/priospa",
