        "description": "Thousands of migrants from sub-Saharan Africa wait near the coast in Tunisia for an opportunity to make the treacherous voyage across the Mediterranean. Under an agreement signed with the European Union, the Tunisian government does what it can to stop them. NGOs and migrants accuse the Tunisian coastguard of deliberately sinking migrant boats at sea, leaving those on board to drown. Others say migrants are regularly bused out to the desert and abandoned. We investigate these allegations and meet the humans caught in the crossfire of a political battle over migration.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X : https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDownload AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n #migrants #tunisia #documentary \n#aljazeera\n#aljazeeraenglish\n#aljazeeranewslive",

With international media barred from freely reporting in the Strip, local journalists have risked their lives to document the unprecedented killing, destruction and displacement around them.\n\nSince October 7, 2023, more media workers have been killed in Gaza than in any modern conflict. Families have been torn apart, homes and offices destroyed, and reporters have been wounded, seen their families killed or have been killed themselves.\n\nThis episode reveals the extraordinary playbook employed by Israel to threaten, intimidate, smear and target Palestinian journalists.\n\nContributors:\nWael Dahdouh \u2013 Gaza Bureau Chief, Al Jazeera\nJodie Ginsberg \u2013 Chief Executive, Committee to Protect Journalists\nSharif Abdel Kouddous \u2013 Journalist & Editor, Drop Site News\nRachel Shabi \u2013 Journalist and author\n\nPresenter: Richard Gizbert\nProduced by: Soumaya El Filali, Monazz",

It means that Israel must prepare its negotiation team to talk details, to talk maps, how the withdrawals will happen, and how the release of Israeli and Palestinian captives will happen.\n\nAnd in the meantime, the Israeli army is warning people not to return to the north.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Nour Odeh reports.\n\nSo it\u2019s not a ceasefire, it\u2019s not an end to the war, it\u2019s almost a pause \u2013 but still very precarious and the hours ahead \u2013 as the momentum builds \u2013 will be very telling on which direction things will go.\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X : https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.alj",
