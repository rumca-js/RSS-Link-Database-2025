I&#39;m targeting 24-26TB drives, effectively doubling my space. I&#39;m seeing ~$500 drives plus tax for this capacity class of drives. I&#39;m curious if any of you have recommendations for deals in this range while retaining 5 year warranties.</p> <p>Are there sales I could look out for? Anything new coming out soon which would push down the price of these drives? Tips on getting bulk discounts?
