In know I might be too optimistic and childish but I\u2019m open for criticism.</p> <p>So I believe that by approximately start of 2026 we will get a whole new video model that will master physics and 3D environments. AI will have the ability to create CGI and even entire scenes from just description. We would discover that some Hollywood movies were filmed completely (or mostly) by AI. We will probably get new LLM\u2019s but they probably won\u2019t be revolutionary.</p> <p>In mid 2026 we will see Genie 3 public release and Genie 4. Besides that Google (or other AI company) will try to combine video models like VEO with world models like Genie 3 to give user more precise control over video generation.

Say you are having a quarrel with someone, you explain the situation and the AI/LLM says &quot;Well this and that should be attempted next&quot;, it&#39;s great and helpful in that way...but people are not wholly logical. Sometimes you can do your very best and still lose because of other connections people have, how they&#39;re feeling that specific day, etc.</p> <p>Any time that I talk with such agents about life stuff, it always feels like talking with a teenager or a child in a nice way.
