As a gay trans dude, it represented my experience and featured a gay couple. When my friend asked me to show it at the film festival they were holding I was really excited because I worked super hard on it. I was also a bit nervous because I live in a very conservative rural town, but decided to do it anyway because I thought eh arts people are more tolerant. I was wrong. </p> <p>From the moment the characters started being romantic people started laughing and jeering, saying ew, etc. Every single time they kissed there was audible discomfort from most of the audience. People just fucking guffawing at this fucked up story about abuse based on my own personal trauma that wasn\u2019t funny at all. Just all laughing because two men kissing is the funniest thing in the fucking world. Seriously. There are like no comedic elements to the film, it\u2019s dark and kinda sad. The liter",
