It arrived a couple days ago and was working on getting into BIOS to make Proxmox my host OS yesterday (from Windows 11 Pro). I\u2019ve tried Esc, Del, F10, and more on startup but even when it doesn\u2019t boot into Windows 11, the display is solid black. The pc will be running in this state, but no visuals. I\u2019ve tried changing display ports as well as removing the Sata drive and resetting CMOS. The only difference I\u2019ll get is that when I reset the CMOS, I get eight beeps which from what I can tell indicates corrupt ROM / BIOS. Im looking for any advice on how to get into BIOS or otherwise just so that I can set the host OS to proxmox.

The goal is to be able to manage the containers, but not see the data.</strong> </p> <p>I imagine the answer is no as, I assume, the running container needs to see the data on the volumes at all times, but if anyone has ideas or has accomplished this, please let me know.
