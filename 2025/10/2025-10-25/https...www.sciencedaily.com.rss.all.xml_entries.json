        "description": "Japanese researchers discovered that hair graying and melanoma share a surprising cellular origin. When DNA damage strikes melanocyte stem cells, they may undergo a protective process called seno-differentiation, leading to hair graying. However, carcinogens can override this safeguard, allowing the damaged cells to persist and turn cancerous. This balance between cell loss and survival reveals a hidden connection between aging and cancer.",
