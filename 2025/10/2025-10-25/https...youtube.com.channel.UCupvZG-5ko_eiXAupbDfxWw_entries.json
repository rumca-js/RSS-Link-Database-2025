        "description": "A sprawling FBI probe into mafia-linked gambling and sports rigging schemes led to the arrests of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups, according to federal law enforcement officials. The NBA says both men have been placed on leave. The investigation involved two major operations: One centered on the use of insider information to place bets on various NBA games and another revolving around underground poker games, where \u201chigh-tech cheating technology\u201d was used to steal millions from victims, US Attorney Joseph Nocella Jr. said. Among the defendants in the dual operations are members of four major American crime families, as well as current and former NBA players and coaches, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.\n\nCNN's Fredericka Whitfield speaks with ESPN sports betting reporter David Purdum. #CNN #News",
