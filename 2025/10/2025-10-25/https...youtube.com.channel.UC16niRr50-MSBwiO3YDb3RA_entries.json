        "description": "Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris has told the BBC she may run again for the White House.\nIn her first UK interview, Harris said she would \"possibly\" be president one day and was confident there will be a woman in the White House in future.\nMaking her strongest suggestion to date that she will make another presidential bid in 2028 after losing to Donald Trump last year, Harris dismissed polls that put her as an outsider to become the Democrats' pick for the next election.\nSpeaking to Sunday with Laura Kuennsberg, Harris also turned her fire on her former rival, branding Trump a \"tyrant\", and said warnings she made about him on the campaign trail had been proved right.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#KamalaHarris #DonaldTrump #BBCNews",
