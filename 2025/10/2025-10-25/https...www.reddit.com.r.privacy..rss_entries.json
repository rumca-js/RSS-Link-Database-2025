The filter is called \u201cAngel &amp; Demon AI\u201d</p> <p>Example: I chose a random friend, the lens generated an image that very strongly looked like them. I didnt upload a picture of my friend either only selected them</p> <p>My questions: 1. How is this allowed under Snapchat\u2019s privacy policy / under law? 2. Does this break privacy / biometric data laws (especially in Canada or U.S. states)? 3. Could someone sue Snapchat (or the filter creator) for this kind of usage of someone\u2019s face/likeness without explicit consent?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Old_Assumption2188\"> /u/Old_Assumption2188 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1og0rke/s",

Naturally I looked up my name on a browser and I found an old account on Facebook I had when I was a child. The account has my name written in it. But there&#39;s an issue. Other than a picture of mine the account -10+ years old- has the picture of a man who I don&#39;t know. This man appears to be a middle aged man whom I&#39;ve never seen before in my life. He&#39;s also from a very far away country -Bangladesh-. I checked the friends list of the account and there appears to be the man&#39;s friends not mine. All of them completely unrelated to me. I will report the Facebook account for impersonation but even if they took it down I still have so many questions. How did the man gain access to that account? Does he have other pictures of me? Why my account in particular? </p> <p>I plan on sending a message to the account and see if he responds. Asking him questions. </p> <p>",

However, creating an Opera account (and I don&#39;t think Opera is especially private) and making payments seems like a good idea, in addition to the fact that it is not very useful that it is only for Ubuntu on Linux due to telemetry, but that&#39;s what I think, how private is it really?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jumpy_Drawing3790\"> /u/Jumpy_Drawing3790 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1ofge6o/privacy_with_gamemaker/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1ofge6o/privacy_with_gamemaker/\">[comments]</a></span>",
