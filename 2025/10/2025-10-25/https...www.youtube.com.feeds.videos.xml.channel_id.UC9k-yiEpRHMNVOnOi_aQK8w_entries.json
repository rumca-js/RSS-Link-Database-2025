        "description": "Jody Plauch\u00e9 was 10 years old when he started karate lessons in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He'd already done well in football, baseball, soccer and basketball. \nJeff Doucet, his karate instructor, befriended his parents, his grandparents and would stay over at the Plauch\u00e9 home. He fooled everyone, Jody says.\nWithin months, the touching began, followed by sexual abuse, then kidnapping. \nJody ended up in a motel room near Disneyland, with cops breaking down the door.\nLater, on live television, Jody\u2019s father shot Doucet as police led the abuser through Baton Rouge's airport. \nNow a grown man, Plauch\u00e9 speaks to law enforcement, schools \u2013 and anyone who will listen \u2013 about his personal hell. He tells Inside Edition Digital\u2019s Deborah Hastings that he does this to help others, and himself.",
