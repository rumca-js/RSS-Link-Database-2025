In a pulsating contest at the O<sub>2</sub> Arena, Wardley showed he has one of the toughest chins in the sport as he swallowed several huge punches from Parker before forcing the referee, Howard Foster, to stop the bout in an explosive 11th round.</p><p>The WBO had ordered the experienced Parker to face Usyk, the undisputed world heavyweight champion, in July, but the New Zealander put his mandatory challenger status on the line against Wardley, who was still involved in white-collar boxing when his opponent was world champion in 2016.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/26/fabio-wardley-stops-joseph-parker-oleksandr-usyk-boxing\">Continue reading",

Liverpool didn\u2019t just slip to a fourth league defeat in a row for the first time since February 2021, but were thoroughly outplayed and outfought by Brentford. The anxious period of stoppage time the home side endured was out of keeping with everything that had gone before.</p><p>Brentford tend naturally to a direct approach anyway, but Arne Slot\u2019s grumbling last week about Manchester United\u2019s long balls was an open invitation. Liverpool never got to grips with the pace of Kevin Schade running in behind their back four, and they looked uncomfortable as well against Michael Kayode\u2019s fusillade of long throws. Every side now knows that Liverpool are vulnerable to balls played in behind their full-backs. The opening goal, scored after five minutes, stemmed from a Kayode throw, but that was the result of Giorgi Mamardashvili, mopping up as Schade chased behind Conor Bradley.

At 9.30am on Sunday, four men arrived in a truck outside the Louvre in Paris, driving right up under a balcony and setting up a ladder with a furniture hoist. Two of them casually climbed up to the balcony and cut through the reinforced glass of a window; on the other side of the glass was the Apollo gallery, the most ornate and arguably the most beautiful room in the museum, <strong>Helen Pidd</strong> hears. Using an angle grinder, they broke into cases holding France\u2019s crown jewels, before escaping back down the ladder and disappearing on motorbikes.</p><p>The audacious burglary of one of the most famous museums in the world has shocked France, especially because the jewels had been bought back for the nation after originally being sold, reports the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent",
