What&#39;s awkward is that they have a special relationship with the open source implementation of h.264 OpenH264\u2014they distribute the binaries that users would otherwise have to pay for (even to compile!), and quite a lot of projects end up relying on it. </p> <p>This leads to a very weird situation. Take, for example, the LocalSend app. It relies on the GNOME runtime. The GNOME runtime needs OpenH264. Flatpak tries fetching the binary for it from Cisco, but they respond with 403. </p> <p>This means that for anybody in those territories (or really GeoIP&#39;d as those territories), you essentially CANNOT use any Flatpak that relies on GNOME without a VPN. There&#39;s no mirroring, there are no attempts to mitigate this, Flatpak just <em>is</em> broken.</p> <p>Sure, you might say that there are some weird",

Ended up writing a custom GRUB module that runs Pong directly in the bootloader </p> <p>While digging into this, I realized there\u2019s not much out there about writing GRUB modules, most of what I found focused on theming or config customization. So I went down the rabbit hole and figured out how to: \u2022 Build and link custom .mod files into GRUB \u2022 Use GRUB\u2019s graphics terminal (gfxterm) for simple 2D rendering \u2022 Handle keyboard input directly from the GRUB environment \u2022 Package everything into a working EFI image via grub-mkimage</p> <p>It\u2019s been a fun side project and a great excuse to explore the internals of GRUB and UEFI booting. If anyone\u2019s ever experimented with extending GRUB or doing weird things at the bootloader stage, I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts or see what others have done.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:/",

Only the performance with his gtx 960 and the 580 driver (which is his current one) with x11 was not optimal. A lot of jerking and a bit sluggish. The gtx960 is actually a pretty good GPU. Well. We&#39;ve been fiddling around with the nvidia settings for a while, including the kwin compositor... didn&#39;t bring any improvement. A little annoyed, we wanted to look for another distribution when I noticed that it was running x11. So I switched to wayland and lo and behold: The box performs excellently. Why none of us had the idea to check which session was active when we first started... Well. Apparently the plasma version and the nvidia driver are no longer compatible with x11...

I basically trapped myself in the bios menue of a laptop after an archinstall gone wrong. When I try to boot into the USB it just goes back to the bios menue. The only devices in my house are a Chromebook from my uncle (which i dont know how to get an iso from) a work desktop (which from my mom I dont think would allow me to download etcher.
