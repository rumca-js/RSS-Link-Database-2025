        "description": "It's finally official: Halo is coming to PlayStation, joining Gears of War and Forza to symbolize Microsoft's Big 3 finally making the jump to rival platforms. However, it isn't Halo Infinite or the Master Chief Collection that are launching but rather Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of the very first game in the series, which launches in 2026. The former-343 Industries, now-Halo Studios, is going back to where it all began, seemingly starting afresh and introducing a new generation \u2013 and console audience \u2013 to the legend of Master Chief.\n\nWhile there's a lot of talk about ensuring that the \u201coriginal feel\u201d of the title has \u201cevolved to suit modern players,\u201d and not modernizing \u201cfor the sake of modernization,\u201d per Halo Studios, what's new with the remake? How does it differ from the original Combat Evolved? Is there any new content for long-time fans to sink their teeth into? Check out ten of the biggest differences.",

        "description": "The original Tormented Souls was an attempt to bring the horror genre back to the olden days of fixed camera angles and puzzle-based exploration, and while it had a few rough edges, it was still a fun game overall. \n\nIts sequel, on the other hand, ramps up essentially every aspect of the original. Tormented Souls 2 picks up a few months after the events of the original, and starts us off with an intricately creepy manor to explore. The core gameplay feels a lot more responsive, and Catherine, Anna, and all the other characters of the game are well voice acted, even if the writing can feel a bit off at times. \n\nThrow on top the fact that the level design is great in letting you always feel like you\u2019re making progress, as well as the fact that its puzzle design and general gameplay are better than ever, and you have a great way to spend a weekend if you\u2019re a fan of the horror genre.",
