Despite what was promised, the final game was nowhere near the success Krafton or Striking Distance Studios thought it would be. \n\nFrom the creative mind behind Dead Space, The Callisto Protocol was released in December 2022, but what the game actually demonstrated was how little it understood about what made Dead Space successful in the first place. Zoe Delahunty-Light is still feeling some kind of way about the letdown The Callisto Protocol ended up being, so in this video essay on The Callisto Protocol, she goes into how it lacked the subtlety that something like Dead Space had in spades, and what was going on behind the scenes in The Callisto Protocol to make it a disappointing, mediocre survival horror game.\nThis video was created by Zoe Delahunty-Light and was originally featured on Eurogamer.\n\n#IGN #CallistoProtocol #DeadSpace",

        "description": "Six years after the release of the original, The Outer Worlds 2 is shaping up to be a deeper, smarter, and more focused RPG experience. Obsidian has rebuilt nearly every system \u2014 from how you build your character to how you explore and fight across Arcadia. In this video, we\u2019ll go over the nine biggest changes and additions from the original.\n\nThis sequel introduces a new trait-based character creation system, removes respecs to make choices matter, and expands the flaw system with unique rewards. You\u2019ll also find brand-new throwables and tactical gadgets, fully reactive radio stations, overhauled companions and abilities, a new crafting system, and the complete removal of item durability and weight limits. Plus, players can finally experience the game in third-person mode, making The Outer Worlds 2 feel like the true next evolution of Obsidian\u2019s sci-fi RPG.",
