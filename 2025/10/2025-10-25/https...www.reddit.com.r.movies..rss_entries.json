It\u2019s still there, having survived the pandemic, when many of the enterprises on the boulevard in that area were boarded up, and were never to be re-opened again. When I peered in, The Frolic, where I used to hang when I first came to town, looked just as dark and divey as ever\u2014just perfect. For some reason, I nodded and the seated doorman, who I\u2019d never met, smiled and nodded back as if he sensed I had been a customer. </p> <p>The Frolic has been used as a location for numerous movies, including A Woman Under the Influence (1974), From Hollywood to Deadwood (1988), LA Confidential (1997), and The Little Things (2021), among many others. Another one was Quentin Tarantino\u2019s ode to 60s Hollywood, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. It only appears briefly in the movie, but star actor Rick Dalton DiCapri",

The tension is fantastic, really ratcheted up to 11, at least for the first and maybe second time you hear the same dialogue over different characters reactions. Then at the end when the poor unprepared SOB has to make the call that the whole movie&#39;s been marching towards...the credits just roll. Absolute dry handjob of a movie. Great direction, great acting, great music, but the story felt cheap and unsatisfying.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cwaterbottom\"> /u/cwaterbottom </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1og4546/i_had_time_for_one_movie_today_and_i_wasted_it_on/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1og4546/i_had_time_for_one_movie_today_and_i",
