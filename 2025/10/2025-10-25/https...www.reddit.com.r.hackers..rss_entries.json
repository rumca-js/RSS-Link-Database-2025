So far they&#39;ve accessed my Telegram and Instagram as far as I know, possibly more as I&#39;m not being notified of any logins or access. I&#39;ve only known about the intrusions so far due to friends letting me know they were sent a crypto scam from my accounts. I had no password set for my Telegram, and I will accept full responsibility that it was a dumb ass thing to forget, and have been resetting all of my passwords to unique ones and setting up 2FA on everything I possibly can. My question is, how might they be gaining access to these accounts? I&#39;ve heard of sim swapping, but from what information I&#39;ve been able to glean, that would have given them access to many of my accounts? I&#39;m trying to figure out why only THESE 2, Instagram and Telegram, have been accessed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#",
