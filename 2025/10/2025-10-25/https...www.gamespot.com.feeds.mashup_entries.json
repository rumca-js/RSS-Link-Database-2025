        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Mega Man Legends 2 is celebrating its 25-year anniversary today, October 25, 2025. Below, we look back at how its unresolved cliffhanger ending still overshadows its memory.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Mega Man Legends 2 is an unfinished promise. The anime-inspired adventure series was beloved by fans of the blue bomber for its inventive, Zelda-like spin on the classic formula. It was filled with lovable characters who have endured long past the series itself, like Tron Bonne, the Servbots, and the hero, Mega Man Volnutt. But like a serialized cartoon series, the second game in the series ended with a whopper of a cliffhanger--and then never returned to it. The legacy of Legends for the last 25 years has been fans waiting for a resolution that never came.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Spoilers for the Mega Man Legends series follow</strong></p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mega-man-legends-2-still-suffers-from-a-25-year-old-cliffhanger/1100-6535697/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2",
