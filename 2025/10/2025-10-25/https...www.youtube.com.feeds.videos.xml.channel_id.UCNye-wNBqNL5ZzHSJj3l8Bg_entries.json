        "description": "Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, has told Al Jazeera that Trump\u2019s meeting with Qatar\u2019s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, is seen in Israel as \u201ca strategic development\u201d. \u201cYou have to combine with that [the meeting] the fact that Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman is going to Washington next week,\u201d he said. Pinkas also said it was important to remember how Trump praised the Qatari mediation and the significance of Saudi Arabia in the implementation of the Gaza ceasefire. \u201cYou also have to remember how Trump forced reluctant Netanyahu to apologise \u2026 to Qatar\u2019s prime minister. You take all this and see that from the Israeli point of view. Israel has been marginalised here,\u201d he concluded.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraengli",
