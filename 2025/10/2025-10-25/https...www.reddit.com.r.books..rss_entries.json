All victims of some cruel and abusive adult and the repercussions of one fateful night. Would recommend it for people who love thriller. But a trigger warning for anyone who is sensitive to abuse esp child abuse by parents. That was a tough read.

It\u2019s kind of weird to realize that something we think of as a cheaper, simpler form of entertainment might actually cost more per hour when you look at the numbers. let\u2019s say you buy a 20$ novel and it takes you about 10 hrs to finish. That\u2019s roughly $2 per hr of enjoyment. When compare that to a $60 video game (ps5, or NS2) that takes around 100 hrs to fully complete. That\u2019s only $0.6 per hr. As a gamer and an avid reader, I\u2019ve realized that I actually spend more money on books than on games over the course of a year. It kind of surprised me when I added it up even though games have a higher cost per unit. I buy so many books throughout the year that it ends up being more overall.</p> <p>Any gamers who are also readers here?
