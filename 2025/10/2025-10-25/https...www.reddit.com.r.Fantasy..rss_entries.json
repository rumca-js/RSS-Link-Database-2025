Now that I\u2019ve read two books by her, I can definitely see the patterns in her writing, and I\u2019m just not sure they work for me. She features some off-beat humor that doesn&#39;t always land for me, for one thing. She also has a very quirky, self-aware style of narration with lots of little asides and characters\u2019 internal monologues frequently making note of how weird their circumstances are. Yes, the story is quirky and off-beat - but how much is really gained by constantly nudging the reader with little reminders of just how quirky and off-beat the story really is? </p> <p>It\u2019s almost like Kingfisher hits upon particular little ideas/turns of phrase that she is very charmed by and then ",

I\u2019ve seen the theory that they believed him to be a ghost, but the books made it sound like some people like Olikea truly could not see him, and when they encircled the camp in salt no one could see him and he couldn\u2019t pass. This made me think he really was a spirit until the rest of the book happened. Or maybe he was a spirit, but gradually became more alive? Maybe Arandula (sp) did something again after he left the speck camp to make him more balanced? </li> </ol> <p>IS IT POSSI",
