Mangafire has a dropdown to switch languages but not between different translations/scans of the same language. </p> <p>This is fine when Im reading well known mangas with official English translations that are often the best available but when Im reading more niche mangas with no official translation I like to give different scans a test to see which I prefer to know if Im using the best one available, there are also some times when I might deliberately want to use a bad scan for humour purposes. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DarkFlame445\"> /u/DarkFlame445 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comment",
