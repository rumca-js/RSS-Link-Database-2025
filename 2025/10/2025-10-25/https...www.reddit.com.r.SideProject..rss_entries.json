In the early days, there was one question that I often thought about: how does one implement the Thought-Action-Observation (TAO) loop of the ReAct agent? More specifically, how does one translate the TAO loop from mere concept into concrete code? Of course, there are several implementations available across different frameworks. However, such versions are, understandably, quite optimized, making it a struggle to find a one-to-one resemblance between theory and implementation. That&#39;s when the idea clicked: I need to build something like that so that others find it easy.</p> <p>Thus, I created KodeAgent, an implementation of ReAct with the methods named after the TAO loop. Subsequently, I also added CodeAct, overriding part of the TAO loop (into the TCO loop).</p> <p>As outlined above, a key purpose of KodeAgent is to potentially educate newcomers who are interested in learning about agents",

If you&#39;re looking for supplemental income online, I think more people should understand arbitraging, particularly &quot;game pack arbitraging&quot;. While people may dismiss it as sounding too good to be true, it&#39;s 100% genuine. Thousands of people do this every day (and I urge you to do your own research to verify everything I&#39;m claiming).</p> <p>The basis for this side hustle is simple: find arbitrage opportunities. You buy in-game packs (from mobile games) for less than what a separate platform will reward you for. For example, you buy a pack of coins for $9.99 in-game and receive $15.00 from the platform, which is a +$5 net profit. Game companies have marketing budgets for player acquisition, and this is how they use it. Instead of ads, they pay platforms to bring them players who make purchases. You can sometimes find rare opportunities where the platform&#39;s payment is MORE than the in-game pack cost. That&#39;s arbitrage.<",
