They&#39;re all <em>series.name.SxxExx.episode.name</em></p> <p>My comparison situation is <em>series.name.SxxExx.episode.name</em> and <em>xx - episode name</em> and the sizes may or may not match.</p> <p>Is there a way to compare these? Using STG FolderPrint Plus I can make excel or html or txt files of the directories, if that helps. The <em>xx - episode name</em> files are part of a torrent, so changing them for a dir to dir comparison would be difficult.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tequilavip\"> /u/tequilavip </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ofdsyl/ways_to_compare_files_of_different_filenaming/\">",
