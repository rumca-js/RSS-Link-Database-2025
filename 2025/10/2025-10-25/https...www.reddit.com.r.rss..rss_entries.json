Works well with most of my websites and love how you can read articles in simple plain text. However I&#39;m subscribed to the FT and have the RSS set up correctly but it won&#39;t let me read the articles through my RSS app it makes me either go to the app or read it through my browser. Is there an RSS feed app that will force it to plain text or is this a common issue with large media companies that force you to use their website/app? At the minute I&#39;m just using an open source RSS feed app </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Dragonfly1132\"> /u/Ok-Dragonfly1132 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ofqtvk/financial_times_rss/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ofqtvk/financial_times_rss/\">[comments]</a></span>",
