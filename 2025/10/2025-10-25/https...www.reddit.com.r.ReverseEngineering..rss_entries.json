To be honest, I know C++ at an average/intermediate level. I&#39;ve also used tools like x64dbg, HTTP Debugger, IDA, etc., and I can solve average crackmes. But once protections like XOR, VMP, Themida, and similar are added, I can&#39;t do anything. I especially get stuck when I can&#39;t identify strings. How can I improve myself? I cracked game cheats a few times that used auth, but I still feel like I don&#39;t know anything. Could you please give me suggestions so I can really improve in a short time? Also, when I can&#39;t find strings, what exactly can I do, or what should I do when I come across a file that uses VMP?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TangeloNo8352\"> /u/TangeloNo8352 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http://reversehelp.com\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=",
