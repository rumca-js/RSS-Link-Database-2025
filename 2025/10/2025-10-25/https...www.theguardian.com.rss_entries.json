Today I decided to record 15 minutes of one of the fox\u2019s days. It went like this: 12:30pm \u2013 the fox is asleep, 12:40pm \u2013 the fox is still asleep (foxes are mainly nocturnal animals and sleep up to 10 hours during the day), 12:52pm \u2013 the fox wakes up and walks out of sight, probably to go through some bins or steal our garden gloves, 12:54pm \u2013 the fox jumps on top of the shed, 12:54pm \u2013 the fox is asleep again.</p><p>Many urban foxes find shelter around people\u2019s gardens. This can include under sheds, in bushes, behind bins or in their own burrows, called earths. In spring, baby foxes are born, and when we\u2019re gardening they stare at us through the bushes, or quickly pass through when our backs are turned. I know I should clap and scare them away",
