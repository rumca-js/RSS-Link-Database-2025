We taught our kids a few new card games early this year where we as a family did what we always do and we created new rules and gameplay mechanics. Long story short and without realizing it at the time we created a new game entirely(!). The kids were excited about that prospect and being from a split home, my wife (their step-mom) and I decided to spend our nights and weekends when they were at their other home formally creating the game, documenting our made up ruleset, designing the cards, the cover art, researching UPC codes, copyrights, trademarks, etc. etc. We did all of this in support of the kids and help make them feel apa",

I like to create a dark world and atmosphere. I love the Kingdom Death Monster minis for their style and high quality and I plan to use them. KDM minis are a bit larger than average TTRPG minis (they have a 30mm base and are roughly 35-40mm scale, this means 35-40mm from feet to eye level).</p> <p>Of course there are other boardgames with a dark atmosphere and miniatures on the market. I was wondering which ones have their miniatures in roughly the same scale as KDM. Games that I have on the radar just based on style and atmosphere are Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Eldenring, Kingdoms Forlorn and the recently announced Berserk.</p> <p>Ideally, someone who owns multiple of these games (or others that fit the description) could put an average human miniature from each game next to each other and post",

This is hard to find, so if you guys has anything to suggere it would be appreciated! To give you an exemple of what I mean by skill: for the moment, the mechanic I develop is based on coin flipping. To be succesfull at a skill check, the player must flip a coin and catch it in different ways, so some are most difficult than others. It should be a mechanic that can grow in difficulty and variations. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Lawfulness_2189\"> /u/No_Lawfulness_2189 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ofdkxg/skill_check_that_requiere_skill/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ofdkxg/skill_check_that_requiere_skill/\">[comments]</a></span>",
