For example, Stellar blade does this after 1-1.5 hours of gameplay. The rest of the system does not freeze, and is completely responsive, only the game freezes and recovers after a few seconds. I have observed this behaviour in other games such as Witchfire( UE4) and Void/Breaker(UE5). Games that are not made in the UE and not DX12 do not exhibit this behaviour. I don&#39;t have this issue in DOOM The Dark Ages(VULKAN), Red Dead Redemption 2(VULKAN), and Dying Light(DX11), and my play sessions in those games are 4-5 hours long, so the issue is either UE or VKD3D.</p> <p>Setup:</p> <p>Arch Linux</p> <p>Hyprland</p> <p>Ryzen 7 7800 X3D</p> <p>32GB DDR5 6000MHz</p> <p>RTX 5090</p> <p><code>nvidia-open-dkms 580.95.05-1</code> driver</p> <p>Proton experimental and GE 10-15, GE 10-20</p> <p>Any idea what is causing this/ho",

You can set an environment variable to change where this is, but by default steam will either put it in the folder of that steam library, so for example if you have a drive called Games that has a steamapps folder, it would be in /Games/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compadata while hte game would be in /common, *or* it could put it in ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compadata as a default location. </p> <p>My issue is, I set up a gamescope session that I can switch to by pressing a button. It works wonderfully, but when I run steam on my normal arch desktop it will default to putting the compadata on the same drive as the game, and when I run it through gamescope it puts it in the default steam folder. This *still* wouldn&#39;t be a problem, but if ran this way it doesn&#39;t force a cloud sync, so it&#39;s possible for me to have t",

This panel is able to do over 1000 but the calibration screens show a bigger white window (windows 11 as well) so this is what you get as the value. On windows I discovered that if I set the first screen max brightness value to 1000 and then the second white screen which is max full screen whiteness to 603 it ended up really nice, allowing my panel to tonemapp up to the 1000 nits. So coming back to KDE I thought maybe I should set that max brightness to 1000 instead of 603 where the image clips. Suddenly I actually have full highlights in my games. Stalker 2 was a game plaguing me. Highlights would look blue and dull. Now the sun at sunset is bright AF and looks good. Cyberpunk I never really had any issues with. It looks really good, so I&#39;m wondering why that is and how these games differ in HDR implementat",

I\u2019m having an issue launching ea games from steam (titanfall 2 and a way out) the games are installed and when I launch them it brings up a black popup for what should be the ea app login or setup screen. The screen works normally on my steam deck, so I think the problem must be with xwayland, which hyprctl clients confirms that window is using.</p> <p>All the things I tried:</p> <p>-all proton versions including GE</p> <p>-Launch options I have tried: big picture mode, gamescope, proton_enable_wayland, mesa loader override, ozone</p> <p>-Hyprland.conf rules I have tried: no blur; opaque, full screen, float, no shadow, no dim, no border. I\u2019m officially out of ideas. Anyone happen to have any ideas or potential solutions?</p> </div",
