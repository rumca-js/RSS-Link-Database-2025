All employees work on their personal laptops with local admin, some even share the login password. You can find all the bad practices in one place. </p> <p>Just to give you some context. This is a Chinese company who opened a new branch in my country. There is around 15 users, all of them work on their own laptops (Windows OS) and use their own user accounts. There is no AD in place or centralization. For communication they are using email SaaS based in China and WeCom enterprise. </p> <p>What I did so far is to enable windows defender on all the machines and implemented best practices from CIS benchmark. I know this is not an optimal solution but I did it as a temporary solution. What I&#39;m planning to do is to install Microsoft Defender for business. </p> <p>What do you recommend guys if you were in my situation and what would you do? and what other ways you might go with this? <",
