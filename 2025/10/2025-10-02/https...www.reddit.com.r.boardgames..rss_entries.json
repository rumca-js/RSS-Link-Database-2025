Reveal your backstory, gather gadgets and allies, develop a grudge against your archenemy, and unleash an ultimate ability as you transform. Use a combination of brains, love, speed, and strength to craft your origin story.</p> <p>Origin Story is a 1-5 player competitive tableau-building, trick-taking game played over 5 rounds. Each round represents a chapter in your development and grants a new card to add to your player mat. Charge your cards and use their abilities to score more points than your opponents, then burst into action as a full superhero (or supervillain) in the final round.</p> <p>Origin Story is co-designed by Jamey Stegmaier and Pete Wissinger (Crits &amp; Tricks) and illustrated by Cl\u00e9mentine Campardou. </p> <p>Set to launch on 10/15</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",

The slots can open and close to cover words in the question. The goal is to shut the most number of doors while still making the question possible for your teammate.</p> <p>For example, a question could be &quot;what bone is responsible for protecting the brain?&quot; And the answer is skull. And you would shut doors until it said &quot;bone...protecting...brain&quot; or maybe even just &quot;bone...brain&quot; if you were confident they could get it. </p> <p>Thank you in advance for your help \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Different-Seaweed-46\"> /u/Different-Seaweed-46 </a> ",
