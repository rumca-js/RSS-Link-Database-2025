It's no surprise that <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> and its sequel are excellent; these are critically acclaimed games, and two of the best-selling titles for the Wii, Nintendo's top-selling console prior to the Switch era. So it's great to have a pair of the most inventive platformers ever made easily accessible in 2025. At the same time, these releases are disappointing in just how simple they are. Nintendo has an enviable amount of history and talent, and re-releases like this would be the ideal place to share that with the world. Alas, we get straightforward por \u2026</p>\n",
