Many of the keywords weren&#39;t updated for weeks, some weren&#39;t updated since mid-August (today is October 1 for those who reads the post later). Is this normal? It doesn&#39;t make any sense, taking into account the volatility of some commercial keywords. How about other SEO tools, do they lag that much too? I&#39;m even thinking about vibe coding a script that will export these keywords from our search console and build this kind of result table.</p> <p>ps: I&#39;m attaching a screenshot with the Updated column high-lighted in the comments, can&#39;t add screenshots here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Oleksandr_G\"> /u/Oleksandr_G </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1nvsyql/ahrefs_keywords_positions_are_very_outdated/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1nvsyql/ahref",

For context:</p> <p>I do NOT use any competitor brand names directly in my ad headlines or descriptions.</p> <p>My campaign does target competitor brand names as keywords, so my ad may show up if those terms are searched.</p> <p>I use dynamic keyword insertion for ad copy, which could result in competitor brand keywords displaying if the search query matches.</p> <p>In addition, my ad group names (and their URL parameters) sometimes include competitor brand names for organizational/tracking purposes.</p> <p>I\u2019ve received notification that a trademark owner has filed a complaint, but I\u2019m not sure how to best respond, or what steps to take to resolve this without risking ad suspension or legal trouble.</p> <p>Has anyone dealt with a similar issue?</p> </div><!",
