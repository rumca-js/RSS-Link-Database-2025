Join the conversation in the comments</p><p>I am really excited by <strong>Namanlagh</strong>, the first poetry collection in 10 years from the great Tom Paulin. A tone-perfect meditation on illness and recovery, partnership and writing, violence and historical neglect, it is an absolute cracker. There are subtle nods to Derek Mahon and Seamus Heaney, and many of the poems are filled with a sense of late style and unfinished business.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/02/what-were-reading-writers-and-readers-on-the-books-they-enjoyed-in-september\">Continue reading...</a>",

Mochizuki frequently gallops full pelt into an arrow or catches a sword-swipe from one of my outlaw enemies as I roll out of the way. Sometimes she stands on the edge of the skirmish, calmly waiting for me to finish disembowelling bad guys so that we can resume our picturesque adventures across the region of Ezo.</p><p>Ghost of Y\u014dtei is the follow-up to American studio Sucker Punch\u2019s reverent samurai action game <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/202",

The Mughals always regarded it as a&nbsp;much more refined place than India and looked to it as the source of the region\u2019s greatest poets and artists, calligraphers and miniaturists, architects and tile makers. As recently as the early 1970s, at the height of the hippy trail, as Afghanistan filled with travellers \u201chigh on weed and low on cash\u201d, Kabul was still known as the Paris of the east. Memoirs of the time describe a world of miniskirts, jazz clubs, bowling alleys and ice-cream parlours. This world was linked to a poor but extremely beautiful rural hinterland where life revolved around the vine harvest and the annual arrival of nomad caravans from the Wakhan corridor.</p><p>A qu",
