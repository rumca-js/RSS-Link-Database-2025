        "description": "Almost two years ago, Adam embarked on an experiment to modify an Emeco Navy chair he had his workshop. This famous chair--designed during World War II for the US Navy--is already lightweight in its welded aluminum construction, but Adam wants to see how much lighter he can make it by drilling thousands of holes into it. The precise layout of these holes, and the operations required to make them, ends up being much more complicated than Adam originally intended...\n\nEmeco 1006 Navy Chair: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emeco_1006\n99% Invisible's episode about the Emeco Navy Chair: https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/77-steps/\n\nShot by Adam Savage and edited by Josh Self\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) me",
