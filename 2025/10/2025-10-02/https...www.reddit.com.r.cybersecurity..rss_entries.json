I could not really find a way to condense it for the title, but I was wondering what a normal day looks like for a comp forensics analyst? How does the kind of evidence you deal with change based on who you work for? I&#39;m mostly wondering because I saw something about workers being susceptible to traumatic disorders from how bad some of that stuff gets in the case of a predator being involved.

I provided a PoC video of this step-by-step as well.</p> <p>At the very least, this represents an <strong>Insecure Direct Object Reference (CWE-639) and a Business Logic Error (CWE-840)</strong>, where an <strong>internal only SKU</strong> is accessible and purchasable by their public-facing storefront API.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>They downplayed the report, and closed it without even reading through the details, and made wrong assumptions about it. They egged me into going through with purchasing the exploited SKU and set that as the condition for taking my report seriou",
