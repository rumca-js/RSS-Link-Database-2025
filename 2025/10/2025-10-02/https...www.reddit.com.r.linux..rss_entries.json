Google is working on a desktop mode for Android and all their recent Pixel phones support HDMI output. So when Google releases Android 17, I expect that users will be able to connect their phones to a USB HUB and use it as a regular PC. Samsung ( DEX) has been doing this for a while with their high end phones, but with desktop capability being included in Android AOSP , this will be a common feature with most mid range phones. </p> <p>Even Microsoft, a leader with their Windows OS, seems more focused on mobile and cloud computing. I was surprised to see Copilot being demoed on a phone rather than a Windows 11 laptop (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/ncjM7mY4LvE?si=ydv-xLocJ21hUyru\">https://youtu.be/ncjM7mY4LvE?si=ydv-xLocJ21hUyru</a> ).</p> <p>I am sure that for some of us even a phone with 16GB memory is not sufficiently powerful enough to replace our desktop PC.

The problem is, I dual boot Arch and Windows, so I was stuck with only being able to boot one OS remotely.</p> <p>My first solution was to set Arch as the default boot option. If I wanted to boot into Windows, I had to wait for Arch to start, run a command to change the default for the next boot, and then reboot. It worked, but it wasn&#39;t great. Even if it could be automated, the PC needed to boot into Arch before it could boot into Windows, which made the boot time longer.</p> <p>And one day I stumbled upon <a href=\"https://superuser.com/a/1452098\">this superuser post</a>. I tried it and it worked flawlessly !</p> <p>Basically, you set up a TFTP server on another machine that serves a text file. In this file, you set the default boot option to use. Then, you configure your GRUB to request this file and source it. After that, the only thing you need is to wake your PC ",
