We are a Christian family so any books that I choose must align with our values. We have Ping, all of the little house on the prairie collection, magic treehouse, tons of Berenstain bears books including the values and virtue, a few Winnie the Pooh, big thoughts for little people which both me and my kids love (more of a devotional). I just ordered a storm in the night, a new coat for Ana, How to Make an Apple Pie and See the World, Aesop&#39;s Fables, Roaring Mad Riley. Basically just looking for great, whole hearted literature that both my kids and I can enjoy. More chapter books like little house on the prairie too as my 5 year old loves for me to read little chapter books like that to her. Please suggest any great stories that you enjoy or have good lessons, etc. thank you!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",

That is, until John Green&#39;s nonfiction. I grew up with him as a teenager, so I&#39;ve always loved listening to him talk. For those familiar - dftba and nerdfighteria are still apart of my inner wiring. </p> <p>ANYWAY, listening to his self narratted audiobook has hooked me. I actually own and started the hardcover a while back, but stopped picking it up in favor of my typical fantasy reads. Now, I&#39;m turning on the audiobook at every drive and every moment of house cleaning. Somehow, his almost dull way of sharing his inner most thoughts on the most random of things is so interesting. I love his open thoughts mixed in with lesser known triva facts about the most unexpected of things. His short essay style informative ponderings catch my ADHD mind when others don&#39;t. I already own Everything Is Tuberculos",

I would prefer if the apocalypse was actively happening, so no post-apoc please. And I would also prefer zombies or something similar instead of aliens/etc.</p> <p>As for the romance portion, I\u2019m open to poly/RH or just MF. The spicier/smuttier the better!! The important part is that I would love a friends to lovers trope, whether it\u2019s the fact that they are actively friends and attempt to survive together or end up meeting up after years of not seeing each other. If it\u2019s poly or RH, it doesn\u2019t have to be all of the MMCs but at least one would be great!</p> <p>An added bonus would be a man that yearns, yknow?

As a young professional, I&#39;ve lived what most people would consider a privileged life. Great childhood, collegiately educated, good circle, but I&#39;ve dealt with so much more things that an average 23 y/o would experience. Loss of life (friends, relatives, in-laws), addiction, self doubt, etc. It&#39;s been hard as well.<br/> I&#39;m really looking for a book about perspective, how you can truly shift your thinking every day and the things you tell yourself (internal dialog is extremely important I know that), and how to create narratives in your mind.
