If you would have told me I would loved it when I started it and immediately hit with some series plot, I would not have believed you. That&#39;s because what made it so amazing to me only really hit me at the end. Yes there is a heroes journey, and a progression fantasy, but goddamn was it refreshing to have an entire cast of characters that were so earnest to each other. People recognizing their faults, caring for each other, rooting for Paks. it was beautiful despite how dark it gets. </p> <p>For some reason I didn&#39;t immediately jump into the sequel series. I wanted to jump into more well known highly recommended series and I almost forgot about these 5 books entirely. Now I am almost glad I waited, because I needed what this series provided after chugging through so many other works, middling to great. </p> ",

So I made my own playlist of indie/pop/folk songs that are fantasy(ish).</p> <p>These songs use fantastical imagery like goblins, knights, harpies, wolves, sirens, and curses to explore very real experiences. Some are explicit in their fantasy themes while others use medieval or mythological metaphors to talk about identity, power, love, and loss. Some are just personal head cannon songs, things that reminded me of a certain character or scene from a book. There are musical narrative projects that blur the line between song and story (The Amazing Devil, Fish in a Birdcage, Rabbitology), there are established artists who regularly use fo",

One of them caught my eye - a battered copy of \u201c The Dragon of Kelmoran\u201d by Adrian North, a name I had never heard in my life. The cover had this gloriously cheesy 90s art: a farm boy with a sword that looked way too big for him, standing in front of a very shiny green dragon. Price tag? One euro. I almost walked away, but nostalgia won.<br/> On the train ride home I read the opening chapter, where a boy named Daric steals bread in the market of a city called Rynhaven, only to run straight into a runaway princess disguised as a thief. It wasn\u2019t perfect some sentences were clunky, and the dialogue felt like it had been translated twice - but it had that messy, beating heart I hadn\u2019t felt in years. I stayed up until 3 a.m. just to see if Daric and Princess Elyra would make it out of the cursed forest alive. Now it\u2019s October and I still think",

Tolkien first (as they should), but then they ignore his contemporaries. They mostly just fill the list with the biggest names from the 90s (Martin, Jordan, Rowling, etc...). I&#39;m not saying those names don&#39;t deserve to be on these lists, I&#39;m saying they shouldn&#39;t get every spot in my opinion. So I thought that I would rank the top 5 most influential fantasy authors who wrote parallel to Tolkien.</p> <p>Some rules before I start: I am going to only include authors who wrote their biggest book between 1930 and 1959 (so no Lovecraft and Dunsany from 1920s or Moorcock and Le Guin from 1960s). Also, I want to clarify that I am talking about influence on modern fantasy authors so no pop culture, movies, tv, comics. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion and I don&#39;t claim to be an expert, this is just to highlight some names who I c",

I&#39;ve finished the series a week ago, and have been thinking about it since then.</p> <p><strong>Heroes Die</strong></p> <p>The first book is great. It&#39;s a fun blend of dystopian sci-fi with high-fantasy. The characters are interesting, the stakes are high, the plot moves very fast, and the world is interesting. It would work well as a standalone book. Reminded me of Conan and David Gemmell&#39;s Legend.</p> <p><strong>Blade of Tyshalle</strong></p> <p>This is probably among the top-10 fantasy books that I&#39;ve read. Instead of being a straight continuation of the first book, it replaces the pulpy action with deep philosophy. There&#39;s a lot of metaphorical storytelling in this book that isn&#39;t always clear at first. The stakes are higher than ever, and at every point it seems like there&#39;s no hope for victory. It&#39;s very very dark in places. I enjoyed it immensely",

Whether he sticks to it or not, it&#39;s about his characters. He writes adults with real and usually relatable problems (outside you know, of being an Emperor or general or something) that are often layered (even if some feel similar between different books). He is low fantasy, with just a hint of magic. His books are about the plot and characters, and are slow burns and are often tragic. </p> <p>Onto the duology. Loved it! Of what I&#39;ve read of his I think its my favorite, maybe that is some recency bias, but I loved the politics in this book more than his other w",

Well I\u2019ve just finished Red Seas and\u2026 I liked it! It\u2019s not anywhere nears as good as the first but I still had a hell of a fun time reading it. I do, however, have one major gripe: this book felt like two entirely seperate stories that Scott Lynch glued and tied together via tenuous plot lines and characters. </p> <p>First half of the book is entirely a heist movie; we see the planning, get a rough idea of what Locke and Jean are going for, you can practically hear the Mission Impossible theme in your head when you\u2019re reading\u2026 and then all of sudden we have Stragos prepping them to be sent out to sea to be pirates. And wow, the second half the book REALLY dives into the whole pirate thing, to the point I\u2019d often forget about the Sinspire heist altogether. I liked the pirate bits a lot (I ",

However, I&#39;m weary to continue the Drenai Saga, as I tend to try to avoid fantasy with rape plotlines when possible, and I just don&#39;t know if Gemmell is the kind of writer to include that stuff or not. So I figured I&#39;d ask here:</p> <p>Do any of the Drenai books feature rape? (I&#39;m mostly referring to on-screen or graphic/gratuitous) If so, can anyone tell me which books have it, and maybe light spoilers on what that might consist of?</p> <p>Ps. I really appreciate any help. I know that this kind of thing doesn&#39;t bother some people, but it&#39;s definitely a big turn off for me, and having a heads up can really help me prepare myself and enjoy a book without it coming out of nowhere. And after reading LEGEND, this is definitely a series I really want to enjoy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kooky_County9569\"> /u/Kooky_County9569 </a>",

As the 19th book in the series, it is very much the culmination of what&#39;s come before, especially the huge turn in <em>Be the Serpent.</em> I was excited to see Toby&#39;s father-by-choice come back (he&#39;s my favorite character) and seeing Toby navigate a difficult mission with the support of her family, even if she found that support constricting. It made for an interesting conflict beyond the standard type of antagonist for this series. Also, we&#39;re clearly building towards something big involving Maeve (a goddess in-setting) and I have Theories about that.
