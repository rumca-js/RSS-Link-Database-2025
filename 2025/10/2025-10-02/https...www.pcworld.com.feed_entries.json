Over the long term, a robot lawn mower will cost a whole lot less than hiring a landscaper\u2014and it won\u2019t expect a tip every week and during the winter holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top-of-the-line robot mowers cost a pretty penny, but they can climb slopes and handle very large yards (we\u2019re talking acres of grass). While early robot lawn mowers required you to lay down a boundary wire to prevent them from wandering out of your yard, each of the mowers listed here uses advanced navigation technology to eliminate the need for any wires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve already spotted some terrific robot lawn mowers deals ahead of next week\u2019s Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, and we expect plenty more as Amazon\u2019s two-day shopping event gets underway.
