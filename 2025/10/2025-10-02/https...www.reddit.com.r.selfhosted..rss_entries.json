My issue is with one particular show (foundation S3). When viewing the centered on my PC, phone, but not my TV. Every other form of media is perfect and centered properly. </p> <p>I have tried deleting and download from other sources but the problem persists only with this show. It\u2019s almost as if 1/6 of the screen is offset and loops back into itself. </p> <p>Any help would be appreciated if someone has ran into this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tallguy415\"> /u/Tallguy415 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nvqq7i/jellyfin_newbie_aspect_ratio/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1nvqq7i/jellyfin_newbie_aspect_ratio/\">[comments]</a></span>",
