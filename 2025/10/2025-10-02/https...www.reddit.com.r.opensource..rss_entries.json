This isn&#39;t a critique of the people still involved, but rather an observation of the limitations of their model, especially when founders move on and project priorities shift.</p> <p>Looking at the broader ecosystem, it seems like anybody wanting to build a community without reaching for proprietary, vend",

I don&#39;t want to leave the project at this point either but since I am not a developer looks like it will be a miracle if Open Source Developers come together and finish polishing this tool.</p> <p>Motivation to do so was due to the high pricing point of trading journals available out their.
