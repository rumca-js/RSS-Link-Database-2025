Monster Hunter Wilds--a game that attempts to continue World's legacy of franchise approachability--launched on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC in February of 2025. It sold more than 10 million copies in the first month of release, reaching tons of new players. It also left the veteran fanbase of the longtime series divided, with many calling it a limited experience that does too much to cater to the casual audience.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned hunter, it's worth revisiting some of the older games in the franchise to see how the latest games measure up to series favorites.

That's a lot for a collab that Epic kept completely under wraps until less than a week ago, and given the surge in popularity for the Netflix movie, it's possible it all came together quickly.</p><p>The item shop cosmetics include skins for Rumi, Mira, and Zoey, along with a pickaxe and a ramyeon back bling for each--and the set is rounded out by the Zoey's Thumbs Up emote. The skins cost 1,500 V-Bucks each, and a bundle with everything will run you 3,500, saving you a lot if you plan to get everything anyway.</p><p>As you might expect from a collab like this, though, there are also some free KPop Demon Hunters cosmetic",
