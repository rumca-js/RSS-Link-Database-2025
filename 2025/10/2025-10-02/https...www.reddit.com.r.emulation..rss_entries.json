I fixed issues with the filter envelopes and the chip&#39;s mixing to eliminate some clipping and distortion, and I also figured out the odd way the loop parameters are encoded, which makes looping samples loop properly now. Most recently, I figured out an emulation scheduling problem causing Xtreme Rally (Off Beat Racer in some regions) to lose up to 2/3rds of the commands sent to the sound CPU. This was causing stuck and missing sounds, the engine sound not following the RPM, and other weird issues.</p> <p>So all 7 games for the system now have good sound. And to make a common question explicit: yes, the stuck sounds in Samurai Shodown 64 and SS64 2 are fixed.</p> <p>Ha",
