        "description": "Trump\u2019s Gaza proposal is the latest Western effort that ignores Palestinian national rights while seeking to isolate the Strip from the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory, says Wadie Said, a law professor at the University of Colorado.\n\nIsrael and its top ally, the US, have for decades \u201cbeen trying to \u2018solve\u2019 the Palestinian issue without in any way acknowledging Palestinian national rights in these lands and in these territories\u201d, Said told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThis idea of separating Gaza has been floated before, and it\u2019s just a repeat of many proposals that have been in existence that deny Palestinians their right to national self-determination,\u201d he explained.\n\u201cThe West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem have been declared as occupied illegally by the International Court of Justice,\u201d he added.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: h",

        "description": "At least four people were injured in a combined car-ramming and stabbing attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall, northern Manchester, during Yom Kippur. Witnesses say a car was driven into pedestrians before the attacker got out and began stabbing people. Armed officers from Greater Manchester Police shot the suspect, who is believed to be the offender. Paramedics in protective gear rushed to the scene and treated victims, with at least one taken to hospital. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham urged people to avoid the area, calling it a serious incident, while stressing the immediate danger had passed. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called the attack \u201ceven more horrific\u201d for taking place on Yom Kippur, is returning early from Denmark to chair a COBRA emergency meeting. Authorities are treating the incident as a grave threat to public safety.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Rory Challands joins us live from London to discuss the latest developments.\n\nSubscribe to",
