But during the time I have been developing on RISCV, the bug that has been troubling me the most was when the program (the main function) restarts when the interrupt came but was not properly initialized.</p> <p>So my mistake was that I had two different interrupt signals in my hardware, but only initialized one interrupt handler. The mistake was obvious, but the bug caused the main program to reset, which really drove me into all kind of superstitions when trying to debug. I feel it is so unintuitive that a wrong register of interrupt handle will cause the main program to restart, despite not having any loop.</p> <p>I have several questions regarding this. First, why does it happen? I wish they would just spit an error code for that, but is it expensive to do so? And lastly, are all cpus the same on this regard, but only a R",

Could someone point me toward ways of getting in touch with microarchitecture experts who might be willing to help?

My approach is to study the literature for each structure (so I can deepen my knowledge of computer architecture) and then create a design compatible with the RISC-V specifications. So far, I\u2019ve completed this for the MMU (TLB and PTW) and I\u2019m almost done with the frontend (RAS, FDP, and direction, target, and loop predictors).</p> </d",
