        "description": "Come join us as we talk with some of the team MoonHood, who created the incredible game The Midnight Walk. Become The Burnt One, befriend a lost lantern creature named Potboy, and use his flame to light your way through a conflicting world of wonder and suspense. This dark fantasy adventure was painstakingly handcrafted with clay and animated in a stop motion style - and can be enjoyed both flatscreen or with a VR headset. We'll discuss their unique approach to this project & ask questions that you might have as well during our live Q&A.\n\nGame link: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863640/The_Midnight_Walk/",
