        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Recently got the DODI Repack for Warhammer 2 and noticed that the battle map is almost always just blank terrain that looks like the units are battling in the sky. So far the only help I&#39;ve found are peeps who have legit copies of the game on Steam that keep saying that verifying the files fixes the problem. Anybody got any solutions for this issue for crack copies?

What happened was that when I installed it, many things were opened and many things were installed, like adware, AVG or CCleaner were downloaded, what I mean is that the PC had no problem whatsoever, The other question was that the GPU suddenly increased along with the CPU, but after a while it stabilized normally. We checked with antivirus and there was no problem. Is there any risk or way to find out?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Funny-Interview8948\"> /u/Funny-Interview8948 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1nvyk05/i_have_a_big_doubt/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1",
