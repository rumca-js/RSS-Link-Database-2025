When the game started, I had a different vehicle that looked more like a futuristic tank with a rounded front. The vehicle would shoot TWO grenades. It was about the same sprite size as the Jeep. I hadn&#39;t played Jackal that much, so I just thought it was a random code I entered. It never happened again.</p> <p>I&#39;ve occasionally thought back to that moment though, but every time I&#39;ve tried to research it, I haven&#39;t been able to find any information or even mention of it. I mean, I think it&#39;s possible this is a false memory, but I truly believe that there is a hidden vehicle in this game that hasn&#39;t been made public for almost 40 years.</p> <p>Is there any way to verify this? Is there a way to reach out to a developer, to reverse engineer the code, or something? I&#39;m not going to become obsessed about this, but I think",
