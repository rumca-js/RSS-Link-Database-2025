Meant to just test it out real quick, ended up playing it for over an hour instead. </p> <p>It really captures that 90s arcade feeling of playing Time Crisis or any of the classic gun games at arcades. I enjoyed it being an on-rails shooter, where I just had to focus on the shooting and incoming bullets. I loooooooved the cinematic moments where you&#39;re shooting a specific part of an incoming vehicle to prevent it from running you over. </p> <p>Grab the demo, give it a try.

I&#39;m looking for a VR headset that works well with Steam games like <em>American Truck Simulator</em>, <a href=\"http://BeamNG.drive\"><em>BeamNG.drive</em></a>, and <em>Hitman 3</em>. I want something that\u2019s <strong>not too expensive</strong> but still offers good performance and comfort. I\u2019ve seen some pre-owned Valve Index units for around $199 and the Meta Quest 2 at a similar price, but I\u2019m open to other suggestions too. Ideally, it should connect easily to my PC and provide a solid VR experience without breaking the bank. Any recommendations or experiences would be super helpful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cow_boymk1\"> /u/cow_boymk1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nvsw42/what_vr_should_i_get/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1nvsw42/what_vr_should_i_get/\">[comments]</a></sp",
