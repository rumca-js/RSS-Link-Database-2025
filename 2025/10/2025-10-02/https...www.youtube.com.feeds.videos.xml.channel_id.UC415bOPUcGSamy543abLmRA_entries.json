This is huge because for a long time we thought that only us humans made and used tools\u2026\n\n\u2026 Until Jane Goodall carefully studied chimps in Tanzania in 1960.\n\nShe revealed they were much more complex than we had ever thought, teaching us so much more about our closest relatives... and ourselves.\n\nThank you, Jane Goodall. We\u2019ll miss you.\n\n#shorts #chimpanzees #science #janegoodall #animals",
