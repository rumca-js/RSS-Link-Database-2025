For the users here: Why do you still use RSS? \u2022 What specific tools (readers, aggregators, custom scripts) do you rely on? \u2022 How has RSS helped you filter out the noise from social media algorithms? \u2022 What&#39;s a service or a site you wish still offered a reliable RSS feed? \u2022 What&#39;s the killer use case for you (e.g., tracking job postings, monitoring specific news sites, following YouTube channels without getting algorithm-baited)? For the skeptics (if any are lurking): \u2022 Why do you think the common perception is that RSS is obsolete?",
