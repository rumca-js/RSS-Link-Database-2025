Im using hyprland on arch btw. I&#39;ve been trying to do the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>have my system normally use the nvidia gpu for everyday tasks and gaming on linux(successfully did that)</p></li> <li><p>have a windows vm that i pass through the nvidia gpu to use(where im stuck)</p></li> </ul> <p>What i want to do is have the nvidia gpu detach from linux mid session and attach to the vm. Similarly have a way to detach it from the vm when im done with it and use it in linux like normal.</p> <p>Is this even possible? If not what would be the closest compromise that would achieve something similar.</p> <p>I already know that i can use only the igpu for linux and leave the nvidia one only for the vm but thats not what i want.</p> <p>Any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb</p> </div",

Its still pretty decent speed when gaming and some streaming. but I want to switch to a card that has a wider range like my laptop and phone. For reference i&#39;m on the second story.

I&#39;d think it be cool to see more projects come around to preserve old abandonware games (kinda like the Ruffle project that is meant to preserve Flash games in order for them to not become lost media). </p> <p>Happy to say I&#39;m glad I&#39;m gaming on Linux and hope to see what more comes out of it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd-Crab-604\"> /u/Odd-Crab-604 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
