        "description": "Shower corner insulation tips\u2026I had to frame a new shower wall but there\u2019s a gap between it and the old wall. I used Rockwool comfort batts to insulate that area. I like using this option for all the bathroom walls not only to insulate but to reduce sound into adjacent rooms. It also makes the bathroom more comfortable in the winter and summer \ud83d\udd25#insulation #rockwool #bathroomremodel #showerremodel #homerepairtutor",
