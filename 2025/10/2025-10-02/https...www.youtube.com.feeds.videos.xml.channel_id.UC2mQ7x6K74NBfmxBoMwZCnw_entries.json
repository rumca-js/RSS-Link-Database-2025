        "description": "Josh is back with a brand new Black Legion list, while Jacob from Foresight Gaming rallies the Cadian Shock Troops to hold the line. Old school rules meet old school attitudes as a Daemon Prince built the classic way struts in with every daemonic upgrade under the sun, Terminators pile out of a Land Raider, and those very 4th ed obliterators do work at 70 points a pop. \n\nAcross the trenches, iron discipline, sharpshooters, and a Hellhound template try to keep Chaos honest, while a Leman Russ Exterminator lays down the dakka. The mission is Meat Grinder, which means Josh has one job and Jacob has another... and dozer blades somehow become a recurring character. Expect flamer math, vox chatter, and a Commissar with bionics who refuses to take a hint.\n\n#Warhammer40k #BlackLegion #AstraMilitarum\n\nMembers to watch the Post Game Show, go here\nYoutube Members - https://youtu.be/8jj00kTPBhw\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bVault Members - https://www.miniwargaming.com/content/did-winning-used-to-matter-black-legion-vs",
