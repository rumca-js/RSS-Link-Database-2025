        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Over the past year I\u2019ve interviewed more than 100 women navigating perimenopause. Many have months (even years) of data from wearables, labs, and symptom logs. And yet, when they bring this data to a doctor, the response is often: <em>\u201cThat\u2019s just aging. Nothing to do here.\u201d</em></p> <p>When I step back and look at this through the lens of machine learning, the problem is obvious:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The training data gap.</strong> Most clinical AI models are built on datasets dominated by men or narrowly defined cohorts (e.g., heart failure patients). Life-stage transitions like perimenopause, pregnancy, or postpartum simply aren\u2019t represented.</li> <li><strong>The labeling gap.</strong> Even when women\u2019s data exists, it\u2019s rarely annotated with context like hormonal stage, cycle changes, or menopausal status. From an ML perspective, that\u2019s like training a vision model where half the images are mislabeled. No wonder predictions are unreliable.</li> <",

I came across some podcasts, but most of them have been around for some time already now, so I&#39;d assume they&#39;re talking about some of the more advanced stuff that&#39;s out there right now. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not willing to listen all of those podcasts back from A to Z, but since the tech is advancing so incredibly fast I might be falling even more behind than I already am if I do so. So my question was; what are some must listen podcasts/must watch videos to atleast understand all of the absolute necessary basics and have a foundation that&#39;s strong enough to dive right into some of the podcasts that are coming out nowadays. And an other small question on top of that; what are some of the absolute must listen, loose episodes (doesn&#39;t have to be the more &#39;basic stuff&#39; iykwim) that includes stuff that was so informati",

Researchers routinely talk about and ask whether this or that approach or idea is sufficiently &quot;bitter lesson pilled&quot; (meaning arranged so that it benefits from added computation for free) as a proxy for whether it&#39;s going to work or worth even pursuing. The underlying assumption being that LLMs are of course highly &quot;bitter lesson pilled&quot; indeed, just look at LLM scaling laws where if you put compute on the x-axis, number go up and to the right. So it&#39;s amusing to see that Sutton, the author of the post, is not so sure that LLMs are &quot;bitter lesson pilled&quot; at all. They are trained on giant datasets of fundamentally human data, which is both 1) human generated and 2) finite. What do you do when you run out? How do you prevent a human bias?

The paper focuses on the case of artificial general intelligence, AI with broadly human capabilities. The paper uses a bargaining model of war to apply standard causes of war to the special case of AI/human conflict. The paper argues that <em>information failures</em> and <em>commitment problems</em> are especially likely in AI/human conflict. Information failures would be driven by the difficulty of measuring AI capabilities, by the uninterpretability of AI systems, and by differences in how AIs and humans analyze information. Commitment problems would make it difficult for AIs and humans to",
