Other retailers such as Best Buy and Walmart continue to list subscriptions for that price, but have not yet publicly commented if they will follow Microsoft's MSRP for the service. In other news, developer Starbreeze has officially canceled its Dungeons & Dragons game, codenamed \"Project Baxter,\" laid off some of its developers, and recommitted to its troubled Payday 3 and the \"heist genre.\" And finally, Quentin Tarantino's martial arts western epic, Kill Bill, is returning to theaters as one four-hour film titled \"Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair.\" Originally released in two volumes six months apart, the two halves have been slightly re-edited as one film as originally envisioned by Tarantino.\n\n#IGN #Gami",
