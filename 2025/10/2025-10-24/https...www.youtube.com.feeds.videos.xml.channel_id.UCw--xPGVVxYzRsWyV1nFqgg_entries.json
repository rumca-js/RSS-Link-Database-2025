        "description": "Fantasy didn\u2019t start with Tolkien... but it also DID. \nIn this video, I trace the history of the modern fantasy genre \u2014 from roots in ancient myths and folklore to the pulp magazines, Tolkien\u2019s revolution, and the modern fantasy revolution. From Beowolf and Arthurian legend to Sanderson, Martin, and Le Guin \u2014 this is how fantasy became the world\u2019s most ambitious storytelling tradition.\n\n\ud83d\udcda My Books:\nBreach of Peace: https://tinyurl.com/BoPTLT\nRebels Creed: https://tinyurl.com/RCTLTDG\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch: https://www.danielbgreene.com\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/DanielBGreene\n\ud83c\udfa5 Second Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC-EqiFg67s2Nd0imgRXg5w\n\ud83d\udcac Discord: https://discord.gg/xUzhVv4\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dgreene101\n\ud83e\uddf5 Thread: https://www.threads.com/@dgreene101",
