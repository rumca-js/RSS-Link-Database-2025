Although Bach famously never travelled far, he was by no means immune to the popular zeitgeist, falling in love with imported works by composers such as Vivaldi and the Marcello brothers, whose music he copied and transcribed in his own inimitable way. This double disc, ingeniously programmed by French violinist Amandine Beyer, pays homage to those Italophile tendencies, juxtaposing Bach\u2019s works influenced by Italian originals with music by the composers themselves.</p><p>Some associations are obvious, such as Vivaldi\u2019s concerto for four violins that 25-or-so years later became Bach\u2019s concerto for four harpsichords.

But it\u2019s also a place of deep, loamy quiet \u2013 a world that hums with hidden life.

It\u2019s Halloween baking, but less fright night and more folklore. The aim is to evoke an enchanted woodland, dark, lush and a little eerie.

        "description": "<p>My work as a TV and film extra was a dream come true. My look \u2013 skinny and not too good-looking \u2013 was in high demand</p><p>I have always been a television addict. As a young boy growing up in Bath, I\u2019d devour programmes such as Doctor&nbsp;Who, desperate to know how they were created. At 16, I dared to tell a school careers adviser that I wanted to work in TV; she laughed and said a career in television was for people who went to&nbsp;university. She suggested I get a&nbsp;job in retail. Dejected, I reluctantly took on a job at a supermarket, but made my&nbsp;way up through the ranks. They had a&nbsp;budget for making corporate films, and I ended up directing and producing their training videos.</p><p>Then, in 1998, I saw an advert in a&nbsp;sci-fi magazine for unpaid extras for Auton, a Doctor Who spin-off. I dashed off an application and was thrilled to&nbsp;get a call weeks later, offering me a&nbsp;role as a villager.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/o",
