        "description": "Eric Carlson is a self-taught software engineer at Cisco. In his early 20s, he worked his way up to manager at the busiest Dominos Pizza in Canada. He eventually went to college and studied liberal arts, then worked as a teacher for two decades before teaching himself programming using freeCodeCamp. \n\nHe got his first developer job at age 45 by using his programming skills to pivot into a more technical role within a big telecom company. And he's since gone further down the stack, doing back end work and now DevOps.\n\nEric shares tips for:\n- Teaching yourself programming while raising young kids\n- Building up your mental stamina so you can program for many hours in one sitting\n- How to learn just-in-time so you don't waste time chasing \"shiny object\" tools\n- How to reinforce your learning by taking detailed notes on basically everything\n\nLinks we discuss during the show:\n- Eric's 2022 freeCodeCamp forum post about his journey into software development: https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/",
