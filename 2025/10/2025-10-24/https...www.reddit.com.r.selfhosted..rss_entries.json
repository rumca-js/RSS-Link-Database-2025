I have hardware that can support them all, and can work my way around new systems if needed, but my imagination is lacking on what I should do with them. I currently run unRaid serving up a bunch of things already, but that is a large amount of platter drives and apparently unRaid does not play well with SSDs as the array due to lack of TRIM support. I thought maybe proxmox, as that serems to do better with an all SSD set up, but again the question of &quot;and do what&quot; comes up. Is there anything worth making that would take advantage of the faster speeds? Make a dedicated media server for plex/jellyfin that serves up my Linux distros faster maybe?</p> <p>The simple answer is use them in my NUCs for something, or just put them in a gaming rig and download half of Steam, but I feel they could be better used.

I recently found out about self-hosting and thought it might be a good alternative. From what I\u2019ve read, I\u2019ll need a device to run a server on \u2014 and that\u2019s where I\u2019m stuck.</p> <p>I have an Alienware 15 R3 (P69F) lying around. Some specs:</p> <ul> <li>i7-7700HQ</li> <li>16GB RAM</li> <li>GTX 1080 (6GB)</li> <li>1TB SSD + 1TB HDD</li> </ul> <p>However, the laptop is a bit old and has a few issues:</p> <ul> <li>The battery is swollen (I\u2019ve replaced it 3 times already).</li> <li>One fan makes a ticking noise and might need replacement.</li> <li>It tends to overheat when under load.</li> <li>It runs fine without the battery if plugged in directly.</li> </ul> <p>My main question is:<br/> Is this laptop suitable for self-hosting?<br/> Wou",

During the last months updates lagged more and more behind new releases. I asked about the current situation in TM&#39;s feedback forum and the post was silently deleted after 20 minutes. Current state is a TM repository update from Sep 22 and 14 entries added to the changelog of the cloud variant since this date (mainly and most important, support for recent mainstream models). Nothing of it appeared for the self-hosting code.</p> <p>My impression is, the one-time purchase option doesn&#39;t work too well and the developer gradually reduces support.
