And now i read occasionally. </p> <p>In the last few years, one book that i really really liked was The Hunger Games. Another book that i found interesting to read was The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. So i think i kind of like reading mystery/thriller? </p> <p>But i don&#39;t think I like reading something too dark/depressing. </p> <p>I recently also tried to read Anxious People by Fredrik Backman but I kind of found it boring and couldn&#39;t really bring myself to finish it. </p> <p>I am okay with romance novels, but don&#39;t want wattpad kind of romance you know?

I slept while reading it today morning, which is not a good sign. </p> <p>For those who have read it, what do you suggest I do - Should i abandon it? Or continue to invest time effort? Does reading it get easier or more interesting as we proceed? If not, is it worth investing the time and effort that it requires? Or, for the key conclusions, should I instead read the book&#39;s summary online? Please advise!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Philosopher7048\"> /u/Ok_Philosopher7048 </a> <br/> <span",

I like stories that feel layered but don\u2019t require constant decoding.</p> <p>Physical: I\u2019m not gentle with my books \u2014 I highlight, dog-ear, and revisit them often. If I\u2019m buying a hard copy, it has to pull me in the way Kristin Hannah does. Her books consistently wreck me in the best way.</p> <p>Kindle/eBook: Quick, emotional, and easy to consume. I use this format when I want something fast-paced yet meaningful enough to stick.</p> <p>I tend to reach for stories with emotional depth and strong storytelling, but without heavy focus on race, sex, or gender themes. Modern fiction often loses me when it feels like it\u2019s",

The image was basically the pocket/waist area of jeans, not an illustration.<br/></li> <li>I originally read it around the late 1990s / early 2000s (could be early 2000s or a later reprint). The author was American (I think).<br/></li> <li>Other small memories: rural / small-town vibe, family secrets. Possibly marketed as YA / teen fiction.</li> </ul>",
