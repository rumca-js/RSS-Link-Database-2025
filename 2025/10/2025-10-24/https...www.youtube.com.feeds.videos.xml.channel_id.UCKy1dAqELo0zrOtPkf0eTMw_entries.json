        "description": "Tormented Souls 2 reviewed by Vikki Blake on PC, also available on PlayStation and Xbox.\n\nIf you're nostalgic for the survival horror games of old, Tormented Souls 2 can provide a modern-looking trip down memory lane, with all the good and bad that brings. It has a tense atmosphere to soak up and some gorgeously spooky locations to explore, but you\u2019ll need to push through janky combat and a bit of backtracking to enjoy them. Its esoteric puzzles test your brainpower in a way that could sometimes frustrate, but will also delight anyone who missed smashing key items together to see what would happen. There's a lot to enjoy here, as well as plenty that perhaps should have remained in the past, but Tormented Souls 2 still manages to stand as an entertaining callback to the adventures that made contemporary horror gaming what it is.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
