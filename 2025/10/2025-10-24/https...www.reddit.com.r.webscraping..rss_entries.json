So I tried out a bit with ChatGPT but couldn&#39;t get the work done \ud83e\udd72 My problem is the following. I do have a list with around 500 doctors offices in Germany (name, phone number and address) and need to get the opening hours. Is there any GPT that can help me best as I don&#39;t know how to use Python etc.? The normal agent mode on ChatGPT isn&#39;t really a fit. Sorry again about such a dorky question I spent multiple hours trying out different approaches but couldn&#39;t find an adequate way yet. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Nick060789\"> /u/Nick060789 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ofabmc/noon_needs_some_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ofabmc/noon_needs_some_help/\">[comments]</a></span>",
