        "description": "As Washington tries to iron out the details of phase two of Trump\u2019s Gaza plan, including a demand for Hamas to disarm, analyst Rob Geist Pinfold says \u201call sorts of compromises\u201d are possible on disarmament. \u201cHamas could, for example, agree to give up its heavy weapons \u2013 things like its long-range rockets and mortars \u2013 whilst keeping its small arms,\u201d said Pinfold, a lecturer in international security at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe issue here will be Israel. Netanyahu has campaigned on total victory, the total destruction, the disarmament, of Hamas, which will mean that Israel will drag its feet all the way.\u201d Pinfold told Al Jazeera that completely disarming the Palestinian group at this stage is \u201cnot achievable and not likely\u201d. \u201cThe group will be basically committing institutional suicide and giving up something which it won\u2019t be able to get back in the future to use as leverage against Israel. If we are going to see any disarmament of Hamas, it\u2019s likely to be some kind of a compromise ",

It\u2019s a daily struggle to meet the most basic human needs here amid destruction, amid hunger, amid the grief.\n\nPeople are returning, but they\u2019re returning here to only skeletons of these buildings. There is nothing inside, no access to water, no access to food supplies, and it\u2019s not appropriate for sheltering as they were given a warning that many of these buildings are severely damaged and near collapse.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen people walk for hours, sometimes days, in search of flour, or lentils, or some canned food in order to survive these difficult conditions.\n\nAlso, people are still living in the dark here. The whole entire power grid system has been destroyed.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud reports.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X : https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.co",
