The first thing the IPS guy offered, without hesitation, was that I have the right to have a dedicated IP address, and this was included in my plan. I wasn&#39;t even aware that I was using a shared IP address for years, but I knew that when I checked my IP address with &quot;WhatsYourIP&quot;, it always located me in different places in my country. I&#39;m in Europe, btw. </p> <p>So, I told him to yes, please change my IP to a dedicated one if this will solve the dropouts, and he immediately assigned me to a new IP address. </p> <p>Now I can see that my location is sharp when using &quot;whatsyourip&quot;, and this really bothers me. </p> <p>Should I use a VPN from now on, or should I request to have a shared IP address again?
