But we like to play board games. I\u2019m definitely competitive but also didn\u2019t have as much experience in strategy games as most of the games we played as a kid had more luck based elements (like Uno). But the rest of this group was raised in strategy games (my brother through his friends). </p> <p>I personally way prefer coop games, party games or games with a luck element because then I can take the \u201closing because you don\u2019t have the skill\u201d element out of it lol. And I can just focus on the fun. </p> <p>But my group doesn\u2019t like those games, they all get bored, they like strategy. And not only that, in game mode they go full ruthless killer mode lol. They play not only to win, but to disrupt your strategy and mess with you and they give no sh*ts lol. </p> <p>So when I play I\u2019m minding my own business just workin\u2019 o",

What I like about the game War of the Ring the Card Game is that it is really meant to have different factions on each team as each faction plays differently. Actually, I think when you play WotR the Card Game it is worse when you combine the decks as then the factions are gone. Is Dune War for Arrakis just simply splitting and combining the teams or does each factions have a unique experience or personal victory condition? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Safe873\"> /u/Safe873 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1of9xz5/dune_war_for_arrakis_at_3players/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1of9xz5/dune_war_for_arrakis_at_3players/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It was a square box filled with smaller squares, each with a tiny stick/handle thing. The print/pattern was green lines on white background that create squiggles, open squiggly shapes or circles. The goal of the game was to turn one square at a time, trying to create a shape corresponding with the one on the card you drew, while your opponents might sabotage you in order to get their shapes in.

I\u2019m looking for something with relatively easy to learn mechanics, fast enough pace to keep someone with undiagnosed ADHDs attention, and where set up, game play, and clean up don\u2019t take more than an hour.

It&#39;s rare to have a game that is so deep and interesting while also being so accessible. We&#39;ve played it with groups spanning four generations in the same room! But it has a core limitation: only two players get to create and link clues, while the others mostly wait for their turn to guess.</p> <p>I wanted to fix that. The goal of this rework is to make everyone play simultaneously, to keep all players focused on the interesting linguistic and abstract puzzle, and to reduce waiting time to a minimum. The price to pay is that it\u2019s no longer a team game, and it becomes more intense and less casual.</p> <hr/> <h2>Setup</h2> <ul> <li>Use the same grid of 25 words as in the base game.</li> <li>Each ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey erveryone,</p> <p>I have a rule question and I hope you can help me.<br/> The Slime card and the treefolk card tell that you need to fill out 2 spaces (each 1x1) with monsters after this monster is surrounded from tiles.</p> <p>So my question is about the timing.<br/> Let&#39;s say I draw one of those cards early on like in spring and I have plenty of space left, so nothing is surrounded - no 1x1 spaces are filled.<br/> We move on, and space gets filled and then somewhat later in the game those monster is totally surrounded. Does this effect apply also in winter for example whereas I have drawn the card in spring? Or is it just for the season the card was drawn (in this case spring) and I am lucky that no 1x1 spaces are filled?</p> <p>The option that the card also have an impact later on in game would spice that up ;)</p> <p>Thank you!</p> <p>Edit: For those of you who want to take a look at the cards:<br/> Treefolk: <a href=\"https://boardgamegeek",

Not with the intention to replace physical decks EVER, but instead just always have the option to play even when there\u2019s no space. Whether you\u2019re at home, on a plane, at the bar, etc.</p> <p>I\u2019ve gotten some great feedback from you guys and would love to hear more so I can incorporate it!! Definitely want to make this an app for the people, esp the people who like card games so feel free to take a look and let me know what I should add!</p> <p>Some upcoming features:</p> <ul> <li>multiplayer feature so everyone can have their own hand as their phone</li> <li>customizable deck patterns so you can add your own designs/photos</li> <li>saved layouts so you can make up your own game and save it for later</li> </ul> <p>Anyways,",
