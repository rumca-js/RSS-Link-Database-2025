Unfortunately I have come to the realization that I do not enjoy raunchy humor or an excessive use of profanities. For example I did really enjoy the lies of lock lamore but at some point I couldnt help but roll my eyes at the banter between the characters.</p> <p>Ideally I would love to read a book about a noble, idealistic perhaps even morally conflicted thief (or similar in job description). It doesnt matter to me whether the book is a big epic fantasy or a smaller scale, more character-driven story. But definitely bonus points for no romance.</p> <p>I hope this is not to much of an outlandish request and thank you in advance!</p> <p>(Before it comes up I have read six of crows and mistborne)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",

I had the opportunity to see the author give a guest sermon at a church in Oxford a couple of years later and was totally smitten. Waited impatiently for The Book of Dust over the years, and wow are these books are delivering (despite some questionable narrative choices in The Secret Commonwealth that did not ruin the book for me but I hope will pay off as this trilogy ends). </p> <p>I\u2019m diving into The Rose Field now and it\u2019s picking up exactly where the previous book ended. Can\u2019t wait to find out where we\u2019re going, but also already sad that it will no doubt mean saying goodbye to this universe and these characters once again\u2014and for good, this time.</p> <p>One of the best fantasy worlds in the hands of a master storyteller, to my mind. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hieronymos_of_Cardia\"> /u/Hieronymos",
