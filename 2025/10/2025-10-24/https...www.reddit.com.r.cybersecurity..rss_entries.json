Recently though, I\u2019ve been really interested in how AI and cybersecurity intersect.</p> <p>I\u2019m still junior in the field (less than 2 years of experience), so I don\u2019t qualify yet for management-level certs like AAISM or CISM, but I\u2019d love to start building a foundation now.</p> <p>Has anyone here taken one of these or found another program that\u2019s actually recognized and valuable (not just marketing)? I\u2019d especially love advice for someone who\u2019s technical/offensive-minded but wants to stay relevant and not get replaced by AI down the road.</p> <p>Thanks a lot for any insight, really appreciate it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",

The whole passwd mgt of on prem users, hybrid users, remote users, windows and apple users makes it very challenging. Curious if users are going with NOT expiring passwords on a schedule.

This makes it far harder for law enforcement to identify, stop, and arrest cybercriminals, as often the victim country\u2019s legal jurisdictions, warrants, and courts do not apply in the criminal\u2019s country.</p> <p>It is rare that a country without an international legal agreement will agree to identify, arrest, or block a hacker located in its country when they are only attacking another country. Russia and China, for example, certainly aren\u2019t going to arrest and detain hackers in their country for things that the US reports. And let me be clear, vice versa.

We had over 40K separate publicly announced vulnerabilities announced last year, and we are on track to have over 47K this year. That&#39;s over 130 a day, day-after-day, year-after-year. AI bots are certainly going to decrease the patching window. Some non-minor percentage of people/companies don&#39;t patch (at least in a timely manner). Given these facts how can anyone be against default auto-patching? If you don&#39;t like or want auto-patching (for very valid reasons) how can you be against default auto-patching? A lot of people (rightly) say you should test all patches before applying, but let&#39;s be honest with each other, almost no one really does that (correctly, if at all). Yes, auto-patching can cause operational issues (e.g., Crowdstrike), but the damage done by not timely matching is hundreds to thousands of times higher",

My industry is very shaky right now and I\u2019m considering doing a 180 and going the office job route and I felt like cybersecurity was a very interesting industry to get into and I had been intrigued by technology and the internet growing up. </p> <p>I have absolutely no knowledge in cybersecurity, programming, coding etc. I\u2019m heavily considering going all out but I don\u2019t know where to start. What could be the basics I can learn and study through YouTube videos and free online classes/articles? What\u2019s the next step after learning the basics, what and when should I get certifications and in what order? Should I go to college/university and if so what should I study? Bachelors, masters?</p> <p>Any and all advice helps!
