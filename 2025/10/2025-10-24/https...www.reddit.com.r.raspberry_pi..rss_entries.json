I originally thought that I could jank/homelab the Pi5 case fan to work, but couldn&#39;t so I ordered the Pi5 active cooler. When I attempted to install it, one of the spring pins broke and now I&#39;ve got a tilted heating and cooler. Is there any replacements like an .STL or something I can get so I dont have to waste the one I have since it should be fine still. I&#39;m trying to waste as little as I can, so an STL would be the best solution, but if there isn&#39;t anything then I&#39;ll just order a new one.</p> <p>Again, this isn&#39;t about a price, just not wanting to throw away something that works if I don&#39;t have to</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Partlow99\"> /u/Partlow99 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1oemlpt/broken_spring_pin_on_active_cooler_for_pi5/\">[link]<",

I understand the purpose of Rule 3 (ask for refinements, not full designs), and I certainly am not looking for a full solution. Where is the appropriate place to ask if RPi is even worth considering for a given project? I don&#39;t wish to order a unit &amp; components and then learn that RPi is a non-starter for my particular application. I have searched RPi video projects, but the ones I find seem to be geared to media servers and streaming content rather than manipulating a live feed (I want to pass a live video feed to a touch monitor and have the option of seeing the full picture or cropping &amp; zooming on specific areas of the video). I&#39;m not asking <em>how</em> to do it, I just need to know if RPi could be an efficient approach. Is there a better place to ask this question?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jdjintx\"",
