The commitment to preserving not just source compatibility, but also ABI (binary) compatibility is strong. However, as the language evolves and accumulates new features, we can reveal issues with existing features, and we wish to remove harmful or misleading behavior or to reduce the complexity of growing redundancy.\n\nThe C++ Standard has adopted a process to advertise that we would like to remove or change a feature in some future Standard, allowing developers to adapt to such revised rules and to update their code at a time of their choosing, rather than as a cost of updating to the latest Standard.",
