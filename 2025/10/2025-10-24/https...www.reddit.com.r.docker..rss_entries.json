I&#39;ve set up a fresh Proxmox VE [Mention your version, e.g., 8.x] install, installed Docker Engine and the Compose plugin following the official docs, but I can&#39;t get my containers to run reliably.</p> <p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p> <p>My <code>docker-compose.yml</code> includes a standard <code>postgres:15</code> service and a FastAPI application service (<code>qrlogic</code>). Both of these containers crash immediately upon startup and enter a restart loop.

But that&#39;s not what I want, I want to use volumes.<br/> And I know that docker creates volumes under /var/lib/docker/volumes.</p> <p>I keep my /root fs rather small and provide storage to my apps as needed. For example I have a raid1 device, say /dev/md1p1, of several TB size in my box which I would mount in fstab under /srv/nas/media.</p> <p>Now I&#39;m beginning to dockerize my apps and my question is how I can provide that diskspace as a volume for a container. </p> <p>Do I simply mount /dev/md1p1 under /var/lib/docker/volumes in fstab?
