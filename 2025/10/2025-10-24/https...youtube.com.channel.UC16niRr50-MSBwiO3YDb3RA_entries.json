        "description": "Voting starts on Saturday for one of America\u2019s biggest and most prominent political positions. \n\nHow did Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, emerge as the frontrunner to be the next mayor of New York, despite being virtually unknown at the start of his campaign?   \n\nSarah, Justin and Anthony look in more detail at his policies, and in particular the centrepiece of his campaign around the cost of living. Mamdani says he will make New York more affordable, by increasing housing stock, raising taxes for the rich and bringing down the cost of rent. How realistic are his promises and how much could it matter if he can\u2019t deliver? We also unpack his views on Israel and Gaza, and how his views on Gaza could affect the Jewish vote in New York, the biggest outside of Israel.   \n\nWe get an inside track on Mamdani\u2019s campaign from Eric Lach, staff writer at the New Yorker, who has been following him on the campaign trail, from before he won the primaries, to having dinner at Mamdani\u2019s apartmen",

Then, a planned summit in Budapest between the US and Russian presidents was called off by Trump who said it would have been a \u2018waste of time\u2019.  \n\nBut, the White House has now increased the pressure on the Kremlin announcing sanctions on Russia\u2019s two largest oil companies, a first for the Trump administration since his return to office. But will these sanctions be enough to push Putin to the negotiating table? Or will the Kremlin see them as an escalation?   \n\nAnd as European leaders join Zelensky in insisting that any talks on ending the war in Ukraine should start with freezing the current front line, how should we interpret the Ukrainian leader's language?  \n\nTo answer your questions, Lucy and Vitaly are joined by the BBC\u2019s Europe Digital Editor Paul Kirby and senior digital journalist Laura Gozzi. \n\nThe team also discuss the EU\u2019s plan for using ",

        "description": "Plaid Cymru defeated Reform UK in the Welsh Parliament by-election for Caerphilly, with Labour coming third and suffering its first parliamentary defeat there for 100 years.\n \nPlaid's candidate Lindsay Whittle won 47% of the vote with a majority of 3,848, in what was the 14th time he has stood for election.\n \nThe result saw a swing of 27% from Labour, which has held the seat in Westminster since the 1920s and in the Senedd since it began.\n \nA former Caerphilly council leader who has been a councillor for almost 50 years, Whittle said: \"We've beaten billionaire-backed Reform and, with the same determination, we can do it again in May 2026.\"\n \nHe also paid an emotional tribute to the late Caerphilly Member of the Senedd Hefin David, whose death had triggered the by-election, saying David's \"kindness\" was the \"guiding spirit\" of his campaign.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Wales #Caerphilly #BBCNews",
