I used the <a href=\"https://github.com/frankcrawford/it87\">it87 driver</a>.<br/> I did a bios update a few days ago which led to a few problems:<br/> So i noticed that my fans just where not responsive to my pwm value so I looked deeper.<br/> I noticed that as soon as my temp sensor 1 (System1) gets over 40\u00b0C the motherboard overwrites all given PWM-values.<br/> There are a few bios settings:<br/> Fan Control and Fan Control table<br/> I set both of them to manuel and tweaked the settings but it didn&#39;t changed anything. So I found no way around this magic 40\u00b0C marker.</p> <p>So searched through reddit but couldn&#39;t find an answer. So does anybody has this problem, too? Or is there even a solution?</p> <p>Thanks for the help ^^</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Forcii1\"> /u/Forci",

Recently my system was force upgraded from the Nvidia 550 driver to the Nvidia 580-open driver, everything in the system works perfectly fine, except for Windows games, which after launching for moments proceed to freeze, having to quit the game. Native Linux games work just fine. I have tried Proton-GE 9-25 and Proton Experimental but they all yield the same results. The weird thing is, if i turn off my laptop display the game plays just fine on my external monitor and vice versa, So i have no idea what the cause is. I tried various kernel parameters like nvidia_drm.modeset=1 and nvidia_drm.fbdev=1 but both do nothing to solve the issue. Do note that game sounds don&#39;t freeze, they keep playing like nothing happened (like the bgm) but nothing else happens it just loops.</p> <p>Running Linux Mint 22.2 Cinnamon X11 on a hybrid dual GPU setup",
