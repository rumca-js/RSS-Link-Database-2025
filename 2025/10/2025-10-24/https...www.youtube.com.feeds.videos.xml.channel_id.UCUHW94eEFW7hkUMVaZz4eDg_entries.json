White rainbows need three things to form: mist, the sun, and you. White rainbows are the same as regular rainbows, except they only form when the water drops in the air are super small. To find a white rainbow, go out when the Sun is low in the sky, like in the morning or evening. You want the Sun to be behind you so that a ~40 degree angle from the droplet to you and the sun is achievable. You'll need to be in a very thin fog, thin enough that the sun shines through but thick enough to reflect the sun's light back. Look away from the sun (the same way you do with a regular rainbow).  \n\nREFERENCES:\nMie theory, Airy theory, and the natural rainbow - https://opg.optica.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=AO-37-9-1506 \nPhysically-based simulation of rainbows - https",
