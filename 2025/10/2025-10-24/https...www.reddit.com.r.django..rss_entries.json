Last week PdfDing was selected to receive a grant from the <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/news/2025/20251016-selection-NGI0CommonsFund.html\">NGI Zero Commons Fund</a>. This fund is dedicated to helping deliver, mature and scale new internet commons across the whole technology spectrum and is amongst others funded by the European Commission. The exact sum of the grant still needs to be discussed, but obviously I am very stocked to have been selected and need to share it with the community.</p> <p>You can find the repository <a href=\"https://github.com/mrmn2/PdfDing\">here</a>.
