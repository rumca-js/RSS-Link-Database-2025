Do you even API???\n\nThere is so much more to OpenAI than ChatGPT. Instead of using an off the shelf product you can build your own AI platform and solutions that are powered by OpenAI's AI services through their API. Whether you want a question and answer system for your users, a way to track emotional state of your customers, or you want to have AI create images for you the API can do all of this and more.\n\nThe cost to use the API's beyond cheap. You only pay for what you use and 1000 tokens is now a fraction of a penny. And you offload the work to their servers so you don't need to buy an expensive GPU, you can literally run an AI platform on any computer that has an Operating System.\n\nThis class will go over:\n\nCreating an Account, Costs, and Account Management\nText Generation\nImage Generation\nVoice and Audio\nVisi",
