Linux is very amazing and i want to support them, by giving healthier torrents. My internet is really good, 1000 Down and 400 Up, so i can seed fast and reliably. I also have a massive 2TB SSD.</p> <p>I started out with Ubuntu (All LTS Versions from 14.04 to 24.04) and then Linux Mint, from versions starting from 17 to the latest. Seeding older operating systems isn&#39;t a good idea, but i still wanted to help, there is and will be someone that may want to try a older version of Linux to see what it felt like to use. For the older Linux Mint files, i could not find on the official site, i had to go to a 3rd party site, most of the torrents are dead, unfortunately, but i can bring them back to life.</p> <p>What more distros you would recommend? Should i download even older Ubuntu and Mint versions? What do you think",

She was hit by a wrong way driver on St.Patrick&#39;s day 2025 I recently came into some of her items, including this old Toshiba Satellite that she used primarily to type on, as she was a bit of an author (she actually wrote the story to the first &quot;Read Only Memories&quot; game). I would like to get into it, read her writings, feel close to her. But, none of the passwords I know for her are working. Can anyone guide me into getting in somehow? It&#39;s running Lubuntu</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ahegao1313\"> /u/Ahegao1313 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1oejfl3/trying_to_get_into_a_laptop/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1oejfl3/trying_to_get_into_a_laptop/\">[comments]</a></",
