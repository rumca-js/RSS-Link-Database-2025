        "description": "Digital Foundry is now fully independent! Join the DF Supporter Program and support the team: https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx\n\nThe Outer Worlds 2 on PC isn't quite as solid technically as the Xbox versions of the game, proving to be particularly heavy on console-equivalent CPUs in particular. Alex looks at the usual stuff: menu quality, shader compilation/stutter issues, GPU performance and - of course - optimised settings. Suffice to say that using max settings on this one is a gigantic waste of your GPU's resources.\n\nGo here to check out DF merch! https://store.digitalfoundry.net\n\nSubscribe for more Digital Foundry: http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe\n\n00:00:00 Introduction\n00:00:21 Shader Compilation + CPU Performance\n00:08:03 Optimised Settings\n00:18:02 Conclusion",
