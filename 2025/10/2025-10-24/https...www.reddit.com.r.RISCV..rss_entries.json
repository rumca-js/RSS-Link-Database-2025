U-mode can issue system calls to EE and share memory buffers allocated in user-space so EE can read/write them as part of syscall processing. I am looking at a way of making sure the buffers that are passed are in fact in user-space and access control is enforced by PMP even during the syscall execution (in machine mode). So I wanted to utilize the `mstatus.MPRV` mechanism to make the EE to &quot;pretend&quot; to be U-mode when accessing this memory. The problem is that when EE might want to do something like `memcpy` from M-mode space to U-space with MPRV set, both the source and the destination would see U-mode-like access and will cause PMP access fault to the M-space side. So it looks like the only way to perform such a copy is low-level word-by-word copy via a register with toggling MPRV on and off for every word (or fixed limited number of wor",
