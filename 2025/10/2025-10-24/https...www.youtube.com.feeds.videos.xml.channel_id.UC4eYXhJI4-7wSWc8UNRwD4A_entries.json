        "description": "Alant\u00e9 Serene | October 24, 2025\nAsake arrived at the office with a warm smile and a quiet confidence that instantly bloomed as he stepped behind the Desk. The Nigerian artist is known for his high-energy stage presence, but this concert shows just how effortlessly he can blend the sounds of Afrobeats, amapiano and Fuji in an intimate setting.\n\nGrounded in his Yoruba roots, Asake's music unites people across cultures worldwide. This set pulls hits from his last three projects, laced together in a seamless medley and backed by a stellar band. By the end, Asake joins in on the fun: He plays a set of mini bongos as \"Fuji Vibe\" closes with a dance break that'll have you moving in your living room. His performance transforms the Tiny Desk into a celebration of rhythm and connection, reminding us that music is more than just sound, it's a feeling.\n\nSET LIST\n\"WHY LOVE\"\n\"Amapiano\" \n\"Awodi\"\n\"Remember\"\n\"Lonely at the Top\" \n\"Ototo\" \n\"MMS\" \n\"Organise\"\n\"Fuji Vibe\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAsake: vocals, percuss",
