To my surprise, many people spoke about Heathcliff with deep compassion, even admiration. Some described him as tragic, romantic, and apparently found him attractive.</p> <p>I sat there feeling nothing but revulsion.</p> <p>To me, Heathcliff isn\u2019t a romantic hero. He\u2019s a sadist, an abuser, a man consumed by vengeance and cruelty and just violence. I couldn\u2019t understand how anyone could speak about him so positively.</p> <p>Yes, I understand why Heathcliff is the way he is. Or I think I do. He been through a lot of rejection, humiliation, and psychological and physical trauma of getting beat up. He was orphaned and denied love. But does that justify his actions? No.</p> <p>It\u2019s one thing to explain a person\u2019s behavior; it\u2019s another to excuse it. Heathcliff doesn\u2019t just suff",
