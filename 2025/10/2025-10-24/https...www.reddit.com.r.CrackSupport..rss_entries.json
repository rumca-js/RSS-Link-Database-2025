If anybody has some knowledge pleas tell me why it is/isn&#39;t possible.</p> <p>I ask this question because the first 2 chapters were realy good and I genuinely want to know what&#39;s next, the game was fun, but 2 chapters that barely got to 2 hours just doesn&#39;t scratch my itch. And waiting for a product I paid for so that I can fully enjoy it just feels scummy.</p> <p>Every comment is appreciated \ud83e\udee1</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LEE_LEE_8D\"> /u/LEE_LEE_8D </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackS",
