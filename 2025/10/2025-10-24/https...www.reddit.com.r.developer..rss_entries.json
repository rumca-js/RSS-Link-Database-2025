I want to switch to a core software role and be job-ready by June 2026, but I\u2019m confused between Backend Developer and Data Scientist. I\u2019m not very strong technically yet but can dedicate 2\u20133 hours daily to learning. Which path would be more achievable and better for growth within 8 months? Also, how can I use my automation background to make the switch easier? Any advice or roadmap would really help. Thanks! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lazy_Explanation_239\"> /u/Lazy_Explanation_239 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1oeyurr/backend_developer_vs_data_scientist_which_path_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1oeyurr/backend_developer_vs_data_scientist_which_path_to/\">[comments]</a",
