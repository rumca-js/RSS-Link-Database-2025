The life-or-death drama started when the trooper pulled over a pickup truck in Kentucky. The trooper's bodycam captured the moment he was shot in the leg. The good Samaritan nurses happened to be passing by, and came to the trooper's aid. They applied a tourniquet using a belt, and tried to keep the injured officer conscious.",

It imagines the chilling minute-by-minute response by the U.S. government as a nuclear warhead bears down on the country.

Inside Edition producer Michelle Sigona saw trucks driving to the golf course and dumping debris to form hills that will become integrated in the course over time. There are growing concerns Friday about what else might be in the rubble. Environmental scientist Jerry Roseman says there is a high possibility of it containing toxic material.",

As luck would have it, the dog owner's neighbor just happened to be a fire fighter, and he called in the cavalry. Fire fighters tried to use a hose, but that didn't work. Nor did the jaws of life. Finally, they used inflatable air bags to move the boulders. Zoe's owner was so excited that their dog was freed that they dropped their camera!",
