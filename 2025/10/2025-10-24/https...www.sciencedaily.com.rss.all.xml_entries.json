        "description": "ASU scientists found that people whose gut microbes make more methane extract more calories from fiber-rich foods. Methanogens help the microbiome turn fiber into energy by consuming hydrogen and producing methane. Using advanced metabolic chambers, researchers measured how diet and gut chemistry interact, showing that methane may signal efficient digestion. The work could lead to personalized diets based on individual microbiomes.",

        "description": "A massive genetic study found that naturally lower cholesterol is linked to a dramatically reduced risk of dementia. The research simulated the effects of cholesterol-lowering drugs and showed up to an 80% lower risk for certain genetic profiles. Scientists believe high cholesterol may contribute to dementia through atherosclerosis and small blood clots. Long-term trials could confirm whether medications can replicate this protective effect.",

With its long snout, small horns, and lean build, it represents a transitional form between swift mid-sized predators and giant apex hunters like T. rex. The find also suggests that large Tyrannosaurs first evolved in North America following an ancient migration from Asia.",
