Pep Guardiola knows most about the Norwegian\u2019s talents and jokingly suggested a plan to keep him out: \u201cFour centre-backs.\u201d There are no straightforward answers, especially as so many have tried and failed.</p><p>On Sunday Aston Villa and Unai Emery will be tasked with formulating a strategy to keep Haaland quiet. Not that the Manchester City player is particularly perturbed by not being involved for much of a match. His touches are infrequent but very often telling. The focus generally against Haaland is preventing the ball from reaching him but with City\u2019s array of creative talents, that is easier said than done.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/24/how-to-stop-erling-haal",
