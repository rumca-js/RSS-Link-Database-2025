If you&#39;re unconvinced , please do your own independent scrutiny on this (you will find that hundreds of people are already doing this daily). This is a side hustle where you basically collect free recurring gifts from sweepstakes sites to collect at minimum ~$400+ a month.</p> <p><strong>The faster and profitable part of this side hustle is farming the welcome offers from the sites, which earns near $1.5k each month. To make it as easy as possible, here is the executive summary of this:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Sites will offer you an inordinate discounted offer for &quot;SC&quot; (coins that can be exchanged for real money). You can simply buy these packages at crazy rates like $15 for 40 SC ($40).</li> <li>Now that you have 40 SC, you will be required to play this amount through once, in order to redeem it to your bank.

In this video I use it to visualise the Tesla Q3 earnings release. You can upload any document that you want to visualise. Charts will be generated whenever there is a lot of numerical data and otherwise it will generate illustrations.</p> <p>Check it out:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.visualbook.app\">https://www.visualbook.app</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitt",
