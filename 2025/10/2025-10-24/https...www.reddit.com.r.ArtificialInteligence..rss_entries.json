In the past couple of months, the subject is starting to be brought up with gradually increasing frequency in mainstream news media. The claims vary depending on source. But probably more than half the time I see this subject brought up, whether a post, a comment, or a CBS News Story, there&#39;s a critical piece of information missing. The timeline! &quot;AI is expected to do {this} to {this job market}.&quot; Okay. In 2 years or 20? Many times, they don&#39;t say. So you get people questioning the plausibility. But are you questioning over 3 years or 13 years time?!</p> <p>These TV commentators were laughing how slow the fulfillment robots were in the video clip their station used. Huh? Do you actually think THOSE are the robots that will replace people? Their proof of concept you idiots. LMFAO. Next time you make a prediction, be sure to include the timeline.</p> </div><!-- SC",

So I wondered how can I identify Accounts that are run by AI or post AI generated texts?</p> <p>1 good hint pointing toward AI texts seem to be posts that generate a lot of engagement, but then the original poster never interacts with any comments. Is this a valid clue though? I feel AI can easily enteract with commentators.</p> <p>Another thing thats tickles my senses is generic text.
