We have 36 Quest headsets (5 are 3S, and the rest are 3)</p> <p>We&#39;ve been using ArborXR, and I love it! However, with Meta&#39;s recent licensing change, and the fact that ArborXR was paid for by temporary grant funding, we&#39;re trying to use Horizon Managed Services instead. So far, I&#39;m annoyed more than anything else.</p> <p>From what I can see, you can&#39;t install YouTube if the device is in Shared Mode, and so far, I haven&#39;t been able to figure out anything in HMS that would allow for a kiosk-esque experience... Which is unfortunate since I have 5 headsets that are supposed to be dedicated to showing 360 videos. </p> <p>Anyone fought this battle? Am I SOL without a Third-party MDM?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",
