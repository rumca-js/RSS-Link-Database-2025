        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So a while ago I seeded a torrent for a TV show that was encoded by a member of the SEVreleases encoding group, on the torrent itself there was a txt file basically saying that they could no longer be reached out via 1337x.to do to strict guidelines that prohibit regular members from reaching out to the encoders directly, the txt file suggested making an account on glodls.to and reaching out to them over there, it also said that they had a chatroom on Discord so I reached out to the SEVreleases account kindly asking for an invite yesterday but I haven&#39;t heard from them...I&#39;m starting to think that since they were around for about the same time as TAoE it makes me wonder if SEVreleases also left the public tracker scene in favor of private trackers or they simply quit encoding all together idk, does anyone know if they&#39;re still active? If so where can I contact them?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",
