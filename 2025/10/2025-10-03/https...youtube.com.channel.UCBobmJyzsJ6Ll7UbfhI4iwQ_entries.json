        "description": "Watch this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025 in which Matthew Campbell of Obsidian gives a tour of Unreal Engine 5 technologies and customizations used to ensure performance and quality in action role-playing game \u2018Avowed\u2019.\n\nThis session, focused on GPU, performance, and notable customizations, discusses the successes, failures and pain points encountered during production of \u2018Avowed\u2019, along with where and how the use of these features affected performance on the Xbox Series S/X and PC. \n\nUnder the hood, \u2018Avowed\u2019 incorporates several UE5 core render technologies including Lumen, Nanite, Virtual Shadow Maps, and ray tracing to achieve its performance and quality goals. This session explores the implementation of these technologies in the game.\n\nLearn more about using Unreal Engine for video games here: www.unrealengine.com/uses/games\n\n#Obsidian, #Avowed, #Lumen, #Nanite, #VirtualShadowMaps, #RayTracing, #GameDevelopment, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestOrlando",

        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, CORYS gives an overview of their project to completely redevelop their production pipeline under Unreal Engine 5, with the aim of bringing a new level of realism to rail simulation, and to increase production efficiency with tools for editing and procedural/parametric asset generation.\n\nUnreal Engine features implemented as part of the CORYS project include Nanite and Lumen, alongside a CORYS-developed module called World Manager that defines the cells, loads GIS data, gets the terrain, and distributes the work. The team also integrated with an existing C++ simulator and implemented a non-destructive pre-cooking pass.\n\nCORYS has been meeting the simulation needs of freight, passenger rail and urban transportation operators worldwide for three decades. The company pioneered the use of CGI for transportation simulation decades ago, and remains a leader today with high-fidelity imagery driven by advanced data processing and AI.\n\nFind ",
