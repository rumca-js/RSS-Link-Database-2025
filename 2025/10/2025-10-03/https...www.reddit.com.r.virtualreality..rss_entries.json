That being said, it doesn\u2019t work on standalone as the program REWASD (used to map mouse movement to up on the analog stick) isn\u2019t available on the quest.

Only my PC is connected to the GE800 via ethernet and the Quest 3 is the only device on the wireless bands. The GE800 has some game specific features and is overall a much better router, so I&#39;m thinking about making the GE800 the primary router and having the AX56U as the access point. So, the GE800 will directly manage my PC traffic without having to go through the AX56U, and the ASUS router will still handle all other wireless devices and wired smarthome hubs to put minimal strain on the TP Link. Is that advisable, or should I just keep my config as it is now?</p> <p>I do have an nvidia shield an",
