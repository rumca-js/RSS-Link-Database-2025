Next, to snatch the three points, the Ghanaian sent Justin Kluivert away to score a gorgeous winner. Just when it seemed Fulham were set for fourth time lucky, Bournemouth instead climbed to second. Semenyo\u2019s second, from a trademark warp-speed counter, completed a sweet home win. A soaked Silva, whipped by autumnal gusts, could only suffer on the sidelines as a chance to prove he too is one of the Premier League\u2019s progressive forces slipped from his grasp.</p><p>Despite an elite asset-stripping of his team, Iraola\u2019s squad looks far more robust than last season.

        "description": "<p><strong>Sadler\u2019s Wells, London<br></strong>In a stunning evening, fearless and faultless dancers deliver a trio of classics, ending with a gorgeous yet more subdued piece by David Dawson</p><p>English National Ballet\u2019s new season launches with a quadruple bill that follows a loose thread through ballet\u2019s evolution over the best part of a century. You can see the inheritance, morphing across the decades, as well as one work of rebellion.</p><p>We start in 1947, but looking back to the late 19th century, with George Balanchine\u2019s Theme and Variations, a neoclassical piece aping the Russian imperial ballet. It gently sparkles (that\u2019s not just the diamant\u00e9 necklaces) and proudly lays out its patterns and steps, academic in presentation but infused with deep love of the form, as if saying: \u201cHere is ballet, isn\u2019t it beautiful?!\u201d Yet within that formality there is hidden swagger, in certain angles for example, that plants it firmly in the 20th century.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.",

The $14bn deal, if finalised, would see the transfer of TikTok\u2019s US operation from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to a consortium which includes the American billionaires Larry Ellison, Oracle\u2019s co-founder, and Rupert Murdoch, as well as two investment firms with known ties to the Trump administration.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s owned by Americans, and very sophisticated Americans,\u201d Trump said while signing the order. \u201cThis is going to be American-operated all the way.\u201d His administration claimed the deal would meet the requirements of a security law that required ByteDance to sell its American operation or face a ban in the US, after years of concern about data security and the risks of Chinese influence.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/oct/03",
