So far, I have a self-coded identity provider which provides a email+password based login and returns a JWT token. I use this for most of my projects running in my home server, but I am scared that this will become a liability once it goes public.

You can highlight and add notes as well as bookmark for future reading or print them off as PDFs.</p> <p>I am also trying to make reading fun by adding challenges and gamifying the reading process so that you can get points for actions like finishing a summary.</p> <p>The goal for summaries isn&#39;t to completely replace reading books, but a tool to explore what books you may want to fully read as well as get the most important information from books that are overly verbose.</p> <p>I hope some of you find it useful and would love to hear feedback and ideas from you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",
