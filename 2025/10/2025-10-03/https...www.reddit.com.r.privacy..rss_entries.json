From my understanding, these work by a person using a popular sites api to then host a custom frontend stripped of many invasive features. However this seems to entirely depend on the hosting server and gives them access to all data sent back and forth.</p> <p>Well as a solution to this problem I had a thought, which I don\u2019t know if it exists anywhere so please direct me there if so. But instead of relying on a hosting server to use the popular sites api why not use it directly but have code on your machine to filter specific calls and fill in a custom frontend. So for instance, the code would make limited calls to reddits servers only requesting necessary data, and not sending anything else. You could apply this principle to all sites like instagram or youtube",
