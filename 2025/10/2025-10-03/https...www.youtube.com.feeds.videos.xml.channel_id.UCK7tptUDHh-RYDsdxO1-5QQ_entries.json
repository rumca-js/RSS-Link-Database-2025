        "description": "Greenland is a self-governing territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, a NATO member that controls the island\u2019s security policy. Its position as a natural barrier between Russia and North America makes it important for the U.S. and President Trump, which has only one active base on the island.\n\nThe Danish Armed Forces take WSJ inside its operation as it sets out to prove to the U.S. and Russia that it is capable of defending Greenland. We gained rare access to Denmark\u2019s operations in the vast Arctic landscape: in the air, on land and at sea. \n\nChapters:\n0:00 Inside a military helicopter in Greenland\n0:48 NATO\u2019s frontline in the sea\n2:24 Land forces \n4:55 Trump\u2019s pledge to take Greenland\n6:03 Remote logistics hub\n\n#Greenland #Denmark #WSJ",
