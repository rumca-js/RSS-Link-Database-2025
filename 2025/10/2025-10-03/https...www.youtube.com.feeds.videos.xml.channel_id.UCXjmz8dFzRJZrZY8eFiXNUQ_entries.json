        "description": "By all accounts, Zack Snyder\u2019s DCEU should have been a cultural juggernaut to rival the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With iconic heroes like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and The Flash, Warner Bros. had all the tools to build a shared universe that could stand toe-to-toe with Marvel.\n\nBut after 15 movies, the DC Extended Universe never quite found its footing. From messy pseudo-origin stories to a disastrous attempt at Justice League, the DCEU struggled with inconsistent tone, rushed storytelling, and poor studio decisions.\n\nDo YOU think the DCEU could have been saved with better choices, or was it doomed from the start? Let us know in the comments!\n\n#dceu #justiceleague #zacksnyder #dccomics",
