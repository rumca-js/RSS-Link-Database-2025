The only thing between me and the game&#39;s good ending is the final dungeon and the final boss. I might get stuck here though, because my character levels aren&#39;t high enough for me to equip the Ultimate Personas. Thankfully, the last dungeon has a save point, a healing area, and the place where you can combine cards to summon Personas so I won&#39;t have to go back and forth between places. I was looking to play a short JRPG and my current playtime is only between 30-40 hours so I definite chose the right title to play.</p> <p>What about you guys? What vintage video games are you planning to play this weekend and why?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LabRat2329\"> /u/LabRat2329 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1nwz4o4/what_retro_games_are_you_playing_this_weekend_oct/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span>",

I recently played it in the Cowabunga Collection only to learn just how much is in there!! 8 Chapters or Stages, some with multiple parts. A great collection of memorable boss characters. New mechanics like the overhead throw. An absolutely mind-numbing number of enemy types and variants. Great variations in levels and unique environmental hazards.</p> <p>I&#39;m genuinely impressed with how much content there is in this game. Thankful for save states that let me play it over the course of two days, that&#39;s for sure. But WOW what a value this game would&#39;ve been back in the day.
