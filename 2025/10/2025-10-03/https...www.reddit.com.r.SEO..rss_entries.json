I&#39;m just a react dev dealing with a technical SEO question that I&#39;d love your input on. </p> <p>I&#39;m working on a Next.js SSG (Static Site Generation) website with multiple client components. I have a complex responsive navigation that has completely different structures for mobile vs desktop:</p> <ul> <li><p>Desktop: Horizontal menu with dropdowns, different buttons, language dropdown</p></li> <li><p>Mobile: Hamburger menu with accordion-style menus, different button layout and different language dropdown</p></li> </ul> <p>Currently using JavaScript hook to detect breakpoints. It causes hydration mismatch errors because the server renders version for mobile but the client on desktop shows another based on screen size. </p> <p>So I am thinking about solution: Rendering BOTH navigation structures in the HTML and use CSS media queries to hide the inappropriate one:</p> <pre><code>&lt;nav&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;nav-desktop&quot;&gt;&lt;!",
