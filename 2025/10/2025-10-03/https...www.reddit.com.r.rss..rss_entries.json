Feed Control cheaper plan does not offer any feed manipulation and paying $20 a month just for the filetring feature is just too steep.</p> <p>I know that some RSS readers can do that but I wish to use the generated feeds inside the app I already use for all my text/reading/highlighting needs and this app does not have any kind of feed configuration at all (I am using Readwise Reader for that).</p> <p>Basically the flow would be like this: [extract full text from rss feed] -&gt; [apply XPath/CSS filtering] -&gt; [output filtered RSS feed] -&gt; [import the newly generated feed into the app I use].</p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestion? </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lprell\"> /u/lpr",
