Unlike the NFL, which broadcasts most of its games on channels available over the air in every major U.S. city, the NHL\u2019s TV schedule still leans heavily on cable and subscription platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the 2025-26 season, ABC, ESPN, ESPN+, Hulu, and TNT will air a combined 172 nationally televised games during the regular season, with only ABC\u2019s games available over the air. ESPN will stream its games via its direct-to-consumer app, while TNT\u2019s coverage will stream on HBO Max. For the Stanley Cup Final, ABC holds exclusive broadcast rights in even-numbered years such as 2026, so the full Final series will be on over-the-air television (and simulcast via ESPN).

Today, if you mosey on over to eBay, you can find a refurbished Acer Nitro display <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/277237933212\">going for just $103.55</a>. This is a 27-inch 1440p display with 180Hz of refresh\u2026 and it has an IPS panel! That\u2019s an absolute banger of a deal. Normally, even for a refurb, you\u2019re looking at about $200-ish for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the color-accurate IPS panel (much better than the VA panels found on most new gaming monitors), this is a pretty basic design. The Acer Nitro KGB271U doesn\u2019t feature any other inputs aside from HDMI and DisplayPort, and it isn\u2019t even rated for AMD FreeSync.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you don\u2019t need any bells and whistles, you\u2019ll be absolutely gobsmacked by the value here.

It\u2019s polite to know at least some basic words and phrases when visiting a foreign country, right? Enough to get by, anyway. With about three months to learn, I landed on Duolingo\u2014and instantly fell in love with the way it teaches a language through implicit learning and gamification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who\u2019s never been particularly academic, I still remember those days with a special fondness because I\u2019d never had so much fun while learning something new. A lot of that had to do with the fact I could see (and feel) how much progress I was making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duolingo has been part of my life for a decade now, but I\u2019m falling out of love with it. What was once my favorite app has turned into something I dread, and the fun I once had is no longer there. What happened?</p>\n\n\n\n<div cl",
