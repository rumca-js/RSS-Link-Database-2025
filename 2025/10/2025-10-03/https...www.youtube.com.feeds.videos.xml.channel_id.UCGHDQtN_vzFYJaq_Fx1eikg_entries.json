        "description": "The pooper looks pretty funny, but is this figurine comedy or tragedy?\n\n\n\"A Caganer (Catalan pronunciation: [k\u0259\u0263\u0259\u02c8ne]) is a figurine depicted in the act of defecation appearing in nativity scenes in Catalonia and neighbouring areas such as Andorra, Valencia, Balearic Islands, and Northern Catalonia (in southern France). It is most popular and widespread in these areas, but can also be found in other areas of Spain (Murcia), Portugal, and Southern Italy (Naples).\nThe name \"El Caganer\" literally means \"the pooper\". Traditionally, the figurine is depicted as a peasant, wearing the traditional Catalan red cap (the barretina) and with his trousers down, showing a bare backside, and defecating.\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caganer\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA\nMerch: https://qxir.creator-spring.com/\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/qxir\nTwitter: h",
