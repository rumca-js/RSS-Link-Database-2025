Then, I&#39;ve got a Proxmox host running Adguard, which I&#39;m using for DNS and DHCP. All of my devices use DHCP, which gives them my Adguard host as the primary DNS, as well as another Adguard instance as a secondary DNS. As I said, everything has been working happily for a number of months without fail. And last night, all internet traffic was blocked suddenly.</p> <p",

I tried setting up Immich (I managed to do it once, but lost container) again and again with different methods, none of them which worked. I tried using proxmox VE helper script for Immich LXC - unprivileged. Although discouraged by some users, I got it working on my previous install. Then I tried with Docker. Then with Dockge which had Immich template set up.</p> <p>Everything installs just about fine, until I decide to point uploads to my external library. So my Proxmox host has SMB share mounted, and I usually pass it to LXC container. In .env file, I corrected the path (I made sure the container can see the share, has permissions to read/write). As soon as I do that, webUI is either not reachabe, or says server offline. Then, at times, logs say redis and database not found...</p> <p>Can someone help me here, because I think I&#39;m running in circles.",
