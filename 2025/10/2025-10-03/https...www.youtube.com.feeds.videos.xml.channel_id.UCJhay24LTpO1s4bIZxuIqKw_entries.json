Did you design it or did it just... happen?\n\nIn this talk we will look at examples of good and bad API design from the embedded world. What are some guidelines for creating awesome API:s? The examples will be C and C++ but the principles are all generally applicable.\n\nWe will look at some new API design patterns like \"The Mullet\", and the \"Domain Burger\". We will look at fundamental principles like symmetry, predictability and consistency and of course we will look at naming.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJoin think-cell as a C++ Developer and work on cutting-edge challenges with a focus on code excellence, innovation, and working alongside an international team of experts \u2014 apply now to be part of a team shaping the future of business presentations. https://www.think-cell.com/en/career\n---\n\nAnders Sundman\n\nAnders is the Principal Architect",
