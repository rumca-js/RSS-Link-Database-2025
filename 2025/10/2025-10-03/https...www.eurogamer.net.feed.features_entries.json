That's <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/shin-megami-tensei-nocturne-21-years-old\">very much</a> my <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/shin-megami-tensei-5-vengeance-review\">taste in RPGs</a>. Given this is sort-of a kid's game (OK, it's got a PEGI 12 rating because of 'bad language', 'in-game purchases', and - bafflingly - 'sex'), that is a pretty big surprise. I've come to this conclusion after sinking a good 50 hours into the game, and being taken on a surprisingly volatile journey as a result. The story is pretty guff, with a lot of sh&omacr;nen-style anime filler injected into the meat to make it appear more succulent, but most of my emotive response has been to its design philosophy, its approach to dungeons, and some unbelievable pacing choices.

To play Clover Pit is to collide with gambling head-on. There, in front of you, is a slot machine, perhaps the purest expression of casino gambling there is. And there's the handle on the side of the machine for you to spin the drum within. Go ahead and rotate the columns of symbols in the hope they'll slow and stop into a scoring pattern on the screen. Did they? It doesn't matter - you can always spin again.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/clover-pit-does-for-slot-machines-what-balatro-did-for-poker-and-i-cant-stop-spinning\">Read more</a></p>",

So consider it fortuitous timing, then, that <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4\">The Sims 4</a>'s latest expansion, Adventure Awaits, provides exactly that. Unfortunately, like holidays often do, it also comes with a bunch of screaming children.
