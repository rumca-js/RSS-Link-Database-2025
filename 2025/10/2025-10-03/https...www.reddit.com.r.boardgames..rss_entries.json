The feedback was very mixed - some found them very useful, while others absolutely refused to use a timer.</p> <p>Since many of you also suggested new features, I\u2019ve continued developing the app to make it more flexible. The goal is to adapt it so it can be useful for everyone, especially for games where a timer is already part of the rules (for example, Rummikub). I hope the latest update will be especially welcomed by Rummy players!</p> <p>At the end of the day, this is just a tool. You can choose to use it or not - nothing is mandatory. In chess, timers have become the norm, but for other games it\u2019s really up to the players.</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts: \u2022 What additional features would make a Game Timer more appealing to you? \u2022 Are there ways it could be adapted so players who dislike timers might still find it acceptable?</p> <p>Thanks for ",
