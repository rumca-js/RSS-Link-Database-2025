        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nPeacemaker Season 2 is now firmly in their own \"multiverse of madness\" as the characters may have found themselves in the DCU version of Earth-X, the alternate universe where the Nazis won World War 2. But we may have found a clue that suggests this isn't Earth-X, and could be another universe where the Allies lose the last world war. That clue lies in a throwaway Pok\u00e9mon reference, but it could be something more. What do you think? Have Peacemaker and the gang travelled to Earth-X? Do you think they'll meet Uncle Sam and the Freedom Fighters? Let us know in the comments",
