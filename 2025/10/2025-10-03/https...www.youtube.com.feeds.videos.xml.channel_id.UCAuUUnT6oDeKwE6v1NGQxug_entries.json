        "description": "What if ending food insecurity meant ditching charity models that haven\u2019t been updated since the 1960s? Dion Dawson, TED Fellow and founder of Dion\u2019s Chicago Dream, shares how he turned a spontaneous idea for giving back to his community into a thriving social enterprise, delivering top-quality produce to thousands of Chicago households every week and reaching a million dollars in revenue in just 18 months. He\u2019s proving that it\u2019s possible to replace the outdated food pantry model with a data-driven system that delivers high-quality food \u2014 so your zip code doesn\u2019t decide how long you live.
