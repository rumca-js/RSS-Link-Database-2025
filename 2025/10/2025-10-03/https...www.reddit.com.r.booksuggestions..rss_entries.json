I already knew my emotional intelligence was very high, as I&#39;ve been told that since I was very young, but tbh, I always thought I was kind of stupid in other areas, but I&#39;m really not. But there is just so much about the world, it&#39;s history, and it&#39;s philosophies that I don&#39;t know or understand enough about to speak on. So I want to change that. Are there any books (or documentaries if you feel so inclined) you&#39;d recommend?

I love every aspect of it, and have read it several times (unique to this book, in the past I&#39;ve only read books once) because it just has such a unique feeling. I love the depth of the characters, they feel so real and alive... taking apart their psychologies is half the fun for me.

Naturally not all books hit the same, but that is my overall feeling towards them. I didn&#39;t read the last two installments, simply because I&#39;m not interested protagonist&#39;s son. I re-read them recently. </p> <p><em>Junior Bender</em>: I loved the whole &quot;private eye for crooks&quot; theme, the characters were great, the pacing was a bit slower than <em>Fletch</em> but I still found it overall pretty decent, same goes for the dialogue, first person narration. There hasn&#39;t been a new book in the series for a bit which is a shame. I just finished the series yesterday. </p> <p>For both: ",

The robot ends up making an endoskeleton and covering it in the guys skin to make him look alive. This was a kids movie btw, like what. Anyways, I think that concept is really cool and I was wondering if anyone knew any books that delve into that sort of thing. I guess like skin stealing and body horror stuff.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone!</p> <p>I\u2019m on the hunt for a horror book recommendation, preferably an audiobook since I\u2019ve got a toddler at home and barely any time to sit down and read. I\u2019m looking for something really scary, but not in a gory or gross way. I want that creeping dread, the kind that makes you check the corners of your room and question every creak in the floorboards.</p> <p>Stuff I love: - Atmospheric horror - Folk horror - Ghosts, hauntings, mysteries</p> <p>Stuff I\u2019m avoiding: - Gore, torture, body horror \u2014 just not my thing</p> <p>I\u2019ve already read a bunch of Stephen King and Lovecraft, so I\u2019m hoping for something different and hopefully more chilling. Any hidden gems or underrated picks you swear by? I\u2019m ready to be spooked.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Erothes\"> /u/Erothes </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1nwsbd2/atmospheric_horrors/\">[link]</a>",

I want a book in which the lead man is gay, but his sexuality is not the driving force of the story. so I don\u2019t want any books about finding yourself or gays suffering for being gay. like, imagine if James Bond is gay. he\u2019s still out there with a mission but him making out with bond guys is not what it\u2019s all about. it doesn\u2019t have to be necessarily a spy book.
