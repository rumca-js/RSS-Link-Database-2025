It is one of several fantasy books I&#39;ve read that feature Islam, and obviously there is a wealth of western fantasy that either includes or is heavily based on Christianity as well.</p> <p>But as a Jew myself, it got me wondering if there are any fantasy books where Judaism, or an in-world analogue, is the primary focus? The only thing I&#39;m aware of is The Lions of Al-Rassan, which is on my TBR for this year, but my understanding is that it splits its time with Christianity and Islam. Is there anything out there where Judaism or something based on it takes center stage?</p> <p>ETA: adding that I&#39;m less interested in Jewish mythology (like golems) and more interested in the actual history/religion.

It&#39;s just a fun, easy, and enjoyable read. Spend so much time reading books with heavy themes and prose when what I really need are books with just swords and magic. No need for complex magic, no need for complicated romance. Just fight and power, and occasionally poke fun at the characters.</p> <p>If there&#39;s more of a &#39;Zero to Hero&#39; protagonist like Lindon, I would appreciate the recommendation. One thing I really like about the series is how different interactions between MC and the other characters depend on how much they see MC&#39;s progression. Those who saw his hard work up close will see him positively, while those who saw his drastic change tend to view him negatively or with fear.</p> <p>In the end, there&#39;s always that small part of him from his time as nobody to keep him modest, no matter how powerful he became in the end.<",

Now, I&#39;m a big fan of a few of these series, Joe Abercrombie in particular is one of my favorites, but there was something that never really sat right with me about how this movement was marketed and often perceived by certain fans of the genre - Specifically the idea that these works were a wholly unprecedented reversal of the traditions of the fantasy genre. That fantasy up until this point was all Tolkien and black and white morality and just general kids&#39; stuff and that this movement represented a sort of new anti-fantasy.</p> <p>A good example of this is the way the Game of Thrones tv ser",
