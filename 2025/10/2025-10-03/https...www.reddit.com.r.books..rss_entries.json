My very first copy of this gem was acquired over 40 years ago when I was browsing the shelves of the local bookstore and browsed past &quot;S. Morgenstern&quot;, did a double-take, and came back.</p> <p>Sure enough, it was a newly released story by the great Florinese master. I was ecstatic! I immediately purchased it and scurried home where I devoured it in a single session. Sadly, my first edition was misplaced during a move and when I went to purchase a copy of the then-current paperback edition, the author had, through some gross negligence, been listed as a certain &quot;William Goldman&quot;. The confusion appears to have stemmed from this &quot;Goldman&quot; having once published an abridgement of the master&#39;s best known work, _The Princess Bride_. (I won&#39;t address the travesty of attempting to abridge a seminal Florinese work of literature.) I was devastated, but I needed to repla",

It illustrates, too, the difficulty of reaching out and making those connections, especially in the aftermath of deep and abiding trauma.</p> <p>The novel follows the unhappy life of a young woman, Fuyuko, who works as a proofreader. This woman is the \u201cdictionary definition of a miserable person\u201d. Fuyuko calls herself so on the occasion of seeing her own reflection during a blood drive; it is an apt if unfortunate description, and it is impossible to examine this novel without at least touching upon Kawakami\u2019s words here.</p> <p>Fuyuko\u2019s portrayal is a frank examination of a woman stuck in place. She is good at her job, detail-oriented and conscientious, but there is at first a curious vacancy of any emotional dimension to her accomplishments as a proofreader. This vacancy gives way to the realisation that there really is nothing Fuyuko ga",

I actually savored the words, the story, the images. </p> <p>- I liked the setting, the train itself is a character. I liked the story. It&#39;s not the most original story, but it&#39;s well told. I liked the characters, even though they weren&#39;t the most fleshed out, they had enough backstory for me to understand them. </p> <p>- It seemed to genre jump, if that&#39;s even a thing.

I felt like I was unable to follow along.</p> <p>It made me feel so sad and confused. Is reading comprehension really this bad now? I just can&#39;t understand how one POV is more confusing than the other. I can understand preferring one over the other, but not being able to read one just blows my mind. </p> <p>The book this review was about was not a difficult read (to me).

It wasn&#39;t a long (under 200 pages). </p> <p>I know that first person seems to be the preferred POV these days so I can understand this person not reading many third POV books, but I just don&#39;t see how it could be difficult to follow a book ",
