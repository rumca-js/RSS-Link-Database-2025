The decline over the last 20 years is clearly measurable, as current NASA data shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A research team led by Dr. Norman G. Loeb from NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center investigated <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2511595122\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how much radiant energy the Earth reflects back into space</a>. To do this, they analyzed satellite data from the last 24 years, including values for solar radiation, albedo, and radiation balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result? Since 2001, both Northern and Southern Hemispheres have become darker and now reflect less sunlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Radiation absorption has increased by a total of 0.83 watts per square meter per decade. The Northern Hemisphere is particularly affected, absorbin",
