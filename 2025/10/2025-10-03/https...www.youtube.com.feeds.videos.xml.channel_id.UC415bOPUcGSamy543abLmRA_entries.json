        "description": "Notice anything weird about this tiger? Its stripes are way darker than a typical tiger!\n\nThat\u2019s because of a mutation that we\u2019re seeing a LOT of now because of what scientists call the \u201cbottleneck effect\u201d...\n\nWhile this mutation doesn\u2019t seem to hurt the tigers, it could have been a harmful genetic disease\u2026 \n\nFor the tigers, scientists moved in healthy tigers from other areas\u2026 but for other animals, they\u2019re trying gene editing\u2026 \n\nIf you wanna know how that works, subscribe!\n\n#shorts #science #geneediting #tigers #tech",
