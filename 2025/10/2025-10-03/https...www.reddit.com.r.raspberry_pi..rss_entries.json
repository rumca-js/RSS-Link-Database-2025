While it does work, at some point while I was away from home I tried logging in to the server. The usual: user is pi and password is raspberry.</p> <p>The result? It didn&#39;t work this time. My guess was that something in SSH screwed up and when I came back home I plugged an HDMI cable on my Raspberry and a wireless keyboard, and tried logging in directly. Same result: login incorrect. What the heck?</p> <p>I did set this user/password combination on the Imager, and it&#39;s the third time this is happening to me now. Most forum posts at the official Raspberry Pi forums tell me to set a user/password combination on the Imager, which I already did. Multiple times.</p> <p>Any help in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Ive just got my first raspi and im learning still and articles and videos arent really explaining my issue.</p> <p>So like my raspberry pi is too cool i guess. I really like to overclock computers and I started stress testing the pi to make sure it was stable by running S-TUI, geekbench5/6, stressng, and a few others i cant remember (cant do stress-ng -all 0 since it doesnt crash but makes the computer too unresponsive to monitor). It only reached 35c (stock) under max load which i thought was too low even for a low power arm chip but said it was using 100% so idk. </p> <p>I went to watch videos about stress tests and overclocking to learn more and there getting to 3.2ghz at 70-80c, but im at 3.2 at 46-50.8c? Ive let it go overnight twice running stress-ng and s-tui (i think it was this one) and the highest temps i could see was 50.8 which is about when my cooler turns on and bri",

I bought the Pi 5 active cooler, took everything apart including removing the fan off the hat. When I started reassembling, I found out it doesn&#39;t really fit....

It is on an official Pi power supply as I haven&#39;t upgraded to a POE switch yet. </p> <p>WTF is going on? Did I brick my pi? </p> <p>Note, I am running HAOS on this SSD.
