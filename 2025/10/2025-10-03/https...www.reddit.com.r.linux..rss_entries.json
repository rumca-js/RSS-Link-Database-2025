I have a Synology NAS that I use as photo storage, and it contains a lot of photos. I tried Winapps and successfully installed Lightroom, Photoshop, and Adobe Bridge to edit and sort my photos (I tested them with locally stored photos). During my search for a Linux-native replacement for IrfanView (which I use to quickly view photos on the NAS), I came across Nomacs, which seems to be a nice alternative. So, I thought I had everything I needed to replace all the important native Windows apps. So far, so good.</p> <p><strong>The problem</strong>: With local folders, Nomacs and all other image viewers I tried are pretty fast. However, when I try to open photos from the NAS, every image viewer either crashes or becomes incredibly slow. It takes about five minutes just to open a single photo.</p> <p>The NAS folders are mounted ov",
