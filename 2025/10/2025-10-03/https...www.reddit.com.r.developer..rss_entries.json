I started learning coding so that i could make my own SaaS or some cool projects myself but still struggling a lot even after investing time. This is my <a href=\"http://zohair.vercel.app\">portfolio</a>.</p> <p>The projects i made took me a lot of time to make. What should i do next? Start freelancing to get some experience? Continue my progress towards SaaS?
