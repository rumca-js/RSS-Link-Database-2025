I was testing two different AI models by asking them to generate a simple Java function. The task was trivial, but the results were... bad. The generated code was convoluted, low quality, and not the simplest way to implement the logic. My clean, hand-written Java function was significantly shorter and easier to read. If the AI struggles this much on a simple function, imagine the mess it makes in a complex codebase. The core problem? We shift from writing clean code to debugging and wrestling with low-quality AI code. For a developer, it&#39;s often faster to write a clean version from scratch than to refactor an unreadable AI suggestion. This makes me believe that, for now, blindly accepting AI suggestions actually slows down the development process.</p> <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong though I think AI an invaluable tool and it has really increased my productivity and it can even teach new technologies",

That\u2019s why a lot of times when people google something they add \u201cReddit\u201d at the end because it will give them a real answer. Not an answer thats pulled from some manufactured sponsored content someone or some bot made. You may get honest reviews on something for example. </p> <p>So the question is do you think Reddit should ban AI in order to protect actually original content?

We introduce Future-Guided Learning, an approach that enhances time-series event forecasting through a dynamic feedback mechanism inspired by predictive coding. Our method involves two models: a detection model that analyzes future data to identify critical events and a forecasting model that predicts these events based on current data. When discrepancies occur between the forecasting and detection models, a more significant update is applied to the forecasting model, effectively minimizing surprise, allowing the forecasting model to dynamically adjust its parameters. We validate our approach on a variety of tasks,",
