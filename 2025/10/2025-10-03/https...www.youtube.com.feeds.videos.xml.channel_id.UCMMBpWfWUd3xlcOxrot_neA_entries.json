        "description": "Thanks Xsolla for sponsoring the video! Check out the Xsolla Cash\nMastercard \u00ae here: https://bit.ly/3JiHEd4\n\nToday I\u2019m exploring why 80% of people experience cybersickness in VR. I go over what motion sickness really is, how to prepare for it, what contributes to it, and the scientific data on building VR endurance! Including theories and solutions on how VR can eventually break through this barrier and one day become mainstream. Hope this helps some people learn how to solve their cybersickness for good. :) Comment your thoughts below!\n\nDaily TVRS VRChat Group Hangouts:\nhttps://vrc.group/TVRS.0429\nJoin my Discord!:\nhttps://discord.gg/phia\n\nPHIA's Socials\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/phia \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PHIA_bunny \nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/phiabunny \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/phiabunny/ \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@phiabunny?\n\n5% off Voicemod Pro with code: PHIABUNNY\nhttps://x.la/l/Nos4XLvM\n\n=TIMESTAMPS=\n00:00 - Overview\n01:08 - Sponsor Segment\n0",
