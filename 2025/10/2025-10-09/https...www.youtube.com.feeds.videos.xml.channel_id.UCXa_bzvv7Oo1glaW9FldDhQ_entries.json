        "description": "Battlefield 6 feels like one of the most complete entries the series has seen in years. Its campaign, warts and all, feels substantial. The class system is smartly balanced, bringing something new to the table while sticking to everything fans love. The progression feels mostly rewarding without being exploitative. The maps are a visual and tactical showcase, even if some modes and vehicle handling quirks reveal rough edges.\n\nThere's still work to be done, as is always the case with a multiplayer shooter, and the jury is still out on Portal and battle royale. However, I can easily see myself coming back, if only for the immersive atmosphere and sheer chaos on a grand scale that only Battlefield can provide.",

        "description": "It isn't a good Ninja Gaiden game if the combat mechanics aren't on point. Thankfully, Ninja Gaiden 4 seems to have no such problems, with its combat even extending the franchise's signature formula by implementing a few excellent additions from modern action games. \n\nIt's a system that could have the momentum of a fight constantly shifting between the player and their foes, with either side being able to turn the tides in their favor at even the hint of an error from their opponents.\n\nFrom new moves, new mechanics, and enemies that constantly test your prowess, Team Ninja and Platinum Games seem to be on to something in the run up to the release of a long-awaited new addition to the beloved franchise.",

        "description": "Jurassic World Evolution 3 is shaping up to be an accomplished threequel; the most immersive, detailed, and strategic yet of the series. Its headline features - dramatic terraforming ability and deep enclosure customisation - are the result of Planet Zoo developer Frontier Developments listening and responding to community feedback. \n\nEvo 3\u2019s creation and management tools are striking, but greater still is the game\u2019s ability to weave its suite of new mechanics meaningfully into gameplay. Frontier\u2019s development team have poured a lot of care into this threequel, and if the promise of its gameplay previews and deep dives are realised, we could finally have the dino-park management sim fans have been craving - and, potentially, one of the biggest games of 2025.",
