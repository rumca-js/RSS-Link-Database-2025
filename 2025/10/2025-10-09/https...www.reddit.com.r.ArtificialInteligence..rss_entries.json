This is a AWS Step Function. Last year AWS had a major change in how SFs are defined. (JSONPath is being replaced by JSONata)The sr engineer had used JSONata in the Step Function already. The jr engineer was failing because Co-Pilot in the IDE prompt window insisted on giving answers in the old JSONPath and insisting JSONata was wrong. And then file window code suggestions were being offered in both formats. This was happening despite the file being flagged as JSONata. The engineer didn\u2019t understand he needed to tell Co-Pilot to give answers in JDONata. The sr engineer and I believe Co-Pilot was doing this because there is more material on the Internet in JSONPath vs JSONata. It\u2019s having trouble adjusting. JSONata doesn\u2019t even have a Wikipedia page yet. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/simplifying-developer-experience",

I tried to make my post as okay as possible to not have it taken down, but i am someone concerned, looking for answers and most of the members of this space seem very well-informed on that topic. i am currently a college student. anytime i turn my head somewhere, i see another student using an ai, wheter it&#39;s studley, chatgpt, gemini, claude, turbo... i&#39;m not ai-free either, i use it too. but these past few weeks, i&#39;ve been really questionning myself on what&#39;s next for our intellectual, our creativity, also our environnment and our jobs. As a student, it seems like no task is doable without ai anymore. that&#39;s what the instagram and tiktok ads try to make us think, at least. &quot;how i got a 4.0 gpa and barely studied&quot; and it&#39;s turbo ai. how people need it to write emails, or use grammarly for their thesis or just any text n",

Well I just went down a rabbit hole on what this is actually costing and holy shit we need to talk about this.</p> <p>Microsoft just casually dropped that they spent $14 billion in ONE QUARTER on AI infrastructure. That&#39;s a 79% jump from last year. Google? $12 billion same quarter, up 91%. Meta straight up told investors &quot;yeah we&#39;re gonna spend up to $40 billion this year&quot; and their stock tanked because even Wall Street was like wait what.</p> <p>But here&#39;s the actually insane part. The CEO of Anthropic (they make Claude) said current AI models cost around $100 million to train. The ones coming out later this year? $1 billion. By 2026 he&#39;s estimating $5 to $10 billion PER MODEL.</p> <p>Let me put that in perspective. A single Nvidia H100 chip that you need to train these models costs $30,000. Some resellers are charging way more. Meta said they&#39;re buying",
