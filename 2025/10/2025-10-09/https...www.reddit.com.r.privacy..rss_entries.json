We all love the power of AI, but every single conversation you have is logged, classified, dissected, stored indefinitely, used to train their models, and subject to human review. Deleting a chat is often a false sense of security because the data is permanent on some form. And why wouldn&#39;t it be? It is the prime directive of LLM&#39;s to gobble up and retain as much data as possible.</p> <p>The biggest liability you create is dropping your <strong>Personal Identifiable Information (PII)</strong> or highly sensitive data (like proprietary code, financial records, or medical notes) into the prompt box or uploading the as we often do with PDFs.

An experience from a friend of mine shows why this is so problematic:</p> <p>She often uses ChatGPT. One day she wrote a short, factual sentence about <em>what had been done to her in her childhood</em>. No details, just that. The text was instantly deleted with a notice saying it violated the rules. To her, as a victim, this suggested she had done something wrong.</p> <p>Now imagine such a system applied to all private chats: Millions of people who have experienced abuse or violence could no longer talk openly with their friends. Algorithms would flag the text, humans would \u201creview\u201d it, and depending on interpretation, accounts could be suspended or even trigger a police visit.</p> <p>This would silence exactly those who need to be heard: the victims.<br/> Meanwhile, offenders would likely find ways to circumvent the system.</p",

I\u2019m talking more so about individual donations rather than nonprofit orgs and the like. I know it seems like a silly question. Is it just me being delusional and hopeful and that I\u2019ll just have to do it with my real identity? Or is there some other platform anyone uses to donate? The platforms I listed above are the most common though. I know the most honest and best way is cash of course but that\u2019s not really possible. And I don\u2019t want to make someone that\u2019s in dire need of help have to go through hoops and download another app because id like our relationship to stay anonymous.
