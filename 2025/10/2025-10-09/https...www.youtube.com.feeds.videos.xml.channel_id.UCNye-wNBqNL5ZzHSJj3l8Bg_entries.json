In the past two years, we have fought to achieve our war objectives, and one of the central goals is the return of the hostages \u2013 all of them, the living and the dead. And we are going to do it,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\n\u201cWe know that this is for the good of Israel and the United States, for the good of decent people everywhere, and for the sake of these families who will finally be able to reunite with their loved ones,\u201d he said.\n\nAl Jazeera's Hamdah Salhut joins live from Amman. She's there because the Israeli government has banned Al Jazeera from reporting inside Israel and the occupied West Bank.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook:",

Armed groups now control large parts of the country, leaving public services in ruins and forcing families into overcrowded camps. Many children face violence, food insecurity, and a lack of basic necessities. The killing of President Jovenel Moise in 2021 triggered a power vacuum, worsening the instability.\nThe United Nations has deployed a Kenyan-led multinational security mission, but it is severely underfunded. UNICEF estimates $250 million is urgently needed to provide aid to Haiti\u2019s 3.3 million children in desperate need, including one million facing critical food shortages. As efforts to curb the violence falter, families continue to suffer.\n\nAl Jazeera's Teresa Bo reports.\n\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our",

        "description": "Al Jazeera\u2019s Hani Mahmoud, reporting live from al-Zawaida, says that while optimism grows after two years of relentless bombardment, the destruction left behind is overwhelming. Entire neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble, hospitals and schools destroyed, and families displaced. As captives are expected to be released and Israeli forces withdraw, many Palestinians now face the monumental challenge of rebuilding their lives amid devastation and loss.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\n Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n#GazaCeasefire #GazaWar #KhanYunis #GazaCelebrations #CeasefireAgreement #GazaStrip #Palestine #IsraelGazaWar #GazaPeace #GazaNews #AlJazeeraEnglish",

        "description": "Al Jazeera\u2019s senior political analyst Marwan Bishara says President Trump\u2019s optimism over the peace plan is more of a strategy than a prediction, aimed at pressuring others to deliver results. He notes that Trump\u2019s push for the deal also serves as a distraction from domestic troubles.\nBishara adds that Trump seeks a \u2018hegemonic peace\u2019 favoring Israel and the US, rather than a balanced resolution. He warns that the plan remains vague and unenforceable, making lasting peace unlikely beyond a temporary ceasefire.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDownload AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n#aljazeeraenglish #BreakingNews #aljazeeralivenews #palestine #latestnews #gaza #israel #news #trump #hamas #qatar #egypt",
