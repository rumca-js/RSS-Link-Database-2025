The automated browser is just used to authenticate, afterwards I use the cookies and session to access the API directly.</p> <p>Problem: Meanwhile moving it to the server made it fail bypassing authentication captcha, which is being triggered consistently</p> <p>What I&#39;ve tried: I tried it with xvfb, no luck but I don&#39;t know why exactly. Maybe I&#39;ve done something wrong. In bot detection tests I am getting 65/100 bot score, and 0.3 recaptcha score. I am using residential proxies, so no problems with IP should occur. The server I am trying to deploy to is a digital ocean droplet.</p> <p>Questions: Don&#39;t know specifically what questions to ask, because it is very uncertain to me at this point exactly why it fails.
