A spirited fantasy that dons the<em> bande dessin&eacute;e</em> mantle, it's a fantastic case study in how to make combo-centric fist fights feel good and look grand all at once. It's a beautiful brawler &ndash; and one that'll need to make good use of its mitts, given the number of killer releases fighting over every crumb of attention this month.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/absolum-from-the-publisher-of-eurogamer-essential-streets-of-rage-4-is-a-brawler-that-lets-you-cash-out-a-combo-and-its-brilliant\">Read more</a></p>",
