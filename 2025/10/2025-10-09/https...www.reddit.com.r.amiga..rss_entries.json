Whenever I fit the clip on Sordan RAM module I get crashes during heavy hard disk (CF Card) access. I first noticed it when TinyLaucher was scanning my WHDLoad drive. It also happens when running disk check tools. Any sustained disk activity can trigger it.</p> <p>It rarely happens from a cold start. The longer I run the Amiga the higher the chance of a crash.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tested the RAM for hours with no errors. Reseated several times and cleaned the CPU (and RAM) pins with Deoxit.</p> <p>Sordan say if the RAM tests fine it has to be the Amiga or PSU. Apparently even one pin not making proper contact would stop the Amiga from booting, so it&#39;s not a contact issue.</p> <p>Currently I&#39;m testing without the module and waiting for a crash. So far it&#39;s stable.</p> <p>Has anyone got any ideas where I should look next?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; ",
