I also just have too damn many to make that viable. I&#39;m going to just put the pages down on the bed and scan whole pages at a time. Also I already have a Plustek feeder style scanner. </p> <p>I don&#39;t need extreme high resolution - most things will probably be scanned at 600dpi. I just want something that will produce good enough results for archiving and scan relatively quickly and survive the number of scans I need to do. Hoping to spend around $300 or less. </p> <p>At first glance the Epson V600 looks like a popular choice for this kind of thing but I&#39;ve read some people are dissatisfied, although seems like mostly at higher res, and also that scan times can be slow. Any other good options? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",
