As part of this mission, the CDSA\u2019s Virtual Reality (VR) team has developed a high-fidelity VR simulation of the Gateway Space Station, utilizing Nanite technology to integrate large polygon-count meshes of spaceflight hardware and equipment. \n\nThis cutting-edge VR platform allows for detailed exploration and evaluation of the station\u2019s interior design. Through Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) testing, astronauts simulate daily tasks\u2014such as conducting scientific experiments, retrieving supplies, and preparing meals\u2014replicating real-world scenarios that will occur during the Artemis missions. \n\nThese immersive simulations combine virtual models with astronaut input, providing invaluable insights t",
