Bruce Cameron- I absolutely LOVED the exploration of varying cultures within the different fictional hunter gatherer tribes as well as the very real human emotions displayed for the people. Another great media I love is the Full Metal Alchemist manga by Hiromu Arakawa- I loved the exploration of scientific ethics and especially the issues of racism tackled among the varying cultures represented in the main cast. Most recently I read and tore through Blood Over Brighthaven by M.L. Wang. I adored the dark fantasy plot and tackling difficult subjects such as racism and sexism.

Before that I completed the Stormlight Archive and tbh while I enjoyed reading these, they left me exhausted. So on a whim I decided to read A Good Girl&#39;s Guide To Murder and it was surprisingly fun, but then I found out that it has 2 more books in the series...ugh. </p> <p>I really love reading sci-fi, fantasy, murder mystery (I love Agatha Christie&#39;s stuff), mystery in general. Tbh I like the escapism of fiction books. I have two books in my &quot;to-read&quot; list : Everyone In My Family Has Killed Someone and Blindsight. Not sure which one I should pick, I read the former up until chapter 2 but I am not engrossed yet.</p> <p>Is there any book that has the same vibe as the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel? Just watched that, and I had so much fun. If not, then recommend something?</p> <p>I am sorry if my post was difficult to read, my thoughts all over the place.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; ",

I just finished a short story collection called Kids Are Sad by Tom Spencer which is a collection of short stories all set in the same school with the stories all interlinking.

I don&#39;t think the authors written anything else so I wondered if there&#39;s any other things like this?</p> <p>Basically, what I&#39;m looking for is a collection of contemporary YA short stories?

There&#39;s things about folklore and their literary evolution, but I&#39;d really just like something with a ton of facts about them, plain and simple. Things like what kills them, where they live, how they dress, their anatomy, powers, where they live, etc. Something that goes into detail on vampire facts. (Yes, im aware that vampires arent real, therefore none of this would actually be factual. I hope that clarifies my thought process. &quot;Facts&quot; is just the best word I could think of, other than &quot;trivia.&quot;) Does anybody know anything like that?

I am aromantic, but somehow not asexual (not sure how that works) so I love smutty books. The problem is that I hate typical romance and love, it makes me close a book even if it has a great story beside that. I wish I could move past it but romance genuinely disgusts me and there\u2019s nothing I can really do about it.</p> <p>Im looking for a book that hopefully has smut, at least sexual tension, with nothing overly romantic. I don\u2019t like super fucked up books, which is what I usually find when looking for smutty but not romantic books, or anything like rape or assault. I\u2019m okay with minimal amounts of romance, but I can\u2019t stand when the characters \u2018feel warm and fuzzy just by looking at their partners face\u2019. Other then that I don\u2019t mind what kind of book it is, as long it has plot beside just smut. Thank you SO M",

I&#39;m a HUGE EPIC: The Musical fan so I want to make this about Odysseus and Penelope.</p> <p>So, like Odysseus&#39; kingdom had been taken over by the higher kingdom of Mycenae. Odysseus and his sister Ctimene are now forced to live and scavenge for themselves. Meanwhile, Penelope is this rich Spartan princess who spends her days, designing clothes and partying. One day she falls in love with Odysseus and decides to help him find his father, Laertes so they could find a way to take back, Ithaca and help the other kingdoms that have fallen.</p> <p>I feel like the problem is that it doesn&#39;t really feel like the Odyssey. If you take out the Greek-Myth pats of it, nothing will really change similar to Lore Olympus. I DESPISE Lore Olympus, so what should I ",
