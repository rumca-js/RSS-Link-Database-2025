        "description": "I hadn't planned to make another episode on this, but I keep being asked about Yungblud - his single with Aerosmith and this week, his interview with Jack Osbourne. I admit it, I hold some unpopular opinions. My motivation has been called into question because of them. But if we're only allowed to have one, acceptable opinion, doesn't that put a chokehold on reactors? And if having an opposing view is met with playground-style accusations of jealousy, can I come up with something equally as ridiculous? Why, yes! Yes, I can! \n\nFor a brilliant analysis on the use of auto-tune live, visit Wings of Pegasus: https://youtu.be/AQ1w1B_xXBA?si=WjH6ScfZGI4n05BD\nFor the full Yungblud interview with Jack Osbourne: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-u5QRt21Gw\nMy Only Angel by Aerosmith and YUNGBLUD: https://youtu.be/74mV9qwlCgg?si=kWIyUUo6GlH1u9EO\n Justin Hawkins Rides Again will be LIVE in theatres across the UK in January, you can find out more here: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-ha",
