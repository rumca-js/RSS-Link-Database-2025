        "description": "Sponsor: Hyte Y70 and Touch Infinite on their site https://geni.us/Ir9vKEK\nIntel today announced its Panther Lake mobile solution with Xe3 GPU architecture updates, building upon Xe2 and moving toward an eventual Celestial launch in the desktop GPU space. Xe3 is distinct from Celestial; however, Intel announced its intent to work toward an \"Xe3P\" (Plus) GPU architecture following this. We suspect that Xe3 sets the foundation for some of what Celestial will eventually get. Intel's Panther Lake updates also include claimed power management and balancing improvements for CPU vs GPU power budget allocation in gaming scenarios. We hope to benchmark more handheld gaming devices soon and as these (and AMD's Z2 and Z2 Extreme chips) roll out. Check back soon for our animation error video!\n\nWatch our previous engineering discussion with Tom Petersen about Arc driver optimization: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qp3BGu3vixk\nAnd our deep-dive video showing inside a frame: https://www.youtube.com",
