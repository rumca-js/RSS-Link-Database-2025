One of the reasons is the numerous flavors of BASIC and other languages with the Commodore OS, the numerous OS simulators, and so on. But I&#39;m concerned that there are several utilities -- control of flashy lights, updating the firmware -- that wouldn&#39;t be included in the switchover. So it comes down to trying to import some PiOS things into the MX respin, or trying to import a lot of MX respin things into PiOS. PiOS being Debian-based, I assume it carries the Debian &quot;depart from approved packages and your&#39;re doomed, doomed I say&quot; policy.</p> <p>So, my first question is what packages are strictly Pi 500+ hardware related, and are these readily imported into another .deb system.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently bought a pi zero 2 w and used it to run Klipper for a while. Eventually, it stopped working after a couple of days and didn&#39;t show any activity when plugged into 5v through the usb power in. I since got a replacement from the seller and now it&#39;s laying around. Is there a chance the problem is limited to the usb power? Could it be worth to figure out a way to power it through the Io pins or would that be a waste of time? If it&#39;s worth it, what would be a good way to go about that without spending any money on a power supply or sth like that?
