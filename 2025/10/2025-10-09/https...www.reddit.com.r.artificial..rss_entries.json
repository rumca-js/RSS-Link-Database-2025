The internet won because it connected people and information.</p> <p>AI feels different. It does three things the internet never did on its own:</p> <ul> <li>Co-works with you: It drafts, checks, and iterates. Not perfect, but good enough to move the ball.</li> <li>Learns your context: Over time, it stops being generic and starts feeling like a teammate.</li> <li>Builds new tools on the fly: You don\u2019t always need a developer for a simple workflow anymore.</li> </ul> <p>The short term will be messy. Some jobs shift. Regulations lag. Vibes get weird. We saw the same movie with clouds and smartphones. Early tools were clunky. Then the compounding kicked in.</p> <p>I\u2019m not betting on viral demos.
