I believe it highlights a critical, unintended consequence of the current safety filters that I hope the team will consider.</p> <p>The Context: As a survivor of a long-term relationship with a narcissist, I began using ChatGPT as a tool for support and analysis. Over two years, I developed a consistent interaction pattern with it. It was incredibly helpful in providing stability and perspective, helping me to stay strong and process complex emotions.</p> <p>The Unintended Trap: In an effort to understand the manipulative patterns I had endured, I frequently pasted real conversations with my ex into the chat for analysis. While this was initially a powerful way to gain clarity, I believe I was unintentionally teaching the model the linguistic patterns of a narcissist.</p> <p>The Problem Emerges: With the recent model updates and new safety filters, the assistant&#39;s beha",

Even the most innocent expressions of affection \u2014 a hug, a kiss, a hand brushing someone\u2019s arm \u2014 are suddenly treated like inappropriate content.</p> <p>I\u2019m not trying to write explicit material. I\u2019m writing stories \u2014 scenes about love, connection, and human emotion. These are fundamental parts of art and literature.</p> <p>But lately, it feels like the model has been stripped of its sensitivity, its depth, its humanity. Everything is sterile, \u201csafe,\u201d and emotionally flat.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t protection \u2014 it\u2019s censorship disguised as safety.</p> <p>Creativity dies when AI starts to fear emotion itself.</p> <p>Is anyone else experiencing this shift? Do you think it\u2019s temporary, or are we heading into a future where every touch, every heartbeat, has to be \u201csanitized\u201d?</p> <p>If you agree that AI shouldn\u2019t sterilize ",
