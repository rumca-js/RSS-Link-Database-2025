It\u2019s still very beta, but it works enough to test. I\u2019d love to know if people feel this solves a real problem! Also, just general feedback. If anyone would like to check it out, let me know, and I&#39;m happy to share the beta link! It&#39;s only for Android devices right now.</p> <p><a href",
