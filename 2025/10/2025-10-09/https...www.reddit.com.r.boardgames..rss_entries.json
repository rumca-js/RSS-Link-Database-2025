BUT the main issue is finding a supplier, do you guys have any recommendation on where do I start buying in bulk, but not very large quantities because still new to this and need to walk in baby steps. </p> <p>I have contacted Asmodee but it&#39;s not convenient for us. We haven&#39;t heard from BNW &amp; Blackfire :( </p> <p>So, whatever lead you have is very helpful. Never imagined that it&#39;s this difficult to find the supplier... </p> <p>Thank you!!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fine_Ad1996\"> /u/Fine_Ad1996 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1o249ai/buy_board_games_in_bul",

What makes this seem odd to me is that a Special-type booster is available after mission 1, but the only special weapon you could even have at that point is a single option from the rewards pool.
