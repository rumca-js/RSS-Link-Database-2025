        "description": "Using a tunnel is fundamental to modern software development. This video shows you exactly how to set up the following free tunneling services:\n\n- ngrok (00:01:36)\n- Cloudflare Tunnels (00:09:20)\n- Tailscale Funnels (00:19:16)\n\nThe tunnel forwards a public domain name (such as https:// mydomain.com) to a local and private development server (such https:// localhost:8000). This process is a must so that you can:\n\n- Enable HTTPs on your project\n- Setup and test live webhooks\n- Create ChatGPT Apps with Apps SDK\n- Test your MCP Servers outside of your local environment\n- Configure OAuth flows (Google Login, GitHub Login, Facebook Login, etc)\n- Share your project with anyone in the world\n- Run live tests\n- In some cases, you can even use to to go into Production (not covered in this video).\n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 Welcome\n00:01:36 Install and Use Ngrok Tunnels\n00:09:20 Setup a Cloudflare Tunnel with a Custom Domain\n00:19:16 Use Tailscale Funnels for Tunneling\n00:25:39 Thank you",
