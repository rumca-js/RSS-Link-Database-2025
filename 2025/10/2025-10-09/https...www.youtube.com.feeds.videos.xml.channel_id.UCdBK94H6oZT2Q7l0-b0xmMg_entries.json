Check out their AeroMag power banks below:\nSHARGE website: https://bit.ly/4pbg2a2\nAmazon link: https://amzn.to/4mA8sTN\n\nPlouffe tests one of the strangest keyboards ever made \u2014 the DS Pixel Key Pro, a fully screen-based keyboard that can also act as a display. Between missing screws, bad battery life, and surprisingly fun animations, this thing is as confusing as it is impressive. And just when you think it can\u2019t get weirder, there\u2019s an even more expensive \u201cErgo\u201d version on Kickstarter.\n\nCheck out the DS Pixel Keyboard: https://lmg.gg/2qLKz\n\nWant us to unbox something?
