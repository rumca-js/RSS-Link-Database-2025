        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">At its best, Battlefield 6 is everything you could ask for from a Battlefield game. Intense, close-quarters firefights transition into long-range skirmishes as control points change hands and the action moves from the tight confines of half-destroyed buildings to open stretches of land. As fighter jets and helicopters swoop overhead, a medic pulls out a defibrillator and rushes into a hail of bullets to revive a squadmate who was just blown up trying to destroy a tank with a handful of C4.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Elsewhere, a sniper taking residence in a high-rise building is snuffed out by a well-placed RPG, blowing a hole in their nest until the entire building eventually collapses in on itself, while just a few yards away, the burnt husk of a helicopter drops out of the sky as its previous occupants parachute to the ground amidst a salvo of gunfire. Battlefield 6 is a return to form for a multiplayer shooter that thrives on emergent chaos.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-s",

Instead, we've got a couple generic and rather unremarkable Fortnite skins, pictured above--the one on the left, Sedona, unlocks immediately when you purchase the music pass, and the one on the left, Jana Pastel, unlocks at the end of the pass.</p><p>Fortunately, there's a tradeoff involved in that. Since the pass doesn't include a new Icon skin, it instead comes with six licensed jam tracks, up from the usual four. There aren't any extra Epic-original tracks, though. There are still only four of those this time, though they're still free, as usual--you can unlock them without buying the pass. Here's the list of licensed tracks in the Season 11 music pass:</p><ul><li>Gorgeo",
