There had been problems in the relationship for a long time. I\u2019ve been in therapy for years, and a lot of my best growth happened when I\u2019d be away from home for work or trips.</p> <p>While away I\u2019d reflect on why the relationship wasn\u2019t working.<br/> Why didn\u2019t I want to initiate sex anymore? I blamed low self-esteem.<br/> Why didn\u2019t I want to do things with her? I told myself I was lazy or too wrapped up in my own obsessions.<br/> Why was there no intimacy? I said \u201cthat\u2019s just not our style.\u201d</p> <p>We laughed a lot and were great friends, but it felt more like roommates. She had control issues and I had my own blind spots, but we both wanted to fix it. In couples therapy the word codependency started appearing everywhere. Our counselor encouraged us to be \u201cselfish\u201d for a while, a word that triggered deep shame from childhood but that I tried to explore.",

This tweet misrepresents what is going on. The Supreme Court is hearing oral arguments about if a law barring certain talk therapy practices which try to convert someone\u2019s gender or sexuality. This is still very bad, and the court does seem in favor of the Christian therapist who says the law violates her right to free speech, but importantly, this will not legalize practices like electroshock therapy. To imply that it does only serves to make people uncomfortable and worried unnecessarily. We need to organize, we need to be brave and fight back and survive, and to do so we need accurate, nuanced information, not misinformation that can cause panic.
