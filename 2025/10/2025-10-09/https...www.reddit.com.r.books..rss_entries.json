It had so many twists and turns that it was definitely fun to read, but when it comes to the actual resolution of the story, it felt like\u2026 a whole lot of nothing.</p> <p>I still think Millie isn\u2019t telling the whole truth. She keeps lying, or at least hiding things, and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s something we\u2019ll continue to explore later in book 2... but I\u2019m not sure if I want to explore it. The mystery around Officer Connors\u2019 daughter also had me guessing for a while. I even thought maybe Millie was his daughter who changed her name after doing something terrible, but then\u2026 who is she really? Probably something else we\u2019ll find out as the story goes on, and again, I don\u2019t think I want to know.</p> <p>As for the ending, didn\u2019t hate that she turned in some sort of \u201chitwoman\u201d. In fact, I was actually fine with that part as that\u2019s what she\u2019s meant to do. What bothered me was how neat",
