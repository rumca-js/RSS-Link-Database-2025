For cord-cutters who get free local channels with an antenna, this was a genuinely exciting technology when it began rolling out way back in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six years later, that excitement has evaporated thanks to restrictive digital rights management (DRM) and high adoption costs. While the broadcast TV industry has failed to make ATSC 3.0 stick, they\u2019ve succeeded in getting tech enthusiasts, consumer advocates, and even some individual broadcasters to fear and despise it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, broadcasters are hoping for a bailout from the Federal Communications C",

In many cases, smart locks dispense with physical keys altogether in favor of PINs, fingerprints, NFC tags, smartphone apps\u2013even your smartphone or smart watch. And with some of the latest models, you can even unlock your door with just your face! Smart locks deliver lots of other benefits, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They invariably have logging systems, so you can keep track of who\u2019s coming and going\u2013and when. That\u2019s incredibly useful whether you have a teenager who tends to break curfew or merely want to give temporary access to houseguests, service providers, or Airbnb guests.
