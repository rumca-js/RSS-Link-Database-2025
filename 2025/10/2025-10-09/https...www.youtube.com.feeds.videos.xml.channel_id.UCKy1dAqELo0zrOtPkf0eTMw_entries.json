I hate being limited by numbers instead of skill in action games, and in the early hours here, it feels like you\u2019re a slave to them. Once you get to the point where each run has you making substantial progress and the story picks up, Absolum is very compelling. But it took me a long time to get there. Gorgeous artwork, an excellent soundtrack, and smart combat spread out among several distinct characters do a lot to carry it, but they can\u2019t fix the feeling of dread when I died, again, and realized that I would have to do some variation of the same exact thing once more. I\u2019m not against failure; I just wish there was more variety to it, and Absolum doesn\u2019t find that until a good way into its runtime. That it manages to emerge as a compelling beat \u2018em up in spite of that is a testament to the skill and work",

Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch/Switch 2.\n\nDespite a pair of new protagonists and the inclusion of two-player support for the first time in the series, Little Nightmares 3 doesn\u2019t do enough to distinguish itself from the previous two adventures, making each step through its shadowy structures less full of dread and more like a retread. There are some memorably morbid moments here and there, and the Carnavale chapter is a standout, but the constant crate-pushing and instant-fail chase sequences feel all too familiar at this point. Little Nightmares 3 features little innovation, few scares, and limited appeal if you\u2019ve already played the previous two games, unless you\u2019re dead keen to experience the series\u2019 signature brand of stop-start stealth with a friend in tow.",
