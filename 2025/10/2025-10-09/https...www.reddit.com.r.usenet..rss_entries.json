Decades ago I spent some time on usenet but never really found it to be my thing. I&#39;ve recently retired and am trying to keep my brain active by learning new stuff. I&#39;ve done a lot of reading here have what I think is a decent grasp of how backbones, providers, resellers and companies work, but I have some simple questions about file transfers. I hope you&#39;ll indulge an old man who&#39;s trying to get caught up.</p> <ol> <li>I understand that file transfer involves converting binaries to text and then reassembling them into binaries after download. Is this accurate?</li> <li>Various usenet resellers set different price structures for downloading. Say I have an account that has a 40gb monthly download limit and I wish to download a large binary file, say an ISO of a custom Linux distro that is 100GB. How does the conversion/reassembly work? Will I end up downloading",
