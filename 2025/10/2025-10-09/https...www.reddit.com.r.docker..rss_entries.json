I&#39;m trying to transition from kaniko to buildkit for low permission image builds in my CI/CD and it&#39;s just blowing up resource consumption, especially ephemeral storage. Its madness that a dockerfile that works fine with kaniko now won&#39;t work with buildkit. Yes I know I can optimize the dockerfile, I&#39;m working on that. I&#39;m also wondering what buildkit level options there are to minimize the amount of storage and memory it uses.</p> <p>Thanks so much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lambda_lord_legacy\"> /u/lambda_lord_legacy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1o2jggt/going_insane_with_buildkit/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1o2jggt/going_insane_with_buildkit/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I have therefore swapped everything to rootful docker. I have managed to re-create my site, load my containers etc, but I now have massive problems with SFTP. It surely isn\u2019t difficult to setup a SFTP connection to my website folders? But every time I create the container, I cannot connect to the SFTP container. I was initially trying to do so with SSH keys, but this was not working, so I tried with ssh passwords. I was getting exactly the same thing, when using an SFTP client it would stop of \u2018starting session\u2019, or when trying to to connect from my terminal it would hang and after about 15 minutes would give me the sftp&gt; prompt. </p> <p>I have physical folders on my host I am mounting,",
