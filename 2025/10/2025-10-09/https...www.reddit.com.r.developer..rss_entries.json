It would be like steam, but the point of it would be to allow people to use their Xbox version of a game on PlayStation if supported. The download could happen as an extension pack, and we could offer them huge discounts on re-purchasing games. Maybe we would have to make a deal with the console companies. I\u2018m not completely sure. I would just like to hear people\u2018s opinions and if anyone would like to make this.

He takes multiple payments a day and spends too much time chatting with customers, taking their orders, providing payment instructions, verifying payments, sending orders to the shipper and tracking numbers back to customers. He wanted to automate this process. I agreed to build him a solution for 1% of his monthly volume (this would be $1600-$2400/month), no deposit or fee up front. </p> <p>My preferred approach was a small web app or custom Telegram bot for order submission and either a payment processor like Cryptomus / Nowpayments or a centralized exchange to receive payments, since both allow price protection by immediately converting deposits to stablecoins. The downside of this option is privacy, you need to complete KYC and the processor or exchange will probably report your income to the tax man. </p> <p>After explaining the pros and cons to the client ",
