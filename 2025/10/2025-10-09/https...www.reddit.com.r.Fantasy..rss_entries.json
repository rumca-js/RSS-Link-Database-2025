Rather, I want to read something that has a story that stands on its own perfectly well without understanding it on a thematic level, but where as you think on it more or reread it, you begin to notice a bunch of clever parallels and uses of symbolism and repeated themes throughout the story (bonus points if the structuring of the story is also really clever!). I&#39;ve seen this done here and there outside of fantasy, with writers like Jun Maeda (albeit not a NOVEL writer). </p> <p>Within fantasy, I would think of something like Earthsea or the Chronicles of Narnia.
