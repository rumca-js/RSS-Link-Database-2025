Back home, mushrooms simply didn\u2019t sprout much. This episode took me from June all the way to September to film... By the time the rainy season in Yunnan had passed, the mushrooms were already preparing to emerge again next year\u2014only then did I finally get to taste them!\nBut beautiful things are worth the wait, no matter when they arrive. The delicious wild mushrooms are a once-a-year feast for the taste buds of us Yunnan people...\n\nHello, everyone! I am Dianxi Xiaoge, a Yunnan native. If you enjoy my videos, please keep subscribing to my channel. I'll continue to share my life and Yunnan-styled food in my uploads. Wish you have a happy life and enjoy tasty food every day\n\nYouTube\u3010\u6ec7\u897f\u5c0f\u54e5 Dianxi Xiaoge\u3011\u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2MH1T5N\nFacebook\u3010\u6ec7\u897f\u5c0f\u54e5 Dianxi Xiaoge\u3011 \u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2TsGflr\nInstagram\u3010dianxixiaoge_apenjie\u3011\u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2Wagkz",
