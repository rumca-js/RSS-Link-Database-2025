In the past, I borrowed my friend\u2019s a couple of years ago and completed the game Arizona Sunshine, which I really liked, and Beat Saber! Other games I have liked in the past are Telltale\u2019s TWD, Until Dawn, As Dusk Falls, etc. Usualky like story based interactive games, but open to other fun games as well.
