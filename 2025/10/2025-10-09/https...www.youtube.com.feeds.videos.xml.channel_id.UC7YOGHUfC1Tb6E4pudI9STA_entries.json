Services like email and Kakao Talk have been restored, but there was no backup for the governments cloud storage and up to 858 TB of data may be permanently lost.\n\nMy merch is available at\nhttps://based.win/\n\nSubscribe to me on Odysee.com\nhttps://odysee.com/@AlphaNerd:8\n\n\u20bf\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb2Help Support the Channel by Donating Crypto\ud83d\udcb2\ud83d\udcb5\ud83d\udcb0\u20bf\n\nMonero\n45F2bNHVcRzXVBsvZ5giyvKGAgm6LFhMsjUUVPTEtdgJJ5SNyxzSNUmFSBR5qCCWLpjiUjYMkmZoX9b3cChNjvxR7kvh436\n\nBitcoin\nbc1qdc32p8035ztyvtm8t97gdcyhc26jg6cte9qc8n\n\nEthereum\n0xeA4DA3F9BAb091Eb86921CA6E41712438f4E5079\n\nLitecoin\nMBfrxLJMuw26hbVi2MjCVDFkkExz8rYvUF",
