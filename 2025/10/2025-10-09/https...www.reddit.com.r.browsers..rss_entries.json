Chrome will go bankrupt, FF will be number one.&quot;</strong></p> <p>This was the last bit of remaining hope for FF to increase its market share. During this period, Chrome kept increasing market share, and FF kept losing market share. Now it&#39;s for sure, nothing will stop FF&#39;s ever decreasing market share. If it goes like this, one day FF will end up with 100 users. lol</p> <p>Another one which sees a non stop market share increase is Brave. Users who seek ad blocking and privacy switch to Brave. Even FF users switch to Brave. Where do you think privacy oriented FF users who quit FF, go?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2929311/brave-brow",
