Once locally extinct due to habitat loss, bay scallops are now multiplying exponentially in the restored eelgrass meadows of the Eastern Shore's southern coastal bays, possibly setting the stage for a future recreational fishery.",

Since dark matter cannot be observed directly, its properties can only be determined by observing the gravitational lensing effect, whereby the light from a more distant object is distorted and deflected by the gravity of the dark object.",

        "description": "A heretofore unknown molecular mechanism helps plants save water in extreme drought and intense sunlight. A research team at Heidelberg University's Center for Organismal Studies (COS), in cooperation with partners at Nanjing Agricultural University (China), has discovered that a protein complex\u2014the cysteine synthase complex\u2014serves as a sensor in the chloroplasts. It receives and forwards stress signals and ensures that the hormone abscisic acid is formed via biosynthesis. This hormone triggers the closure of tiny pores on the leaves, thus preventing water loss.",

Although the forecasting accuracy of TC tracks has improved substantially in recent decades, progress in the forecasting of TC intensity remains limited. In recent years, deep learning methods have shown great potential in TC intensity prediction; however, they still face challenges, including limited interpretability, cumbersome feature engineering, and unreliable real-time operational forecasts.",

        "description": "It is widely recognized that the Bank of Japan's Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) purchases had a substantial impact on stock prices. Market participants and media reports have often highlighted that the policy distorted market valuations. At the same time, they pointed out that ETF management appeared to accelerate stock lending activity as the number of ETFs held by the Bank of Japan increased over time. This pattern suggests that the stock market, particularly the lending market, has mechanisms that enhance market efficiency and counteract the effects of the Bank of Japan's policy.",

As a result, they detected a hot gaseous outflow in the galaxy. The new findings, presented Oct. 1 on the arXiv pre-print server, could shed more light on the nature of NGC 5746.",

These waves, which were first directly observed in 2015, are known to be produced during various cosmological phenomena, including mergers between two black holes that orbit each other (i.e., binary black holes).",

Therapies that pinpoint the exact areas of the body where they're needed\u2014and nowhere they're not\u2014can reduce the medicine dosage and avoid potentially harmful off-target effects elsewhere in the body. A targeted immunotherapy, for example, might seek out cancerous tissues and activate immune cells to fight the disease only in those tissues.",
