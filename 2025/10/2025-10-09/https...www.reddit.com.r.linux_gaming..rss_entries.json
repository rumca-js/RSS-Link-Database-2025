When enabled, the executable will launch within a Linux terminal.I use it specifically to run Escape From Tarkovs SPT mod &quot;server&quot; component, which doesn&#39;t work properly when simply run normally through Wine. </p> <p>However, in recent months I&#39;ve been trying to make a switch away from Lutris, and instead gather all my non-Steam games in Heroic (nothing against Lutris, I just use Heroic way more). Does anyone know a method of having Heroic emulate the &quot;CLI Mode&quot; that Lutris offers? Even if it&#39;s an external solution like a bash script that runs the .exe in my terminal, which I can set as the executable in Heroic.

It keeps crashing my Skyrim, either before the game even loads, or less than a minute after it loads (but before I can even start a game).</p> <p>I&#39;m testing with just ENB and nothing else, to eliminate other culprits. I downloaded it from the site and followed the instructions (copied the files into a clean Skyrim, changed the .ini to enable LinuxVersion). I can see ENB compiling shaders, and then soon afterwards the game closes. Nothing in the logs stands out to me. I have the full Skyrim SE+AE+CC combo. I read some guides that suggested adding a few extra d3d .dlls (d3dx11_43, d3dcompiler_43, d3dcompiler_47 etc.), but none of that seemed to help. I haven&#39;t experimented much with Steam command line args, because I couldn&#39;t find any guides or success reports.</p> <p>What gives? Has anybody gotten this to work recently and knows how to do it?</p> <p>All other modding works great. For example",

I&#39;ve mitigated this issue by using the repo steam. I prefer flatpak however. Also how do i run old games like project igi, the house of the dead 1/2/3, teknoparrot emulation of house of the dead 4/scarlet dawn etc? Lastly do i need lutris if steam can handle all my needs? Thanks and i use endavouros btw.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/starrynight90s\"> /u/starrynight90s </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1o1s7ql/help_me/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1o1s7ql/help_me/\">[comments]</a></span>",
