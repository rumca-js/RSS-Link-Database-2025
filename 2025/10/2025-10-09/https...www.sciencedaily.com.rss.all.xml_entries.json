Deep inside fat tissue, they found a hidden system that helps the body use up calories, even without exercise. By studying mice, researchers discovered that brown fat \u2014 the type that keeps us warm \u2014 has a backup \u201cheater\u201d that kicks in when needed.",

Using deep learning on thousands of satellite images from European orbiters, scientists have discovered that Martian winds can reach up to 160 km/h \u2014 much stronger than previously thought. These powerful gusts play a key role in shaping the planet\u2019s weather and climate by lifting vast amounts of dust into the atmosphere.",
