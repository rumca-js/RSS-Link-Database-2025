Everything in automation seemed stuck in browsers, but people actually live on their phones. Apps are walled gardens and nobody had cracked how to make agents work inside them. So we built something that could tap, scroll, and interact with real mobile apps like a human would.</p> <p>A few weeks back, we posted a short demo. No pitch deck, no fancy landing page, just an agent running through a real Android UI. What happened next caught us off guard. Within 48 hours we hit over 3000 stars on GitHub. Devs started flooding into our Discord asking questions and wanting to contribute. We got on the radar of investors we&#39;d been trying to reach for months. And we closed a $2M+ funding round shortly after.</p> <p>Looking back, a few things made the difference. ",
