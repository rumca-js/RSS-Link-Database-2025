        "description": "Apparently YouTube Critics have been lying to you! In this video I taka critical look at Anthony Gramuglia\u2019s video \u2018YouTube Critics Are Lying to You\u2019 and how he misses the point time and time again. If you care about honest writing, about an artist's work, or even just want to see a look below the shallow surface, join me along with particular journey. Together we can learn the meaningful difference between a critic and an Art Bro who tends to dismiss much of the Artist's work - i.e. the dedication to craft. Yes, theme and emotion matter, but only in the eyes of the privileged viewer does that craft become meaningless. And this is the Art Bro. One who believes himself on a similar level to the artist, but who chooses to dismiss the very idea of objectivity, the structure and formula lying beneath the art. In truth, famous writers and well educated professors believe fully in the craft and the plot - and like myself - see them in service to the theme.\n\nGet Lady Midnight: Devils Dwell i",
