The game was as fun as I remember. </p> <p>I recalled using a character during my first play not in the base game and found that there were expansions (which the character was from). I&#39;ve read around and found these expansions online for exorbitant prices on Ebay. I understand and recognize that the expansions have been out of print for quite awhile, but I am not so ready to be dropping that much money for them (at least $100 per expansion). </p> <p>I was wondering if anyone here would be able to point me towards any other websites to try and keep an eye out for these expansions (besides boardgamegeek) and if anyone could point me to any potential homebrew expansions or othe",

Recently my 8-and-a-half-year-old son was given some board games as gifts \u2014 including Monopoly, Hotel, and Labyrinth \u2014 and he really enjoyed them. So I thought it might be a good time to introduce him to some slightly more \u201cinteresting\u201d games.</p> <p>In the basement, I have a few games I haven\u2019t used in quite a while, such as Ticket to Ride: Europe and Forbidden Desert, and I was thinking of suggesting those to him. Do you think it\u2019s too early for that?</p> <p>Also, I\u2019d love some recommendations for games we can play as a family (there are four of us at home, and my 6-year-old daughter usually prefers to team up with an adult when the games are a bit more complex).</p> <p>Thanks everyone for your suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Key_Influence_3887\"> /u/Key_Influence_3887 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oi95vq/introducing_my_8yearold_",

Is 6 y/o old enough to play this? Are there any others that you would recommend to a beginner? Apologies again for the long post, thank you in advance for your help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

You start with a hand of 9 cards and you have to play double digit numbers. always increasing from your last pair. then cards are drawn for the following - highest number round table, playing a pair, playing a third consecutive colour on either digit. Simple, fast and brilliant. we all bought a copy.</p> <p><strong>Bid Coin</strong> - The best trick taker i&#39;ve played in a long while. normal TT rules apply except in this game your prediction is updating live. you start the game with the coin cards 1,2,3,5,7 in front of each player. If you win a trick then you slide one of those forward to update your bid. the rub here is that you can&#39;t ever slide them back down and EACH time you surpass your bid (ie if i bid 3 and win my 4th tric",
