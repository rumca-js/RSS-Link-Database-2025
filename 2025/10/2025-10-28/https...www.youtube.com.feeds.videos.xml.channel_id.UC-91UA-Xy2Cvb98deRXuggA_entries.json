        "description": "Recruiters on LinkedIn are absolutely losing it. One says you can\u2019t answer the phone with \u201chello.\u201d Another says your thank-you email is \u201ctoo generic.\u201d Then someone else says if you lean too close to the camera you\u2019re desperate. Apparently, the job market has become a minefield where breathing wrong disqualifies you from employment.\n\nIn this video, we explore the absurd contradictions of recruiter advice, where every \u201ctip\u201d sounds like satire and common sense has been outsourced to ChatGPT. From the recruiter who demands your \u201cinner fire\u201d for their startup to the founder who rejects anyone who asks about work-life balance, it\u2019s peak LinkedIn lunacy.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why getting a job feels like auditioning for a reality show you didn\u2019t sign up for, this one\u2019s for you.\n\nNeed a resume / cover letter? \u27a1\ufe0f https://joshuafluke.store\n\u2022 \ud83d\udd0d Resume Reviews\n\u2022 \u270d\ufe0f Custom Resumes\n\u2022 \ud83c\udf93 Courses: Hacking the Resume & Interview\n\u2022 \ud83d\udcde 1-on-1 Consults\n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/Joshuafluke",
