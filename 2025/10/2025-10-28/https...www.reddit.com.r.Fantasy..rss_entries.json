I&#39;m already wondering what the next and final book will reveal about what I just read. </p> <p>Because you WILL be lost reading these books. That&#39;s entirely on purpose.

They&#39;re very rich, complicated, and easy to care about. One of my favorite aspects of this series is how everyone has a valid reason for what they&#39;re trying to achieve.

I&#39;ve never seen anybody complain about elves having a posh English accent or Orcs being cockney. In fact, people seem to love cockney orcs. I actually like Scottish dwarves. Rarely do we get any representation in the media, even fantasy, and when we do, it&#39;s often just a random side character that happens to be Scottish because the actor is. But with Scottish dwarves, we have a whole race and culture representing it. Sure, it might be tropey, but I think it&#39;s cool, even if I have to put up with a bad Scottish impression every now and again. Now, if they wanted to remix it and make Orcs Scottish, and Dwarves Welsh, or I don&#39;t know, Himalayan? That would be cool as well.</p> <p>Are you a fan of Scottish dwarves?

I remember it had Game of Thrones, The First Law, Way of Kings, Lies of Locke Lamora, and Name of the Wind fairly highly ranked, but it wasn&#39;t just based on popularity/popular poll.

So for example, there&#39;s an Alyssium in the book &quot;The Spellshop&quot;, an Iliseeum in the book series &quot;From Blood &amp; Ash&quot; and an Elysium in the movie &quot;Gladiator&quot;. When I pronounce all 3 of these, they all sound the same to me.</p> <p>Now I know Elysium in the movie Gladiator is referring to Greek mythology.
