Since an enclosure can only support a limited amount of total storage, the comparison is between using two enclosures with smaller drives or one enclosure with larger drives to reach about 120 TB of usable space in an F6-424 configured in RAID5. It\u2019s also worth noting that the 16 TB drives are refurbished and currently the lowest cost per terabyte I could find.
