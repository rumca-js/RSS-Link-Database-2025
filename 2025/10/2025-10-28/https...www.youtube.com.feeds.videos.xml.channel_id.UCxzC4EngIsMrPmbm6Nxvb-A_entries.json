        "description": "It started with a scene in a Mission Impossible movie, and ended up with a bunch of custom neutron simulations. There are a lot of meme's about the demon core and it's criticality accidents, but I decided to actually simulate how dangerous it would be to play games with the pits as a ball.\n\nThe simulation work was performed using OpenMC, I'm a complete newbie to this, so don't trust your life with my results, please don't go bowling with nuclear pits unless you have a camera crew nearby, but not so nearby that they'd exceed safe radiation doses.\nhttps://openmc.org/\n\nGavin's code for the case simulation is here, it's useful for getting started:\nhttps://gist.github.com/gridley/bb8c0f358b84d0838926eefb568c515c\n\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scottmanley",
