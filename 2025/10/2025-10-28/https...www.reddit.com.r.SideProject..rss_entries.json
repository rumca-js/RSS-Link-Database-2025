I got sick of using a large number of apps for their basic tracking functionalities so I created a data tracker app that lets you customize what you track the way you want it. I use it for tracking my work hours, running, reading and similar. It&#39;s completely free (and will be as long as the vps can handle the usage). It has stuff like filtering, sorting, csv import/export and customizable analytics. It&#39;s not completely polished and might have some bugs but it&#39;s definitely been useful for me. I&#39;m posting since it&#39;s my first project and would love some feedback from others.
