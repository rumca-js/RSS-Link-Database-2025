Unfortunately, I have to inform you that the Milk-V Pioneer series has reached its EOL and will no longer be in production.</p> <p>However, I recommend checking out our upcoming product, the Milk-V Titan. It features strong single-core performance. Additionally, it is an 8-core Mini-ITX board that might suit your needs for building a high-performance server.</p> <p>You can find more details and specifications about the Milk-V Titan by visiting the following link: <a href=\"https://milkv.io/titan\">https://milkv.io/titan</a>.</p> <p>If you have any further questions or need additional information, please fe",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is a question kind of geared to one board, but might prove useful to other boards. Is there binaries distributed anywhere for later version of Chromium for this distribution? AFAIK Ubuntu keeps getting updates on this board and Ubuntu version but Chromium hasn&#39;t been updated in a while and running into browser checks as outdated. So far haven&#39;t had any luck turning the Chromium version from the Felix Arch LInux repository into a Deb and installing or running it with Box64. Chromium, at least the one that originally came with this distro, seems to have better video playback and is quicker than the up to date version of firefox.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PolkKnoxJames\"> /u/PolkKnoxJames </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1oigxsv/updated_chromium_for_ubuntu_2404_orangepi_rv2/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comme",
