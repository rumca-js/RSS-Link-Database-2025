Israel has intensified its attacks on Hezbollah targets across the country despite a ceasefire. The strikes, now more frequent and widespread, have killed more than a dozen fighters in recent days. Ortagus urged Lebanese leaders to accelerate Hezbollah\u2019s disarmament and consider direct talks with Israel \u2014 a divisive issue in Lebanon. Washington warned of renewed conflict if Beirut fails to act. The Israeli army also held its largest border drills since 2023. Foreign envoys, including Egypt\u2019s ambassador, have voiced alarm over the escalating violence.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Zeina Khodr reports from Beirut, Lebanon.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https:/",
