I&#39;m just looking for something that is easy to read, flows well and preferable has short chapters or is set out in a interesting way. I recently read The Killer Question by Janice Hallett and really enjoyed the format of the book. I don&#39;t mind the genre, but I do tend to read mostly Horror, Crime/Mystery and Fantasy. Really open to anything though. I&#39;ll list a few of my favourite books so that you have an idea of what I&#39;ve liked before, although they may not fit the criteria of what I&#39;m looking for now. 1. The Binding by Bridget Collins 2. The Hunger Games series 3. Looking for Alaska by John Green 4. The Throne of Glass series 5. Carrie by Stephen King 6. The Year of the Witching by Alexis Henderson 7. Hide by Kiersten White 8. The Invisible Life of Addie Larue 9. The Killing Eve series </p> <p>So what are your favourite books",

I have never listened to an audiobook nor did I have any interest to begin with, but I&#39;m working on a big knitting commision with a deadline so I have no time for reading. My favourite books are Pachinko, The traveling cat chronicles and Beasts of a Little Land, but I&#39;m looking for something more lighthearted and easy to follow along. I was thinking of picking up Jeannette McCurdy&#39;s memoir but I don&#39;t know if I would enjoy it.

It\u2019s such a simple story on the surface, but the way it moves from this light, airy beginning to that quiet, emotional ending really got to me. Mansfield writes in a way that feels so effortless, but somehow it makes you stop and think about everything life, class, death, empathy, growing up. Laura\u2019s confusion at the end really stayed with me. That moment when she sees something so raw and real for the first time\u2026 it\u2019s like her entire world shifts in silence. It\u2019s so subtle but incredibly powerful. Has anyone else read it recently? Did it leave you with that strange mix of sadness and peace too?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So, I&#39;ve decided to get back into reading because I&#39;ve noticed my creative writing skills have taken a sharp decline since high school (who would&#39;ve guessed \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude02). I used to love reading. In the past, I read books like The Maze Runner, Wonder, Scythe, and A Series of Unfortunate Events. I love romance, but I don&#39;t really care if it&#39;s the main focus as long as it&#39;s in there, haha. I&#39;m not interested in spice or horror. I get bored really easily, so I want a page-turner, a book that will leave me on edge. I want to have withdrawal symptoms if I have to put it down. </p> <p>I don&#39;t want something too dense since I haven&#39;t truly read through a book in ages. The last thing I read was Fight Club for a class two years ago, if that says anything about the difficulty level I can handle.</p> <p>If it helps, my favorite films are The Road to El Dorado, Grave of the Fireflies, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and Anne of Green Gables",
