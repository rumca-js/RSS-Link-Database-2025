The programming is and v simple and clean and customizing my Linux machine has been a blast (after hrs of documentation reading XD). However, while most of my non competitive games run well on my laptop I do occasionally need to boot into windows for multiplayer games with kernel level anti cheat. Could I theoretically use a VM in Linux running windows and play from there or are there better alternatives? I haven\u2019t looked much into it other than \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll post a Reddit thread here\u201d.

Both of these games I&#39;ve played for a good amount of time before I switched to Linux, about a year ago. Somehow The Forest got de-synced, since whenever I boot the game on windows, the save files are there but never carried over to Linux. My solution was just to manually transfer the save files to Linux. So not really a loss.</p> <p>For Dead Space however, everything got nuked. I reinstalled the game on W11 and the saves were gone there too. Local save files were not available since I switched from W10 to W11. </p> <p>Anybody having the same issue? </p> <p>I&#39;d like to know more as to why this happens and how were you guys able to handle it.

We are debating doing a native Linux version vs just doing a Windows build that people can run via Proton. For a non-graphically intensive game, that doesn&#39;t use anticheat, is there really a benefit to doing a Linux native version nowadays? </p> <p>For a tiny team with one programmer, the costs of doing an extra build (plus extra tech support) really does add up over the course of a project. However I&#39;m in the process of switching to Linux myself, and want to support open/free software where I can. But, for my test setup on Mint, I can&#39;t even tell the difference between Proton and native builds for comparable indie games.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rtza\"> /u/rtza </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1oi3ib7/linux_native_vs_proton/\">[link]</a></span> &#",
