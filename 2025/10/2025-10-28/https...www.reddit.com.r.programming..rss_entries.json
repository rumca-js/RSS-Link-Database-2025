In principle programmers like to work on a well-defined and well-planned project, which is what waterfall requires, however, in reality, clients always tend to change their requirements which makes the waterfall approach almost impossible to land. Therefore the software world no longer insists on rigidity of requirement change. This is where agile methodology comes in. it offers flexibility and adaptation to changes, which is basically a total surrender to the business word. however this ideal method is subject to a premise that clients or business team is also open to compromise their project scope, i.e, they are willing to sign off the project even some of their original needs are not delivered due to the changes of their requirements down the road. unfortunately in many cases clients hard press both changes and full scope delivery, which cause blames o",
