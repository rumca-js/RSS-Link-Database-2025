I posted this in <a href=\"/r/Concerts\">r/Concerts</a> and got a great response and so I figured it would be worthwhile to share here.</p> <p>For years I&#39;ve been tracking and recording ticket prices for concerts, sports, and theater events on resale sites (StubHub, Vivid Seats, SeatGeek, etc.) and I finally finished building out a public site so anyone can explore the data. It&#39;s completely free to use, no sign up, no ads, no paid plans.</p> <p>You can look up any upcoming event to see current resale prices, plus a chart showing how prices have changed since tickets first went on sale. You can also focus on specific sections or rows in the venue and set price alerts to notify you when tickets in your desired area meet your threshold. I&#39;m also rolling out forecasts for where prices might go next for any given event based on an ML model trained on all this",
