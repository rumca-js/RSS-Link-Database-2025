        "description": "Would Godzilla be structurally sound or too big for its own weight? Neil deGrasse Tyson, with co-host Matt Kirshen and \u201cGeek-in-Chief\u201d Charles Liu, takes a look at the monsters that have terrified us, like the zombies in The Last of Us or Godzilla, and the scary speculative science behind them. Are black holes cosmic cookie monsters?\n\nCharles shares his favorite creature, Godzilla, as Japan\u2019s way of processing nuclear trauma. What does it mean that the monster came from radiation? Neil recalls his childhood fascination with Rodan\u2019s supersonic flight and asks: could any creature that big actually move? We put monster physics to the test. What would happen if Godzilla really walked the Earth? Would his bones shatter under his own weight?\n\nFrom King Kong\u2019s tragic fall to Frankenstein\u2019s electric creation, we trace how monsters evolved alongside scientific discovery. How did Benjamin Franklin\u2019s experiments with electricity inspire Mary Shelley? Why are we drawn to the undead like zombies i",
