He has gotten more and more interested in computing and programming and wants his own computer. He is currently in cyber school so I was thinking a fun thing to get him would be a Pi 500 he could use for school (he has seen them and shown interest and he would still have his Schools windows laptop should the Pi\u2026 do what Pis do when you tinker with them a lot lol). His school uses Zoom for their in-class portions and I recall Pi4 having issues with Zoom. Does anyone know if Zoom works on the 5/500 version? I\u2019d like him to be able to be able to jump right in school if the Pi is hooked up and not have to be constantly switching between machines on his desk if avoidable\u2026 any advice or experience in this situation would be great!
