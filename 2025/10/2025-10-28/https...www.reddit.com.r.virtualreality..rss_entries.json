The main issues that convinced me to return the headset are comfort, PCVR support, hand tracking, bugs, and lack of controllers.</p> <p>Comfort is a major issue with this headset if you wish to have a good field of view and visuals. I had to tilt the headset at a very high angle in the back to get the lenses close enough and at the right angle to give me good visuals. Even removing the forehead pad did not help. Keeping the slimiest forehead pad and angling the headset gave me the best visuals. This is uncomfortable even when I was able to use my top strap from my Quest Pro.</p> <p>PCVR Support is a mess on this headset.
