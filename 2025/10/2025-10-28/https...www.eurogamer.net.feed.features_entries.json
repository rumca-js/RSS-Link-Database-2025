        "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/horror-mute.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Maybe this is another getting old thing, but my tolerance for stress and tension in horror is not what it used to be. I grew up watching classic horror from the 80s, I relished the dawn of survival horror on consoles, and read an awful lot of Stephen King and James Herbert when I was probably far too young. These days I'll be lucky to get through an episode of Escape to the Country (UK-based home buying TV show focused on moving to rural locations, for those not well-versed in quality broadcasting) without being jump scared by an unexpected appearance from Alistair as he exits a walk-in wardrobe. I get scared easily, yet I still enjoy the many ways horror is used in modern media. What am I to do?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/please-tell-me-im-not-the-only-person-who-plays-horror-games-on-mute\">Read more</a></p>",

        "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/halo-consoles.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>I love Halo. When I was a teenager, I used to work in a kitchen, under a Michelin-starred chef and his ex-con sous. Hard work, poor money. One night, after a late and messy shift, the sous took me back to his place for a beer and some decompression time, and booted up his Xbox 360 and <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-3\">Halo 3</a>. I had never played an FPS before, somehow, and I'd never seen anything like this. My pupils dilated, my mouth opened, and something inside me broke. We stayed up until dawn the next morning before heading back to the pub for the morning shift. I couldn't get Halo out of my mind.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/as-its-original-devs-post-conflicting-takes-on-the-controversial-remake-i-have-to-ask-who-is-halo-campaign-evolved-for\">Read more</a></p>",
