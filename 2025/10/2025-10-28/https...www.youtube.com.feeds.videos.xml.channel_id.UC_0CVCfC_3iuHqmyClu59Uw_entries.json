        "description": "In this video, we\u2019re taking the all-new GPD WIN 5 to the max!\nThis handheld may look small, but in docked mode, it transforms into a full-fledged gaming PC. We\u2019re running the Ryzen MAX 385 (not the 395) with 32 GB RAM, tuned to a 65 W TDP, and the performance jump is insane \u2014 1440p AAA gaming over 60 FPS on an integrated GPU!\nWe\u2019ll compare 45 W vs 65 W benchmarks, run 3DMark, Geekbench 6, and test real games like Spider-Man 2, Forza Horizon 5, DOOM The Dark Ages, God of War Ragnarok, and Cyberpunk 2077.\nYou\u2019ll also see how the twin-turbofan copper cooling system keeps temps under control even at 65 W, and why this handheld might just replace your desktop when docked. #etaprime #gpdwin5 \n\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/en/projects/gpdhk/gpd-win-5-the-ultimate-external-battery-handheld\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Halloween sale code for software\uff1aETA\nWindows 11 Pro Key($23):https://biitt.ly",
