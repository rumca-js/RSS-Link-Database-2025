It was honestly nothing more than a stocking filler, with the buyer knowing that I like gadgets and that I\u2019m a keen stargazer. So, what better than a fun little accessory for my smartphone? Sure, I could invest a lot of money in a proper telescope, but for an occasional glimpse into the heavens, this was a cheaper and less complicated option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, I have to admit that it wasn\u2019t very exciting at first. It actually took me a few months before I even took the smartphone telescope out of its box to give it a go.
