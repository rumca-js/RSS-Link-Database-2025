However, it\u2019s bringing with it a relic \u2013  a part of safety culture that is actually too safe to be practical at a time when it seems like a new reactor is being commissioned every day. What the public doesn\u2019t know is that the fundamental assumption of radiation safety and regulation simply isn\u2019t true.
