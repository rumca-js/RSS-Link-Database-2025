        "description": "Nine-year-old Melodee Buzzard was last seen three weeks ago. Surveillance photos show Melodee at a car rental business wearing a hooded sweatshirt and detectives say a very large dark wig, perhaps to disguise her appearance. Police say Melodee's mother, Ashlee Buzzard, left Lompoc, California in a rented vehicle with the girl to Nebraska, then Kansas. The mom returned home making the 3,000-mile trip in three days. Cops say when Ashley came back, Melodee was nowhere to be found.",
