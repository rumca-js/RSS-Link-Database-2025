In this video, I BREAK OUT of the GUI and show you how AI in the terminal (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex and OpenCode) makes me 10x faster. We\u2019ll install the tools (Mac/Windows/Linux), spin up project aware context files, and unlock terminal AI superpowers. I\u2019ll also show my daily workflow for keeping multiple AIs in sync across the same folder.\n\n\nRESOURCES / LINKS:\n\nCommands / Walkthrough: https://github.com/theNetworkChuck/ai-in-the-terminal \nGemini CLI: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api\nClaude Code: https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code\nOpenCode: https://opencode.ai/\n\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n0:00 - Intro\n1:09 - Segment 1: The Terminal Superpower (Gemini)\n8:43 - Segment 2: Claude Code\n17:59 - Segment 3: ALL THE TERMINALS!!!\n20:31 - Segment 4: Meta-Proof\n26:29 - Segment 5: Open Code\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Join the NetworkChuck Academy!: https://ntck.co/NCAcade",
