I can clearly see on YouTube that auto-generated English subtitles are an option (there is a transcript, they sync on the video etc), but when I use --list-subs in yt-dlp it only shows languages that aren\u2019t English. I am trying to download the automatic English subtitles from an entire channel (something I\u2019ve done before with other channels) and it is showing that none of the videos have any. Even videos that I\u2019ve downloaded subs from before aren\u2019t showing any English subtitles when I use --list-subs and if I try to download directly it says there are no subtitles in this language. Again would like to mention that this is <em>not</em> exclusive to this one channel and is applying to every channel with automatic English subs that I\u2019ve checked, including ones that I have previously downloaded subs from. Am I missing something?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",

I&#39;m guessing some kind of muxing after acquiring video and audio assets? Is there any way, any options, to facilitate just downloading one simple 1080p video of something with no conversions or anything after to keep things quick? I guess grabbing a 720p would be faster but I don&#39;t want to go there just yet.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tinpanalleypics\"> /u/tinpanalleypics </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/comments/1nyukrk/processing_times/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedl/comments/1nyukrk/processing_times/\">[comments]</a></span>",
