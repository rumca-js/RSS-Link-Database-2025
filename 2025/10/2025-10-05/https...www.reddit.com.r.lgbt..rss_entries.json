I usually used Walgreens, but for my hormones, I was using Jewel. However, a couple months ago I decided to switch the pharmacy for my hormones to Walgreens.

Confused and panicked, as they now know for sure that I&#39;m taking testosterone, I told them that I never put it on their insurance and it&#39;s not supposed to be.

When it&#39;s school I try to shave it often so I look neat but I&#39;m on holiday now and I&#39;m letting my hair and facial hair grow out because I&#39;m just curious how it&#39;ll look.</p> <p>Now earlier today I saw myself in a mirror and noticed just how long my facial hair had become, it&#39;s not objectively that long but it&#39;s still way longer than I&#39;ve ever let it get, and when I saw my reflection I just got this pleasant happy feeling of really liking how my face looked. Not really in a &quot;big manly man grow big beard&quot; way, more a simple &quot;dang I look so cool, I think this really fits me.&quot; </p> <p>So yeah that&#39;s my story, if gender euphoria feels like this for anyone else man I hope you all get to experience it, it was very nice :))</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Contradict",
