        "description": "The UK's Online Safety Act age verification requirements have backfired spectacularly, with new data showing users are fleeing regulated platforms for unregulated, less safe alternatives. I break down the latest evidence of privacy violations by age verification companies, how 14 out of 90 major sites simply ignored compliance, and why this censorship approach is making the internet less safe for everyone. Plus, I'll show you practical tools like VPNs, NextDNS, and Tor to protect yourself from these expanding restrictions. Techlore empowers individuals with practical digital privacy knowledge, security tools, and advocacy resources. Discover how to protect your online data and regain control of your digital identity.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 RESOURCES IN VIDEO:\n\u2022 Main source: https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/08/uk-age-verification-data-confirms-what-critics-always-predicted-mass-migration-to-sketchier-sites/\n\u2022 https://www.freezenet.ca/drew-wilson-was-right-double-blind-age-verification-company-busted-track",
