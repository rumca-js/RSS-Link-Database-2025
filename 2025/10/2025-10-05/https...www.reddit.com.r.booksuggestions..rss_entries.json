Every now and then I find something decent, but once in a while I hit a book that really pulls me in. A couple of days ago that happened. I was digging around the sci-fi/dystopia section and stumbled across this random book &#39;The Conduit Trials&#39; and I got completely hooked. It\u2019s got that high level dystopian feel, but what really grabbed me was the psychology behind it. It does such a good job showing how humanity crumbles under pressure and evil. Anyway, I\u2019ve said enough you should jyst give it a try. It&#39;s called &#39;The Conduit Trials&#39; on booksprout. I&#39;ll send the link in the comments. It\u2019s free, it\u2019s fun, and honestly?

Something like what Philippa Gregory writes, but about vampires. Not a YA book or anything, i want a lengthy, adult (don\u2019t mean sexual by this, but I don\u2019t mind sexual scenes) and word heavy kind of thing. Just something really interesting but obviously fantasy.</p> <p>Second vibe: some kind of crime thriller/psychological fictions. Something that gives Twin Peaks kinda vibe, or like the detective that ends up in a small town where everyone knows eachother but what\u2019s happening is way more sinister than it first appears. Again, same kind as the previous, something fairly lengthy, adult and not YA, word heavy. I also really enjoy the Lincoln Rhyme series by Jeffrey Deaver s",

These two seem to be the majority of books in this theme i seem to find. A male protagonist would be preferable because most books I have read in the past had a female protagonist and I would like sime variety. Most books I have found while searching were male powerfantasies, mary sue, horny books with a bad written love intrest or even a harem (nothing against horny books, but these were realy bad). I do not care if it is fantasy, urban-fantasy, sci-fi or something else.

Looking for a novel that will consistently throughout the book will land scences and sentences so emptional my hairs will stand. Open to any genre but aim for more respected novels and less booktok. Also open to scences not necessarily emotional but awe inspiring, can be truly great twists like in &quot;the silent patient&quot; ot the show &quot;dark&quot; or just epic or fantastic scences, as long as they bring these goosbumps feeling consistently throughout the book.
