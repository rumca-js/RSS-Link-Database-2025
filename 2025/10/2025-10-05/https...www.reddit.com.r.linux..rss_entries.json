It worked wonderfully for 5 years until I upgraded to windows 11 a few months ago. It took multiple minutes to log in, and 10-20 mins for my startup apps to actually start. In the meantime my fans would spin up like crazy, (on battery mind you, with wall power my laptop sounded more like a 747). I came to the logical conclusion of resetting the PC to see if it would help. </p> <p>I spent an hour or so resetting my computer and giving it a total clean install of Windows 11. It made no difference at all.</p> <p>I know my laptop is old, but it is not awful, it only has 8GB of RAM and the processor is old and slow by todays standards but I believe an OS should still function at a basic level with that. So long story short I decided to go for Linux. More specifically, Linux Mint XFCE. It was my last shot before I said goodbye to my binary buddy. </p> <p>I am pleased to share that my laptop now ",

I have been using Arch as my daily driver on my laptop for office usage as well as my HTPC / Homeserver. I chose Arch for those devices as I wanted to customize everything to my needs and was eager to learn. Additionally I was a fan of the rolling release cycle and thought of it being more secure as I would always and instantly get the latest updates. During that time I only encountered a &quot;not booting after update&quot; problem twice. While everything has been stable, it was not rock solid stable but fine after all. I then decided to switch to Fedora Kinoite and after using it for a few months I decided to stay with it.</p> <p><strong>Thanks to Arch community and wiki</strong></p> <p>First of all I want to say thanks to the Arch community. Their support on the forum is marvelous and exemplary. The wiki is golden. I would never have come to enjoy (Arch)Li",
