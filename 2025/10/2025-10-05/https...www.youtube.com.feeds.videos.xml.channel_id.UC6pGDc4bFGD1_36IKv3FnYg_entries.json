Watch To Your Eternity on Crunchyroll! http://got.cr/cc-tye\n\nIn the beginning, an \"orb\" is cast unto Earth. \"It\" can do two things: change into the form of the thing that stimulates \"it\"; and come back to life after death. \"It\" morphs from orb to rock, then to wolf, and finally to boy, but roams about like a newborn who knows nothing. As a boy, \"it\" becomes Fushi.\n\nThrough encounters with human kindness, Fushi not only gains survival skills, but grows as a \"person\". But his journey is darkened by the inexplicable and destructive enemy Nokker, as well as cruel partings with the people he loves.\n\nABOUT CRUNCHYROLL\nCrunchyroll is the place to watch all your favorite anime!
