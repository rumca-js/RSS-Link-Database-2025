See the FAQ comments here:\nhttps://3b1b.co/faq#manim\n\nMusic by Vincent Rubinetti.\nhttps://vincerubinetti.bandcamp.com/album/the-music-of-3blue1brown\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/1dVyjwS8FBqXhRunaG5W5u\n\n------------------\n\n3blue1brown is a channel about animating math, in all senses of the word animate.
