I want to share this for anyone having the same issue to easily find the solution.</p> <p>So I am making an application using Jedis, it was running perfectly fine on all environments, Linux, Windows, etc... But running on Docker made it not work. I didnt know why the code froze. We noticed another project was working fine so we got confused. Two projects using Redis, one works the other doesnt...</p> <p>We removed the URI system and BOOM! Fixed. JAVA Jedis URI system does not work at all on docker containers. You need to pass each of the parameters individually.</p> <p>I dont know exactly why this happens, but I am guessing some issue with decoding, its not &quot;separating&quot; the string properly with the separators because of some encoding problem maybe.</p> <p>Hope this helps someone!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
