        "description": "Pokemon Legends: Z-A is an evolution of its predecessor. Whilst Pokemon Legends: Arceus made strides towards open-zone world design and more streamlined Pokemon battling, Legends: Z-A is primed to shake up the series more than any earlier entry. Leading Z-A\u2019s innovations is a switch to real-time combat, a potentially controversial change but one that has been well received by anyone who\u2019s played the 20-minute demo. \n\nThe new system is fast, fluid, and intuitive; its inclusion might just prove a masterstroke by developer Game Freak who\u2019ve shown a willingness to iterate heavily on the Pokemon formula for this entry. Elsewhere, the return of Mega Evolution is a sure-fire win. Gameplay will certainly be distinct, but this video will also explore the possibility that Pokemon-Trainer bonds could become the strongest they\u2019ve ever been.",

        "description": "In case you missed it, Silent Hill f is a pretty significant success, with over one million global shipments and digital downloads. It probably doesn't seem like a big deal at first, but Konami also confirmed that it achieved this within a day, and that it's moving units at a faster rate than Silent Hill 2 remake (which took less than a week but still).\n\nWhen you consider that the publisher's other big release of the year, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, sold over one million units in its first day, the true significance of Silent Hill f's success becomes clearer. After all, Delta: Snake Eater was handled mostly by Konami (with assistance from Virtuos) and not only had the benefit of years of rumors and hype, but also being based on one of the greatest games of all time.",
