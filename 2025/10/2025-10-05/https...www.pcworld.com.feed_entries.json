Its popularity has made USB-C a common sight on new monitors. A USB-C monitor can act as USB hub, giving you additional ports for connecting various USB devices, but the monitor\u2019s USB-C port can also serve as a video-input alternative to HDMI or DisplayPort; and some USB-C monitors can even charge a connected device while in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The details of USB-C can be confusing, however, and pricing for USB-C monitors is often higher than that for monitors that lack the interface.
