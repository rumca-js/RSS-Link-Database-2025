Forget pizza parties and kombucha taps \u2014 the new cutting-edge office perk for 2025 is\u2026 taking your shoes off.\n\nStartups and CEOs are calling it \u201creturn to work reinvented,\u201d as if socks and communal shoe racks are going to make you excited to commute again. LinkedIn is full of think pieces about how \u201cshoeless Fridays\u201d will spark creativity, build culture, and apparently fix burnout.\n\nWould you actually go back to the office just to take your shoes off? Or does your office already",
