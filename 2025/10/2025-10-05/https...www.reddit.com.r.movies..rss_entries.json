One of the best parts though is how much of a buffoon Jack Burton is.</p> <p>He&#39;s ostensibly the hero but he gets continually undercut throughout the fim.

Since then we haven\u2019t really heard anything about it.

Fun plot, great voice acting, really feels like a labour of love, which is typical from Laika studios (known for Coraline and Kubo and the Two Strings).</p> <p>If you haven&#39;t seen it, go watch it</p> <p>A colony of trolls living beneath a town is blamed for kidnapping and eating a baby, so an opportunistic slug of a man makes a deal to join the upper crust of society, if he can exterminate them. But he&#39;s opposed by the supposedly eaten boy and the delightfully sadistic daughter of an aristocrat. </p> <p>Really just a fun movie, genuinely impressive animation, where there&#39;s the main focus, but the background characters and action keep going, which is just torturously difficult for stop motion animation.

The gunshots are extremely loud, not guite to the level of real gun shots but films rarely get this right. Might also be becouse they used real blank rounds. (aside from the garage scene.) 2. You can see alex and eric (the shooters) flinching during pretty much every shot they take which is very common with inexpierienced shooters. Also the way the two hold their guns (especially eric) isnt that far off from amatourish shooters either. (Like alex firing the mossberg from his hip.) 3. Mr luce is able to run a little bit even after being shot 2 times due to adrenaline but michelle , eric and the guy who walks out of acadias class die instantly due to them feeling no adrenaline. 4. The gun models are all accurate to the time the film takes place and are all models that a civilian could easily obtain in america due to their cheap price. 5. The pair have pistols (alex having two) but t",

In any case, I just watched All the President&#39;s Men, which I&#39;ve watched about 5 or 6 times since it first came out. This one is excellent on so many levels! For starters, it&#39;s based on the true story of the Watergate break-in, which happened just a few years before the movie came out and was thus still big news. And what&#39;s more, the story is amazing in-and-of itself! As they say, the truth is often stranger than fiction, and this is a case in point! Until 1972, who would have believed that such a huge illegal operation was going on, administrated by our own president! To me, the silver lining behind all this was the ability of the free press, the Washington Post in this case, to get to the bottom of all this and expose it to the public, which is free speech in action, without which our democracy could not stand. </p> <p>Unfortunately, since then, I&#39;d say we&#39;ve",

And wow, it&#39;s bad. I know Spike can be hit or miss sometimes but this was miss for me on all fronts. Not even Denzel could save this for me. I honestly think it might be his worst performance. And the acting across the rest of the cast is just as bland and uninspired, especially the lady playing his wife and the kid playing his son and ASAP Rocky who is woefully miscast and has 0 screen presence. I think the only person I even kind of enjoyed watching was Jefferey Wright. The random celeb cameos were unnecessary and took me right out of the movie. I get that this is Spike trying to pay homage to New York by getting as many NY names in here as possible but I think he definitely could have gone about it in a better way. And also, is it not weird to anyone else that the rich ",
