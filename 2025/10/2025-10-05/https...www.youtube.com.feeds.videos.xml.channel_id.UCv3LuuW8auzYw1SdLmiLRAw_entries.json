With its focus on history and real world locations, I knew it was the perfect place to make an anime review unlike any I've made before. \nWithin this video I journey all over North West Europe in search of the locations that inspired Yukimura's masterpiece and in the process explore the history behind the story of Thorfinn Karlsefni. It just so happens that I have more of a connection to this story than any other I've covered in the past.\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/c/TotallyNotMark/",
