Most physicists think it does: It is called the \u201cUnruh effect\u201d after Bill Unruh who developed the mathematics for it. Now, researchers say they\u2019ve come up with a way to test this effect. Really? I\u2019ve had a look at the paper.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/mn34-7bj5\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNf",
