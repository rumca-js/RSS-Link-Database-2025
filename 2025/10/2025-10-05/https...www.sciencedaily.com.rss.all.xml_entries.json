Using DNA-based \u201cepigenetic clocks,\u201d they found that people with richer, more sustained relationships showed younger biological profiles and lower inflammation. The effect wasn\u2019t about single friendships but about consistent connections across decades.",

        "description": "When cancer cells are physically squeezed, they mount an instant, high-energy defense by rushing mitochondria to the cell nucleus, unleashing a surge of ATP that fuels DNA repair and survival. This newly discovered mechanism, visualized in real time with advanced microscopy, shows mitochondria acting like emergency first responders rather than static power plants. The structures, called NAMs, were also identified in patient tumor biopsies, suggesting real-world relevance to cancer\u2019s spread.",

It helps move the appetite receptor MC4R to the cell\u2019s surface, allowing it to send stronger \u201cstop eating\u201d signals. The discovery offers new hope for tackling obesity by targeting this natural hunger switch.",

The new species, Acronichthys maccognoi, shows early adaptations for its unusual hearing system. Evidence suggests otophysans moved from oceans to rivers more than once, leaving scientists puzzled about their ancient global journeys.",
