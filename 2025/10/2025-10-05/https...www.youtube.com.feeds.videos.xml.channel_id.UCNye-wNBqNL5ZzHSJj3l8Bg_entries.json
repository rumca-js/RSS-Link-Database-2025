Protesters, many dressed in red, marched through the city carrying Palestinian flags and banners reading \u201cStop the genocide.\u201d\nThe six-kilometre march drew roughly 250,000 participants, making it one of the largest pro-Palestinian demonstrations in Europe. Protesters accused the Netherlands of complicity through arms trade and political silence, calling for sanctions on Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza.\nAs the Netherlands heads into national elections later this month, protesters said their goal was to pressure candidates to \u201cdraw a red line\u201d against Israel\u2019s actions.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Step Vaessen reports from Amsterdam.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.alj",
