        "description": "Scientists have engineered sperm cells coated with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, creating magnetically steerable microrobots capable of precise navigation in the body. These \"sperm bots\" are visible in real-time X-ray imaging and swim at about 6.8 micrometers per second, opening new possibilities for targeted drug delivery.\n\nSource Article: https://www.livescience.com/health/fertility-pregnancy-birth/scientists-invented-sperm-bots-that-they-piloted-through-a-fake-cervix-and-uterus\n\n#medicine #breakthrough #bioengineering #technology #shorts\n\nLinks:\n\ud83e\udd18\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c Merch: https://www.rockstarscientist.org/\n\ud83d\udcf8 Insta: https://www.instagram.com/drbenmiles\n\n\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udd2c \ud83d\ude80  Support my work:  \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUeZBocfxALSUdOgNJB5ySA/join\n\nI support scientific teams tackling global problems.
