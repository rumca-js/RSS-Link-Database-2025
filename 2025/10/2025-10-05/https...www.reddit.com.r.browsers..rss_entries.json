Since then, I&#39;ve never looked back and started working day and night to dedicate all my efforts into building this project, hoping It could inspire others that even a beautiful things can come out of heartbreak.</p> <p>It&#39;s now available as an extension on both Chrome and Firefox.</p> <p>website: <a href=\"https://scribble-pad-fun.vercel.app/\">https://scribble-pad-fun.vercel.app/</a></p> <p>github: <a href=\"https://github.com/A-ryan-Kalra/react-scribble-pad\">https://github.com/A-ryan-Kalra/",
