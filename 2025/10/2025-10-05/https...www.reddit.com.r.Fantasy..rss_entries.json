Pinterest has been great for variety, but I feel like I\u2019m missing out on places where people find more unique or creative fantasy artwork. I\u2019ve tried DeviantArt but didn\u2019t really find what I\u2019m looking for. I\u2019m mostly into art that sparks ideas for storytelling and roleplay \u2014 worlds, characters, species, or anything with a lot of imagination behind it.

No love triangle, no cheating, no rejection or break-up \u2013 no drama, just two people who love each other and get along fine, while going through an adventure together.</p> <p>In other fantasy and science fiction novels, there is either no romance at all, or it is dominated by dysfunctional emotions and behavior.

So far an easy read, but some things kinda disturb me:</p> <ul> <li><p>it&#39;s written in a rather simplistic way. Obvious tropes of young characters running from their village because baddies happen. Every thought, feeling etc of the characters is plainly described every single time, nothing left to intuition/ imagination, only direct description. Character relationships are also very much that way, it&#39;s always black or white, a character may jump up enraged and then a friend may say &quot;no, it&#39;s not the way&quot; and bam, finished, no more anger. Seems kinda YA?</p></li> <li><p>is it only me or the book is heavily (HEAVILY) taking inspiration from the wheel of time? I mean, Camilyn is obviously Caemlin, there are Fades, the magic system is composed of drawing threads of air/fire/earth etc. Dunno if thinking of it as a tribute to Jordan or as plain copy</p></li> </ul> <p>S",

Like on par with game of thrones and Spartacus, those kinds of gory violent stories with a lot of smut involved. I want books written in 3rd person, as I really dislike reading books in 1st person.

I&#39;m someone who always became easily engrossed in narratives, in world building, and adventure but for the longest time I only ever sought out stories told through other media, through video games and comics and animation. I realize there are literal libraries filled with untapped adventures waiting to be experienced, so I want to go ahead and take the plunge of getting into reading.</p> <p>Cliche as it sounds, Tolkien is one of the few authors I read as a kid for fun. Picked up the Hobbit, one day and loved it to bits. I went through the LoTR trilogy a few years later and found myself rereading chapters as I was sucked right on in. The only other book I&#39;ve read and re-read was the Count of Monte Cristo, so that&#39;s another title for the pile. I really, really want to change that and get into reading more books!</p> <p>So wi",
