After 5 years, I have some amazing memories in VR with many different games, friends, and experiences. If it wasn&#39;t for the Quest 2, I feel I would be quite a different person, honestly. Games that I&#39;ve played on this headset have fueled my interests and hobbies, and introduced me to new ones. It&#39;s just been plain fun for 5 straight years.</p> <p><strong>Who cares about nostalgia and fun, though?

I tried the Quest 2 of one of my friends a few days ago and honestly I really liked the experience. My only complaint is that it had a very small sweet spot and the resolution/clarity was also pretty bad, which made me very uncomfortable after like 30 minutes of use. I&#39;ve seen many reviews by now and was also considering the BSB2, but it&#39;s a little out of my budget for now. I would really like the Pimax for it&#39;s better blacks performance due to QLED, because I would like to race at night and have it really FEEL like night, compared to LCD on the Quest which I think will not be immersive during night races. My only concern is QC issues as I&#39;ve heard there is a lot of them. My plan was to look on eBay and find a headset that is already functioning without known issues, tested by someone (the owner), which technically gets me around QC issues.",
