One of them being Metropolis (Original name: The City [[The City|2011]]) and we think it&#39;s a nice quick game and like it. However, it didn&#39;t take us long to realize, the card &quot;City Villa&quot; is quite powerful, especially of you can build a school first and can follow up with 2 City Villa&#39;s (with or without the workmans hut) the chance of you winning grows significantly, and adding a third will gain 21 points for those 3 cards alone.</p> <p>So is this card too powerful and if so, how can it be mitigated? (One thing I thought of was to make the cost of the City Villa as follows: 4 + Number of City Villa&#39;s already in your city, so the second one would cost 5 before bonus and the third would be 6 before bonus, making them 3 and 4 with a school but limit it to 1 per turn, even with the workmans hut.
