By running the raw data through signal processing and machine learning techniques, the team could hear what the user was saying through their desk. Mouse sensors with a 20,000 DPI or higher are vulnerable to this attack. And with the best gaming mice becoming more affordable annually, even relatively affordable peripherals are at risk.... \n\n[T]his compromise does not necessarily mean a complicated virus installed through a backdoor &mdash; it can be as simple as an infected FOSS that requires high-frequency mouse data, like creative apps or video games. This means it's not unusual for the software to gather this data. From there, ",

After five days, almost 5% of the nanoplastics had made their way into the radish roots. A quarter of those were in the edible, fleshy roots, while a tenth had traveled up to the higher leafy shoots, despite anatomical features within the plants that typically screen harmful material from the soil. \n\n\"Plants have a layer within their roots called the Casparian strip, which should act as a form of filter against particles, many of which can be harmful,\" says physiologist Nathaniel Clark. \"This is the first time a study has demonstrated nanoplastic particles could get beyond that barrier, with the potential for them to accumulate within plants and be passed on to anything that ",

Platforms amass users, but then abuse them to make things better for their business customers. And then they abuse those business customers too, abusing everybody while claiming all the value for themselves. \"And become a giant pile of shit.\" \n\nSo first Amazon subsidized prices and shipping, then locked in customers with Prime shipping subscriptions (while adding the chains of DRM to its ebooks and audiobooks)...\n\nThese tactics &mdash; Prime, DRM and predatory pricing &mdash; make it very hard not to shop at Amazon.
