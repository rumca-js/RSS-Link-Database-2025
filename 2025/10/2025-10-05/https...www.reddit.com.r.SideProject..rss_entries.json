The inspiration came from my previous use of google news, where you select x number of topics and it customizes your news selection that way. I&#39;m using some link fetching tools plus gpt to scrape articles based on keyword, so I can in theory have an unlimited number of topics. I also wanted to have a feedback system for me to rate/comment on the daily news batch and it&#39;ll change the search prompt to match my preferences. Attached a video of what it looks like so far, curious to hear what y&#39;all think and what your current news system looks like!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Weakness_Dizzy\"> /u/Weakness_Dizzy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1nyxreu/recent_project_ive_been_working_on_would_love/\">[link]</a></sp",

I think a lot of us have ideas sitting in Notion or our notes app that never go anywhere because we don\u2019t have a good way to test them with the right people.</p> <p>Before I start building it, I\u2019d like to know what you think.
