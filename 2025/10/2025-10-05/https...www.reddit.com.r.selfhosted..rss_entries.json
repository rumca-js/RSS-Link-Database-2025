My ISP uses CGNAT so I am trying to find a way to access my home server from outside my local network. Currently my attempt is to connect my home server to a free Oracle VM instance using Tailscale then use the VM as a public gateway (i.e. redirect all requests through it) to the home server.</p> <p>I have set up global DNS settings(cloudflare) to point to the public ip address of the homeserver on the tailnet.</p> <p>I have succeeded in setting up AIO locally and can access it through the domain name I set up on cloudflare from any device in the same tailnet as the home server.</p> <p>I&#39;ve connected the VM instance to the tailnet and installed nginx. I&#39;m not sure how exactly to set it up.</p> <p>Thank you for any help or suggestions for getting around CGNAT</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chimpy354\"> /u/chimpy354 </a> <br/> <span>",

J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 un compte chez les deux h\u00e9bergeurs. En faisant rapidement les comparatifs, j\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 que les nouveaux VPS 2026 de chez OvhCloud se rapprochent de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s en termes de prix et de ressources. J\u2019ai l\u2019impression que Ovh a sorti ses VPS en se basant vraiment sur les offres de Contabo. Enfin bref, c\u00f4t\u00e9 stockage, les deux sont align\u00e9s.
