Now, Professor Petr Slav\u00ed\u010dek and his bachelor's student Jakub Dubsk\u00fd from UCT Prague (University of Chemistry and Technology, Prague) have described in detail one of the key mechanisms for the creation of these slow electrons in water, a process known as Intermolecular Coulombic Decay (ICD). Their powerful mathematical model successfully explains all the data from complex laser experiments conducted at ETH Zurich (Hans-Jakob Woerner team).",

When scientists compiled this data with signals picked up by multiple other instruments, like the Einstein Probe (EP) Wide-field X-ray Telescope and the Russian gamma-ray spectrometer, Konus-Wind, they found that they were dealing with the longest gamma ray burst (GRB) ever recorded. At around 25,000 seconds in duration (around seven hours), the GRB event scientists refer to as \"GRB 250702B\" beat out the prior record-holder, GRB 111209A, by 10,000 seconds.",
