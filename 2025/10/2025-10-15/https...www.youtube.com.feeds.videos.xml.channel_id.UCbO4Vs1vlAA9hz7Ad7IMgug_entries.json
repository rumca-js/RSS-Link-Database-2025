        "description": "We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Forty One! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independently published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\n\nTaking cues from the gonzo Grim-Darkness of Forbidden Psalm or Space Gitz, Untitled Pirate Game is exactly what it says on the tin; a game about Pirates.

Let's dive in!\n\nCheck out the rulebook in digital  HERE: https://scstew.itch.io/untitled-pirate-game",
