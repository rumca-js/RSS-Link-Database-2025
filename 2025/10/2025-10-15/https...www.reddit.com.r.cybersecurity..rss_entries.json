Specifically I\u2019m weighing whether to rely primarily on vendor APIs (IntelX, DeHashed, Leak-Lookup, etc.) or to invest in limited, carefully scoped crawling of high-value sources, and I\u2019m curious what trade-offs you\u2019ve seen around coverage, timeliness, cost, and legal/operational risk. I\u2019m also interested in how teams typically obtain and manage legitimate API access to intel platforms (what to expect from vendors, auth models, and rate/usage limits), how you validate that a hit is a real leak rather than a false positive (useful enrichment signals, cross-source corroboration, metadata to trust, triage workflows), and practical ways to score or throttle alerts so customers don\u2019t get flooded.
