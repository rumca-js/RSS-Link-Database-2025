        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, Squint Opera reveals how modular tools can enable teams to live the mantra \"work smarter, not harder\" by giving them more time to be creative instead of wasting time reinventing the wheel. \n \nWatch to hear about Squint Opera's learned experience in key areas where they've used Unreal Engine to build custom tooling, from building generation to crowd optimization, even to down task management. By leveraging Unreal toolkits such as Geometry Script, PCG, MetaHumans, and Scriptable Tools, they've broken down the barriers to creating large, visually-driven worlds for AEC. \n \nThis session starts off with the story of Squint Opera's journey, and its current methodology based on lessons learned along the way. The second half of the session features real-world examples of custom-built tooling for solving common project issues, and a discussion of how attendees could implement smart tooling and build better pipelines for their own projects.\n\n",
