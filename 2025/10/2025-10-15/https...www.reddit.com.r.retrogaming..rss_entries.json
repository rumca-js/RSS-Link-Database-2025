I&#39;m seeing adult millenials with stacked game rooms, filled with games they don&#39;t play and frankly don&#39;t want to play. Some, perhaps, they played for the first hour, or first level. But realistically they just own them to say they do.</p> <p>But what really gets me is the self-affirmation surrounding it. These people will tell themselves, and you, that it is all okay, and that it&#39;s not about &quot;finishing&quot; all these games but getting something out of it. It&#39;s okay they never finished the second level of half their SNES collection because it&#39;s &quot;not about that&quot;.</p> <p>For my book, a game not worth playing isn&#39;t worth buying, and it&#39;s not worth owning. Really wish the sphere had more players than payers, but as long as we all tell ourselves it&#39;s great to own more, people will strive to be more great.</p> </div><!",

The modern setup should be simple enough for me, but I&#39;m having trouble deciding how to do the retro setup without breaking the bank.</p> <p>I would prefer to actually use the consoles that I&#39;ve collected and have been looking at getting either the OSSC or Retrotink 5x Pro.
