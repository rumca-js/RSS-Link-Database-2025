I am a junior in high school who has decided to take up Salinger\u2019s \u201cthe Catcher in the Rye\u201d, due to countless recommendations. I am a writer with a high reading comprehension, though I don\u2019t really enjoy reading (Some people think this is weird, I find it might influence my writing style and it psychs me lol) Now to the point, I would like some perspective on the book, preferably without any spoilers!</p> <p>I have gotten as far as chapter 17, or rather page 160 and I am a bit lost. A few notable aspects I have taken into account:</p> <p>\u2022 \u2060Profound repetition \u2022 \u2060Unreliability as a narrator \u2022 \u2060Such intense detail, I keep losing the plot</p> <p>The book has been commemorated by so many of my peers and teachers, and I am honestly having trouble interpreting situations and their impacts on Caulfield, the plot itself, and even whether I should continue reading or not. I\u2019m disappointed so far, and not feeling awfully motivated to keep read",

I used to read a lot of Jacqueline Wilson, not sure what the genre is but I like books where the characters are human but the stories are kinda wacky and not really something that would happen in real life if that makes sense. In a different vein I LOVED the faraway tree series with the different stories every chapter and stuff - they didn\u2019t drag on and could easily get through a chapter easily. I recently re read Holes and got through it quite quickly - I think I enjoy the snappy shorter sentences and chapters. So, I\u2019m not looking for anything too long or with overly complicated language and something that would be YA would be fine, I want to build up to more interesting/longer/grossing books.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just finished a fantasy trilogy that followed the development of a relationship that included a breakup. Time passes and their paths cross again when they are forced to work together on a problem. The final book sees them arguing, pining, working through their emotions - the angst! There were things left unsaid where I was shaking my fist and saying PLEASE JUST TELL HIM! There was humor throughout, so while it was sad and tumultuous at times, it wasn\u2019t super heavy. There wasn\u2019t any spice and it had a happy ending. I am fine with the presence of spice though, so it\u2019s cool if a suggestion contains it. I chose the romance flair because I am asking for relationship drama, but I prefer fantasy or historical settings.</p> <p>I want to laugh, lightly cry, and route for two people that I care about.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ExpectoPropolis\"> /u/ExpectoPropolis </a> <br/>",

I\u2019d love to hear how others connect with fiction on a deeper level.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Due-Rise-3628\"> /u/Due-Rise-3628 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o757cd/how_do_people_enjoy_fiction_even_though_they_know/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o757cd/how_do_people_enjoy_fiction_even_though_they_know/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;m not super interested in interpretations of life after death, but am not against it. I&#39;m mostly thinking about the &quot;death&quot; character interacting with humanity or other aspects of the natural world. I&#39;d love horror and speculative, but am also interested in other world SFF.</p> <p>Not sure if this is allowed, but open to other media recommendations as well.

It&#39;s about a 6-hour trip both ways and I need a solid audiobook recommendation we can both enjoy. He\u2019s a big Stephen King fan, like a completionist! Most recently I&#39;ve bought him The Staircase in the Woods, The Way of Kings, and The Hike. He&#39;s not exactly excitable so his reviews have been mostly &quot;it was good&quot;, but they seem to be hits!</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for anything in the horror/strange/dark realm. I want some good weird vibes that we can both enjoy without a side of secondhand embarrassment (I&#39;d also like to avoid substance abuse themes).
