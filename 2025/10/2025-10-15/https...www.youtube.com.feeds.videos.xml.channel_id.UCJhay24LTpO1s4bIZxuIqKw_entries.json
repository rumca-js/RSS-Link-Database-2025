When these chunks of memory are defined at runtime, we call it dynamic memory allocation.\n\nIn C++ there are multiple situations where dynamic memory allocation is performed. A user can allocate dynamic memory explicitly in different ways, but dynamic memory allocation can also happen implicitly. There are multiple features of C++ that require dynamic memory allocation, but this is not always necessarily clear to the user.\n\nThis might become a problem in certain fields. In safety critical systems some guidelines forbid the use of dynamic memory allocation.\n\nIn this talk we will analyse certain features of the C++ library to see if they dynamically allocate or not. We will also learn what are the challenges",
