I know these exist for books but I was hoping to find ones that are specific to board games.

I&#39;ve been working on BumFit for 3 years - it&#39;s a competitive card game where: - You perform bodyweight exercises (push-ups, squats, planks) to earn &quot;reps&quot; - Reps are the game&#39;s resource/currency - You spend reps to play attack and defense cards - Strategic depth comes from resource management + opponent psychology Only 18 cards needed for a complete game (vs Magic&#39;s 60-card decks). Games last 30-45 minutes and leave you genuinely tired. **The big question:** Is this TOO gimmicky? Or is there a market for games that combine mental + physical challenge? Launching on Kickstarter Thursday to fund expansion pack 2. First deck already exists and shipping. **Full details + video:** <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/redhubcap/bumfit-wo",

I&#39;m wondering, how do you all view the archaic classics that everyone knows about? Like Monopoly, The Game of Life, Sorry, etc. We discussed how modern board games are much more refined and have smoother mechanics, and therefore we personally have more fun with modern games, but of course there is still value in the century old games. For instance, playing with children can be very exciting with these classics, or with other family members or others who aren&#39;t eager in learning an entire new game, no matter how simple it may be. </p> <p>Anyway, although our podcast isn&#39;t specific to game design and our love for games, we had a great, while brief, time discussing games to our commenter. We definitely will return to",

To populate the market, you have to randomly draw from a bag that isn&#39;t big enough to really shuffle around the tiles, but only certain tiles can go in the first three rows, then you have to mix in the storm tiles after the fact only to sort them out at the end of the game. It doesn&#39;t take long in the grand scheme of things, but for the game&#39;s length it&#39;s a lot. Pro-tip: Get a bowl for the tiles instead of the bag.</p> <p>Art: Phenomenal. Between the look and Reiner Knizia&#39;s name on the front, I was pretty much sold immediately. Where it could just be beige, they went with fun and vibrant colors for all the whales (and whale adjacent animals) and gave each tribe it&#39;s own look. </p> <p>Gameplay: Does a lot with relatively little.
