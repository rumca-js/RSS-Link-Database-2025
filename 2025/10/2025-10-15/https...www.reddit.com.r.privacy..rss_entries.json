The pollster seems incredibly biased, and the question they polled people on was vague, just asking if they support online age verification, not specifying if it requires ID or not.</p> <p>When Matt Walsh made a video 2 weeks ago supporting the idea, but it received 1.4k dislikes and 1k likes with most comments being against the idea.</p> <p>How many people actually want these ID verification systems? Could it be that the online community is more against it than those that are less online?<",

I had a roommate that i knew for 12 years before he moved in and while he was not a good roommate, I did not think about the fact that i had borrowed his laptop and then cleaned my passwords out. Somehow he managed to get that back and threatened me on text saying he sent the pw&#39;s to my ex bf who would etc etc. the point is, I need to get my 2 factor authentication and password protection while i change all 300 of my passwords. I am looking at different password authenticators etc, and wonder which one i should use to shut down the ability to use even my current pw by adding 2 factor to them. that is not just sms.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TW1ST3DM1ND1\"> /u/TW1ST3DM1ND1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1o6zk6m/shared_passwords_on_shared_computer/\">[link]</a></sp",
