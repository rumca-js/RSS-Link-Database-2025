I\u2019m wondering if anyone has any decent and budget friendly computer recommendations for my new life of the seas. I was an avid limewire user, and I had an ex that was reallyyyy into being a pirate, so, I\u2019ve got a general knowledge of it all. As well as reading up on all the helpful info here \ud83d\udda4 I just need something that will help me get started maybe? $300-500 hopefully? I\u2019m thinking of probably upgrading later when finances allow. Unless there\u2019s an argument to be made for spending more up front?
