        "description": "Ad: I was given early access to the Arduino UNO Q and invited to the product launch. I used the face tracking example from the new Arduino App Lab on the UNO Q to control a car I can ride in. Check out the full Arduino UNO Q announcement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYb8YzdMWbc\n\nThe car was 3D printed and made from fibreglass tubes. I used two brushless motors to drive it, and build electric steering. The microcontroller part of the Arduino UNO Q drive the hardware using a normal Arduino sketch, while the face tracking part runs on the Linux side of the UNO Q.\n\nThe UNO Q is available to order from the official Arduino store or their various partners!
