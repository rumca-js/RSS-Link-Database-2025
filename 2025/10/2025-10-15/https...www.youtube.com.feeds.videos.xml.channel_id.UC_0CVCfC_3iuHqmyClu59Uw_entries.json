        "description": "In this video, we take our first look at the all-new ASUS ROG Xbox Ally X, the next generation of handheld Windows gaming.We unbox it, go over the design, build quality, and ergonomics, then dive deep into the specs and new software features \u2014 all powered by the AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme APU.\nWe benchmark the Ally X using 3DMark Time Spy and Geekbench 6, then jump into real gameplay with Forza Horizon 5, Cyberpunk 2077, Borderlands 4, and Street Fighter 6 for D-pad testing. We also check out indie gaming performance with Silksong and get a feel for battery life and thermals.\nWith improved cooling, a redesigned shell, and better power management, the ROG Xbox Ally X might just be the ultimate Windows handheld of 2025!\n\nRog Xbox Ally On Amazon: https://amzn.to/4nS3YcX\nBuy The ROG Xbox Ally X AT Best Buy: https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/DyvWPj\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Halloween sale cod",
