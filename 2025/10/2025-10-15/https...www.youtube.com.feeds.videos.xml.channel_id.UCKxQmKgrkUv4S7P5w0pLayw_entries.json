It seems like all hope is lost: until a desperate gambit gives the heroes exactly what they need to win! But Doom has a desperate gambit of his own: one that, though it's never been attempted before, combines all his sorcery and science into a single brutal attack. It all leads to a shocking conclusion \u2014 with consequences that will reverberate throughout the entire Marvel Universe in this penultimate issue!\n\nFOLLOW ME HERE!\n\u25b8 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/ComicsExplainedSub\n\u25b8 Twitter: http://twitter.com/Comicsexplained\n\u25b8 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/comicsexplained\n\nVideos Everyone Loves:\n\u25b8 New To Invincible?
