        "description": "Myanmar marks 10 years since the signing of the National Ceasefire Agreement (NCA), originally intended to end decades of conflict with ethnic armed groups. However, nearly five years after the military seized power in a coup, the prospects for peace appear increasingly remote. Many of the signatories have declared the agreement void, as the country endures a devastating civil war.\n\nAl Jazeera spoke to Ko Htein, a former graphic designer who joined the armed resistance after witnessing violent crackdowns on peaceful anti-coup protests. Now a People\u2019s Defence Force soldier, Ko Htein shares his hopes for unity among ethnic armed groups and a future federal Myanmar. Meanwhile, displaced civilians from Karen State continue to seek refuge by the border as junta forces push their offensive.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nChe",
