I&#39;ve been less enthralled by the horror fiction of H.P. Lovecraft, but I&#39;m familiar enough with the genre to respect it and to understand something of the Cthulhu Mythos.</p> <p>In this short story, Neil Gaiman combines both these worlds, in a Sherlock Holmes pastiche set in an alternate version of 19th century London. Even the title - &quot;A Study in Emerald&quot; - is a nod to Arthur Conan Doyle&#39;s &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, which was his very first work featuring Holmes.</p> <p>Gaiman has made it freely available on his website, so you can read it here:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf\">https://www.neilgaiman.com/mediafiles/exclusive/shortstories/emerald.pdf</a></p> <p>As Gaiman&#39;s story pro",

Where I live in the US, I&#39;m lucky enough that most of the thrift stores around me price their books at 50 cents per paperback and $1 per hardcover. Since I realized this, I have begun frequenting them and every trip is like a little treasure hunt. True, there&#39;s a lot of garbage, of course, but that makes finding something worthwhile all the more exciting, and sometimes you&#39;ll find a whole stack of great stuff, gently used, for just a few dollars. You can find recent releases (and not just airport bestsellers) for an absolute fraction of their normal price, long out-of-print and forgotten gems, interesting old editions of still-in-print books with beautiful vintage cover art, and interesting oddities that you&#39;d otherwise never try. If you collect physical books, consider thrift stores! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BradleyN",

Definitely a page-turner; I read fairly slowly, and I thought this 522-page book would see me through October, and now I need to choose a new spooky text.</p> <p>I think Straub has similarities to Stephen King, and it&#39;s no surprise that they later collaborated. But the similarities are in terms of structure, character, plot ideas. Stylistically, they&#39;re pretty different. Stephen King writes like rock &#39;n&#39; roll, Straub&#39;s more refined prose would be jazz or classical, which I was unsurprised to learn are Straub&#39;s favourite genres.</p> <p>SPOILERS HEREON OUT</p> <p>Actually, you&#39;d think a book called <em>Ghost Story</em> would maybe be similar to King&#39;s <em>The Shining</em>, but if anything, the similarity is to <em>&#39;Salem&#39;s Lot</em>.
