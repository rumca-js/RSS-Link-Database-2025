Built\nusing third-generation 3-nanometer technology, M5 introduces a\nnext-generation 10-core GPU architecture with a Neural Accelerator\nin each core, enabling GPU-based AI workloads to run dramatically\nfaster, with over 4\u00d7 the peak GPU compute performance compared to\nM4. The GPU also offers enhanced graphics capabilities and\nthird-generation ray tracing that combined deliver a graphics\nperformance that is up to 45 percent higher than M4. M5 features\nthe world\u2019s fastest performance core, with up to a 10-core CPU\nmade up of six efficiency cores and up to four performance cores.\nTogether, they deliver up to 15 percent faster multithreaded\nperformance over M4. M5 also features an improved 16-core",
