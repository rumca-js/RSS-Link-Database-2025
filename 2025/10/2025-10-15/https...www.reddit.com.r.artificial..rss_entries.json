A framework \u2014 designed to read internal states (tension, restlessness, freeze, spike, shutdown) as signal logic, not emotional noise. We call it Sentra \u2014 a recursive architecture for translating nervous system data into clear, structured feedback loops.</p> <p>\ud83e\udde0 The Core Premise \u201cThe nervous system isn\u2019t broken. It\u2019s just running unfinished code.\u201d Sentra treats dysregulation as incomplete signal loops \u2014 processes that fire but never close. Instead of narrating those loops emotionally, Sentra maps them as signal \u2192 misread \u2192 loopback \u2192 shutdown \u2192 restart, tracking where predictive regulation fails. This isn\u2019t mindfulness. It\u2019s not self-soothing or narrative reframing. It\u2019s a feedback model that assumes your system already works \u2014 but hasn\u2019t been translated yet.</p> <p>\ud83d\udcbb Why Share Sentra Now? Because it\u2019s working. And feedback is the next",

Every single prompt burns enough electricity to power a light bulb for 10-20 minutes. Multiply that by millions of queries a day... and yeah, it adds up fast.</p> <p>I&#39;m not anti AI (I use it all the time), but it did make me pause. Why aren&#39;t there more models that are powered by renewables? Or at least hosted in regions with greener energy grids? At this rate we&#39;ll probably destroy the earth before we reach super intelligence </p> <p>Has anyone seen good examples of &#39;green&#39; AI tools, where I can feel less bad about my AI usage? The only one I have found so far is <a href=\"https://greenpt.ai/\">GreenPT</a> which claims to be 100% renewable-powered.
