This new dive into the franchise is an action-RPG that features the Bleach cast as playable characters and combat where you directly control their blades. It'll be launching later this year for iOS and Android mobile devices.</p><p>Developer Nuverse says that the game will feature \"innovative\" swordplay, as players can wield their blades against enemies by moving their fingers across the screen. Wherever your finger goes, the blade follows, and the developer says that each Zanpakuto sword has a unique feel to its design, just like the weapons seen in the anime. Switching between characters will also allow players to pull off powerful combos, and creating a versatile lineup to make the most of character synergies is another key gameplay element.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E19pF5EFbWw\" data",
