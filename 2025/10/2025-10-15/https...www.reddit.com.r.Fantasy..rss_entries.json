Its like someone mashed up <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>The Office</em> and <em>Critical Role</em> into one chaotic fantasy sitcom. The humor hits more often than not, with clever dialoge, awkward party moments, and those classic \u201cwhat the hell just happend\u201d quests every DnD group has been through. You can tell the author really loves the genre but doesnt take it too seriously which makes it feel super fresh compared to all the dark serious fantasy out there rn.</p> <p>What I liked most is how the characters actually grow even tho its written kinda episodic. Elliot the cleric might be one of the most relatable fantasy characters I\u2019ve read, just tryna hold the group together while everyone else causes chaos. The group banter legit feels like real friends messing around. Half the time I was laughing and the other half I ",

If you could recommend some good titles I&#39;d be really grateful. i DO like spice. Please know I don&#39;t like anything stereotypical, fetish yaoi-like (like one is an uwu bottom and the others a dark lord or something, can they both be dark lords lmao?) im queer myself btw so its not a fetish thing. I&#39;m just really itching for some angsty male romance man. thats my headspace rn. maybe in 50 years i&#39;ll get to publish this elaborate novel i have in my own head and random notes in my computer, but i digress.</p> <p>if you can add a summary of what its like i&#39;d be eternally grateful</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a",

Just wanted to say that I really loved this novel--and no, I don&#39;t know the author, though we have friends in common. It&#39;s a strange, eerie story of an alt-1700s Italy town in which Catholicism has a mostly-pagan flipside that rules the night. Many fabulist stories feel flat to me because the characters never seem to be more than stepping-stones to the fulfillment of some legend or incarnation of some trope. Here, the tropes are intricate and agile, and the unfolding legend is kept at a satisfying remove. It&#39;s a blast to follow Oriana, the young protagonist waging quiet war on the confines imposed by town and family, as she moves in &amp; out of the &quot;seven fiefdoms&quot; of the night, toward a conclusion one can **feel** coming without ever quite guessing it. An original, dramatic, smart, &amp; satisfying read.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",

Don&#39;t feel too constrained by what classifies as the entrance to a location. For example, for Gandalf traveling to Minas Tirith in Jackson&#39;s Return of the King, it doesn&#39;t just have to just be the first shot of Minas Tirith across Pelennor Fields after Gandalf rides up the hill, it can be that + him galloping his way up every circle to the Citadel. </p> <p>An example that comes to mind for me is the entrance to the city of Rapture in the game BioShock, spotting the ominous lighthouse in the middle of the ocean after a plane crash, the bizarre entryway of the lighthouse with a giant statue, getting the lore of the city explained to you during the ride down in",

It really doesn&#39;t seem like just a bunch of meaningless nonsense. The whole pseudo-feudal thing with its rules, the Faufreluches system, space trade, etc., make the entire fictional universe of Dune more believable, with a feeling of \u201cthis is organic, it&#39;s alive.\u201d</p> <p>So, I would like to read about what other works have these social and/or political structures, specific to the setting, that are so well constructed and convincing that they help bring that entire fictional universe to life with that touch of \u201cthis is so organic.\u201d</p> <p>(And of course, if possible, explain these structures, how they work, and what makes them so cool.)</p> <p>Thank you all for your answers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Iberianz\"> /u/Iberia",

Let me know.</p> <p>What I\u2019ve noticed is that most people describe Sanderson\u2019s prose as simple. \u201cNice observation, Sherlock,\u201d you could say, but I\u2019ve also noticed that some people treat this as if it\u2019s a bad thing. I love Brandon Sanderson and his books, though I agree that in some parts his prose can feel redundant or too bland. Still, there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s so successful.</p> <p>My point is that simple prose seems to be underestimated by many people, even though there are plenty of great examples of it. My favorite is Joe Abercrombie. In my view, that man writes exactly the kind of prose I\u2019d like to achieve.

The FMC had a love interest, and she thought it was her mate. He was a prince and would regularly report back to his father, the king. But he also had a brother at the other academy. I think it was the darker academy, or maybe shadow work done there? Anyway, she kept having run-ins with his brother when they would have trials in the sky (possibly riding dragons? Or dragon-like creatures), and the pull toward him was strong. I remember that towards the end of the book, he said something along the lines of &#39;don&#39;t mate with him&#39; (the other brother).

The wizard parents do this to their kids because, ostensibly, it&#39;s the better chance of survival. It&#39;s almost an inversion of Harry Potter. Magic is expensive and it mostly makes the world more dangerous for wizards rather than less. The school is broadly split between kids of wizards living in fortified &quot;enclaves&quot; and &quot;independents&quot; who are everyone else with far less access to resources. Enclavers have a far better survival rate.</p> <p>The narrative voice is 100% first person retelling from the protagonist El Higgens who, for the first two books has extremely limited information. Scholomance students have no timely news from the outside world, and El and her mother were outcasts",

Looking online, there is a surprising limited number of speculative fic books themed and/or themed around the holidays besides &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. As of right now, &quot;the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; is the December pick unless another title shows up. Any recommendations?</p> <p>(Also, as much as I would have love to read these for December, we unfortunately don&#39;t have that many copies of Pratchett&#39;s &quot;Hogfather&quot;, &quot;Krampus: the Yule Lord&quot; by Gerald Brom, and &quot;A lot like Christmas&quot; by Connie Willis in case anyone mentioned those titles.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lobsterhasspoken\"> /u/Lobsterhasspoken </a> <br/> <span><a href=",
