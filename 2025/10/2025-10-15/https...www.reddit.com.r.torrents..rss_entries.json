That hash is also not present in BTDigg and the torrent can not be found on itorrents.org, torrage.info or btcache.me.</p> <p>Would there be a way get the torrent file from another source or website? I need the torrent file for &quot;archiving purposes&quot;. I have the file it is representing, so getting the content is not the issue. I&#39;d really like to have the .torrent file in my archive.
