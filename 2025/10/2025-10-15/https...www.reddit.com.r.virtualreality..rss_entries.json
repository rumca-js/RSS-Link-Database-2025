And its not good for the skin in the long end. </p> <p>So im here to ask is the kiwi k4 I dont exactly remember the name, is it worth it?

I won&#39;t mention the title to avoid bashing the developers, but I don&#39;t understand how in this day and age of great titles like Half Life: Alyx, where they&#39;ve essentially set the VR standard for how VR mechanics should work and there are still VR games that come out today that learn absolutely nothing from those titles. For me the game mechanics outright sour the experience of a game that would be good otherwise. So my question is, why? Why do game developers continue to release titles like this ? It&#39;s driving me insane. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Peng_Fei\"> /u/Peng_Fei </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1o6zf50/vr_game_mechanics_jank/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtua",

I thought that a VR treadmill or similar might be an option. I am curious if any other folks with varying levels of physical ability have tried such a device.</p> <p>I&#39;m just terrified that I&#39;ll buy it get it all set up and figure out that&#39;s not for me. Obviously I&#39;ve tried tracking down a unit at a local VR arcade and, in fact the local shop is selling one but it&#39;s at roughly the same price as new. I&#39;ve not been able to book time using the device </p> <p>I just wondered if anyone here had-lived experience with one. Obviously I&#39;m particularly interested in hearing your thoughts if you&#39;ve navigated one of these with a disability but I recognize that would be a rather small subset of a already somewhat small community </p> <p>Thanks in advance for your time.
