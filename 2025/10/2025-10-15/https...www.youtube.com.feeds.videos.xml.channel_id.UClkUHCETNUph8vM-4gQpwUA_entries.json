(Early Access Launch)\nIn this Fextralife video, we're going to be talking about Fellowship, a game we actually touched on before that we had access to in the early alpha build back in August of 2024. If you caught that video, you might remember that we came away pretty intrigued by what the developers were trying to do. But for anyone new, Fellowship is what the developers are calling a Multiplayer Online Dungeon Adventure or MODA for short, and is being developed by Chief Rebel, a brand new studio made up of some pretty seasoned veterans. \n\nTimestamps\n0:00 Fellowship Early Access Preview\n1:01 What is Fellowship\n1:59 What makes Fellowship unique\n2:57 Mount System\n3:20 Monetization\n3:55 Gameplay and Combat\n5:04 Stronghold\n5:27 Heroes and Talents\n6:58 Final Thoughts\n8:55 Boss Reveal with Hamish Bode\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook:   / fextralife  ",
