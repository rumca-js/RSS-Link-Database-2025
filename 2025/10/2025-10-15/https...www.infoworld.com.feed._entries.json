They are designed for building lightweight web applications, and they\u2019re particularly well-suited to microservices architectures. Although Spring Boot is the most common choice in this arena, different frameworks cater to different needs. This article is a quick look at seven Java microframeworks prized for their unique combination of features and simplicity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a review of the frameworks, with Spring Boot included for reference:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><div class=\"overflow-table-wrapper\"><table class=\"ha",
