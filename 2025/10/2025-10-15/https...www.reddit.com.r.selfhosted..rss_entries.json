So its been kinda blowing up on X today that someone got banned from GitHub for a troll PR to the Linux Kernel mirror on GH. Now obviously they should not have made that PR in the first place but I think the bigger issue this underscores is that they no longer can access hundreds of private repos of theirs, and anything that was using GitHub for SSO.</p> <p>Now I do not, and refuse to use GitHub SSO, so I&#39;m not too concerned about that. But I do have code in private GH repos for my business. And while I do not anticipate doing anything ban worthy, this makes me think I should have a better option. After all it seems not too far fetched with the polarization today to get de-platformed for merely saying the &quot;wrong&quot; thing or be associated with the &quot;wrong&quot; person or group regardless of which side you are on, so long as the powers that be are on the other side.</p> <p",

Keeping accounts, permissions, and library access in sync across all three is becoming a bit of a headache.</p> <p>Is there any self-hosted or soft-hosted solution that can keep user accounts up to date across these platforms? Something like an arr service, a Docker container, or a community project that handles cross-syncing users and access control?</p> <p>Ideally, I\u2019d love for new users or access changes on one server to automatically reflect on the others.</p> <p>Has anyone built or come across something like this?
