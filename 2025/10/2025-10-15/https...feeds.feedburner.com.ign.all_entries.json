        "description": "It is one of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s most iconic scenes, one that has endured as both a prime example of his acting prowess and a meme. But Interstellar\u2019s tape scene was not heavily rehearsed. Nor did McConaughey have to go through multiple takes to get the emotional reaction we see on-screen. McConaughey in fact nailed it on the first take, and he didn\u2019t rehearse the scene at all.",
