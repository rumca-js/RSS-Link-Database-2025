For example, why did Lucilla feel the need to send Lucius away and abandon him after Maximus died? She said she was worried for Lucius&#39;s safety, but it didn&#39;t really feel like there was any immediate threat to his life. Then Lucilla just moves on and doesn&#39;t even give Lucius a single thought. Like really?! She spent the whole first movie protecting Lucius and worrying herself to death over his safety, then she just decides to abandon him for no apparent reason, and forget about him and get on with her life as if he never existed?! It just doesn&#39;t make any sense...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Embarrassed_Chef874\"> /u/Embarrassed_Chef874 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1o7mvdw/does_anyone_feel_like_the_story_of_gl",

Someone\u2019s poor, therefore their life must be a tragedy of abuse, neglect, addiction, and ignorance, not a condition of unfettered capitalism. And it\u2019s usually packaged as \u201cgritty realism\u201d or \u201cmelodrama with heart.\u201d It seems sympathetic, but they still treat poverty as a moral failure, like being poor automatically makes you broken. I listed some examples but removed them because I feel that would make this post dwindle into a debate about how wrong I am about them and that isn&#39;t my point.</p> <p>Obviously movies like Norma Rae do a good job. Billy Elliot and The Full Monty are good examples of movies that do it right. And the original run of Roseanne (I know, I know and I haven&#39;t seen The Conners) is pretty perfect in its tone. David Lynch&#39;s The Straight Story just came to mind. I am trying to remember but",

At the time it was seen as a grotesque and violent film, but I see a story of community and empowerment for those who are different. And to think it was filmed so soon after eugenic fever ravaged Europe. So glad that it got selected for preservation in the 90s. Only wish that the full cut could have been salvaged. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nataliejonah\"> /u/nataliejonah </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1o735jh/freaks_1932/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1o735jh/freaks_1932/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The only french actor I really recognized or knew about growin up is Jean Reno &amp; I read somewhere he\u2019s not even really french but spanish, lol. I\u2019m not even sure if he\u2019s regarded or as well known to French people as he is in America. So who are considered the all time greats in France? Like if you were to ask someone in France who is the greatest actor, what would the answer be for most people? Like in America some common answers would be Nicholson, Leo, Denzel, etc, etc. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dood0906\"> /u/dood0906 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1o71w43/who_is_frances_most_notable_actor/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1o71w43/who_is_frances_most_notable_actor/\">[comments]</a></span>",

AMC decided to use it as their monthly UNSEEN SCREENING. If you don&#39;t know, AMC shows off a new movie, that hasn&#39;t realesed yet, early and the audience won&#39;t know what it is. It&#39;s kept a secret and all you know about it going in is the rating and runtime. </p> <p>I say all this because Kelly Reichardt is not a general audience director. Her movies are very slow and methodical. Alot of scenes of nobody talking and just jazz music playing, which alot of people like. This is not a director who pleases the general audience. The day after the screenings, people have posted (on other socials) how boring the movie was. Rimming the director&#39;s usual style. </p> <p>Now, you could say &quot;Why hate on the director&#39;s style that she is know for?&quot; Thats the thing. No normal person knows Kelly Reichardt. To make an audience of regular joes go raw in",
