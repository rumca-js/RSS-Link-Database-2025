        "description": "What does it actually mean to live like a Stoic? In this wide-ranging conversation with bestselling author and modern Stoicism evangelist Ryan Holiday, we unpack the origins of Stoic philosophy, why it exploded during turbulent times in ancient Greece and Rome, and how its principles\u2014like courage, temperance, justice, and wisdom\u2014still apply in a world filled with chaos, anxiety, and uncertainty. From shipwrecked merchants to emperors journaling their fears, this episode explores why some of the most powerful figures in history turned to Stoicism not just for answers\u2014but for survival.\n\nWe also dig into how Stoicism overlaps with modern psychology, why it\u2019s gaining traction among young men, and whether its rising popularity is being misunderstood or misused. If you\u2019ve ever wondered whether Stoicism means being emotionless, if it\u2019s compatible with ambition, or if it actually makes you a better person, this episode is your one-stop masterclass. \n\nOrder Ryan Holiday\u2019s new book, Wisdom Take",
