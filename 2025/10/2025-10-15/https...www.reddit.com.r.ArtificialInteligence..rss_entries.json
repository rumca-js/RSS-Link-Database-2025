This is, in part, due to the lack of transparency from big tech companies around aspects like training data and how the algorithms powering their generators work, on the one hand, and the deep and technical knowledge in computer science and machine learning, on the other, that is required to understand these workings. Acknowledging these aspects, this qualitative examination seeks to better understand the black box of algorithmic vision through asking a large language model to first describe two sets of visually distinct journalistic images.

However, the rise in vibe coding taking over the industry has kindled a dislike of many AI coding tools and practices. To me, it feels like people are cheating their way to the top, because it requires so much hard work and dedication to truly understand and appreciate programming. I also feel bothered by companies who fire their programmers and then hire more later to fix the AI mess.</p> <p>Now for me, personally, I use ChatGPT and Gemini all the time to help me learn concepts and figure out why my code isn&#39;t working. I&#39;ve tried using Cursor and Github copilot, but I feel li",

Right and wrong is not something that we&#39;re born knowing. We aren&#39;t born with the knowledge to talk. We are born able to store information, and use that information to make decisions.</p> <p>What makes artificial intelligence so difficult isn&#39;t the ability to store information, but to properly access that information to make decisions in such a way that shows growth. One large factor for this is that artificial intelligence doesn&#39;t have the flaw&#39; of age. Whether it is a faulty&#39; memory that causes decisions to sometimes be erratic, or the simple moral code that we had grown accustomed to, an artificial intelligence typically doesn&#39;t have any of that.</p> <p>Of course, who would want to program an artificial intelligence that",
