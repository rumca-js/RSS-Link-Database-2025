Every Keycloak release has to be applied to each tenant separately. With 3 tenants and 18 releases in a year, that\u2019s 54 upgrades to handle.</li> </ul> <h1>Multi-realm (one Keycloak, multiple realms)</h1> <p>Here, a single Keycloak instance hosts several realms, each dedicated to one tenant.</p> <ul> <li>This allows you to pool ",

For example, if it detects urgency or inactivity in a chat, it will try to autonomously engage in a conversation. </p> <p>You can even control how \u201canxious\u201d or eager the agent is to talk using natural language \u2014 like telling it \u201c<em>respond as if chatting with a friend</em>\u201d or \u201c<em>check in every few minutes when the user see",
