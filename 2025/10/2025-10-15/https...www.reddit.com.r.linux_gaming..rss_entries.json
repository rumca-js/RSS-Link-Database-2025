The runtimes it runs on are now unsupported and the MESA flatpak it uses is now older than Debian&#39;s backports.</p> <p>I&#39;ve looked into switching to Debian&#39;s version of Lutris so this can use Debian&#39;s newer drivers, but it has a HUGE amount of dependencies. It also requires enabling multi-arch and the installation of Wine32, which I don&#39;t really want to do. I like massive things such as Lutris to be apart from the base system.</p> <p>Is there any word somewhere with regard to the next update of Lutris?

Alt tabbing out and back in seems to fix this however the second I go into the inventory screen or the settings menu it is back on the screen and stuck in the center.</p> <p>Only games so far this does not appear to happen in is New World. Going back to X11 the problem goes away, however I find the performance is better using wine wayland.</p> <p>I have tried utilizing protontricks and winecfg to capture in full screen however it is not an issue of the mouse movement being captured but an issue of the last known place being stuck. This did not appear to be an issue when I used my computer last month.</p> <p>Can anyone recreate this issue and or know how to solve it.</p> <p>Using",

No success.</p> <p>Context:</p> <p>The alsamixer trick is the official way to fix the issue, from what I&#39;ve seen. It works for others. In my case, after doing that, I can hear myself talk through the <code>External Mic</code> <strong>Playback</strong> (if I up the gain), but nothing is recorded on the <strong>Capture side</strong>. In other words, the feedback in my hears is working, but not the output of the mic towards the outside. So I know my microphone is capable of recording stuff, since I hear myself in the feedback, but it is not sent to the right place on the capture side.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried with only External Mic being captured, or both <code>Line In</code> and <code>External Mic</code> captured.
