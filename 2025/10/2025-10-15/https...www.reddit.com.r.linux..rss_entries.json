There are practically really three main tools to do this:</p> <p>1- Firejail - Huge setuid app with questionable security, and messy config files.</p> <p>2- Bubblewrap - Even harder to setup, but is at least not setuid, and seems to be built with a cleaner base, which has:</p> <p>2.1- Bubble Jail - This one actually might be relatively decent, trying to fix the Firejail issues, except the part that it&#39;s relatively unknown and mostly developed by one person. So who even knows how secure it is? But I appreciate the work on it.</p> <p>2.2- Flatpak - I mean, eh, I wouldn&#39;t really call this a proper sandboxing tool, it&#39;s again confusing to setup and too easy to leave gaping holes, and only works if you get the app as a flatpak, which",
