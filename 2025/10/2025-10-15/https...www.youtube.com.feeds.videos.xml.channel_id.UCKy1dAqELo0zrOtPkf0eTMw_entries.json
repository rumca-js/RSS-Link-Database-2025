A new dump of leaked material not only provided early looks at the upcoming Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A, but also details on unannounced projects and even new Pok\u00e9mon species. The leaks also suggest the new Gen 11 games are aiming to be released in 2030. In other news, Microsoft is adamant that they're not giving up on console hardware by showing off the lab where the ROG Xbox Ally X was tested, and where the next generation Xbox is being prototyped. And finally, Call of Duty co-creator Vince Zampella spoke with GQ, reflecting on his career and admitting that CoD only exists because \"EA were dicks.\"\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Pokemon",
