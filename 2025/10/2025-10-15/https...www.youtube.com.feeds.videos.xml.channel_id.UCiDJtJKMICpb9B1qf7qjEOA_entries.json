        "description": "When Adam set up his pantograph mill, there was one tool to adjust it's cutter collet that didn't make it to his shop.

How many attempts do you think it will take for Adam to successfully make this tool? \n\nAdam's pantograph mill: https://youtu.be/pku2VRADLGk\n\nShot by Adam Savage and edited by Josh Self\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nSavage Merchandising: https://adamsavage.com/\nAbout Tested: https://www.tested.com/about\nMeet Adam in Person: https://www.tested.com/events\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@testedcom\nInstag",
