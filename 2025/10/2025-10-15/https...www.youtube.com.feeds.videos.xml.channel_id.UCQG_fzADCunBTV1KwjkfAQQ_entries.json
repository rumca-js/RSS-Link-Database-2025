When the rainy season ends and the roadsides are filled with mugwort, it\u2019s time to start smoking the meat again!\n\u201cNiuganba,\u201d literally meaning \u201cdried beef,\u201d comes from the transliteration of local ethnic languages in Yunnan. It\u2019s made by marinating fresh beef, then smoking and air-drying it \u2014 similar to cured pork \u2014 and is one of Yunnan\u2019s traditional specialties.Locals love to use mugwort for smoking, believing it gives the Yunnan-style dried beef a deep, smoky aroma while keeping it gentle and not overly dry.\n\nHello, everyone!
