        "description": "Sponsor: Thermal Grizzly Duronaut on Amazon - https://geni.us/tpgcPMw\nCooler Master is back on its A-game with the MF500 series of cases. This time, we hand-picked the review sample from the factory and sealed it off the line. The Cooler Master MF500 (the \"MF\" stands for... Master Frame, continuing Cooler Master's redundant naming) case has had a variable price between $150 and $190 in the time we've worked on the review. In any situation, the build quality is overall high with good materials and panel sturdiness, although it does have its downsides and areas we're critical of.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
