Nelson had also questioned the phone\u2019s IP68 rating, noting the hinge isn\u2019t dust-resistant. He criticised Google\u2019s claims of improved durability, stating the device showed no progress over previous models. The explosion marked the first in his 10 years of testing, especially disappointing given that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 passed the same test without damage.",

Using assumption-free models, scientists found their interiors could range from mostly icy to mostly rocky, suggesting we know far less about these distant worlds and that new missions are essential to solve the mystery.",
