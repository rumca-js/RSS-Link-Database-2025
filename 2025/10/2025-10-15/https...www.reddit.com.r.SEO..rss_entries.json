Even the ones who aren\u2019t doing great don\u2019t have any money to actually invest in SEO or marketing. And the ones doing <em>okay</em> are just looking for new ideas or validation, not a long-term project.</p> <p>So I\u2019m curious how you all handle this- do you give a free audit first and then talk about pricing for the project <em>after</em>? Or do you mention your charges right away, and only do the audit if they seem serious?</p> <p>It\u2019s been feeling like free audits are more of an idea exchange than a lead generator.
