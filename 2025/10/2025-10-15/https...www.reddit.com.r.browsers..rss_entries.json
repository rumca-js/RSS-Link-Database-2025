Brave definitely delivers on almost everything except of theming it&#39;s pretty lackluster. Firefox theme library was very fun to browse on, while Chrome Web Store have \ud83e\udd21 despite the categories.</p> <p>I&#39;m planning to switch from Firefox after it&#39;s starting to put some strange features and the ToS drama thing, but it kinda feels incomplete browsing without this one animated miku theme I use. Ofc I also prioritize privacy, my FF is hardened but it does slow or lags sometimes also eats bigger memory than Brave.</p> <p>It looks like Brave already answered the privacy features tailored for my usage preference. Have there been any mods or workarounds to add cool themes to Brave?
