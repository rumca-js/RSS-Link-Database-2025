Then you'll dive into three hands-on coding projects.\n\nYou'll build calculator apps using Standard I/O (STIO) and HTTP Stream, integrate APIs for dynamic content, and apply testing with GitHub Copilot.\n\nYou\u2019ll finish by deploying your MCP on FastMCP Cloud for a complete end-to-end workflow.\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Code: https://github.com/BarrileteChapin/FCC-MCP-Course\n\n\u270f\ufe0f Course created by Carlos Leon.\nConnect with Carlos on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/leoncarlo/\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Support for this channel comes from our friends at Scrimba \u2013 the coding platform that's reinvented interactive learning: https://scrimba.com/freecodecamp\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n- 0:00:00 Greetings\n- 0:01:54 About MCP\n- 0:04:46 Coding Scenario 1\n- 0:13:58 Coding Scen",
