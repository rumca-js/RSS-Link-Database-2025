        "description": "The new ROG Xbox Ally comes in two models: the $1,000 Ally X and the $600 Ally. The key differences between the two are in their processors, storage and memory.\n\nThe Xbox Ally will have the AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor, while the Xbox Ally X will use the faster AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme Processor. Memory will be different, with the lower-priced Xbox Ally having 16GB of LPDDR5X-6400 and the higher-cost handheld coming with 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 RAM.\n\nBoth will come with solid-state storage, but the Xbox Ally will have 512GB, and the Xbox Ally X will have 1TB. Let's unbox the two new gaming handhelds. #asus #gaming #gaminghandheld #xboxally #asusrog #unboxing",
