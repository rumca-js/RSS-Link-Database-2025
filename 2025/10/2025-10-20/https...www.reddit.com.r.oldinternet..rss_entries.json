I am becoming increasingly aware of how the internet, and the web in particular, has changed radically in recent years and how, essentially, everything has gone to hell. There are no longer myriad small islands of discussion and exchange, but only large agglomerations whose sole purpose is to take as much data as possible from our lives and sell us products. The content is less and less authentic, and all this AI is getting boring. Even the graphic design of websites seems prefabricated, leaving aside the imagination and wide variety of colors of the old sites. I can no longer get excited about anything I see on social media today or on modern websites. Paradoxically, today we have speed and efficiency that are light years ahead of just 15 years ago, but I feel that the most important thing of all is missing. The soul. I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s just the rant ",
