I&#39;m aware that especially the expansion isn&#39;t too easy to come by and I&#39;ve seen some pretty crazy asking prices online.

I also understand there are people that just like board games less because they are too slow or they don&#39;t like the medium. But what gets a person to dislike board games but like video games?

Do you ever buy board games in markets or do you think it&#39;s a bit weird? lol maybe we need to just go to board game specialty stores, but thought it could be interesting for us to chat with people and explain the game ourselves!</p> <p>Thanks for all the help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Full-Ambassador5625\"> /u/Full-Ambassador5625 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1obo512/any_holiday_markets_to_sell_board_games_in_nyc/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1obo512/any_holiday_markets_to_sell_board_games_in_nyc/\">[comments]</a></span>",

They apologised and said \u201cit\u2019ll be delivered tomorrow.\u201d Five days of this. Eventually, the following Wednesday, the DPD tracking app said ti was being returned to the sender!<br/> I immediately called DPD and learned that the parcel was \u201ctoo big for the locker,\u201d so every single day a driver tried, failed, and returned it to the depot. Then it got sent back to Zatu. Ridiculous!</p> <p>I contacted Zatu, explained I had a second game night planned (already had to cancel the first one), and asked if they could send out a replacement copy while the original was on its way back. They said no, they won\u2019t do anything until they physically receive the return.<br/",
