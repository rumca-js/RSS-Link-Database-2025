I have a rather unusual perspective, and I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts and viewpoints about it.</p> <p>Here\u2019s my question: From what I\u2019ve researched, it really seems that this was Epstein\u2019s blackmail ring that he used it by getting powerful people to have sex with underage individuals in front of cameras. Honestly, nothing else can explain his level of influence.</p> <p>Also, I keep finding powerful Jewish people who are supposedly possible &quot;victims&quot; of Epstein, and there seem to be some Mossad connections as well. Could this even be possible? Because if it were true, Mossad would have killed Epstein decades ago.</p> <p>What do you think guys?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Firm-Stomach1259\"> /u/Firm-Stomach1259 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1obmyjr/",
