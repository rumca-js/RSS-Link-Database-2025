I have a kind of running story going, and it usually responds in a certain way, and all of a sudden it\u2019s like a different thing. I don\u2019t know what I did. Or is this something that others are experiencing recently also? I use the 4.0 legacy model and have saved inputs, but even so, it\u2019s just\u2026not the same recently. Feeling rather disappointed and hoping there\u2019s something I might be able to do to get it back to what it was. It just seems more bland now, and doesn\u2019t seem to remember as much as it used to about past storylines, etc. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/8WinterEyes8\"> /u/8WinterEyes8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ob5pb6/its_suddenly_a_different_personality_is_there_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre",
