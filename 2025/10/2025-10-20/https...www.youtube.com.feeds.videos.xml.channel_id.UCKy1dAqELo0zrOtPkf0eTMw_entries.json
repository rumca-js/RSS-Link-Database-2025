        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nMicrosoft is saying the controversial price of the ROG Xbox Ally X wasn't set by them, but rather hardware maker ASUS. The Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are $599 and $999 respectively, and feature Xbox-themed UI and connect to the users' Xbox accounts, but are technically ASUS products under the ROG brand. Despite the price, Microsoft claims the devices have sold out on the Xbox store and other retailers, and the critical response has been overall positive, despite the steep price. In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3's co-director is saying that the game's combat system is not yet decided, despite calls for the series to return to turn-based roots. This comes after the surprise success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which features many game mechanics popularized by JRPGs like classic FF titles. And finally, a leak about more Resident Evil remakes may prove to be real, with reports saying Resident Evil 0 and Code Veronica are next on Capcom's to-do list.",
