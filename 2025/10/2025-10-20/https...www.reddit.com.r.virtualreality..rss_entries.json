So, i figured that I couldn&#39;t go back to Sim racing on a flat screen, even a good one. </p> <p>In order to not spend a lot of money since I am choosing to do this instead of uprading the Sim rig (T300rs) or the pc (10700k rtx3080) I thought about either buying a new cable (from ali express seems to be the only place I can get being in EU) for about 100\u20ac or I can try to sell the headset and controllers (100-150\u20ac?) and buy a Quest 3 for example as the price used is going around 350\u20ac</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen some reviews saying it isn&#39;t a jump when it comes to using it for sim racing alone so that is my hesitation mostly, i still need to buy a better strap and the link cable probably, seen also that",

Seems like the perfect headset for me as I have some neck issues and really hate heavier HMDs. I also think the 75hz, lower res screens are a good blend for my heavy DCS/MSFS use where I often struggle in DCS low level rotor to get good frames as its very demanding in single player campaigns. Curious about the Pimax Dream Air but its Pimax so by the time I can figure out if some people also have issues with that headset and its available to me I am looking at Q3/Q4 next year.</p> <p>ANYWAY.... </p> <p>Currently on a G2 so not in the lighthouse ecosystem. Don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll dislike the BSB2 once I try it, but need to get setup so have to buy stuff and risk it. Seems base stations would be an easy resell if needed.</p> <p>But what about the index controllers? I mostly do seated sim experiences",

I saw there are collectables in each biome? Or is it collectables for each path? I wanna know if I can replay a story mission over and over to find those and/or try out the different suits in a similar environment.. I understand the levels are procedural generated so how does that work with the collectables? Oh one more questions: How much does each suit evolve as they upgrade? Thanks for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/alien1583\"> /u/alien1583 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ob5bz7/anyone_play_titan_isles_yet_i_have_some_questions/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ob5bz7/anyone_play_titan_isles_yet_i_have_some_questions/\">[comments]</a></span>",
