He gets misgendered alot and i want to say something when it happens but he doesn&#39;t so it feels like not my place. Like on our first date we got pulled over and a cop called him &quot;mam&quot;. And I understand not correcting a cop cause that could be an issue. But we have a mutual friend who constantly calls him &quot;she&quot; and i want to say something because thats his friend. Like you would think he wouldnt want to be friends with someone who cant respect his pronouns. So i want to say something cause maybe he just doesnt want to make a thing of it.

She was very touchy with me but at first not a creepy way. Just like putting her hand on my back or shoulder when she would walk by me or stand really close to me. At one point she was helping me with something and she put her breast on my hand. She\u2019s very fast moving so I\u2019m sure it was an accident but she gave me a very seductive look when she stood back, and it made me very uncomfortable. This sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen to me a lot but enough that I know mentioning I have a boyfriend usually makes these kind of girls back off or want to be my best friend.
