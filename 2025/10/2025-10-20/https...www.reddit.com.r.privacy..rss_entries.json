I don\u2019t mind paying for services but still, I don\u2019t want to simply throw money at a wall.</p> <p>One things that come up in the recent years are those brand marketing themself as privacy note apps. Give you some cloud storage space and \u201cnotebooks\u201d, everything for a subscription. Not wanna say any name as this isn\u2019t brad specific, and people tend to get too focused on their brands.</p> <p>Now, my point is, are really needed?</p> <p>And I am not saying because free alternatives exist. I say this, because probably you are already paying for something that offer a privacy way to store your notes. Here some examples:</p> <p>- Proton Drive: Have his own suit and it is marketed as end-to-end encrypted</p> <p>- Filen: This cloud provider that is getting a little more known as a dedicated \u201cNote\u201d section.

And even when we do, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. Are these settings genuinely protecting our data, or just making us feel like we\u2019re in control while the real tracking continues in the background? Some apps offer meaningful choices like turning off ad tracking or using end-to-end encryption. But others make it so complicated that you just give up halfway through. What\u2019s your take? Do you actually adjust your privacy settings? Have you ever seen a real difference after doing so? Or do you think the whole thing is just a marketing trick to make us trust these platforms more?
