You had objectives such as find documents or just destroy the enemy and could play as either Viet cong or US soldiers, and the enemy was other players not NPCs. </p> <p>It was played through a website, and it would have been around 2003-2005. I seem to remember that the website was something like Junglewar.com, but that doesn&#39;t bring anything like it up. I really hope someone else remembers this, because at this point I&#39;m wondering if I dreamt this, but I&#39;m sure I spent many an evening playing it. </p> <p>Edit: the game started with a blacked out map, you had to move and explore to be able to see and open it up. Also you waited about 10 seconds between movement/ actions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",
