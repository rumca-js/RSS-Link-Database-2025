        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, leftist protesters take to the streets to bravely stand up against our non-existent king. And they do so, as always, by explicitly calling for violence against their political opponents. And I think I have identified the precise moment in time when our culture peaked, and then started its decline. The real reason for the decline \u2014 and the thing that may make the decline permanent \u2014 is something that isn\u2019t talked about very much. But we\u2019ll talk about it today. This is a very important conversation, in my opinion. So stick around for it.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:29 Opening\n01:55 - 27:11 \"\"No Kings Protest\"\" Turns Into A Rallying Cry For Political Violence\n29:24 - 31:03 Matt Discusses His Fish Cam\n31:04 - 43:07 Two Ohio Kids Charged With Attempted Murder Against A 5 Year Old\n44:33 - 1:08:20 The Exact Moment Pop Culture And Society's Monoculture Died\n\nEp.1676\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtJhzta62hc\nhttps://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/10711299",
