I really like sarcastic and dark humor but I feel that sometimes, especially with Welsh, it can become quite depressing. I enjoy learning about different sports/music/film subcultures and being able to learn about them outside of my reading. Bukowski and Kerouac are also some of my favorite writers for their minimalistic style but I have grown sick of their misogynist themes. I like a little vulgarity and shock appeal but not to the extent of constantly reaffirming derogatory beliefs. I really like an antisocial character but would like to see a happy ending or positive lesson out of a dark situation.

I chose Kelsen and Ancient Greece from the list, with the aim of contrasting the two, especially in regards to justice. However, I am struggling to get my head around Ancient Greek law (particularly Ancient Athens, as that seems to be the main focus in available resources) especially in regards to their definiton of justice.

I also read all of the Heroes of Olympus books, and I am now in search of some other books I would enjoy. I loved the hero-type books in Percy Jackson, and also the mythological aspect of them. I have looked into the Covenant of Steel trilogy and might read it, as well as The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Does anyone else have some other good book suggestions I should look into, and why? Thank you.

I used to read alot more but lately its been difficult to find fun books. I&#39;ve found that I prefer books that a structured mysteriously in that you don&#39;t get the full view of the world to much later in the story. I don&#39;t know if it is a trend or I actually like that type of book, but both of my more recent favorites, A Green and Ancient Light by Fredric S. Durbin and The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman have been set up like this. Another similar title I had read a few years ago was the Contender Series by Matharu Taran. I also am not allowed to read anything with alot of &quot;18+&quot; topics so I&#39;d like if any suggestions didn&#39;t have these.</p> <p>Thank you for your time!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_RetroDragon\"> /u/_RetroDragon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comm",
