I somewhat recently dug out my old Raspberry Pi 3B and installed Trixie onto it. After some troubleshooting elsewhere, I was able to get my old Element4 3.5 inch GPIO display working with it too. Everything was fine where the screen would go into screensaver mode after about 5 minutes and I could even force it on and off in SSH. The issue is, I accidentally knocked the screen off while the machine was on and now it won&#39;t work right. The screen still shows up but now it only refreshes at 1/10 of the speed, doesn&#39;t turn off the screen, and when I try to check it out with xset, it says the server does not have the DP",

However, that larger computer has not enough USB ports on it or space for the setup i&#39;m trying to use, (flight simulator+streaming equipment+music recording studio, so throttles, yoke, pedals, MANY different dashboard modules, and then a stream deck, multiple microphones, webcam, capture card, and a sound mixer for instruments, all limiting space and total USB ports available.) The larger pc sometimes struggles to run all of them at once as well, something, whether OBS or the flight simulator, is bound to crash when I run both at the same time. Would it be a good idea, or even sensical, to try and plug them in with their extra USB ports to my PC to power all of the equipment, or to even have a connection with the main one for the stuff that is plugged into an outlet on its own? And also maybe just for the tiny extra processing boost, if possible, but not necessary, for any surplus tasks I ma",
