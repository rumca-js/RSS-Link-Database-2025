For 30yo vhs , it is restored very good. So i want to keep them and newer medias for longterm. So my critical data is not that much. Probably it is 500gb max. I think bluray disc better fit for me because i know hdds always fail in short time. Ive lost many family data with hdd. Should i really go for M-disc or is standart verbatim bluray disc are enough for 30-40 year backup?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lavetera\"> /u/lavetera </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1obuujk/longterm_optical_disc_archive/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1obuujk/longterm_optical_disc_archive/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019ve always used a VPN for privacy and to change my location, but lately it feels like sites are catching on and blocking VPN IPs pretty fast. A friend told me to look into proxies instead, especially residential ones.</p> <p>I found a place online where you can <a href=\"https://infatica.io/residential-proxies/\">buy residential proxies</a> for a pretty good price (I saw them at around $3 per IP), but I\u2019m not sure how they compare to a VPN. Would proxies actually be better for this kind of use? I\u2019m mainly trying to avoid rate limits and access region-locked sites without getting blocked.

Everything I use is offline capable (All software I have is FOSS, all games I keep are from GOG, etc.) Reason being is that I want to achieve the goal of having all of my software to be able to be run on a computer in, say 30 years or more.
