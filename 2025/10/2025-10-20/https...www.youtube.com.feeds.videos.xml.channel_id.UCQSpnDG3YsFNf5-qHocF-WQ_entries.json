There's also other configuration options I discuss.\n\n\u25bc Time Stamps: \u25bc\n0:00 - Intro\n0:32 - How To Enable It\n1:04 - What The Feature Does\n1:41 - The Other Options\n3:16 - Very Excellent Thing Indeed\n4:42 - The Feature In Action\n6:15 - Advanced Configuration\n7:59 - Other Thoughts\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\u2022 My Gear & Equipment \u21e8 https://kit.co/ThioJoe\n\u2022 Merch \u21e8 https:",
