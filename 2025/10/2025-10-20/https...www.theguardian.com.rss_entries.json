The difference between shop-bought and homemade gnocchi is vast, especially the vac-packed, long-life kind, which are dense and can be heavy. Freshly made gnocchi, with fluffy baked potatoes, however, are light as air, pillowy and silky. If that sounds intimidating, let me reassure you that this recipe is really forgiving, and much easier than making fresh sheet pasta. I love them served simply, as here, with a slightly nutty sage butter and <em>lots</em> of parmesan. The simple sauce lets those gnocchi sing.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/oct/20/quick-easy-parmesan-sage-jacket-potato-gnocchi-recipe-georgina-hayden\"",

It\u2019s the most widely marked festival in India and feels a bit like Christmas does in the west. It\u2019s synonymous with fireworks, bright colours, endless parties and tables creaking under the sheer weight of food and desserts. No Diwali is complete without boxes of sweets (<em>mithai</em>) and dried fruit exchanged between friends and family. In the UK, we keep those traditions alive, dressing up, visiting temples, reading Indian mythology to the kids and, most importantly, gathering with friends from every background and religion. For me, Diwali is about togetherness and sharing food that feels special, but doesn\u2019t keep you in the kitchen for hours. The bread pudding is my take on the indulgent <em>shahi tukda</em>, while the ladoos are perfect to gift or to enjoy",
