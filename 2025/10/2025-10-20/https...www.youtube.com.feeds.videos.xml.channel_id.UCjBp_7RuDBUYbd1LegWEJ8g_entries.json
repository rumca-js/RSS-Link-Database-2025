        "description": "To celebrate the launch of Ninja Gaiden 4, we took the fight sky-high \u2014 literally. Imagine this: two helicopters slicing through the Miami night sky, one carrying a 26-foot wide screen created by Heli-D, the other with Emmanuel \u201cMaster\u201d Rodriguez, the Team NINJA community manager, and diamond-certified recording artist Swae Lee. The result? A jaw-dropping, first-of-its-kind spectacle that fused gaming, technology, and pure adrenaline. The event also set a new Guinness World RecordsTM title for the largest videogame display flown by helicopter.\n\nAs the city lights shimmered below, Yakumo of the Raven ninja clan leapt into the night, battling enemies across an enormous screen suspended in the sky. Every slash, every grapple, every heart-pounding moment of combat came alive against the backdrop of snippets of an exclusive new record from Swae Lee entitled \u201cFlammable\u201d. \n\nhttps://www.xbox.com/games/store/ninja-gaiden-4/9p0sq1s72g4j\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO XBOX: https://xbx.lv/2EEjmaR \n\nFOLLOW XBOX \n",
