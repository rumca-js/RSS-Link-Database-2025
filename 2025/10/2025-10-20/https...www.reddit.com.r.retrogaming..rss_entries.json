I&#39;m working on an options screen to make it more friendly to modern gamers, with options for non-permadeath, longer pauses in the game&#39;s input timer, starting at level 2 or maybe even 3, just to make the game more fair.</p> <p>Also toying around with some ideas about adding an overall goal, but I won&#39;t do that unless I can come up with something really good, which I haven&#39;t yet. A mobile version is for sure on the table if people are interested.</p> <p>Anyway, let me know what you think.</p> </d",
