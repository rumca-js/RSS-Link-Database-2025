I am currently working as a security consultant for a small MSP that gives freedom to study and skill up and my career development talk is going to happen soon.</p> <p>What career path/education would you suggest in your experience for a person with 4-6 yrs of experience in SIEM, EDR and DLP solutions? I don&#39;t really have much experience in firewalls or networking. I am kinda being seen as the go to SIEM guy but do wish to broaden my scope. I also have worked in SoC and generally love the investigative nature of the work.</p> <p>Ideally I would like to be involved in work that is around I&amp;M, Zero Trust etc. A proper security engineers role </p> <p>Just not sure if it&#39;s feasible for my background and if I can do something about it. </p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>Also, apologies if I am all over the place. I fortunately that is how I am feeling right now with my background and choices. <",

In order to give back to the community, I wanted to start a YouTube series with quick ~10min hacking guide of OSCP machines. All of these machines should be good practice for the test (they&#39;re from LainKusanagi&#39;s guide).</p> <p>These are going to be quick, pre-hacked boxes that just gets to the good stuff without all the fluff. The hope is you can watch them quickly while studying for some notes to jot down, instead of skipping through a 30-40min video lol. I plan on releasing a new one at least once a week, sometimes faster if I have time.</p> <p>Hope you enjoy! Feel free to give any suggestions or tips you may have.
