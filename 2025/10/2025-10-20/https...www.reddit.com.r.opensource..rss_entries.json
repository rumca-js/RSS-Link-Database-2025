You\u2019re not just coding anymore; you\u2019re managing bug reports, feature requests, PR reviews, and user complaints daily. It becomes product management for the open-source world rather than just programming.</p> <p>What struck me most was his discussion on the mental side of things: burnout, community pressure, and the struggle to find time for innovation amidst the maintenance demands. Many developers don\u2019t talk about this, but it\u2019s a significant aspect of open source.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the conversation if you want to check it out:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2D_AkdUupM&amp;list=PLeeGnEj5psFIwWJfpCwnedMsFApK6CvRr&amp;index=8\"> Open Source at Scale with Erik Ras",
