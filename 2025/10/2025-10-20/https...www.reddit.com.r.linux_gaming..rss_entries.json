While I expect to have some extra difficulties in installing or running certain games, one issue that is new compared to my last attempt to move to Linux is that one game that I play (Honkai Star Rail) does not work at all at the moment with either Wine or Proton due to anti-cheat. One option would be to have a dual-boot setup (which is what I have for now), but then I would have to have at least some other personal accounts, apps, and files stored or duplicated on the Windows side of the machine for when I&#39;m doing a longer gaming session and might need to briefly switch away for some other task or while auto-farming (this happens often enough for me that it&#39;s a genuine issue).

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just want to take a minute to appreciate this game. A UE5 game that runs without hiccups or any faults on my Linux machine. Im using a 9070xt and using the RTXGI epic preset with medium on the rest and native 1440p. Getting 120fps+ !!. Now in was under the impression that RT took a huge hit on Linux but here that doesn&#39;t seem to be a huge factor. IDK what id get on W11 but this is definitely a good experience. I could even just do fsr4 quality and probably go above medium to still have high refresh. I&#39;m still getting the hang of what the game is, but so far i really like the calm but intense at times vibe. Amazing game!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Strange-Armadillo506\"> /u/Strange-Armadillo506 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ob9avw/shout_out_to_arc_raiders/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments",
