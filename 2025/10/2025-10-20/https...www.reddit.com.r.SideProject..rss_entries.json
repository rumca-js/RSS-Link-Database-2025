I spend a few minutes every day collecting free daily bonuses from sweepstakes sites. It&#39;s a popular and legitimate side hustle right now. </p> <p>Basically, you just log in and claim about $1 from each site. It only takes me about 5 minutes to run through my list, and it builds up to around $600 a month. There&#39;s no catch... it&#39;s just how these sites are legally required to operate (they need to give out &quot;free entry&quot;). </p> <p>A lot of people are skeptical at first, but it&#39;s completely transparent and it works. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions about it! </p> <p><strong>\u27a1\ufe0f For the full list of sites and my free guide on how to start, you can find the link here</strong> <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/lionpenguin\"><strong>https://linktr.ee/lionpenguin</strong></a> <strong>:)</strong> </p> <p>The guide is",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019m currently building something aligned with those ideas called KINVII, a regenerative living and lifestyle ecosystem in Washington state. The first site is planned as a 100-acre campus integrating modular homes, a solar microgrid, coworking spaces, an RV park, and community agriculture. It\u2019s designed as a for-profit and nonprofit hybrid that rewards participation, where residents can earn rent credits through community work, mentoring, or creative contributions.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for a cofounder or collaborator who shares the solarpunk vision and wants to help bring it to life, ideally someone experienced in sustainable design, regenerative systems, or ethical tech who also believes in building new economic models from the ground up.</p> <p>If that resonates, I\u2019d love to connect and swap ideas. KINVII is meant to be a living prototype, a place where regenerative living meets real-world scalability</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

If you\u2019ve ever tried reading or parsing a 10-K, you know how bad it can be for some companies. Hundreds of pages, inconsistent formatting, and severe rate limits. </p> <p>We got into this space because we realized that understanding SEC filings can give huge insight into how companies operate. This isn&#39;t just for trading, but also for research, compliance, and trend analysis. As Martin Shkreli pointed out in the past (won&#39;t post the video link as you can find it easily), being good at reading SEC filings can make you an expert in the field. So we decided to make that process easier through code. </p> <p>We built EZSEC-API, an API that:<br/> \u2022 Fetches and caches SEC filings for faster access by you<br/> \u2022 Transforms raw filings into structured data (JSON, text, etc.)<br/> \u2022 Normalizes inconsistent SEC formats so you can focus on analysis<br/> ins",
