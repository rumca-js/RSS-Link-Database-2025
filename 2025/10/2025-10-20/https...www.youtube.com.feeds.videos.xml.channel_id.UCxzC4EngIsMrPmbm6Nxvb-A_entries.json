        "description": "On October 16th at about 6:40am mountain time a Boeing 737 experienced dramatic damage to a cockpit window which forced an emergency landing in Salt Lake City. Some sources claim the pilot saw an object and thought it was space debris. Most news sites are reporting this as fact.\n\nI on the other hand see that this is 3rd hand information, and think there are other possibilities that may be more likely. I'm hoping the NTSB will come up with more evidence after examining the broken window.\n\nThis is the Aviation Safety network page on the incident\nhttps://asn.flightsafety.org/wikibase/552393\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scottmanley",
