I want to make something <strong>innovative, clean, and attractive</strong> that can showcase my skills, projects, certificates, and experience, basically a personal site that stands out.</p> <p>I\u2019m also aiming to try some new things in this project, like adding a <strong>multilingual</strong> option, <strong>light and dark</strong> mode, and maybe using <strong>django-cutton</strong>. I\u2019m not going to be too strict about the structure, but I really want to make the portfolio customizable so I can easily update or expand it later. The idea is to make it flexible enough to publish it later so anyone can use it for their own portfolio too.</p> <p>Later on, I\u2019d like to expand it maybe add a blog, but for now, the goal is to <strong>build a solid version from scratch to deployment</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Tec",
