Once the Strip\u2019s largest urban centre, it now lies flattened by Israeli bombardment. Fletcher said entire neighbourhoods he saw earlier this year have been reduced to rubble and dust. He noted faint signs of life, with markets reopening amid the ruins. His convoy only recently gained access after clearing debris and bodies. Fletcher reflected on the scale of loss, saying numbers can no longer capture the suffering. He lamented that the world failed to act to stop the unfolding horror.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDownload AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n#UnitedNations #OCHA #Palestine #Israel #Gaza #GazaH",

He said UNRWA has 12,000 Palestinian staff in Gaza, over 370 of whom have been killed\u2014an unprecedented toll in UN history. Despite the dangers, staff continue providing health care, sanitation, and education, including online learning for children in shelters. Fowler described Gaza as \u201cthe most dangerous place in the world\u201d for aid workers and journalists. He warned that the current aid levels are \u201cnot even a molecule in a drop in the ocean,\u201d urging a massive scale-up to address hunger, medical, and humanitarian needs, along with clearing rubble and recovering the missing before any recovery can begin.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our",
