And when there are routes with &quot;similar times,&quot; they are always better than the ones the system selected. Since Google is deeply involved with energy companies and the automotive industry, even technologically supporting Israel and the US&#39;s crusade for dominance in the Middle East, and in this era of manipulated and biased algorithms, I honestly no longer trust these apps as a form of smart mobility.

Although the post was taken down, I had most of the info I needed. So I am sharing a few things which are slowly getting annoying. 1) I moved to GrapheneOS last Saturday, its really simple. But tbh it doesn&#39;t feel that simple to use unless you have some knowledge of OS. And I don&#39;t, but using some utube vids I got through. Its too buggy which I can work with but the worst is notifications settings like it notifies after a brief lag. Other stuff too but I may post about it in Graphene support group. 2) Proton is nice, as of now I am on the free one but it works pretty smooth. 3) Changed to Brave and kept DDG as background for app tracking but I think its secretly eating up too much of my battery. 4) Google Takeout is processing my request, I haven&#39;t yet decided which cloud storage to go with yet.
