Right now, Amazon is selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2PY2KTJ/\">solar-powered Reolink 4K wireless security camera for just $109.99</a>, down from its original $149.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reolink Argus PT Ultra is awesome for many reasons. First, it\u2019s fully wireless so you won\u2019t need to worry about network cables, and second, it has a solar panel so you don\u2019t need to wire it up or worry about batteries. Unlike a lot of smart gadgets, this one comes with dual-band Wi-Fi 6, meaning you can connect it to either 2.4GHz or 5GHz networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, you just have to pair it to the app and connect it to your home Wi-Fi network, then get a ladder",
