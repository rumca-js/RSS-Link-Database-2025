Drawing from his experiences as a young oncologist, Mukherjee turns what could have been a clinical document into an eloquent chronicle of humanity\u2019s long, uneasy relationship with the disease.</p> <p>The book begins as a simple medical journal but quickly expands into something monumental, a biography not of a person, but of an illness that has shaped countless lives. Mukherjee traces cancer\u2019s first recorded mention in ancient Egypt to the modern age of chemotherapy and genetic research, connecting each scientific breakthrough with real patient stories. The result is both educational and deeply moving.</p> <p>Mukherjee\u2019s prose is elegant and empathetic. His portraits of patients like Car",

Finished it in a day, staying up late to finish. Every single weird decision he made with the writing style was awful. The non-stop acronyms. The made-up slang. Constantly giving the etymology of this weird slang that nobody has ever or ever will use. The 2 word chapters, and the sentences running from one chapter to another so that chapters ended up looking more like formatting errors than any intentional creative idea (290 chapters in a 300 page book?). Trying to make the three main characters so &#39;cool&#39; that I was cringing regularly throughout. The sudden changes to typewriter-style scripts in the middle of chapters that had no purpose. The chapter that was just a directory of a shopping mall. All of it was terrible. </p> <p>The c",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>From time to time I see the idea that misunderstandings in general are a disreputable crutch for bad plots. They&#39;re a thing of sitcoms, chick flicks, and just low-effort writing in general. Miscommunication is a way for bad writers to set up false conflict while it&#39;s needed for humor or drama, and then they wave it away later. The result: a plot that could have been avoided with one clarification.</p> <p>But is there a counterexample? (I guess I would exclude romance, since there we have things like Much Ado About Nothing.) Is there a more serious book where miscommunication is actually used in a dignified way that holds up?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rdhight\"> /u/rdhight </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ob9m8r/are_there_any_noncomedy_books_where/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ob9m8r/are_there_any_non",
