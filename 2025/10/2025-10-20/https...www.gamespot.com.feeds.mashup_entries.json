As rapid combos transition into powerful Izuna Drops, Guillotine Throws, and charged-up Ultimate Techniques, I deflect and counter incoming attacks, lop off numerous limbs, and spill gallons of blood in the most exhilarating and stylish way imaginable. Co-developed by Team Ninja and Platinum Games, Ninja Gaiden 4 revives the character-action staple by nailing the fundamentals of the series' high-octane combat and then iterating on it in a number of interesting and exciting ways. It feels distinctly like Team Ninja's Ninja Gaiden, but Platinum's DNA is also undeniably present, making for a thrilling sequel that's well worth the decade-long wait.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Set in a near-future Tokyo, the once bustling city now lies deserted, blanketed by a perpetual downpour of miasma caused by the skeletal husk of the Dark D",

With the sequel to its popular hack-and-slash roguelite Hades, Supergiant Games explores the worlds of Greek gods from the perspective of Melinoe, the princess of the Underworld.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As the playable protagonist of Hades 2, Melinoe shows players a new side of life in the Underworld. Unlike her brother Zagreus, the young witch didn\u2019t grow up with her family in the main palace. She instead lives in a ramshackle camp on the outskirts of Hades\u2019 domain. The distance between her and her loved ones is palpable, and her only connection to her family is a single drawing enshrined in Melinoe\u2019s make-shift room.

As a nod to the past, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/\">Halo Infinite</a> is adding the Type-35 Needler from the original Halo.</p><p>In the lore of the franchise, Needlers were a weapon that was developed by the alien Covenant and shoot crystalline shards that can track down their targets. Different Needler models are already in Infinite, but the Type-35 is a more advanced model. Players can add it to their arsenal by buying the final Halo Championship Series weapons bundle, which will be available on October 21.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2nAhxk3cKw\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\">          <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v2nAhxk3cKw\" height=\"100%\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"\" webkitallowfullscreen mozall",
