I have recently added Radarr and Overseerr to my docker arsenal and with the hundreds of existing torrents in my client, as well as the way that Radarr handles media by copying the download files, the torrent client began to struggle and the storage commitment to seed every file indefinitely became too much. I appologize to all those I have failed and salute those of you that continue to support the backbone of this cause. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EternalXMicro\"> /u/EternalXMicro </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1obn20c/ive_reduced_my_seeding_limits/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1obn20c/ive_reduced_my_seedin",
