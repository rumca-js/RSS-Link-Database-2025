I am always in awe in how much difference the understanding of a story it is between the beginning and the end. Like you start a series from the beginning, understand little. Not too sure if that is any good but than you get to the newest book, chapter or episode and just acknowledge the sheer ammount of effort in it. Look at the fanbase that has been cultivated maybe for decades. I habe this with books like Cosmere, Malazan (which i am starting right now), manga like One Piece or online comia/webtoons like TowerofGod or Kubera (the later which I am starting too).

Many fantasy books stick to something resembling medieval fantasy (first law, wheel of time, lord of the rings, lies of locke lamora, name of the wind, lord of the rings, realm of the elderlings) or seem to be inspired by other eras of history (shadow of the gods for example). Apart from being seperate to Earth, they often have relatively similar geography, biology, technology, etc to our world. And while I understand that they do this to reduce the cognitive load on the reader, it can sometimes feel a bit repetitive. </p> <p>On the flip side, I feel like video games are often far more creative with their famtasy worlds. - Silksong with its world inhabited by bugs, lands where the very geography is made of the husks of dead bugs, traversal on the backs of giant bell beasts, architecture built around bells and music and the inhabitants a",

Obviously, Vernon hasn\u2019t lost her ironic sense of humor in this.

Tolkien, The Witcher, A Song of Ice and Fire, and Mistborn but I stopped in the middle of the third book. Oh and I read the first book of Earthsea. Now I&#39;m looking for other fantasy series. Especially things with world-building that comes close to Tolkien&#39;s, although I believe that is quite difficult to achieve. I don&#39;t mind romance, in fact I think it&#39;s a very pleasant extra in any story, but not the main focus, I don&#39;t want there to be romance at the cost of world-building. Other fantasy works that I love but are not novels are the Soulsborne games, and Fantasy manga/anime like Frieren and Berserk. While I love Tolkien, the biggest problem with his world is how it is unfortunately deeply racist and misogynist. But anyway, I&#39;m wondering about where to go next. Also I was wondering if there is a kind of canon of important fantasy works that are worth reading. ",

They start small, build slowly, and eventually explode into continent-spanning conflict. You get deep dives into different societies, ideologies, and magic systems (and the evolution of technology, more so in Apt\u2019s case), and both Jordan and Tchaikovsky clearly love building worlds that feel lived-in and complex.</p> <p>Wheel of Time leans more mythic and archetypal\u2014prophecy, reincarnation, the battle between Light and Shadow. Shadows of the Apt is more grounded in cultural tension, espionage, and the clash between tradition and innovation.

This book is definitely not for everyone and even as someone who loved it, I&#39;m amazed it was as well received as it was. </p> <p>This book is not particularly easy to read, it requires a significant amount of effort to keep up with the world it builds far too clumsily. And oddly it feels like the major climax of the plot is in the middle of the book and the end leaves a trail for a story that does not exist. </p> <p>All that to say, that from a technical standpoint this book lacks a fair bit. However, it made up for that in how well it got me to feel how the characters felt. There were multiple times were I had to stop reading the book not because of how tedious it was but because I needed time to process how I felt. Misaki speaking to Mamoru one final time made me want to go hold my little boy a little tighter. It was also refreshing to see a book go through the post epic battle scenes ",

Told from the POV of a teacher working at an private British school that happens to teach magic along with all of the regular subjects, <em>The Incandescent</em> is an exploration of what it is like to teach teenagers, all while grappling with unresolved issues that originated while the narrator was the same age of the children she teaches. Like all good dark academia, the issue of class is at the forefront of the narrative, and <em>it is just handled so well.</em> Discussing how even universal experiences such as the handling of guilt can change based on your socioeconomic class?

While I&#39;ve read my fair share of fantasy novels, I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;ve read a <em>huge</em> number of them, just the really popular ones. Compared to that, I&#39;ve done significantly more reading in the domain of web-novels and manga.
