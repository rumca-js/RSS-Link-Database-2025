Anyway, they are all free on Amazon now, so I decided to watch the Goldeneyes sequel, which I was convinced I had never seen. </p> <p>That was until I got to the part on the ship where Bond fakes his death (which lasts about 30 seconds), which I always thought was another Bond movie. </p> <p>I really like how goofy the villain in this movie is. His evil plan is one of the more over the top in the franchise. While not being as good as Goldeneye, this one is not bad at all, so I will give it a 7.5/10</p> <p>Edit: I thought I would add more because Cravers&#39; death is really dumb.
