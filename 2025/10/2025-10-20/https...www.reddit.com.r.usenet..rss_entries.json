I&#39;ve had my free account for a few years now. There are some limits: the retention isn&#39;t great; I think I can grab things only if they&#39;re a few months old, if that. And I&#39;ve found that it doesn&#39;t download from more obscure groups, but free is free. Might be good for folks just getting into usenet or those who are in between providers or just grab current stuff.</p> <p>Accounts are here and go fast: <a href=\"https://test.xsnews.com\">https://test.xsnews.com</a></p> <p>Reader: <a href=\"http://test.xsnews.com\">test.xsnews.com</a><br/> Port: 119 (SSL: 563)<br/> Speed: 10 Mbit<br/> Connections: 10<br/> Restrictions: No posting, No account sharing</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ffxfinds\"> /u/ffxfinds </a> <br/>",
