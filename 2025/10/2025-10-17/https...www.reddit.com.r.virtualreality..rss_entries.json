It is better than the Quest 3 in terms of image quality and fidelity. Even super sampling to 4k resolution per eye on the Quest 3 can&#39;t even match the image quality of the Pimax Crystal Light running at native resolution! I have a 5090 too. The colors and the contrast. Damn! Well, Pimax is notorious for their QC, or the lack off. I got the headset with a defective right lens with very noticeable wrapping and distortion. Moving around in a room in No Man&#39;s Sky is like melting. Is that bad. Sim games aren&#39;t that noticeable. Wish me luck because I am not sure how long it would take to sort this out. About to exchange another one at my other Micro Center. My next option is sending a support ticket to Pimax and hoping they can send me another pair of lens..maybe for couple of times over the course of MONTHS. Hahaha",

Im also looking for a solution with outside-in tracking, for games like VTOL-VR, as many of the games I play involve looking behind you while operating controls in front of you. This was my biggest complaint about the reverb, and bordered on being unusable in these games. </p> <p>Budget is not of particular concern, and im willing to use 3rd party controllers, if it means the best experience.

Everything else set to high. Game runs smooth with these settings. Looks good but would definitely like more clarity for everything that&#39;s further away in the background. The obvious answer is supersampling. I can only go up an extra .1 before it begins to stutter.</p> <p>Edit: Problem solved. By default, it was set to use AMD super resolution.
