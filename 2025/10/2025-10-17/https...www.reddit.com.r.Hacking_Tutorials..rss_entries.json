To Get into my building and my studio, i use a card, i think magnetic or nfc (not really sure, but it doesnt have the visible chip like on credit card). So, i need to have it on my phone. I know that i can read the code that is in the card, i already did that, but, is it possible to use it, like using a card with Apple Pay, with my phone, to Get into my house ? I both have android and iPhone if its possible on just one of them. If need more info, just tell me.
