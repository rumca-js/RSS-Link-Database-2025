Not a lot of games live up to their hype but this is one that does. It\u2019s just a lot of fun. The action selection is fun and I love that every card is unique. And at the end of the game, you get to look at a zoo you built. It\u2019s not a surprise it shot up the BGG ranks.</p> <p>If I had small gripe, I wish they would release more Tournament maps. Right now there is only one map that you can play that is not designed for beginners but is generic with no special powers (it came with Map Pack 2). I would love a future Map pack come with a second one of these.</p> <p>We played <strong>Clank Catacombs</strong>. This is one of our perennial \u201cweeknight\u201d games and for me waffles back",
