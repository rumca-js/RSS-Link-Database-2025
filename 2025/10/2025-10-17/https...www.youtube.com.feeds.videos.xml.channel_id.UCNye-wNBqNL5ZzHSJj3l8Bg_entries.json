        "description": "Two years of Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed nearly 68 thousand Palestinians\u2014including 20 thousand children. For now, the bombing campaign has largely halted. But the Israeli military's actions in the past 24 months were livestreamed, documented, and archived in unprecedented detail. In September, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry found that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.  And this week South Africa stated the ceasefire will NOT affect its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. But the ICJ lacks the resources to carry out arrests unless UN member countries decide to act. So, will Israel be held accountable, or will impunity become the new norm?\n\nPresenter - Adrian Finighan \nGuests: \nSawsan Zaher -- Palestinian human rights lawyer\nDr Mads Gilbert -- Researcher and medical doctor who has worked in Palestinian healthcare for more than 30 years\nNeve Gordon -- Professor of International Law at Queen Mary University of London\n\nSubscribe to our c",

With global access, this three-part series examines the real consequences of climate change for our civilisation, through the rest of the 21st century and beyond.\n\nIrish journalist Philip Boucher-Hayes visits climate hotspots, from Greenland\u2019s melting glaciers to sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s weather extremes, from the flooding of agricultural land in Bangladesh to the thaw of the Siberian permafrost. He meets experts and witnesses who explain the interconnectivity of the world\u2019s fragile ecology, as we reach tipping points from which there may be no return.\n\nThe series looks at new climate science and faces the harsh realities of a changing world - collapsing ecosystems, marine die-offs and escalating extreme weather phenomena. But it also explores a positive vision for reimagining economies, landscapes and infrastructure - and practical solutions, ways of mobilising collective resolve, and challenging ",

In fact, when Israeli soldiers were detonating tonnes of explosives to level entire neighbourhoods and communities, there were warnings that this was going to complicate the search for the bodies of Israeli captives, and that\u2019s exactly what you see.\n\nIsrael is also not cooperating with countries that are lending help to possibly look for those remains. Turkiye, for example, was ready to send 81 experts in the retrieval of bodies, and Israel has not allowed it to enter. It has also not allowed it to provide equipment that could possibly facilitate that.\n\nMeanwhile, everybody is ready for the Rafah crossing to open, except Israel.\n\nThe EU monitoring force is ready, the Palestinian Authority",
