        "description": "ACCU Membership: https://tinyurl.com/ydnfkcyn\n---\n\nPuzzling C# - Steve Love - ACCU 2025\n---\n\nC# is a widely used and mature language, but like any useful technology it has it's fair share of complexity and dark corners. New features are added constantly, and C# v13.0 was recently released with .NET v9.0. Each new feature brings the potential for surprises and pitfalls.\n\nThis talk takes a light-hearted look at C# to uncover surprising behaviour, hidden hazards, and even unexpected successes, that can arise from using--or accidentally mis-using--features that many C# programmers take for granted in day-to-day development.\n\nWhether you're an experienced C# developer or are learning C#, these puzzles will expand your understanding of the language and demonstrate how to avoid some its pitfalls.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJoin think-cell as a C++ Developer and work on cutting-edge challenges with a focus on code excellence, innovation, and working alongside an intern",
