You can also focus on specific sections or rows in the venue and set price alerts to notify you when tickets in your desired area meet your threshold. I&#39;m also rolling out forecasts for where prices might go next for any given event based on an ML model trained on all this data (plus a lot of other inputs!).</p> <p>Here are a few examples:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ticketdata.com/events/1357373\">The Eagles at the Sphere on 1",
