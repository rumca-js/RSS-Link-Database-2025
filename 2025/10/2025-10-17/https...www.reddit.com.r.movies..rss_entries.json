I&#39;ll go first (because obviously I&#39;m making this post as an opportunity to share this specific opinion). Striking Distance (1993). I always thought the premise, the ending, the entire plot could have made a really fantastic movie. Rumor is that Bruce Willis got all &quot;Hollywood&quot; and messed a lot of it up, but I think his casting was good. This movie could have been really great. It&#39;s still...entertaining, I guess. But I always feel a little sad about what it could have been.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/headlesssamurai\"> /u/headlesssamurai </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1o9euzh/movies_that_missed_their_potential/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.",

It quickly brought to mind the organ sting at the end of Pirates: Dead Man\u2019s Chest when the kraken starts decimating the ship. Another super powerful moment is the Phantom of the Opera Overture. </p> <p>Basically imo the organ is one of the most powerful stand alone instruments we have, yet it feels criminally under utilized today. </p> <p>So I ask all you movie buffs.
