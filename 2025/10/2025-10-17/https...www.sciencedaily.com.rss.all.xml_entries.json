        "description": "Salk Institute scientists discovered that bile acids in the liver can weaken immune cell function, making immunotherapy less effective against liver cancer. They pinpointed specific bile acids that suppress T cells and found that supplementing with UDCA reversed the effect, controlling tumor growth in mice. Since UDCA is already used for liver disease, it could quickly translate into clinical trials.",

A unique imbalance in potassium isotopes points to remnants of \u201cproto Earth\u201d material that survived the planet\u2019s violent formation. The study suggests the original building blocks of Earth remain hidden beneath its surface, offering a direct glimpse into our planet\u2019s ancient origins.",

        "description": "Researchers discovered how to stabilize a high-performance sodium compound, giving sodium-based solid-state batteries the power and stability they\u2019ve long lacked. The new material conducts ions far more efficiently and supports thicker, energy-dense cathodes. Because it relies on a proven technique, it\u2019s also easier to scale up for real-world use. This could bring safer, cheaper, greener batteries much closer to reality.",
