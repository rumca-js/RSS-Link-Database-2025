Suddenly every show on TV and every product on shelves is laser-targeted at me. Take <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/phantom-white\">Razer\u2019s new \u201cPhantom White\u201d collection</a> of PC gaming gear, for example. It\u2019s leaning hard into the translucent plastic trend of the late 90s\u2026 and, apparently, the mid-2020s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no new devices in this range, but some of Razer\u2019s most popular gaming geegaws now come with soft white shells that glow with the company\u2019s signature RGB lighting. The BlackWidow V4 75% keyboard is probably the star of the show for me, if only because <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2031075/razer-blackwidow-v4-75-review.html\">it\u2019s an excellent keyboard on its own</a>.
