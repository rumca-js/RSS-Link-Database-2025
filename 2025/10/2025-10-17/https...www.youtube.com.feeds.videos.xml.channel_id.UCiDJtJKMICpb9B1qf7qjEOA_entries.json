        "description": "We test out the Scalectronics Inner Light LED controller that we first saw at the Wonderfest scale modelmaking show this year. Using a replica of a Star Trek original series computer prop, we wire up an RGB LED strip and program a simple animation based on the light sequence as seen on the show. Plus, an easy way to make use of fiber optic strands in this compact system. \n\nLearn more about Scalectronics' Inner Light system: https://www.scalectronics.com/\nInner Light controllers: https://www.scalectronics.com/storecontrollers.html\nLED and fiber optic accessories: https://www.scalectronics.com/storergb.html\n\nShot and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested",
