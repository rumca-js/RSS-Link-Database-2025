However, there&#39;s one thing I haven&#39;t been able to do: unlock the &quot;CUSTOM FREE TEAM&quot; that was added, according to the patch official changelog.</p> <p>I tried using different tools to change names, line-ups, team &amp; comp names, etc, and they see the team. Even if I try to transfer a player in-game from that team to any other, &quot;CUSTOM FREE TEAM&quot; shows up as their current club in the search mode, but not anywhere else.</p> <p>I haven&#39;t been able to find an answer for this, nor received any response to an email I sent to the team asking for it, so I figured that maybe someone here could know something about this.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Amat-Victoria-Curam\"> /u/Amat-Victoria-Curam </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1o9e",
