It was a small, simple project I built for myself because I was frustrated with all the ads in existing ones and how most of them didn&#39;t support full playlist conversions. The response I got was completely unexpected from helpful suggestions on improvements, to volunteers offering to help redo the app. I\u2019m so grateful to everyone who downloaded it, gave feedback, or offered help. The app version 1.0.0 reached ~1,200 downloads the thought alone that atleast maybe 50 people \ud83d\ude02 out of those downloads has it on their phone and finds it useful makes me so happy, this update is dedicated to all of you.
