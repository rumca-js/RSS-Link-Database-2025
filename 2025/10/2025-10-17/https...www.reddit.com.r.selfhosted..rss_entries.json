I am trying to have my movie library available for me and my family from anywhere like a streaming service. However, I DO NOT want to break any DMCA laws. They are stupid, I know, but they are here in the US. This means I cannot rip or screen record to make them available digitally. So I thought about using remote desktop, and playing a DVD (from a DVD jukebox) on a Linux server. Then I found out that you can&#39;t legally play DVDs and blue rays on Linux. I&#39;m really stumped. I just want to watch my movies I purchased, from anywhere, but that&#39;s like asking for water on my head and also asking to not get wet. Like I said, any helpful advice would be awesome.

This fund is dedicated to helping deliver, mature and scale new internet commons across the whole technology spectrum and is amongst others funded by the European Commission. The exact sum of the grant still needs to be discussed, but obviously I am very stocked to have been selected in this funding round as one of the few projects that can be selfhosted. It&#39;s also great timing, because the past half year has been very busy both in my private and professional life, but in the coming months I finally have time again to continue improving PdfDing.</p> <p>PdfDing is a selfhosted PDF manager, viewer and editor offering a seamless user experience on multiple devices.

Last weekend, I threw together this minimal setup using PHP and PostgreSQL \u2013 no bloat, no overkill. It uses Tailwind for the frontend (clean and responsive out of the box) and is tuned for Vercel deployment. The cool part? Pair it with Supabase&#39;s free Postgres tier, and you&#39;re live in minutes without touching a database yourself.</p> <p>If you&#39;re curious or want to spin up your own (fork it, tweak it, whatever), here&#39;s the rundown. I kept it stripped down: auto-migrates tables on first run, secure env vars for the DB and admin token, and it handles the basics like analytics if you want &#39;em later.</p> <h3>Quick Local Test</h3> <p>Grab the repo (fork from <a href=\"https://github.com/JanePHPDev/Zu",
