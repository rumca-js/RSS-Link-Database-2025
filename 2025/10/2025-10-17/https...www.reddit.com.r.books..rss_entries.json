One reads about the detailed on-goings in the Roman empire just as one would read about current events in a newspaper. The constant twists and turns in the political and war landscape of Rome keeps you engrossed in this massive 1000 pages book. </p> <p>My biggest takeaway from this book was my understanding of the emotions Roman citizens felt about being Romans. There is pride involved but also the deep feeling of love for their motherland in their souls that ultimately dissolves all lines between the various political factions, and yet it is not able to overcome the sense of superiority patricians and senators have. Metellus Dalmaticus&#39; speech against exporting Roman culture gave me goosebumps.</p> <p>On the other hand, what I didn&#39;t like about the book is how the author dropped the ball on narration of important events in the book.

I&#39;m enjoying it, and I want to read Zero History, so I&#39;m finishing this, but it&#39;s deja vu levels of strange. This happened to me ages ago with a book by James Lee Burke, which convinced me to stop reading his formulaic sand repetitive stories. Gibson isn&#39;t as repetitive or prolific, so this one is on me. I guess it&#39;s a sign of age. I&#39;ve been reading 50-100 books a year for 40 years, since I was 14 or so. So it was bound to happen. I used to keep a list of books I&#39;ve read but lost the file in a PC crash.
