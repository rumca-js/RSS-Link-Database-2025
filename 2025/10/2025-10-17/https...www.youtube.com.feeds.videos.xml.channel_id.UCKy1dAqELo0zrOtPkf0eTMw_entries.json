        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe new Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Z-A is going viral in Japan, but not for any reason you're probably thinking of. A quick mention by an NPC about his Pikachu's bowel movements started trending on social media, and though it was altered for the North American release, it's still one of the few canon mentions of Pok\u00e9mon doing normal real-world things like going to the bathroom. In other news, Sony is pressing ahead with their Horizon: Zero Dawn live-action movie. Sony is now looking for a director and the studio hopes to shoot sometime next year. In related news, Sony filed an injunction against Tencent over the reported Horizon clone, Light of Motiram. That game has been accused by gamers and Sony of being a rip-off of Horizon: Zero Dawn. Motiram is slated for release sometime in 2027.",

You play as Anton Blackwood, described as \"a lowly DVD store owner by day, and a deadly assassin by night.\" \n\nThe developers describe the gameplay in this video as such: The following 3-minute gameplay clip is taken from the Prologue of\u00a0Blackwood. In this sequence, Anton \u2014 a contract killer living a double life \u2014 has just stolen a USB from a mob organization for one of his clients. Things quickly spiral out of control, and we cut ahead to avoid major spoilers. The clip begins as Anton emerges from the sewers beneath New York, only to realize the mob has found him again. Cornered near Grand Army Plaza at night, he\u2019s left with no choice but to fight his way out \u2014 one kill at a time.\"\n\nBlackwood is due out in 2026 for PC. Wishlist it in Steam if you're interested: https://store.steampowered.",

        "description": "Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch. This week Daemon and Ryan are joined by producer Nick Maillet to talk about the ROG Xbox Ally X, which Nick had quite a bit of hands-on time with lately. The handheld PC has just launched, and though it's powerful, the $1000 price tag could be too high of a barrier to entry for most people. But is it worth the price? And who would really benefit from a handheld PC of this caliber? Plus we have last week's poll results and a new poll for you to vote on at IGN.com.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Xbox",

        "description": "Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC, also available on PlayStation and Xbox.\n\nIf I may really channel my inner Toreador, I have a complicated, love-hate relationship with Vampire: The Masquerade \u2013 Bloodlines 2 that feels almost impossible to boil down into a simple thesis statement or, certainly, a single-digit number. At times I want to be alone with it in a moment of passion, and at others I want to strangle the life out of it. Nested within the things that bug me about it are bits that I love, and in the parts I like the most I can detect the subtle whiff of things I loathe. There is a story well worth experiencing that nevertheless let me down brutally in the end. It gets so much right about how it should feel to play as one of the Kindred through every stolen bite and scrappy brawl while completely ignoring certain crucial aspects of it. Did I enjoy it? Certainly. That's an easy yes. Would I recommend it? That's a much more complicated question. T",
