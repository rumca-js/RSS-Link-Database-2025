So I am thinking about offering it for download if I can get constructive feedback on what features are possible bugs there maybe. </p> <p>This app is designed to do everything you need to get data but would like it to have more use cases if I can get constructive feedback on what people would like. The app can work on Mac, Windows and linux. It can work on web but I don&#39;t want to pay for data transfer through AWS for other people as this app can download massive amounts of data at once and I am not charging anything. </p> <p>Also the goal is to have a fully functional app that can do everything you want locally without coding and using your residential ips etc so you don&#39;t have to pay anything. Also so it will be 100% private on yo",

I&#39;m using Camoufox, and in my local machine everything works fine (with my local IP or when using a residential proxy), but as soon as I run the script in a datacenter VM with the same residential proxy, I get detected. Without the proxy, it works for a while, until the VM&#39;s (static) IP address gets flagged. What makes it weird for me is that I can run it locally in a Docker container too (with a residential proxy and everything), but running the same image on the VM also results in detection. Sometimes, I get blocked before any JS is even rendered (the website refuses to respond with the original HTML, returning 403 instead). Has someone gone through this? If so, can you give me any directions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Epherex\"> /u/Epherex </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
