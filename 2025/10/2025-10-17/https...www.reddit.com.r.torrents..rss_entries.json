I believe this guy&#39;s name was nemesis. </p> <p>He put together a Hulk collection. It was amazing, has it had just about every series Hulk had appeared in, and tons and tons of other Hulk comic appearances. </p> <p>I had it, but just recently lost it due to my hard drive coming corrupted, unfixable. Does anyone out there know of a site where this is posted now...or if you have it, could you post it... Or know how to contact nemesis? </p> <p>Thanks in advance..</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/This_Number9390\"> /u/This_Number9390 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1o92k2i/anyone_into_comic_book_torrents/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1o92k2i/anyone_into_comic_book_torrents/",
