My self-imposed goal of filling out every corner and corridor of the map is why it&#39;s taking me so long - even though I can see that a path leads to a dead end, I still follow it. I think I&#39;m close to the final boss now, but because my characters have leveled up so much, I&#39;m thinking of backtracking to the beginning of the dungeon to assign some Ultimate Persona that I couldn&#39;t assign earlier because my characters were too weak.
