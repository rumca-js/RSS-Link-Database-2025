So I started the journey by Duolingo. I can\u2019t say that Duolingo doesn\u2019t help, it helped me a lot. I am still extending my 1067 days streak. But what I missed in it was the fact that it doesn\u2019t explain the real grammar rules behind lessons, so most of the time I was guessing the rule or looking for it in web. I searched for apps with french grammar, I found some but I didn\u2019t like UI / UX. So I decided to build my own app. It took me three months 1-2 hours each day in the late evenings and nights. And it was finally released today :)</p> <p>The link to the app: <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facile-easy-french-grammar/id6752913811\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facile-easy-french-grammar/id6752913811</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://",

Now today when I am actually going to build the app, I suddenly remembered some post on YouTube, showing some downsides of hosting on vercel and next.js over all. I never really cared about those stuff as doing hobby projects with the free tier next js, never really mattered much. Now that I am trying to build something big, I am hesitant to use that. Thinking of using react + node, and other options.</p> <p>Did anybody else face the same problem? What should be an optimal approach?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CodingPheonix\"> /u/CodingPheonix </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1o97s1d/common_dilemma_while_starting_a_new_project/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1o97s1",
