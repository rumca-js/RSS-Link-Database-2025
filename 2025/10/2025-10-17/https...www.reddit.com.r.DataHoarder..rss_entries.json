Can I buy a normal NAS setup, but without attaching it to the network? Will it damage the unit long term, if I just turn it on once a month and then keep it off?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I have a collection of discs that I&#39;d like to backup to storage. CD&#39;s ranging from music to Playstation games. DVD&#39;s from Movies to Xbox to PS2, and BluRay&#39;s that also range from Movies to PS3 games. Is there a drive that can rip all of this data into usable files ? I&#39;ve been reading <a href=\"https://forum.makemkv.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=19634\">this guide</a> to find a bluray drive for modern movies, but is there other drives out there that I may also need if I want to rip a Playstation 1 blackdisc? I used to rip music all the time back when I was younger, but I haven&#39;t used a cd drive in ages. Also if this isn&#39;t really the correct sub for video game dumps could you point me in the right direction?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/butz9000\"> /u/butz9000 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1o8phs3/ripping_discs_from_play",
