For me it also creates this bigger feeling of connection, which is important to me when I listen to music. Here are some of my favorites:</p> <p>Dropkick Murphys Blink 182 Less Than Jake Rancid Reel Big Fish 311</p> <p>As I reflect on my list, I realize that these all fit in the punk/ska genre (311 isn&#39;t too far away), and now I am wondering is it more common to have multiple singers in these genres compared to other genres like traditional pop and rock (ignoring boy bands lol). I can&#39;t recall too many bands with multiple singers that were on the radio or considered super mainstream other than 311 and Blink 182. I am sure there were and I just can&#39;t recall them right now. </p> <p>Anyway, I want to hear other people&#39;s favorite bands with multiple singers, please!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
