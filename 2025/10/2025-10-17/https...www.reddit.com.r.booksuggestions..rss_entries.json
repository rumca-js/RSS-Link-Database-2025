Everyone drew a genre and has to buy a book and then we give it to each other, read, annotate and pass on to the next person, so that eventually everyone will have read three books. We also have to choose books that we haven&#39;t read yet.</p> <p>I got Sci-Fi which is perfect because that&#39;s exactly what I love to read. </p> <p>I&#39;m thinking about buying the last book of the wayfarer series, because it&#39;s the only one of Becky Chambers books I haven&#39;t read yet but I also don&#39;t know how important it is to have read the others first. I know the other three books aren&#39;t connected, or only loosely, but is that also the case with book 4?</p> <p>If you have other suggestions, please let me hear them: I choose Becky, because she is a woman, her books are extremely positive and LGBT+ friendly, and they are kind of calm? If you know what I mean.</p>",

Any religion is welcome, just so long as the book is about the politics and history and NOT trying to convert people to that religion. </p> <p>For example: Christianity was pretty diffuse and there were numerous books that would not get included in the Bible once Constantine validated Christianity to gain more control over his people and through the creation of the Bible selected by people coming primarily from Rome/Greece we see the inclusion of more biblical chapters that reinforce their beliefs at the time. Or that time there were 3 popes and they all excommunicated each other.
