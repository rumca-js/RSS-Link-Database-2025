As such, I am left wondering, why hasn&#39;t it bled to racing games, which are also competitive? Mario Kart toyed with the idea in Mario Kart: double dash, giving racers their own personal items, but then went back on that decision in newer entries. Uniqueness is pretty popular in most genres. I think we can all agree that strategy games with distinct playable factions are cool. Same with fighters, shooters, and even platformers, but for some reason this has not extended to racing game.
