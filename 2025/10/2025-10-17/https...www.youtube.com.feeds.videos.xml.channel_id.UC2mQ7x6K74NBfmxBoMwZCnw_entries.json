        "description": "Want to create a Mordheim warband that feels uniquely yours? Luka from MiniWarGaming walks you through his five-step FORGE method! Watch his custom warband in action in the recent Mordheim Campaign here:\nhttps://www.miniwargaming.com/mordheim \n\nLuka presents a simple process for taking your warband from a name on paper to a living, breathing crew of doomed adventurers in the City of the Damned.  Along the way, he shares how he built his own mercenary band, the Bridge Burners, inspired by the Malazan Book of the Fallen, and what it really means to make a warband with character.\n\nFrom choosing a faction that fits your playstyle to crafting personalities, conversions, and backstories, Luka shows how Mordheim\u2019s real magic lies in the stories your models tell... and the heartbreak that can follow. Whether you are a veteran of the streets or brand new to the cursed city, this is the guide you need to bring your vision to life.\n\nMembers to watch Episode 2, go here\nYouTube Members - https://y",
