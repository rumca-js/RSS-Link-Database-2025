All that remains of us at this point is the last machine we ever built, an artificial mind called the Monad.\n\nOur entire solar system has been turned into a substance called Prima Materia. Every atom in existence has basically been co-opted into a giant computer running the Monad's endless calculations.\n\nBut as the Monad grows in power, the sun itself begins to dim. And this draws the attention of the Coven.\n\nThis celestial sisterhood is tasked with caring for the stars of the firmament, and the sun just so happens to be one of their most precious pearls; they will not allow it to fade without a fight.\n\nUnable to intervene directly, the Coven spins bodies for the human patterns they find lingering in Sargassus space, and sends them on a quest to destroy the Monad.\n\n#ps5 #ps5g",
