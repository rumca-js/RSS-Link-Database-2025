I already tried to use an image from kasm web as a base image but it seems like wsl2 doesn\u2018t have a drm, which is why OpenGl can not talk to the gpu, am I right? The other thing I tried was just using an ubuntu base image and install NoVNC on it, but still no success.</p> <p>Is using Linux the only option to achieve this goal or is there any other way?
