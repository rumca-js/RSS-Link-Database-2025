        "description": "A major row has erupted between the US defense department and the journalists that cover its work after a memo was issued last month requiring journalists to accept a new set of reporting restrictions or face being barred from America\u2019s military headquarters.  \n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s new policy would require journalists to sign an agreement stating they will only publish information \u201cexplicitly authorised\u201d by the defense department. News outlets were nearly unanimous in rejecting the restrictions, prompting a major walkout from the Pentagon as journalists from all but one news organisation handed in their press passes. \n\nThe move reignites the Trump administration\u2019s long-running feud with the press and its freedom to report on the White House. In today\u2019s episode, we look at why the memo has been issued, and implications for freedom of the press and future reporting.   \n\nAnd, we speak to Newsmax\u2019s James Rosen about why his news organisation refused to sign up to the new rule",

Could Washington have given the green light behind the scenes already? Are Ukrainian claims of frontline counteroffensives being exaggerated?
