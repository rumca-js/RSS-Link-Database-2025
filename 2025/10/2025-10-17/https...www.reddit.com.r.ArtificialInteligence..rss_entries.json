It\u2019s not a shock that kids and teens are using these models daily - and sometimes, chatbots have given harmful or manipulative instructions to users.

No chat logs, no spying, no invasion of privacy at all as parents never see what their kid is actually saying. The only goal is to step in when the AI crosses a line.</p> <p>I\u2019d love some honest feedback - and bold opinions on why this idea might suck or totally fail.
