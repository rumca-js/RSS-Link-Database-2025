        "description": "What if the worst ideas turned out to be the most interesting? Mischief-making artist Gabe Whaley shares how he built a collective of artists whose seemingly bad ideas \u2014 like selling 5,000 keys to the same car \u2014 often go viral and sell for thousands of dollars. His playful experiments show why it\u2019s worth leaning into the absurd \u2026 because you never know what might happen.
