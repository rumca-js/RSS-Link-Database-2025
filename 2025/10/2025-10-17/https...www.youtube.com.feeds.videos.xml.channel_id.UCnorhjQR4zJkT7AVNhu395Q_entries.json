        "description": "We tested four of the most popular toilets from Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s, ranging from $99 to $499, to find out which one actually performs best. From flush power and golf ball tests to bowl cleaning and spray coverage, we put each toilet through real-world challenges. If you\u2019re shopping for a new toilet, this toilet comparison and flush test will show you which one is truly worth your money. If you found this video helpful, please subscribe. Hope you enjoy. Cheers!",
