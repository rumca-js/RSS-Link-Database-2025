Captured in 1948, it showcases the streets of Moscow and Leningrad filled with trams, trolleybuses, and bustling crowds, reflecting a nation rebuilding itself with resilience and pride. The film provides a vivid look at Soviet urban life during a pivotal moment in history \u2014 a fascinating window into the atmosphere of a country emerging from the aftermath of World War II.\n\nLeningrad 00:06-06:06\nMoscow 06:07-8:27\n\nVideo Restoration Process:\n\u2714 FPS boosted to 60 frames per second \n\u2714 Image resolution boosted up to HD \n\u2714 Improved video sharpness and brightness \n\u2714 Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)\n\u2714added sound only for the ambiance\n\u2714restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) \n\nPlease, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.\n\nB&W",
