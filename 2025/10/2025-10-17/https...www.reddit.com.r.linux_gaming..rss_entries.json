I am using this <a href=\"https://github.com/EnderIce2/rpc-bridge\">https://github.com/EnderIce2/rpc-bridge</a> to get RPC working. My discord status is updated to the correct thing, but for relevant games, I earn no quest progress, and the games also don&#39;t show up on the &quot;Registered Games&quot; tab in my settings, which I am imagining is connected.

So I checked the launcher source code and found out that the launcher is communication with Steam\u2019s WebSocket API but I couldnt get steam to work. I installed steam in the prefix with winetricks but that wasnt enough and I made a script to launch steam from that prefix and steam updates itself but after that nothing opens. I also checked the logs and couldnt find anything relevant. The furthest I got was steamwebhelper not responding.

This already works with wine but it uses wine instead of proton so a lot of games will have errors in them. For anyone wondering what kind of games, these are just like games on itch.io or gamejolt or anything like that. If there is not a solution, I might try to just create a script I guess that does just that.

Im new to linux, switched over from windows 10 to linux mint about 2 weeks ago, I had so much fun tinkering with everything that I never really tested my proper gaming setup (which is running an hdmi cable to my tv to play steam games on big picture mode from the couch), I only tested just playing on my normal monitor which ran fine, perfectly. until now, when ive finished tinkering, ready to actually play some games, and im realizing that when i setup my tv (tested both as a second and single monitor) it runs terribly, it makes my performance horrible, both in game and out of game. I have pretty good specs, a GTX 4060, Ryzen 5 3600, 16gbs ddr4, etc, etc. Didn&#39;t have a single problem with this setup on windows, Ive tried just about everything I could find to try but nothing has made the tv not slow down my pc. please help out if anyone has any suggestions, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",

Recently been experimenting with Linux distros and settled on CachyOS since I didn&#39;t like that the kernel on Bazzite was immutable. I am using an NVIDIA RTX 5070TI and after following all the instructions on the CachyOS documentation website, everything works flawlessly for the most part.</p> <p>Question regarding Steam and Lutris. Should I stick to using Steam for Steam games and Lutris for anything else? Also, are launch arguments on Steam and Lutris different if you launch from each respective platform? Currently still doing research on how to configure my 5070Ti to be as optimally used as possible (latest DLSS version, enabling Reflex when available, etc).
