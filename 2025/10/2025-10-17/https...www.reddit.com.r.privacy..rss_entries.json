No Firefox account. I wasn&#39;t logged into reddit. On my main network, not the guest network. When I open firefox, it&#39;s default page with a few links and news articles suggests that exact video.</p> <p>There&#39;s zero chance that this is a coincidence so how was it possible? I can&#39;t figure out what the connection could possibly be.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",

I&#39;m trying to investigate ways to make it so that a file can only be accessed after a player has gotten a certain piece of information so as to control progression. The only thing I&#39;ve found so far is the seemingly native ability on Mac and Windows to password-lock a PDF, but I want to be able to restrict access to more types of folders without having to rely on external encryption/decryption tools. Does anyone have any ideas for this? Feel free to get creative! Ideally, this would work across operating systems and not increase overall file size too much. I know this is a weird one!
