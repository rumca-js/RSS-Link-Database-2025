The app lets you create a dedicated Medical ID for emergencies, which you can add directly to your Apple Wallet as a pass.</p> <p>For example, my grandma doesn\u2019t speak a lick of English, but it took about 20 minutes sitting down with her and my mom to fill out her profile, set up her medication reminders, and generate her Medical ID pass.",
