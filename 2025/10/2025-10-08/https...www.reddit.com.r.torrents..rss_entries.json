Its a decent bit larger than the correct file with DV HDR+ of the same episode. How is it so much larger in size? I know the HDR metadata doesn&#39;t take up THAT much space. For example, the DV only file is 6.5GB, while the combined DV HDR+ file is 5.2GB. How does that make sense? Both files are from the same release source, so what&#39;s different? I imagine the bit rate is different, at least. Why boost the DV only file though? Shouldn&#39;t they be able to offer the full bit rate with the DV HDR+ release as well?</p> <p>To my knowledge, most streaming services keep one or tw",

The only thing that fixes it is to shut down the app completely and start it up again. Then it connects.<br/> Incidentally, when it&#39;s having the issue, It sits there happily seeding with lots of peers downloading but a newly added torrent with more than a thousand seeds won&#39;t download (all trackers show not working).<br/> On latest version. Tried re-installing the app and resetting defaults.
