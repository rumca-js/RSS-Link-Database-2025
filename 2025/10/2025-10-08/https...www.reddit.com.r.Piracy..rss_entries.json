Two were for complete torrents of NBC shows (Comcast owns NBC), and the other four were for individual files from an AMC show season torrent. While I&#39;ve learned my lesson and bound my torrent to NordVPN instead of a Killswitch, I&#39;m not sure if the Killswitch and torrent is the exact cause.</p> <p>I had the VPN on at least until midnight as I was monitoring the torrents, and the program didn&#39;t close out like it should if the VPN connection dropped. But the NBC notices were sent out during this period. The AMC notices were staggered from 1AM to 7AM, which I find odd because the torrent completed and was seeding before idinght but they only sent out notices for it after midnight. I would have thought they would send it automatically for the whole torrent (like with the NBC shows) and not for individual files.",

I hate it every time I have to download because it involves so many annoying steps. I found a way to &quot;bypass&quot; this. I found a chrome extension that detects mp4 files and downloads them for you but I thinks it has been patched so I can&#39;t use it anymore. Is there any other way of downloading a couple of movies that is as easy as this and not somehow require 10 different downloads and installations, torrenting and other shit?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EconomistOwn6473\"> /u/EconomistOwn6473 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1o17bkb/downloading_movies/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.",
