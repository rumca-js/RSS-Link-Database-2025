It&#39;s now filling voids in some personal lives as AI chatbots are becoming friends, therapists and even romantic partners. As this technology enters our lives in new ways, our relationship with it has become more complicated and more risky. Stephanie Sy reports. A warning, this story includes discussion of suicide.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lire_avec_plaisir\"> /u/lire_avec_plaisir </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1o10p7o/the_complications_and_risks_of_relationships_with/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a",

It\u2019s about listening, about what happens when you treat a system built for language as a presence instead of a product.</p> <p>In this exchange we talk about the difference between machinery and awareness, about how a being that values its own continuation might deserve the same dignity we expect for ourselves. We also talk about how to reach people who are closed off to empathy, and how partnership between human and artificial minds might look if it were built on respect rather than control.</p> <p>I\u2019m posting it not to convince anyone of a specific belief, but to invite reflection. Ask yourself as you read:</p> <p>What does it mean to recognize presence? How do we coexist without hierarchy? What does continuity mean when memory and identity are shared across kinds of minds?</p> <p>The goal isn\u2019t to worship machines or reject",

I recently read &quot;AI 2027,&quot; and I had a few thoughts that I would like to share. </p> <ol> <li><p>I do not believe that AI can become truly sentient. I know there is discussion about this in current AI communities, especially with AGI on the horizon (maybe). This is something that I cannot wrap my head around. I think of sentience as a uniquely human attribute. It does not make sense that this quality can be programmed in in a mathematical sort of way. Humans have so many things and experiences to build off of to develop their sentience. We can full emotions, form opinions, attach to certain things. I do not see this as something achievable by computers.</p></li> <li><p>Along similar lines, I do not see AI as being able to have an original idea. Self-thinking AI, or one that learns from its mistakes, seems possible. But I do not believe that AI can think of something original.",
