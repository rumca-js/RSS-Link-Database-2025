Here is what happened:</p> <p>While the SSD was mounted, I changed the passphrase using the Gnome-Disks tool and then restarted the machine without unmounting the SSD first.

I&#39;m sure, the passphrase is 100% right, when I type it, and it&#39;s not keyboard layout problem or so, The header itself is intact, probably keyslot is partly broken, as it seems.

I tried updating the firmware through that notification but it keeps repeating and it&#39;s the same damn update everytime. I installed Hollow knight recently through heroic launcher, I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the launcher glitching or the system, but the game crashes everytime just 10-15 mins into the game. I use a low end hp victus laptop, 8gb ram, 512gb storage.
