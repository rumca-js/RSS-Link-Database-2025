        "description": "Ghost of Yotei has managed to take the gaming community by storm with a very solid take on Ezo Island, and an adventure that pushes its protagonist beyond her revenge-fuelled tale of wrath. But can its open world beat one of the genre's most iconic presences to date? \n\nRed Dead Redemption 2 looms large as an open world to end all others, and although it's a last-gen title, it continues to dominate any discourse about how an open world game must be made.\n\nAnd while Horizon Forbidden West is another brilliant addition to the genre, how it measures up against these two heavy weights sets the stage for an interesting comparison between each game's effort to present an experience that's as unforgettable as it is immersive. We dive right into this contest, and try to pick a clear winner from among this trio of titles.",
