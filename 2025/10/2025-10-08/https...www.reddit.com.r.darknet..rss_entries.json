Just trying to figure how to accept payments from goods and services, without accepting cash and without every payment going into my bank account (linked to my name and tax) I&#39;m hoping maybe my customers can pay via a store like shopfiy. But one that I can cash out crypto and one that won&#39;t report back to the Tax office in Australia. If this isn&#39;t possible what other ways can I accept payments without having all of the multiple payments land in my personal bank? I&#39;m needing something fairly easy. Currently they could do crypto. But getting everyone to set up a crypto purchase isn&#39;t easy. So was thinking some way for them to pay via card without much hassle or extensive kyc.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LanguageCold4941\"> /u/LanguageCold4941 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/darknet/comments/1o0wfdr/how_can_i_accep",
