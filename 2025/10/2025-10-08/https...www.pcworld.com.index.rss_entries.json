This time, they\u2019ve come up with another unusual keyboard concept: the Gboard Dial Version (via <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/793136/google-japan-open-source-concept-dial-keyboard-rotary-phone\">The Verge</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new keyboard design, inspired by vintage landline phones, replaces traditional keys with rotary finger discs. Instead of pressing keys for input, you instead insert your finger into a hole and turn the dial until it reaches its stop, after which the movement is registered as a key press. It\u2019s satisfying to use, but it\u2019s hardly fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Gboard \u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3 / Gboard Dial Version\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"\" frameborder=",
