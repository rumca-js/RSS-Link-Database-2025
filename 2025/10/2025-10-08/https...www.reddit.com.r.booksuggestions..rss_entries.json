Every word or sentence adds a complex layer to the masterpiece you\u2019re reading. Idk if that even makes any sense. </p> <p>Please share your recommendations and why!!

I\u2019ve been enjoying series like the half moon hollow series by Molly Harper and the vampire accountant series by drew hayes. Kinda chill no massive plots good humor. I didn\u2019t really care for the sookie stackhouse series it was good but possibly too much violence. Is there any thing fun in the vampire genre nowadays </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AdDry3705\"> /u/AdDry3705 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o19zj6/looking_for_cozy_vampire_books/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o19zj6/looking_for_cozy_vampire_books/\">[comments]</a></span>",

You guys have consistently dropped some of the best recommendations I&#39;ve ever received in my life, so I&#39;m more that ecstatic to see what y&#39;all got to recommend me! I would define good writing as concise. I love novels that don&#39;t have a single letter out of place. Books like East of Eden by John Steinbeck or Angle of Repose by Wallace Stegner. I also love books that have deep, philosophical themes that you can meditate on for months, even years after you finished reading them. So for example I really love rhe symbolism and themes of books like The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishoguro, Beloved by Toni Morrison, and Gravity&#39;s Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon. I also have a slight preference for sci-fi written by actual scientists so stuff like Contact by Carl Sagan (my favorite sci-fi novel of all time) or Rainbows End by Vernor Vinge.

Or someone who had things but lost them all due to bankruptcy or their family getting murdered or some other shocking things like losing their limbs in a horrific car crash, and they basically in hell and there is no immediate solution to get out of their situation. So whether due to one huge trauma or a series of bad things happening to them, they have become hopeless. And they are struggling.</p> <p>The kind of book that is true and genuine and doesn&#39;t offer some simplistic or mindless optimism but shows that person still finding a way out? Perhaps memoirs or biographies or maybe fiction based on true events. Not looking for any books that sugarcoat reality and force a happy ending but ones that show true struggles. Thank",
