(I can use if there is no other method)</p> <p>There is a website which is protected by datadome, doesn&#39;t allow scraping at all, even blocks the requests sent to it&#39;s API even with proper auth tokens, cookies and headers. </p> <p>Of course, if there are 50k requests we have to send in a day, we can&#39;t use browser automation at all and I guess that will make our scraper more detectable.</p> <p>What would be your stack for scraping such a website?</p> <p>Hoping for the best solution in the comments.</p> <p>Thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/abdullah-shaheer\"> /u/abdullah-shaheer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1o1i9zr/datadome_protected_website_scraping/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:",

The way that claude AI portraits the code very well and structured. Mostly i develop the core feature tool and automation end to end. Kind of crazy. Just wondering this will land any professional jobs in the market? If normal people able to achieve their dreams from coding then it would be the disaster for corporates because they might lose large number of clients.
