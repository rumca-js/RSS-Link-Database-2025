Stay fully informed on events around the world with Ground News.\n\nOver the past few decades, the idea that gravity is not a fundamental interaction but is instead caused by the increase of entropy has become increasingly popular in the world of physics. Today, we have a paper from a group of physicists who claim that entropic gravity might be the result of space being full of qubits. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/y7sy-3by1\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://o",
