I was thinking about acquiring a refurbished Pixel mobile phone in order to install GrapheneOS. The thing is that the Pixel 7 Pro is available at 307\u20ac and Pixel 8 at 340\u20ac, so my question is which option is the best regarding price/quality and whether the device is suitable and would run properly.

We&#39;ll go from easy to hard.</p> <p>DONE / MOSTLY DONE</p> <p><strong>Email:</strong> it all started last year with creating a ProtonMail account and hosting it on a domain that I own. Transitioning from my gmail.com address to the new one is a serious endeavor - I have almost 600 accounts across various services, most tied to the gmail address. So the switch becomes a multi-year process of triaging old accounts, closing the ones I no longer want, updating the rest to point to the custom domain. I&#39;ve made huge progress; I have about 200 accounts left to transition / close, most of which probably don&#39;t matter enough to bother with. I&#39;ve deleted all mail from the Gmail account, and now it just forwards to my proton address. Eventually once traffic to that address has been mostly eliminated, I should be able to delete it.</p> <p><strong>Shared Drives:</str",
