There may be opportunities in private companies, but I don&#39;t think there are many, and it&#39;s not easy to get in. I decided to take this up a couple of months ago, I know the basic terminology, what tools are used, and I have basic Linux management skills.

It&#39;s not enough to just learn ready-made commands and tools for scanning, reconnaissance, and basic methods of hacking and privilege escalation.

We like the product, and it tends to work well, but it&#39;s challenging to justify these significant price increases.

It inspired me to try it myself and see how practical it would be to implement a truly passwordless solution.</p> <p>So, I put together a detailed, hands-on guide based on my experiment.

Deal with escalations and other fires blah blah....routine as usual.</p> <p>I wanted to start looking into some AI usecases. Me and my manager came up with some ideas and presented to internal AI team. Asked access to the poc they are working and got a pushback indirectly saying they cannot let us do anything with the poc available and they are building.</p> <p>I got a feeling it&#39;s dog eat dog situation and no one will give us chance to innovate anything. I got promoted beginning of this year but due to shortage of staff and hiring freeze, I&#39;m still doing my previous job duties + manager.</p> <p>How is everyone in SOC field feeling about AI? My imposter syndrome is getting worse. I looking for some help / guidance with getting started in AI, upskilling and slowly look into moving out of SOC and do some Cloud, AI &amp; IAM related work.</p> </di",

Then some AI and automation stuff came along and I started thinking, this can&#39;t automate me out of a job but it can make my impact bigger or help me get rid of some of the more annoying repetitive tasks. Now I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s not just going to replace most of us. Not to say that replacing certain humans won&#39;t be a terrible idea, it certainly will be. But corporations will still do it and do dumb stuff like that all the time.
