Experiments with replicas and 3D models revealed design features like a forward lean and curved bases that made movement possible. Concave roads across the island further supported this transport method. The findings celebrate the innovation and intelligence of the ancient islanders.",

Scientists found that for the first time, fire-driven degradation, not deforestation, was the main source of carbon emissions, signaling a dangerous shift in the rainforest\u2019s decline. Using advanced satellite systems and rigorous simulations, researchers uncovered vast damage across Brazil and Bolivia, exposing the fragility of the Amazon\u2019s ecosystems.",

These reversals amplify the metal\u2019s electrical asymmetry, creating a diode-like effect up to 100 times stronger than expected. The team\u2019s theoretical explanation finally clarifies a mysterious phenomenon first observed in 2020, revealing that quantum geometry and spontaneous symmetry breaking are key to this strange behavior.",
