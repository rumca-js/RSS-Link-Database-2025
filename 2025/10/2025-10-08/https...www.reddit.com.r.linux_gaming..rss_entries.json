Now I&#39;m not sure what the problem is, but when I manually mount the drives, I go to steam, I set my directory and I launch my game. It works seamlessly and all is fine.</p> <p>But for some damn reason when I try to automount it in fstab it refuses to launch any game. It recognizes them, I go press play and it looks like it&#39;s starting. The green &quot;Play&quot; turns into a blue &quot;Stop&quot;, but then a few seconds later it turns back into a green &quot;Play&quot; and nothing happens.</p> <p>I tried messing with which folder the drives go into and all sorts of stuff and nothing is working.</p> <p>In my fstab folder I have: <code>UUID:TheUuidStuff /media/P1-Drive ntfs defaults",

I have an ASUS TUF Gaming A15 FA507NV Ryzen 7 7735HS, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 8GB 2 SSDs (500GB and 1TB), 16 GB ram I use it to play some games (Minecraft, civilization VI, baldur&#39;s gate, some friendlop games) and also for programming (Unity, C, Java), taking notes at university and spending time on discord with friends.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been looking around a bit and I&#39;m thinking about using either catchy OS or Nobara, which one of these (or any other) would you suggest?</p> <p>Will I have some problems with Nvidia drivers / using unity / anything else? Is there a armorycrate/ g-hub version for Linux? Does discord work at all? Can I easily screen share?</p> <p>Thank you so much!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",

For reference, my specs are as below:</p> <p>CPU: i5 11400f GPU: 5070ti RAM: 24GB Distros: Fedora 42</p> <p>Now Ik that the CPU is obv a heavy bottleneck factor but I dont think the CPU itself is so bad to the point where shader compilation would take almost an hour, no? Specially since for some of my friends and others, it seems to take only about a minute. Anyone have any idea what might be happening and if theres any fix? Thanks.</p> </div",
