        "description": "<p>This article delves into the critical innovation race in passive components, particularly capacitors, driven by the widespread adoption of third-generation semiconductors (SiC &#038; GaN). As these power devices operate at higher frequencies, temperatures, and power densities, traditional capacitors face severe challenges in size, reliability, and performance. Through five collaborative case studies with industry leaders like Infineon and onsemi, Yongming Electronics demonstrates how systemic innovation in materials and structure is providing the matching, reliable capacitor solutions essential for enabling next-generation power electronics in AI servers, EVs, and more.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.eetimes.com/five-innovative-practices-for-capacitors-in-the-era-of-third-generation-semiconductors/\">Five Innovative Practices for Capacitors in the Era of Third-Generation Semiconductors\u00a0</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.eetimes.com\">EE Times</a>.</p>",
