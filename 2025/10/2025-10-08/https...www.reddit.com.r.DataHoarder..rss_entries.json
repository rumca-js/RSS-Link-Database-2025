For backups I have a computer on my home network that has 4 to 8tb drives on it, and Ive thus far been backing it up alphabetically, ie A-D on a drive, E-H, I-M, N-Q, etc. Asustor&#39;s native backup system doesnt have the ability to logically separate drive to drive or separate alphabetically (as far as I can see), so what Im thinking so far is to create folders on my NAS that match the drives and have each folder backup to a drive, but that will mean Ill need to remove-reload my Sonarr, and Im not sure how it would work for new shows, unless I manually moved those, which Im okay doing if thats the best way, but Im wondering what others do, if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions.</p> <p>If anyone is aware of a backup program ",

Drive was packaged poorly, just in one of those inflatable cushions, but the sides were deflated so it was basically touching the outside box... I&#39;m in Europe so this is fairly standard practice unfortunately (only once in like half a dozen times ordering HDDs have I received proper packaging), but regardless I had a bad feeling from the start.</p> <p>Plug it in, starts making an audible almost light scratching noise? Sounds like it&#39;s trying to spin up, but it can&#39;t get to speed, so it retries a dozen times and goes silent eventually. It was recognized as a generic drive in BIOS initially, but after the second try I can&#39;t even get that.</p> <p>I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s is done for right?

I want to set up a server to hold them, and use their contents (read/write) from another computer or mobile, via Wi-Fi. And I want the whole setup small enough to fit on my desk (not a large one). Moving everything to a single storage media is not an option at the moment.</p> <p>My first idea was something like a mini-PC with a few USB hubs, in a &quot;christmas tree&quot; arrangement of media plugged to them.</p> <p>Does anyone has a better (or smaller, or cheaper) idea than mine? What software I would need to make the files available (and editable) through a Wi-Fi network? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jcastroarnaud\"> /u/jcastroarnaud </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1o0wqhq/how_to_diy_a_small_server_for_my_files/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Dat",
