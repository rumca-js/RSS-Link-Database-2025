Focusing on individual artists and on various artists\u2019 groups, it attempts a history of movements and of alliances in a country that has been both factionalised and divided by language and belief, religious and ethnic divisions, by the traumas of colonisation and of civil war. The sweep of Nigerian history, even over the past century or so, is too big and too complicated to be charted through the lens of the country\u2019s art. What can modernism possibly mean here, especially from our position at the end of the first quarter of the 21st century?</p><p>European-style academic por",

We\u2019d kick through piles of leaves to find them, then bring them home to score and roast on the fire. I remember always burning my fingers as I tried to peel them, yet still I went back for more. To me, autumn is all about earthy flavours and a comforting sense of nostalgia. It also marks a new chapter in the kitchen, because the start of any new season is the most exciting time in a restaurant, when we get a whole new set of ingredients to work with. Today\u2019s two first courses draw on those earthy, autumnal qualities, and work just as well for a light lunch as they do for a relaxed starter, with plenty of room for manoeuvre depending on how hungry you and your guests are.</p> <a href=\"https://www.",
