First of all, it needs to be a zombie game. Second, it needs to be something that is extremely simple (like FNAF security breach, which you don&#39;t need to walk or press anything other than the triggers), because a bunch of kids are going to play for ~5 minutes each. It could be as simple as a 3d video which you can&#39;t really do anything but wait for a monster to get you. The idea is just scare them off a little, not really play a game.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CarossoDeSaco\"> /u/CarossoDeSaco </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1o1hi4f/need_stationary_horror_games_to_scare_kids_during/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1o1hi4f/need_stationary_horror_games_to_",

I finally bought a PC converter and I&#39;m going to play some Steam VR. I WAS thinking about getting a Quest 3 but when I compared screenshots of games like 7th Guest VR and Red Matter 2 to the Steam version. I just thought, it looks too much better to invest in the Meta versions.</p> <p>So for now I just bought a few VR games that are not on PSVR2 but are on Steam. But I still kinda want a Quest 3 some day. Just because of the convenience and novelty of wire free gameplay. Maybe I&#39;ll just have lesser demanding games on that, like Walkabout Golf, and some quest exclusives. But keep PSVR2 and play the more graphically advanced games on PCVR or PSVR2.</p> <p>And this point, maybe I should just wait a couple years to see what a Quest 4 might look like. So do you have more than one headset for different eco systems, or all PCVR headsets?</p> </div><!",

It won&#39;t even attempt it, simply flashing a &quot;Unable to connect please try again&quot; message, and no matter how many times I open and close the apps on both my headset and my pc, it doesn&#39;t work, even when I have the vpn disabled and the app fully closed. Anyone have any experience with this and know how to fix it? I&#39;ve been pulling my hair out trying to look up how to solve it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/prototype1029\"> /u/prototype1029 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1o10xlg/virtual_desktop_doesnt_work_with_vpn/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtua",
