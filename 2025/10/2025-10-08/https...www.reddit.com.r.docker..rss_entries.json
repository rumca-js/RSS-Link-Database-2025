However, since the docker-vol pool is configured to use the HDDs in my cluster, it is lacking a bit of performance. I do have SSDs as well in my cluster but the storage is limited and I&#39;m using it for databases, Ceph MDS, etc. - but now I want to use it also for more performance demanding use-cases like storing immich-thumbs, etc.</p> <p>The problem with the plugins is that the docker-swarm ecosystem is practically dead, there is no real development put into volume drivers such as this anymore and it took me some time/effort to find something which worked. Unfortunately, this wetopi/rbd plugin can only be configured with one underlying ceph pool. <strong>The question:</strong> can I use",

I use docker and a gui application called OrbStack which is a Native Macos Docker-Desktop alternative, I wanted to ask the developers how do you guys manage your dev enviroment, to make sure performance, cleanliness of the host system, compatibitly, and isolation are in check for your development workflows. I actaully wanted to know if you guys prefer like a Ubuntu Docker Container (because arm containers are very fast) or a Virtual Machine specifically for development inside OrbStack (since it suppo",
