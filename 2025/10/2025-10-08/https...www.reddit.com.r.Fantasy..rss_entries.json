The way Cook drops you into the black company, a mercenary outfit filled with vile, selfish men is reminiscent of my time with the Bonehunters and the men of the north. The world of the black company is also a bleak one and one positive trait I can give to this book is the vibe that Cook creates because it\u2019s really good, and if it were more refined I think I\u2019d have really enjoyed myself. And that\u2019s really the thing for me with this first black company book, there are so many things about this I should love because it\u2019s the exact kind of story I enjoy, and yet I just couldn\u2019t get myself there because it l",
