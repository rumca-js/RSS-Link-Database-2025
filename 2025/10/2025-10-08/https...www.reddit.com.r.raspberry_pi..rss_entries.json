I have a project in mind to get into Raspberry Pi. Many years ago, I was casually training with an air rifle from 10 meters, and I wanted to train again. The problem is that there is no place for me to train outside with a real air rifle, and laser guns are <em>so expensive</em>. So I thought, is it possible to make a precise laser rifle to work in-house at 10 meters, no more? In my noob mind, it would work like this: I would create a rifle with a 3d printer that would only send a laser, and I would build a custom laser target that would somehow intercept this laser, map it to score, and then print/store the result to the screen.</p> <p>Is it even feasible to have a laser that accurate? If yes, then could you please recommend a starting kit with a book? And which Raspberry Pi/pico should I use? I want to learn the fundamentals during this ",
