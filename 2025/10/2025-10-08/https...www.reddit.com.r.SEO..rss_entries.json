I want to keep it open and free for guest posters and hopefully rely on that to provide content (leveraging the \u201cvanity\u201d of DR52 backlinks for everyone). My goal is to eventually attract paid sponsors. I know it\u2019ll take some time and I have to build up traffic and content (will rely on my network and self for some content initially). I grabbed the domain not expecting any quick magic , but as a good foundation to build off of (and it was free). Has anyone else here been started off in a similar situation? Any advice and tips on how to spread the word to help jump-start this thing would be appreciated. I&#39;ve kinda fallen down a rabbit-hole with this thing",
