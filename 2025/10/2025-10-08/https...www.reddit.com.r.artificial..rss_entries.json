It powers the apps we use, drives cars on real roads, and even writes articles like this one. With such power comes responsibility. As AI becomes more capable, questions about <strong>ethics</strong> become harder to ignore.</p> <p>How should we balance progress with fairness? Who is accountable when AI makes a mistake?
