They attack the roots of plants, causing them to wilt and eventually die. It is estimated that crops worth nearly USD 173 billion are lost every year due to RKN infestations. While chemical pesticides are effective in controlling RKNs, they also kill other microorganisms that are beneficial to plants, thereby reducing soil fertility. New, less toxic control methods are needed to prevent the loss of crops and soil fertility to RKNs.",

Their dense and rich fecal pellets sink rapidly, transporting carbon from surface waters to the deep ocean. In a new study published in the journal Biology Letters, scientists have discovered another way these crustaceans keep carbon locked away from the atmosphere\u2014by ejecting carbon-rich masses of rejected food, called food boluses, that also plummet to the ocean depths.",
