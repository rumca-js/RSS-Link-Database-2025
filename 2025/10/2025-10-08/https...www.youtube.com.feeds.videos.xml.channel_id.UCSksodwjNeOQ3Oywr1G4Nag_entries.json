So after spending another 45 minutes picking them all up by hand, I had a better idea. Inspired by a driving range picker, the wheels snag the marbles, and the little combs kick them out into the basket.  At the very least I can save my back a bit while I contemplate my future project choices.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nStay tuned for this project, its one of my favorite ones so far!\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n#engineering #invention #mechanicalengineering #3dprinting",
