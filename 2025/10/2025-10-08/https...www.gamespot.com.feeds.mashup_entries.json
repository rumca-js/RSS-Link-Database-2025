        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">While waiting for <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares-iii/\">Little Nightmares 3</a> to arrive, I went back and replayed the first two games, and I was reminded just how much creepier the first one is than its sequel. The Janitor, with his sinisterly stretched arms that could seemingly reach the silent protagonist, Six, wherever she hid, was the stuff of children's night terrors. The chefs, with their unsettling fleshy masks, taunted me with the truth that was veiled behind them. It's a reveal the game never offers, leaving my imagination to run wild. The second game was still one I enjoyed very much, but it felt like Tarsier Studios had toned down some of the grotesque, haunting displays in the sequel. It failed to create memorable villains on par with the original. Little Nightmares 3 changes hands to the horror veterans at Supermassive Games, and though the addition of co-op is a great fit, it feels similarly sanitized and overly familiar at times.",
