There&#39;s about 20 weeks of school so I need 20 assignments and I currently have 10. I was hoping someone might be able to think of some major innovations or failures that have happened and might have corresponding video&#39;s from YouTube that they could watch to learn about. </p> <p>Typically, the students have to answer 5-7 questions about the video, but then there&#39;s about 5 questions where they have to answer opinion/discussion questions and use information from the videos to justify their stance.</p> <p>I been poking around YouTube a lot and I&#39;ve looked through mostly GamingHistorian ",

Guess what game this is? The imagery is a mix of my 2 favorite games during those days. 1 was released in 1993 on the PC Engine, the other on PS1 in, was it 1998? Can&#39;t remember. </p> <p>Had some of the best fun. Really cool enemies and stages and amazing music. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bigbun85\"> /u/bigbun85 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o11u9l\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/com",
