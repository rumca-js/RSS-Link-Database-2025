So, sorry if this isn\u2019t super coherent or even enjoyable to read. And also, fuck you. I can do what I want. </p> <p>I thoroughly enjoyed The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu. This is my first ever sci-fi book. I had just read The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, and after being in that post-book stupor, I decided that I needed to read something a bit more exciting. After reading some reviews, with positive reviews saying that it is the best book they\u2019ve read and negative reviews saying that the book is misogynistic, I dived into the book and read it over the course of 2-3 weeks. Since this book is sorta a slow burn, I was skeptical at first. The first couple pages of world building felt hard to piece together, but as the story progressed and characters were developed, I was hooked. </p> <p>If I had to sum up what I liked about this boo",

I\u2019ll come across an article or a \u201cmust-read books\u201d list and realize I\u2019ve barely read 5-10% of them. It&#39;s quite humbling to realize I&#39;ve read such a tiny part of what&#39;s out there. Though I guess the bright side is, I won&#39;t be running out of books to discover and explore anytime soon \ud83d\ude05</p> <p>(EDIT: To those who asked, I read mostly modern - post 1950s/60s - literary fiction and the occasional horror/thriller. I&#39;m not very well versed in the classics so that&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t tick many in all those must read books lists.
