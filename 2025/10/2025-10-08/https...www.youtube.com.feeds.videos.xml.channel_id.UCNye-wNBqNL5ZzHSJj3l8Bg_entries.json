He\u2019s not on board with a Trump plan. Let there be no misunderstanding,\u201d Pinkas told Al Jazeera.\nHe said Netanyahu had only agreed to the talks after being \u201ccornered and pressured by President Trump\u201d.\nPinkas speculated that Netanyahu views the release of Israeli captives as a short-term win to gain goodwill but believes reigniting the conflict could help preserve his governing coalition.\n\u201cHe has a vested interest in this not succeeding,\u201d Pinkas said.\nThe former diplomat added that Netanyahu is likely \u201cbanking on Mr Trump losing patience and disengaging\u201d before the plan moves to later stages involving an Israeli withdrawal or the future governance of Gaza.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter",

He does not follow through with agreements. He does not believe in peace and does not believe in a Palestinian state,\u201d Hayajneh told Al Jazeera.\nHayajneh says it is necessary to ensure the US shows a commitment to using its leverage over Netanyahu; otherwise, Hamas will likely not accept the deal.\n\u201cThey know from past experience that they will agree to something, they will return the hostages, there will be an exchange or swap of the captives, but after that, Netanyahu will find any excuse,\u201d Hayajneh said.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.",

        "description": "Families of Israeli captives being held in Gaza are marking two years of war by holding rallies and memorials in Tel Aviv. \nThey're urging their government to accept the ceasefire deal with Hamas and help release their relatives. \nThey've criticised Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the war. \n\nThe fate of the Israeli captives has become one of the most divisive issues in Israel, sparking mass protests since the war began.\nOn October 7, Hamas and its allied fighters captured 251 Israelis and foreign nationals during their attack. \nSince then, 203 captives have been returned to Israel - some through negotiated exchanges, others in military rescue operations.\nAn estimated 48 captives remain in Gaza now. Israeli officials believe only about 20 are alive.\n\nDaniel Levy is president of the US-Middle East Project and a former Israeli negotiator. He says Israelis are turning a blind eye to their government's actions in Gaza.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFo",
