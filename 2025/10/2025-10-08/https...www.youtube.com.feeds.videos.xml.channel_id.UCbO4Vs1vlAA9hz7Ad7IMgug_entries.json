        "description": "We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Forty-One! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\n\nScott Hadly is an all-around game designer with his own take on the Mech Genre! Sculpting his own Diesel-Punk mechs with the support of Patreon and his Tribe on MyMiniFactory, he's crowdfunding the last push to make his fully digital game fully flesh-out. Set on kitchen-table sized boards teams of 3-9 'Rigs' battling it out in a post-Smogfall world, Of Oil & Iron slides into that narrow niche of Diesel-Fueled genre with a bit of crunch. Let's dive in!\n\nCheck out the website in  HERE: https://www.ofoilandiron.com/\n\nSTLS available on MMF HERE: https://www.myminifactory.com/users/Scoutsifer\n\nCheck out the crowdfund HERE: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ofoilandiron/of-oil-and-iron",
