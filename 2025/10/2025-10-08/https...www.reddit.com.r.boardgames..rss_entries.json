Played with 4 total players, we have won 1 out of 4 attempts (And in the win we literally forgot that Boromir can&#39;t trade rings, which he did at the very last moment to get the win). It feels like trading cards is crucial, but trading is very restrictive, and getting 2 cards at the end of your turn just feels also very limiting. Last game our Frodo player spent the entire game not moving because he never drew stealth cards, drew very very few rings, had the Merri and Pippin quest so needed to travel M&amp;P all over the map just to trade for the cards he needed to travel back to the places to spend them... It just has felt incredibly punishing every game.</p> <p>I am familiar with Pandemic, I love a lot of the mechanics in play, but the pressure feels absolutely relentless. In our first game we were knocked down to 1 hope before we even made it one round around the table due to all the bad cards robbed us of hope si",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi yall. I played this game in 1994, but it looked older, maybe even early 80s. It had a disc in the middle that you would wind up to make it spin around. There were blue and red pegs sticking out of the disc. There was a blue and a red hammer on each side of the disc that were controlled with a button. You pressed the button and your hammer would swing down at the pegs as they spun around and you had to hit the corresponding peg color. I don&#39;t remember the name or the company that made it. I had never seen it before then and haven&#39;t since.
