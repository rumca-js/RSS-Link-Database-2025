So let\u2019s take a look at everything that\u2019s changed with these models. Starting with iPhone 17. Which comes in five colors: lavender, sage green, mist blue, white, and black. While I think these shades look nicer than last year, I expect many people to be disappointed with no pink option. Which we had with not only iPhone 16, but also the 15.",
