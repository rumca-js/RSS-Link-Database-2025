Get your free assessment and find the best option for you at https://PDSDebt.com/shapiro. \n\nJoin Ben in the studio for an incredible conversation on what it means to balance faith and reason. Matt Fradd is a Catholic apologist and the host of the popular podcast, \"Pints with Aquinas.\" Fradd is an eloquent defender of the Catholic faith and a champion of civil discourse around even the most contentious topics, from cultural analysis to religious philosophy. In this flashback episode, we dissect ideas like toxic skepticism, the West\u2019s normalization of sin, what it means to be \u201cfree\u201d and compare the ritual similarities between Catholicism and Judaism.
