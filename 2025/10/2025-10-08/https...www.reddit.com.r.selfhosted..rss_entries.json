But is it actually possible to fully cut out third-party platforms and still function day-to-day?</p> <p>Like, could someone in 2025 really host everything email, cloud sync, password management, calendar, messaging, identity logins without relying on Google, Apple, or Microsoft for anything? I get that privacy-wise it\u2019s ideal, but I imagine the maintenance alone could eat your life if you\u2019re not careful. I\u2019ve seen setups using Nextcloud, Bitwarden_RS, Matrix, Immich, Pi-hole, and a self-hosted VPN stack, which already covers a lot. But there are always those dependencies that sneak in: push notifications, mobile app integrations, payment processors, and domain renewals that tie you back to big providers.</p> <p>So I\u2019m curious how \u201coff-gr",
