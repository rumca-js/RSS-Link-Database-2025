What really struck me this time around is how the theme of guilt gradually builds as the protagonist\u2019s crime starts to weigh on him, and how this internal conflict is eventually the driving force for his journey towards redemption.</p> <p>I\u2019ve noticed that Raskolnikov, in his isolation, begins to rationalize his actions, convinced that he is above the moral law, but as the novel progresses, this sense of superiority fades, and he finds himself increasingly tormented by his conscience. What I find fascinating is how Dostoevsky uses characters like Sonia and Porfiry to help push Raskolnikov into facing his own guilt, even though he doesn\u2019t directly engage with them in a way that could be considered \u201credemptive\u201d in the traditional sense.</p> <p>Do you think Dostoevsky is trying to suggest that redemption comes onl",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Sorry if this is getting too personal for this sub. When i was a kid, i read a lot. Mostly fantasy. Harry Potter and some other YA mostly. Later asoiaf.</p> <p>Then around 14, i quit reading and just were a teenager for a while. I picked it back up at 20, reading Mistborn because i heard about it on youtube. I really liked it and read the rest of the trilogy, Emperor&#39;s soul, Stormlight archive (fell in love with the first 2 books), then read on and died in Rhythm of War, while my adult brain suddenly changed my mind about fantasy and in general, literature and art. I started reading different books.</p> <p>My favourite authors now, a couple years later, are Vonnegut (No 1), Huxley, Le Guin, McCarthy, Melville, Morrison, Dostoevsky and Alejandro Zambra. I now have somewhat of a dislike of fantasy and the books i read when i was younger.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Anice_king\"> /u/Anice_king",

This is one is a fix up of his titled &quot;My Name is Legion&quot;.</p> <p>The three stories that are in this one revolve the exploits of a man who destroyed his punch cards and changed his face. He has no credit card, no birth certificate or even a passport for him in the international data bank.</p> <p>And he has had many names. His job consists of taking ultra high risks for a massive global detective agency. His assignments are very lucrative, extremely vital and also very deadly. And his life is, more often than not, a virtual hell.</p> <p>&quot;My Name is Legion&quot; is very fast paced and full of action. Zelazny really took some cues from the noir and crime fiction of the pulp era and mixed it in with his brand of SF, and it really shows. Despite how fast the stories go there are some introspective moments where he touches on certain topics such as the environment.</p> <p>It&#39;s",

Would love to start a discussion here.</p> <p>As the book inched closer and closer and 2020, I was wondering if COVID was going to be mentioned because it did have such an impact on prisons. When I thought Corby was getting out in February, I was so relieved he\u2019d be home before things got bad. That ending shook me to my core. I should not have read before bed because I was too emotional to sleep afterwards. </p> <p>The fact that I live in Connecticut I think made me feel even more connected to this book. I just kept thinking if I was Emily, what would I do in such a terrible situation? There\u2019s no right answers. Would I have brought Maisie to the prison? Would I have filed for divorce? Would I ignore phone calls from the prison? Would I ever be able to find forgiveness? </p> <p>This book definitely had me crying real tears and will be sitting with me for awhile.</p> <",
