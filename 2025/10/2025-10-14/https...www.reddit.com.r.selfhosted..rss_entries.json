Still, I\u2019d appreciate recommendations for VPS services that are trustworthy, perform well, and are suitable for running a full business setup.</p> <p>If anyone has suggestions or experiences with reliable VPS providers that meet these needs, I\u2019d love to hear them.

If I were to lose everything in my home, I&#39;d only have access to my offsite cloud backup. In order to restore that backup, I&#39;d need the password to my cloud service, I&#39;d need to be able to get the 2fa for that service, and I&#39;d need the password to decrypt the backup. I probably wouldn&#39;t be able to come up with multiple strong passwords that I could remember, especially if I rarely used them. So what do you all do? Do you print out these necessary passwords and store them offsite? Store them in an online password manager? Make a separate keypass file just for these and store that offsite/in the cloud?

This would save us a lot of hassle from self-hosting, but it is barring people from participating because of the ritual involved in manually cloning the repo (or navigating the GitHub interface), edit, commit, open PR, wait for review, and whatnot. (cloning the repo and editing locally is often needed because we don&#39;t have an automated preview CI pipeline).</p> <p>So we are looking into going self-hosting on an in-campus box, that would have proper backends, etc. and would be able to run full wiki suites.</p> <p>I looked into Dokuwiki but it is so 2002 and theming won&#39;t help.

AI isn&#39;t perfect but it catches my mistakes often enough to be useful.</p> <p>I bought a Framework desktop recently so auditlm is my attempt to use that for code review. It works well with GLM-4.5-Air. The Framework takes about 3-10 minutes to review a change depending on how involved it is, and in a larger project I&#39;d expect reviews to potentially take even longer.</p> <p>The agent gets shell access inside of a docker container for the purposes of review, so it&#39;s able to run tests, static analysis tools, read the output of e.g. <code>cargo doc</code>, etc.</p> <p>Published here for the purposes of opening issues: <a href=\"https://github.com/ellenhp/auditlm\">https://github.com/ellenhp/auditlm</a></p> <p>I&#39;ve been developing it here: <a href=\"https://",
