        "description": "Google has tried nothing to strengthen the Pixel Fold 10 Pro and they are all out of ideas. The new Folding Pixel Phone has failed my durability test Catastrophically. If google needs better tools to build a better phone they can get one of my tool kits HERE: https://www.ifixit.com/products/ifixit-x-jerryrigeverything-toolkit\n\nI thought for sure that after the first two catastrophic failures - Google might move some antenna lines around and make the phone stronger... But nope! The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is weaker than ever and now Explodes. \n\nThis is the first time in a decade of durability testing smartphones that ive had a phone explode in my hands.",
