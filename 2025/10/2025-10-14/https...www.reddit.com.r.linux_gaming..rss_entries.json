I almost made the switch to Linux a few years ago but decided against it because it seemed like everyone I discussed it with made Linux out to be this big scary thing that I would spend my whole life having to tweak just to possibly play my games.</p> <p>With Win10 losing support, I thought about it once more as my disdain for MS had hit an all time high. I decided I would enroll in the extended security updates to be able to use 10 for another year but guess what? Gotta create a MS account for that. This was my final straw. I installed Kubuntu and absolutely love it! I managed to get WoW working with ease through proton and so far everything else has worked great too. I haven&#39;t had to touch the big scary terminal once yet either. All this to say, I&#39;m really digging Linux and look forward to learning more about it. </p> <p>Sorry that this is not formatted better as I never really make posts. Thanks for reading!</p",

The closest thing I&#39;ve found to an answer is it may be related to Freesync but turning it off just made the issues rarer. These issues are so inconsistent, I tried for an hour to get them to happen, but couldn&#39;t replicate them.</p> <p>They tend to happen in game, looking like horizontal rainbow lines, grouped up. It&#39;ll occur as a flash and then won&#39;t happen again for a few minutes.</p> <p>On the desktop, it looks like little gray horizontal lines popping in and out that disappear after a few seconds right after a boot. Does not always happen.</p> <p>My GPU and monitor are both new, the monitor being newer. This did not happen on my old monitor, which was 1440p@165hz, no freesync. The new one is 4k@240 hz.</p> <p>These artifacts do not appear in a screenshot or screen recording. If I can get a picture, I will attach it</p> <p>Specs:<br/> ",

Here&#39;s a polished and clear English version of your message, ready for Reddit:</p> <p>I&#39;m considering switching from Windows 10 to Fedora Linux, but I can&#39;t upgrade to Windows 11 due to a motherboard limitation. My system is a bit dated: DDR3 RAM (16GB), Intel i5-6400 CPU, and a GTX 1650 GPU.</p> <p>Should I make the switch to Linux? I&#39;m currently learning web development and aiming to become a software engineer. I also enjoy gaming\u2014mostly on Steam and Minecraft. Gaming is a core part of my routine, and I\u2019m not willing to give it up. So I\u2019m wondering: can I still play most games on Linux? Are there major issues that would make switching a bad idea?</p> <p>As for creative software like Photoshop, I don\u2019t really care\u2014I actually prefer using GIMP and other tools like DaVinci Resolve. Also, what\u2019s the best Linux distro for someone like me (other than Ubuntu)? I\u2019d say my Linux experience is average\u2014not terrible, but not advance",
