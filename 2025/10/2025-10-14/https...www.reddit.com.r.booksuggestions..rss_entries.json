I&#39;m a big fan of literary fiction, and I&#39;ve mostly read literary fiction set in contemporary times, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone happens to have any recommendations set during the Medieval Period (the Middle Ages, or the Dark Ages, started around 476 AD and ended around the 1450s). It doesn&#39;t need to be set in Europe, as other histories also interest me!</p> <p>To be clear, I&#39;m not really looking for your typical historical fiction, but rather something that holds the spirit of literary fiction insofar as it&#39;s introspective, is more character-driven, and has a sophisticated or lyrical literary quality to it. I know literary fiction as a genre is pretty nebulous in terms of its definition but I&#39;ve found that most of the books I like fall into this category.

Also, looking for older characters (at least middle aged); They don&#39;t have to be the actual protagonist, but then again i don&#39;t want a story about some group of teens going on adventures (nothing wrong with that, just not what i&#39;m looking for). If it&#39;s possible, i&#39;d like for the book to have been translated to french, as it is my mother tongue.</p> <p>So far, the series that was closest to what i&#39;m looking for was wheel of time, but i disliked how &quot;fantasy&quot; it felt, i like magic but in a really controlled and realistic setting, not really within epic tales lol.</p> <p>Thank you to anyone who might help &lt;3 i&#39;m sorry if any of this was confusing, don&#39;t hesitate to ask ",

I like the medieval period, but it doesn\u2019t have to tick every box I mention just having some of these elements is enough. </p> <p>I want the style to be gritty and realistic; I\u2019m not a fan of happy-go-lucky or clich\u00e9 stories. I enjoy seeing characters suffer, experience sadness, but also have moments of happiness. I particularly like stories from the viewpoint of a soldier who has no choice but to follow stupid orders from their superiors. To give you an idea, I love Joe Abercrombie\u2019s work. A little romance is fine too I find it can add an interesting twist.</p> <p>Thanks you everyone for your help ! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

Just all those old-school Internet technologies.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering what some other good ones are. Less about the state of the Internet, more about the techs of the Internet.
