        "description": "How do you design an RPG system where items, skills, and abilities can change anything? In this talk, Ian Cox of Stoic Studio presents a case study about their use of the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) to create modular, scalable gameplay modifications in their RPG brawler Towerborne.\n\nThis session covers practical techniques for mapping RPG elements to GAS primitives; creating perks that can modify anything without overloading designers or programmers; and common pitfalls in RPG perk design with GAS, and how to address them.",

        "description": "This session demonstrates how Fortnite Creative projects can benefit from Scene Graph. Learn how to use Scene Graph prefabs and components to create reusable data-oriented designs for your project. The session also discusses how Scene Graph prefabs enable creators to reduce Verse code, iterate quickly, and reduce bug count. It also includes a comparison of the amount of Verse code in UEFN projects created both with and without Scene Graph.",

        "description": "Cabin Creator is an interior configuration tool used by Gulfstream Aerospace\u2019s sales, design, refurbishment, and customer delivery executive teams. Originally developed to facilitate a continued ability to interact with customers during the COVID crisis, Cabin Creator has expanded over the past five years to become a robust and invaluable tool embedded within the enterprise, generating millions of dollars in revenue through the direct sales of new aircraft, refurbishment upsells, and upgraded material and styling options. \n\nIn this session, Josh Triplett and Brian Toler of Gulfstream Aerospace step through the processes used to create a modular, data-driven configurator, a responsive UI, and the use of Lumen and Nanite to power a fully dynamic interior. The session will include a live demonstration of Cabin Creator.",
