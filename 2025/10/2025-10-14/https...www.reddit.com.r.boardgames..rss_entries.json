But what if only one color comes out or there is a tie in which cube color has the highest count? We made our own rule to re-roll if its one color, and flip a coin if there is a tie.</p> <p>2) Can you place consecutive village tiles on the board in a single build action or do they have to touch a village or trading post that already exists? In other words, in a single build action can I quickly expand across an island by chaining new villages, or can I only build next to already existing structures?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nakfoor\"> /u/nakfoor </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1o6sa5t/amerigo_2013_questions/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"http",
