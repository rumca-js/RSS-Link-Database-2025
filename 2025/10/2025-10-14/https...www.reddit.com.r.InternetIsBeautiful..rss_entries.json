My girlfriend suggested we play a game, but we couldn&#39;t easily find something to do.</p> <p>Anyway, I&#39;m a product manager and I love vibe coding, so she said something like &quot;why don&#39;t you build us a game in your vibe thingy?&quot;.</p> <p>Fast forward three weeks and I sort of created a monster :)</p> <p>It&#39;s called <a href=\"https://partnersheep.com/\">PartnerSheep</a> and there are various games, quizzes, and content there. The idea is that you start a game, share the game code or link with your partner and then you both play the same game at the same time. It&#39;s totally free and built out of love and there&#39;s no registration and I&#39;m not collection any data.</p> <p>Would love to hear your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GreatTwin\"> /u/GreatTwin </a",
