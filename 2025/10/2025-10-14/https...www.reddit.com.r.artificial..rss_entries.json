So when you stop practicing and doing things yourself, then, all of a sudden, you no longer have the mental ability or efficacy to do certain things. You see this in the younger generation where they have repeatedly stopped doing a number of things or have cut back on a number of things that help increase their intelligence, like reading, calculating mathematical functions, literacy has gone down so drastically for the younger generations. And now we&#39;re talking about AI being a thought partner in the corporate world, everyone&#39;s going to start using AI!
