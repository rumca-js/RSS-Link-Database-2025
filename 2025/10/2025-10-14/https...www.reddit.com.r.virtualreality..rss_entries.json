He has been mentioning wanting to buy one for the longest time and loves gaming. He games mostly on his computer and also has a Switch 2. I am not at all familiar with this technology, so I thought I would ask for some advice on which one to choose (since of course I can\u2019t ask him because it will be a surprise.) I am not that rich so 500$CAD will already be a knife to the heart to me, so if it\u2019s possible to find something around 400-300 CAD$ and still worth it it would be perfect to me!
