        "description": "In the mid 25th Century, the Orion Sector, once a jewel of the Human empire has begun to slowly die. The sun Orion has dimmed and turned to a smouldering cinder... causing catastrophic decline in the system's worlds. Given over to pirates, scum, megacorps and freaks.\n\nWith the Flame of Orion's location revealed, the Blade Church and Syndicate Crimson both rush to face the Demon AI juggernaut class Mech that houses it. With the bulk of the bunker holding off the other defences only two Mechs from each faction take to the field with the victor determining the fate of the Sector!\n\nCheck out the INDIE HOUR feature HERE: https://youtu.be/yy120sjhUjQ\n\nGMG is publicly supported.
