Like I could point out a man that was conventionally attractive or understand when my straight friends showed me crushes/bfs, but I myself had not been attracted to a man. But I also had never seen Joe Jonas in my life nor did I know who he was. And holy crap the more videos I watch of this man??? And I feel SOOOOO weird and almost icking myself out even saying it because I so strongly identified as lesbian for so long. I still identify as a lesbian, just in the fine print there is one singular exception and that is Joe Jonas. I will be the first person to tell you sexuality is fluid and not to worry about picking one word to conform yourself to but hot damn after 19 years of never being attracted to a man my head is spinning \u2620\ufe0f Like who am I what is happening to me LMFAO?! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",

Enby here, thought I&#39;d share a nice story that happened to me this morning (some positivity never killed anyone, especially in such troubled times right).</p> <p>I&#39;ll start with mentioning that I study the literature and the history of English-speaking civilisations, so my academic environment is very progressive and open-minded.

It took me quite some time and a lot of information seeking to finally acknowledge myself as non binary, about one year ago. So, since it&#39;s still quite recent, I sometimes struggle with the usual &quot;impostor phase&quot; many trans siblings have probably gone through before me.
