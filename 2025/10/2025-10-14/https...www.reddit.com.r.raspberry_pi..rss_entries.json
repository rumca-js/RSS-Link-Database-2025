Exploring this sub I even saw some people putting custom water blocks on their Pis lol, should I go for something like Noctua or any other reputable manufacturer or is the official one the best? If a 3rd party cooler is a better option, which one? Some companies seem to make very efficient mini fans, however the official cooler has a heatsink and everything which would indicate that it might be more efficient than anything else.

The idea is to let customers book parking slots through a web application, so they have a reserved spot upon arrival. To ensure that only the correct vehicle parks in the assigned slot, we plan to integrate an ESP32-CAM module that captures an image of the vehicle\u2019s number plate once it enters the parking area.</p> <p>The image will then undergo Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the alphanumeric text from the plate, which will be cross-checked against the customer\u2019s registered plate number stored in the web app\u2019s database. This process helps verify that the correct car has parked in the proper slot.</p> <p>Our main question is: can this entire system be implemented using only the ESP32-CAM, or will we need a Raspberry Pi (or another device) to handle the OCR and database processing?</p> <p>Any advice or suggestions are appre",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m thinking of getting my sister&#39;s (teenage) kids into programming, and I&#39;m wondering if getting them Raspberry Pis would be a good place to start. My nephew in particular, at one point, was very into LEGO and building things, so I&#39;m considering getting him a Pi board and some kit he can build something with. The goal is to teach him (Python) programming basics whilst having an end goal in mind instead of aimlessly just learning a language for the sake of learning it.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been researching which combination of Pi board and build kit to get, and my search led me to a Pi Zero 2 and a CamJam EduKit. However, as someone who hasn&#39;t tried it myself, I&#39;m not sure if this pairing will be sufficient. One of my other concerns is the beginner&#39;s workflow: is the board powerful enough to be its own development environment, or will we need to set up a separate one and get them to connect? </p> <p>Open to other suggestions, of",
