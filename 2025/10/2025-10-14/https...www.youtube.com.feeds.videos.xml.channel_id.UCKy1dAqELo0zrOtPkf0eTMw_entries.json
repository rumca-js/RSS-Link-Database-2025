But even after that, plus six spin-off shows, executive producer Scott Gimple thinks there's still plenty of story to tell. Taking a cue from the France-set Daryl Dixon spin-off, the cast's core characters could find themselves all over the globe, with Gimple saying it could provide for 15 more years' worth of stories. In other news, Jar Jar Binks actor Ahmed Best is returning to the character in a one-shot comic. Star Wars: Jar Jar Binks will be co-written by Best, and will feature the character playing a pivotal role in the rebellion after Revenge of the Sith. And we\u2019ve got a look at the thrills you can experience in The Isle of Berk at Universal Epic Universe.\n\nPresented by Universal Orlando Resort and its new theme park, Universal Epic Universe.\n\n#IGN",

Creator James Gunn teased that the finale would lay the groundwork for 2027\u2019s Man of Tomorrow movie. And Gunn seems to have made good on that promise, with the finale strongly hinting at which character will serve as the common enemy uniting Nicholas Hoult\u2019s Lex Luthor and David Corenswet\u2019s Superman. So why are we so unhappy with the big reveal?\n\nLet\u2019s break down why Peacemaker Season 2\u2019s finale doesn\u2019t quite gel with the rest of the DCU. We\u2019ll also explore the other big revelations in this episode, like the debut of Checkmate and the planet Salvation. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the ending of Peacemaker Season 2.\nPeacemaker is created by James Gunn and stars John Cena, Danielle Brooks, Freddie Stroma, Jennifer Holland, Steve Agee, Frank Grillo, and Robert Patrick. The entire second season is now available to stream on",
