I am being told by some people that it should be on WordPress because it\u2019s SEO friendly But my developers are telling me that it should be next JS because that is a new technology and Google can find it easily and it is very SEO friendly and it will be able to handle all the inventory searching much more smoothly. What are everyone\u2019s thoughts? I am really stuck here. On one hand, I am afraid that WordPress will make the site wonky when the user is trying to find inventory and on the other hand, I don\u2019t know anything about Next JS and I know that WordPress is very SEO friendly. Keep in mind this inventory search. Can\u2019t be wonky. Thanks!!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Yourdiamondguysorig\"> /u/Yourdi",
