The app is based in India, and I want to make the right choices early on without overcomplicating things.</p> <p>Some of the areas I\u2019m thinking about are:</p> <ul> <li>Database</li> <li>Storage</li> <li>Authentication</li> <li>APIs</li> <li>File sharing</li> <li>AI calling, recording and reports</li> <li>Other services that might be needed</li> </ul> <p>Since it\u2019s still an MVP, I\u2019m wondering if it makes sense to stick with <strong>Firebase for everything</strong> (for simplicity and faster development) or if I should mix in other services for specific needs. My main goal is to keep things manageable at this stage while ensuring the app can scale later if needed.</p> <p>Has anyone faced a similar situation? I\u2019d really appreciate your thoughts, experiences, or suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",
