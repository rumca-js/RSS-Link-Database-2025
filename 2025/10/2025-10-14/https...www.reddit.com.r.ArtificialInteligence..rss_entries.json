AI gives you a big, raw blob of creative potential, but not all of it reflects <em>your</em> choices. It\u2019s like sculpting from a massive, messy block that you didn\u2019t fully shape yourself.</p> <p>When you make something by hand, every word, sound, or brushstroke is intentional, you own every decision.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the twist: if you break your AI creation into smaller and smaller pieces, refining prompts, rewriting sections, remixing outputs, you start taking control back. The smaller the piece, the more intentional you become again.</p> <p><strong>This is a big question that I have when creating tagtwists and I wanted to get your opinions on it.

I had to cut and paste a fourth spreadsheet to accomplish this. It took me 3 days the first couple of times I did it. The point is that that task disappeared. First with Lotus123, then Excel, then we just programmed a computer to kick out the numbers automatically. Presto, three days of my time freed up and this was not isolated. The same will happen with AI. </p> <p>Every technological advance does the same thing. It eliminates work and causes a skill set shift. The question is whether our current system of American capitalism is still appropriate. The purpose of any economic system is the equitable distribution of goods and services. We have been distributing it based on work and investment. How do we determine an equitable distribution if we no longer need &quot;work&quot; to create products and services?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON -",

Especially those who became more familiar with it in this Era.</p> <p>Classically, we would reserve hanging for those who&#39;ve committed rather heinous crimes.. those who raped, killed innocent people, or done something so fundamentally wrong it was nearly essential that we punish you adequately. But i guess in 2025 we hang those who are behind the next frontier of scientific development i guess. These are the same people who&#39;ve would&#39;ve shot The Wright Brothers out of the sky for doing &quot;magic&quot; or something unbelievable.</p> <p>I understand that it&#39;s against most people&#39;s interest to be in favor of something that can potentially renounce them of their positions, especially regarding survival and work",

A user posts something that\u2019s clearly AI-written, and the comments are AI too. It feels like we\u2019re watching a simulation of people chatting while real humans just sit there and scroll. In that post, I said I hated it, it felt like a copy of a copy of the internet I once knew. Everything too clean, yet somehow completely and utterly lifeless.</p> <p>After a while when I went back to check comments on the post later, a bunch of ",
