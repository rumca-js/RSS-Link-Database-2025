Join the DF Supporter Program and support the team: https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx\n\nA new version of FSR4 was recently leaked by AMD (!), opening the door to high quality upscaling for any GPU that supports INT8 machine learning instructions. That means a range of products ranging from every RDNA 2 or RDNA 3 based GPU, including Steam Deck and ROG Ally handhelds. Rich takes a look at image quality and performance across a range of devices - including Nvidia (!) and even ballpark simulations of how FSR4 could run on Xbox Series X.\n\nGo here to check out DF merch! https://store.digitalfoundry.net\n\nSubscribe for more Digital Foundry: http://bit.ly/DFSubscribe\n\n00:00 Introduction\n02:07 Is FSR4 INT8 The Same As FSR4 FP8?\n04:17 FSR4 INT8 Tested On RDNA 3: Setting The Baseline\n08:14 FSR4 INT8 Tested On RDNA 2: Could Consoles Run It?\n11:58 FSR4 INT8 Tested On Steam Deck\n15:31 FSR4 INT8 Tested On Asus ROG Ally\n19:19 Summary\n22:33 FSR4 Tested On...
