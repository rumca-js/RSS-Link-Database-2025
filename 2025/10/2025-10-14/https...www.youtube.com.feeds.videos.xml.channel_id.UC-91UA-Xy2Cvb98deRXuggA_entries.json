This video dives into the most painfully awkward ways companies pretend to care \u2014 complete with playground field trips, fake smiles, and LinkedIn hashtags no one asked for.\n\nBecause nothing says \u201cwe value your contribution\u201d like making you hug a guy in a sea-otter costume before clocking out early to cry in your car.\n\nWatch till the end for the most cringe-inducing appreciation posts ever uploaded to LinkedIn.\n#CorporateCringe #EmployeeAppreciation #PizzaPartyCulture",
