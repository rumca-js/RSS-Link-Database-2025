Recently, however, there's been a resurgence of skating games, and an audience made up of both oldheads and fresh-faced players alike has been showing up for them. It feels safe to say there's still an appetite for these kinds of titles. With the early-access release of EA's <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate/\">Skate</a>--a revival of a series that once took up a lot of space in this industry--as well as the <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/\">acclaimed</a> <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/\">releases</a> of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater remakes, the once-dying genre seems primed for a comeback.</p><p ",

The lore behind werewolves is fascinating, as they appear as regular humans but can shape-shift into a wolf-like creature. This shapeshifting can occur by choice or by force of nature, depending on how the individual came to be a werewolf. In video games, players are often given the choice to transform into a werewolf, giving them more freedom in how to approach certain situations. However, some games only feature werewolves as enemies you're meant to defeat or as characters you can interact with.</p><p>In any case, whenever a werewolf appears in a video game, your attention is immediately directed toward it.
