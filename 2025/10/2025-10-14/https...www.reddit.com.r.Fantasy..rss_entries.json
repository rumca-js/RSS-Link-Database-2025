I like the medieval period, but it doesn\u2019t have to tick every box I mention just having some of these elements is enough. </p> <p>I want the style to be gritty and realistic; I\u2019m not a fan of happy-go-lucky or clich\u00e9 stories. I enjoy seeing characters suffer, experience sadness, but also have moments of happiness. I particularly like stories from the viewpoint of a soldier who has no choice but to follow stupid orders from their superiors. To give you an idea, I love Joe Abercrombie\u2019s work. A little romance is fine too I find it can add an interesting twist.</p> <p>Thanks you everyone for your help ! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

I\u2019d imagine on this page there aren\u2019t many who didn\u2019t, but I want to find a series like that as adults. I always loved the concept of Demi Gods discovering their divine heritage and learning about their ties to the gods and fixing messes their parents made. The red pyramid was another awesome series and I just wanna get back into that world of mythology but feel like it\u2019s a bit more relative to my own age as a now 26 year old former Riordan fanboy. It doesn\u2019t have to be based in the present but something that\u2019s kinda a good fusion of the real world and the fantasy to really get immersed in it. Any suggestions would be much appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dankest_Faun537\"> /u/Dankest_Faun537 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1o6491o/percy_jackson_but_grown_up/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://",
