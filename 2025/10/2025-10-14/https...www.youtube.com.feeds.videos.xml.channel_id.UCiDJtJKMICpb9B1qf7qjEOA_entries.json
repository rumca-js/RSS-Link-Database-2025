        "description": "While visiting ICON, a company that designs and makes 3D printers for printing structures, Adam visits the labs for their space-based construction system: Project Olympus! We learn how ICON's engineers are experimenting with robotic systems that can turn the moon's regolith into landing pads, roadways, and even eventually pressurized habitats. \n\nLearn more about ICON's Project Olympus: https://iconbuild.com/lunar-construction\nNote: This video is not sponsored. We received no compensation, including travel. We were in Austin and we think the tech at ICON, where someone we know works, is cool! We would have disclosed if this was a paid integration; see our recent videos with Jabra and Alienware.\n\nShot by Josh Self and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\nAdditional media courtesy ICON\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps:/",
