Use code UNDECIDED at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan:\u00a0http://incogni.com/undecided We've been told for years that fast-charging kills batteries. But what if that rule is wrong? The Georgia Institute of Technology just found that the faster they charged a zinc-ion battery, the better it performed. A damaged battery even started healing itself. And another team has re-engineered the atomic twists that normally break a zinc-ion battery down\u2026 to make it stronger than ever. These aren't just lab curiosities. Zinc batteries can act as a safer, cheaper alternative to lithium for grid storage and home use. They can't catch fire. They're made from abundant materials. But they\u2019ve had one fatal flaw that\u2019s kept them from dethroning lithium: they don\u2019t last long enough. So, how did scientists turn atomic jitters into resilience? How can fast-charging help a battery perform? And what does ",
