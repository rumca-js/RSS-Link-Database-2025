I know this means I won\u2019t be able to use software/apps on my TV and that\u2019s fine; everything I use my TV for is through HDMI. My question is: if I want to connect my iPad to the TV via HDMI to watch Hulu <em>from my iPad,</em> am I giving my TV access to the internet because my iPad is connected to the internet? Or if I hook up an internet-accessing Nintendo Switch via HDMI for that matter? My thought is that as long as I\u2019m not giving the TV my network name and password I should be okay, right? Does anyone know how this works?</p> <p>Thanks in advance for any information you can sha",

Maybe yall can confirm? It&#39;s my understanding that if you use MS Outlook, and not use MS for email, they still have access to your emails, calendar, and address book. The reason being, and my understanding, is that when you add your accounts to Outlook it automatically uses \u201cConnected Experiences\u201d and \u201coptional services\u201d to allow you to download your information. Your authentication info is encrypted as is other data, but with that said, they have the decryption capabilities. They claim this is for better user experiance but there are other clients that do not need to call home to get to your mail server. From a privacy perspective this is quite concerning.

He\u2019s not planning to build a website. The domain is only for email use.</p> <p>But when I googled his domain name, I noticed there are <em>tons</em> of search results mentioning that exact domain, including registrar listings, WHOIS data, and metadata sites. Basically, the domain name is all over the internet even though he hasn\u2019t done anything with it.</p> <p>I\u2019m planning to buy a domain for the same purpose (email only), but I don\u2019t want it to appear publicly anywhere. No registrar listings, no index pages, no metadata leaks.</p> <p>Is there a way to buy a domain that stays completely private and invisible online unless I personally share it? For example:</p> <ul> <li>A registrar that doesn\u2019t expose the domain name on public listings?</li> <li>Some way to keep the domain from being indexe",
