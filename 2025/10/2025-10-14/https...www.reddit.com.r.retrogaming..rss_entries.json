        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I recently acquired a copy of Mega Man 2. Full disclosure, my main NES console is an AV famicom and I use a 72 to 60 pin converter to play my games, it should be noted that the converter is modded so it can play games like Dracula&#39;s Curse. Never really had an issue until now. But Mega Man 2 seems to simply freeze once I get to the character select screen, the game freezes. I&#39;ll also get random reboots on the opening crawl. At first, I thought it might be the cart, so I took it back to the store and they swapped it out with another copy they had. We also tested the new cart and it worked fine, I was able to play through Air Man&#39;s stage just fine. Bring it back home and I have the same issues again. So I&#39;m guessing its some kinda compatability issue with my converter. Has anyone ever encountered this situation? I appreciate any info that someone can help me with!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.r",
