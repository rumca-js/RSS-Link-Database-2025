The late nights studying topics I don\u2019t care about and having to teach myself everything because everything is asynchronous or hybrid. Im not even sure I\u2019m enjoying the people I\u2019m meeting who are also in the field of study. I got into cybersecurity because I am competent when it comes to computer hardware and this seemed like the next step. </p> <p>I also saw this as a way to make good money but I just find it so boring. I think it s partly because there is no reason to even have this knowledge If you aren\u2019t studying this. For example, I never wanted to build a computer initially but knowing that most prebuilt pcs come with caveats this pushed me to want to build my own computer and take an interest in pc hardware. I don\u2019t have this same push to learn OSI layer and so on. This makes even the idea that I\u2019d pass a test for a certificate hard because I have no drive ",

I&#39;m getting tired of Linkedin-like conversation and this kind of things. I guess this sub is not that bad, but with karma points, and its popularity and everything, Reddit is pretty much a bot paradise. I said forums, but I guess it can also be Discord, etc.</p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fit-Value-4186\"> /u/Fit-Value-4186 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1o61x2e/cybersecurity_forums_or_communities/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1o61x2e/cybersecurity_forums_or_communities/\">[comments]</a></span>",
