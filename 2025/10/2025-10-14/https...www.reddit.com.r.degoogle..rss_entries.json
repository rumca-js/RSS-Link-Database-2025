If I put it on a work profile would the app still be able to spy on my main phone profile? I would also like to put Amazon on as well as that is on another burner but under another separate user profile. I currently have eight working burners with different uses. Banks, Work, Side business, Social medias, Journalism &amp; research, One for trolling the Daily Mail (sorry but it&#39;s a fun thing), Weekly shopping habits and my main phone... They all live in faraday bags and are &quot;off&quot; as much as is evident and some are stored at different locations such as my rental office, day job, outbuilding and a shack out in the mountains.
