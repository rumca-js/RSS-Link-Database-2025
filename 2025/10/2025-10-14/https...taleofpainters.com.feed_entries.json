This is several years after the current edition of Kill Team came out, which doesn't even include Compendium Kill Teams anymore. I know. Still, I wanted to take the opportunity to shoot some atmospheric group photos for you in front of my Gallowdark terrain, so please enjoy.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/10/showcase-hive-fleet-kraken-kill-team/\">Showcase: Hive Fleet Kraken Kill Team</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
