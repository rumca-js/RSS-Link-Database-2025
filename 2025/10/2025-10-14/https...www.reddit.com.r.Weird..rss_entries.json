I live in a group of studios all located on the ground floor. I\u2019ve probably found cards on one or two other occasions in addition to these pictures so that would be around 5-6 total occasions over 1-2 months. Seems like more than a coincidence to me. There is high turnover in my apt complex and it seems like everyone here is relatively sane because I know the owners of the complex screen tenants pretty intensely, so I\u2019m kind of doubting that the cards are coming from anyone",
