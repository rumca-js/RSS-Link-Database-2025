        "description": "For decades, governments, scientists, and skeptics have tried to explain away mysterious lights and encounters in the sky but some UFO events have proven nearly impossible to debunk. In this video, we explore the most credible and baffling UFO encounters ever recorded, cases backed by radar data, official investigations, and hundreds of eyewitnesses.\n\nWe begin with the Tic Tac UAP Encounter, captured by U.S. Navy pilots in 2004 and officially confirmed by the Pentagon. This fast-moving, physics-defying object displayed technology far beyond anything known to exist and remains one of the most well-documented UFO incidents in modern history.\n\nNext, we look at The Washington Flap of 1952, when radar operators and pilots over the U.S. capital reported multiple unidentified objects flying at impossible speeds. The event led to a military scramble and a national panic that even the Air Force struggled to explain.\n\nThen there\u2019s The Phoenix Lights of 1997, one of the largest mass UFO sighting",
