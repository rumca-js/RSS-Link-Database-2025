Or you can use it at one of its many preset lengths: 1.9 feet, 3.1 feet, 4.1 feet, 4.9 feet, 5.7 feet, and 6.2 feet.

If you dream of a decked-out multi-monitor setup, or if you have one already but they\u2019re all mounted on the stands they came with, then you can easily level up your workspace with a proper triple-monitor arm for maximum flexibility and ergonomics. Right now, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RF63FK/\">this Huanuo triple monitor mount is $119.98 on Amazon</a>, down from its original $149.99 and now available at its best price all year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good monitor arm is one of the best home office upgrades you can make, and gas spring monitor arms offer easier and smoother adjustments than coil spring monitor arms.

Paying $139 for Windows 11 Home or $200 for Windows 11 Pro feels expensive when Linux is free. That much money can easily swallow a third of a budget PC build. Yet with less developer support for Linux, Windows is a necessity for most people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s <em>not</em> a given is paying full retail price. Yep, you can snag discounts on Windows 11. How much you\u2019ll save depends on your circumstances (and your stomach for hassle), but if you\u2019re lucky, you could technically get it for free. Legitimately for free, since installing Windows without ever activating it doesn\u2019t count as a full, sanctioned copy of the software.

Sure, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs are solid even without DLSS, but the company\u2019s own marketing claims DLSS with multi-frame generation can boost the frame rate of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> from 28 FPS to 242 FPS. That\u2019s an eight-fold improvement! Who wouldn\u2019t want that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as some reviewers have noted, the boosts from DLSS aren\u2019t always as impressive in real life as they are in marketing materials. And it\u2019s often less powerful systems\u2014like gaming laptops\u2014that see the most modest benefits.
