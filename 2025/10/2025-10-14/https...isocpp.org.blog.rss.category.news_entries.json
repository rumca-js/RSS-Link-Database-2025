In this recap I share the vibe of the week, five standout talks and ideas, a few notes from my own session, and links to recordings as they appear.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/09/24/trip-report-cppcon-2025\">Trip Report: CppCon 2025</a></h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tby Sandor Dargo</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFrom the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tCppCon is simply bigger than any other C++ conference I&rsquo;ve attended.
