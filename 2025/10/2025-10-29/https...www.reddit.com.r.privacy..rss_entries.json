I&#39;m new to all this privacy things, I&#39;v read this subreddit, <a href=\"/r/degoogle\">r/degoogle</a> <a href=\"/r/DeMeta\">r/DeMeta</a> etc<br/> But I do not really understand if it is actually worth it, going through all that hassle to gain privacy, given the following factors:<br/> 1. I&#39;ve been on the internet and big tech companies databases for over 10 years now, so much of my info is there already, so what&#39;s the difference?<br/> 2. Everyone uses WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, so if I don&#39;t use them, it&#39;s more of an inconvinience<br/> 3. I have to migrate all my google stuff, stop using WhatsApp and Instagram, change mobile and PC OS, it&#39;s a lot of things to think about.<br/> So... yeah, it is justified?

It def isn&#39;t the cia/fbi/whatever. Maybe boyfriend (I just leave my laptop open 24/7, having two accounts sounds annoying), border patrol or hackers. The only files I have are text files and music/videos (not sure if file type actually matters, maybe size comes into play at some point?).</p> <p>Anyways, I use standard notes for my journal entries. I don&#39;t want anyone to read them. It got me thinking, if I decrypt my notes by logging into standard notes on my macbook, those are decrypted somewhere, maybe in memory? I guess I have to manually quit the app to feel secure? Or restart my macbook? Then you&#39;re at the mercy of your user/password of the macbook and remembering to enable encryption for your hard drive.</p> <p>As for files, I have cryptomator working and have a folder being backed up to s3 with restic.",
