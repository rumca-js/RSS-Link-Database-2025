I keep thinking: &quot;Why did he have to die to return to his &#39;planet&#39;?&quot; (if that&#39;s what the author meant). There&#39;s no explanation anywhere. If you think about it, he&#39;s such a depressed and lonely little boy who kills himself because he can no longer return to his planet in any other way... How sad, isn&#39;t it? Anyway, I tried to think of more abstract meanings, since the Little Prince was a figment of his imagination, maybe it could represent his inner child? I don&#39;t know. I think the whole book is incredible, except for the dark and demonic final chapters, which scare me too much. It&#39;s a children&#39;s book... It&#39;s very devastating...

The book was published in September of 2025.</p> <p>To start, although the title is a semi-accurate description of the book&#39;s theme--namely, scientists err when they assess the intelligence of non-humans in anthropocentric terms and find it wanting by comparison--I think it does the book a slight disservice by not adequately expressing how much of the discussion regards non-human life. The book engages in a fair amount of, in my opinion, deserved bashing of the European scientific and philosophical traditions that promote human intellectual exceptionalism, but it does this with a wide-ranging exploration of examples of non-human intelligence that is qu",

Was he racist back in the day and then changed or something? It seems like he&#39;s written a fair amount of anti racist literature, which makes it all the more confusing why he&#39;s using the n word. Is there something I&#39;m missing here?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/thesprung\"> /u/thesprung </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1oiy967/whats_up_with_wendell_berry_using_the_n_word_so/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1oiy967/whats_up_with_wendell_berry_using_the_n_word_so/\">[comments]</a></span>",

This post may be a bit lengthy but I\u2019d really like to hear people\u2019s thoughts.</p> <p>The formula is consistent and good. One or more psychosexually twisted policemen investigate a sprawling case that they gradually get sucked into, barraged at all times with tiny pieces of information that all somehow come together into a neat package at the end. The surprising thing is it hits every time. The prose beams directly into your head just on account of its perfect rhythm and the plots somehow stay consistently bleak while always having at least one hell yeah moment per book. The real clincher for me is it\u2019s perfectly in tune with how pathetic and strange people can be.</p> <p>The Black Dahlia is probably the one least subject to total Ellroy overload and has the b",

Something that his partner has been urging to embrace the chaos. And one day he is forced to shoot a man, and a homeless man, with bloodshot eyes, says that he will die in sixteen hours, words that threaten Harry&#39;s own sanity.</p> <p>So another really fast paced novel like the last one, &quot;Intensity&quot;, but &quot;Dragon Tears&quot; is a bit different. This leans into the realm of the supernatural, like &quot;Hideaway&quot;, but with more of a cop thriller feel. Once I started reading it the story just went into overdrive on the first chapter, very much in the way that &quot;Intensity&quot; did. Just really fast paced!</p> <p>And of course like much of Koontz&#39;s work, I see the story through several different perspectiv",
