        "description": "I built Spite \u2014 an all-carbon, minimum-diameter rocket packed with custom fins, a massive M2080 motor, and an Insta360 strapped in with hot-glue \u2014 and sent it toward Mach 2. We teased 22,000 ft, did ground tests (avionics, shear pins, dual-deploy) and motor integration, then launched from the Mojave \u2014 and yes, we recorded telemetry and slow-mo. Curious how a DIY carbon rocket survives supersonic speed (and my questionable hot-glue choices)? \n\nWatch the full flight for the apogee, smoke-and-fire slow-mo, and the final verdict.\n\nSupport me on Patreon:\n\ud83d\udcb8 https://patreon.com/xylafoxlin\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/xylafoxlin/\n\ud83d\udc26 X (fka Twitter): https://x.com/xylafoxlin\n\ud83d\udcd8 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/xylafoxlin\n\ud83c\udfb6 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@xylafoxlin\n\nBuy my MERCH:\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.xylafoxlin.com/\n\nAll my favorite Amazon Items!:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/xylafoxlin\n(filming setup, safety gear, etc)\n\n\ud83d\udc8c SEND ME THINGS \ud83d\udce6 :\nXyla Foxlin\n3727 W.
