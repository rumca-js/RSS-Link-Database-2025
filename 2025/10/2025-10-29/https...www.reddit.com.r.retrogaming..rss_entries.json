First time posting here.</p> <p>I&#39;m 45 and so I was around when all of the consoles discussed in this subreddit weren&#39;t retro. While I&#39;m young at heart in other ways I&#39;m not. For example my knees are starting to feel a bit retro lately :)</p> <p>Anyway..... I passed on a few retro games at a local market yesterday as they were either incomplete or had fairly bad condition manuals and having things complete in box is important to me. I was curious as to where all you collectors look for manuals if you end up with an incomplete game. I have found a few on Etsy over the years but I&#39;ve found dealer rooms at retro gaming events to be a bit of a goldmine for loose manuals going fairly cheap (I&#39;m in the UK, North East England) there&#39;s a small but dedicated retro community here and so these events are popular.</p> <p>I try not to buy incomplete if I can help it but as the hobby grows and gets more attention via Youtu",

With how much cost games old generation of console I was thinking of print some covers, printing the manual, use a classic box, burn a CD with my old game or if I found it on loose (less cost) and why not printing it too (I just sa there was printer for CD ! Ahaha) </p> <p>What do you think in a collection ? I would have prefere having everything from the original but my god the price for silent hill 2 is like around 100-200 if not higher. </p> <p>In another topic I was thinking of doing the same with my favorite games from GOG (I know there is a cost but I bought a lot of those games around 1-9 euros so adding some for having it in my collection isn\u2019t that expansive if I was buying it at release or from a buyer online) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JoshiiiFox\"> /u/Joshii",
