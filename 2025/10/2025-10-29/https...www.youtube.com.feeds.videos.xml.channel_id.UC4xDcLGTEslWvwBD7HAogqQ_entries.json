        "description": "The Great Train Robbery of 1963 was one of the most audacious and meticulously planned heists in British history. On August 8, a gang of 15 men led by Bruce Reynolds intercepted a Royal Mail train in route from Glasgow to London, stopping it at Bridego Bridge in Buckinghamshire by tampering with trackside signals. They overpowered the crew and stole \u00a32.61 million in used banknotes, equivalent to over \u00a373 million today. The robbers used a nearby hideout, at a farmhouse, to lay low, but a careless trail of evidence including fingerprints on a Monopoly board, led to their capture. Though most were eventually arrested and imprisoned, one man managed to evade capture and get away with his fair share of the loot. The heist became a cultural phenomenon, inspiring books, films, and ongoing fascination due to its scale, planning, and the enduring mystery surrounding some of the stolen money, which was never recovered.",
