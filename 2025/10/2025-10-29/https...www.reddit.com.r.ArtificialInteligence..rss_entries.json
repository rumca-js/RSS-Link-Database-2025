Enough to matter.</p> <h2></h2> <h1>Introduction</h1> <p>Humans, and likely some animals, possess the remarkable capacity for introspection: the ability to observe and reason about their own thoughts. As AI systems perform increasingly impressive feats of cognition, it is natural to wonder whether they possess any similar awareness of their internal states. Modern language models can appear to demonstrate introspection, sometimes making assertions about their own thought processes, intentions, and knowledge. However, this apparent introspection can be, and often is, an illusion. Language models may simply make up claims about their mental states, without these claims being grounded in genuine internal examination. After all, models are traine",

However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at all. In this paper, we",
