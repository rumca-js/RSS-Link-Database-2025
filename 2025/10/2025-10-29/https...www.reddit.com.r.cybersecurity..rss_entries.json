I was tasked with handling 3 tenants with roughly 50 users each. The thing that is kind of bothering me is that they barely get any alerts. On average each tenant gets 1 alert per month and it&#39;s kinda bumming me out.</p> <p>I guess it&#39;s a good thing since it means that the tenants are secure but it kind of leaves me in a weird place. I&#39;d love to grow and learn more so I can look for a higher paying job in the future but if thing keep going this way I feel like I&#39;ll be stuck here. Ofc I do other things as well such as patching, testing security solutions etc. Is it normal for you to get so few alerts? What would you recommend I do? I wouldn&#39;t mind switching to a more traditional SOC analyst job in the future but I&#39;m not sure anyone would take me seriously.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a",
