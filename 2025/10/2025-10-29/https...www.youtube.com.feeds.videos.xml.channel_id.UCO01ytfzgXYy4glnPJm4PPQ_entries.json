It turns out this scam is even worse than I thought, and much worse than most people realize. I\u2019ll give you the facts today. Also, a popular liberal podcaster says that Democrat politicians need to get on board with wishing death on their opponents. An MSNBC anchor claims that no Democrat has ever compared Trump to Hitler. Of all the fake news ever reported by the fake news, this has to the fakest. And a single childless millennial woman has a moment of realization in a video that has gone majorly viral.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:34 Opening\n02:16 - 24:13 The EBT Scam Just Went From Bad To Worse\n26:10 - 32:37 The (Unfortunate) Rise Of Jennifer Welch\n32:38 - 39:23 Democrats Claim They Have Never Compared Trump To Hitler\n41:20 - 53:08 The Cult Of Self-Prioritization Is Canceled\n\nEp.1682\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/G4YSFjhWQAA3j_1?format=jpg&name=medium\nhttps://pbs.twimg",
