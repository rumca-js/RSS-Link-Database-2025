I\u2019ve never had non-binary friends before so it was a change for me, but I\u2019ve been trying to burn it into my brain. I\u2019m generally pretty good with their pronouns and if I\u2019m about to slip up I say their name instead of pronouns. But (unfortunately) I\u2019m human and will make mistakes. My other friend (J) is the type of friend to always call out you on your bs (love that) and J does this especially with S\u2019s pronouns. So earlier today in drama class I was talking really fast and not really thinking and I accidentally called them by pronouns that aren\u2019t \u201cthey/them\u201d and J immediately called me out on it. I apologized immediately but S sighed and looked disappointed and kinda sad. I apologized again and S said it\u2019s fine and that they came out to their parents around 3 years ago and they still get their pronouns wrong sometimes. I know ",

My parents at first didn\u2019t take it seriously because I will be honest, I\u2019ve questioned a lot, but this one just makes sense.</p> <p>However I\u2019ve had my moms therapist, my doctor who\u2019s going to diagnose me with autism soon (shes confirmed I\u2019m definently autistic which is a relief I was scared I\u2019ve been lying to myself) and other people tell my mom that because I have autism that they should not listen to anything I say in reference to lgbtq+ being real because it WILL change and I am just in a phase.</p> <p>It hurts, why do doctors keep telling my family this?! I live in Canada, a very accepting place of lgbtq+ people, so WHY, WHY ARE THEY TELLING MY PARENTS THIS. I have to wait 6 whole months. 6 until they will even talk about it again, I have to SCHEDULE discussing these things with my parents because it \u201cupsets them so much\u201d.
