I recently picked up a Raspberry Pi 400 because I thought it would be a really cool and portable way to play games on my Shadow PC using a keyboard and mouse while connected to my Xreal glasses.</p> <p>I knew going in that the Pi 400 uses an ARM64 processor, but I didn\u2019t realize that both Parsec and Shadow PC are only available for AMD64 systems and don\u2019t support ARM64. I was considering exchanging the Pi 400 for a Pi 500+ since my keyboard has some issues, but after doing some more research, it looks like that model is also ARM64\u2014and from what I can tell, all Raspberry Pi models use ARM64 architecture.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a way to run Parsec or Shadow PC on ARM64? I saw that Moonlight supports ARM and I\u2019ve used it before, but I can\u2019t seem to get it working on this setup. I\u2019m guessing it might be due to port forwarding, w",

I was hesitant to use a regular baby cam because of security concerns about being continuously recorded. After seeing PewDiePie\u2019s Raspberry Pi webcam project, I decided to build my own!</p> <p><strong>What I used:</strong> Raspberry Pi 4 (4 GB), Camera Module V2, Python + Flask (for the script), PiCamera2 (to ingest camera feed)</p> <p>Full details + code are on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/harshib",
