And can Trump break China's monopoly? \n\nPresenter: Bernard Smith\n\nGuests: \n\nBrian Wong - Assistant Professor in Philosophy at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nGracelin Baskaran - Mining Economist and Director of the Critical Minerals Security program at Center for Strategic and International Studies. \n\nHuiyao Wang - President and Founder of Center for China and Globalization.",

Small-scale mining accounts for 85% of the country\u2019s gold production, which has surged since the war began, officially reaching 65 tons last year, though analysts estimate the actual figure is much higher. \nIllegal gold trafficking, particularly by the paramilitary RSF, exacerbates challenges posed by the ongoing conflict.\nIn addition to gold, Sudan boasts deposits of copper, uranium, iron ore, and rare earth minerals across regions such as the Nuba Mountains, Darfur, and the Red Sea Hills.\nCopper is increasingly vital as global demand rises with the AI and tech boom, while uranium was set to power collaborations with Russia and China\u2014plans now uncertain due to the war. \nThe River Nile remains pivotal for agriculture and hydroelectric power, and Sudan\u2019s oil reserves, largely concentrated in the south, are strategically transported through pipelines to Port Sudan.\n\nAl Jaze",
