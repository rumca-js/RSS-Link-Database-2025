This will be capable of making autonomous scientific discoveries. The company also plans to reduce the time an AI agent takes to generate answers to queries, dubbed test time compute. By September 2026, the AI firm will launch its first Automated AI Research Intern, which is claimed to make the research process faster. On top of this, RazorPay has announced that it is adopting OpenAI's new Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) to allow users to make card payments while buying products on ChatGPT.",
