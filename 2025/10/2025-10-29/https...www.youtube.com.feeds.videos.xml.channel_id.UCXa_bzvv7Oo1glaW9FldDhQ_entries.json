        "description": "There is a very strong case to be made that Dragon Quest 1 and 2 HD2D is the best, most definitive version of these games to date \u2013 something that is hard to achieve when you are working with games of this stature, and doubly so when those games have had as many varying re-releases over the years as these two have had, and all of which have their own various fans and detractors. \n\nI feel like they bring together all the best parts of the previous releases of the game, add their own modern updates on top, wrap it all up in absolutely gorgeous audiovisual presentation, and do all of this without losing all the various merits, whether intended or borne out of the limitations that come from being a pioneer. And cumulatively, I think that makes both of these games well worth checking out in 2025. They are not the best Dragon Quest games, they are not the best RPGs you can play today - but they are still very much worth playing.",

        "description": "The world \u2013 or Southern California, as Battlefield Studios tells me following its extended logo reveal \u2013 has changed. What seems like an innocuous disaster originating from Fort Lyndon could be a larger attack by the Pax Armata (aka those other guys you shot during the campaign). Your job is to jump, obtain intel and get out before other teams can stop you.\n\nIs this the most original approach for Battlefield: RedSec, EA's new free-to-play battle royale mode and the series' second stab at the genre following the underrated but ultimately underperforming Firestorm? Well, no. But, man, if it doesn't make for a stunning sight when dozens of helicopters swoop in over the ruined landscape, with military chatter buzzing through your headset. The same goes for the imaginatively-named Circle of Death \u2013 a slowly advancing wave of explosions that offers actual fear from instant death if caught inside.",
