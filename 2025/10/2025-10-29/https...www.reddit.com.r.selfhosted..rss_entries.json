From what I gather, there are two main ways to inject secrets into containers: either by running a CLI command (<code>infisical run ...</code>) or by putting the Infisical service and project tokens directly into the <code>docker-compose</code> file. I initially tried the CLI method because it avoids putting tokens in the <code>docker-compose</code>, but the problem is TrueNAS doesn\u2019t give me access to the Docker daemon to run the <code>infisical</code> command, even with <code>sudo</code>. Plus, TrueNAS blocks creating Docker secrets via CLI, and Portainer CE\u2019s GUI doesn\u2019t support secrets management either.</p> <p>That leaves me with the only option of hardcoding the Infisical tokens into the <code>docker-compose</code>, which is exactly what I\u2019m trying to avoid.</p> <p>So, am I missing something here?

I&#39;ve seen Pluto adopt this and now Paramount+ where you basically have a slew of shows and movies moving in real-time where you, the viewer could jump in whenever or wherever, from channel to channel (i.e. like traditional cable television). Channels could either be created or auto-generated. Meta would be grabbed from an external API that in turn could help organize information. I have a technical background so now that I see proof of concept, I was thinking of pursuing this but in regards to a user&#39;s own personal collection of stored video. It would be identical to Plex but with the live aspect I described earlier. I&#39;m still in the concept phase and not looking to create the next Netflix or Plex for that matter. More-less scratching an itch that I&#39;d be hoping to one day share with others. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",
