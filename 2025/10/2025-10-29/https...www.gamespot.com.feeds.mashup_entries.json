As with many video games, Ghost of Yotei makes use of specially marked white stones in order to help guide you on your journey, but it wasn't until I was many hours into the story that it occurred to me: I've been touching bird poop this whole time. </p><p>There is no getting around this, and no mental gymnastics you can do to pretend it's anything else. As Atsu climbs up a mountain, the white rocks eventually lead to a white smeared area at the top. Sure, at this point, perhaps you could say that is chalk or some sort of paint. However, there is <em>always</em> a bird that just so happens to fly away just as you get there. Was that bird simply hanging out and singing a tune? Perhaps, but only if it likes to multitask while delivering an absolutely gargantuan dump. </p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-s",

However, those same video games do, in some rare instances, have the potential to cause injury or sickness. Over the years, there have been some bizarre cases where a person--or group of people--has found themselves in physical pain because of a video game. Perhaps a wrist sprain, eye soreness, or a little headache. </p><p>In general, these injuries and illnesses haven't lasted long, and in most cases, they can even be pretty funny. Sure, at the time they happened, we doubt those suffering were laughing, but it's a whole lot easier to look back on them now. We've even suffered from a few of them, so we've rounded up some of the most prominent and famous video game injuries and sicknesses.</p></p><br/>     <p><h2>Mario Party Blisters</h2><img src=\"https:",
