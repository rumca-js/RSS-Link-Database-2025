Soaring concurrent player-counts and extraordinary sales are usually reserved for Steam games with multiplayer. Those are the games that tend to catch hold and burn hot, then burn out, some months later. But Duckov is a single-player game, or at least it is in its standard form (there are co-operative mods). It's a single-player extraction shooter, which even to write feels like a contradiction - extraction shooters are multiplayer! But not here. You leave your bunker to explore an aggressive world and loot everything you see, returning to base to build and upgrade. Then you do it all over again.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-duckov-is-not-what-i-was-expecting-at-all-and-its-another-startling-reminder-that-perhaps-were-going-about-this-whole-making-games-business-all-wrong\">Read more</a></p>",

As I've <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-7th-guest-vr-is-a-spooky-puzzle-treat-with-way-more-to-offer-than-nostalgia\">mentioned before</a>, it was the year my parents finally relented (after a whole lot of nagging about how vitally important Microsoft Encarta would undoubtedly be to my future career prospects) and the benevolent PC gods squatted upon our household to birth a 486 DX2/66 into the world. But <em>of course</em> it was never about Encarta. Within days, I'd developed an insatiable hunger for PC gaming mags, poring back and forth through increasingly dog-eared pages as a hitherto unimagined world of digital wonder presented itself. LucasArts' Sam & Max: Hit the Road was my inaugural purchase, slowly ballooning to include the likes of Theme Park, The 7th Guest, and Myst. But one game I never quite g",
