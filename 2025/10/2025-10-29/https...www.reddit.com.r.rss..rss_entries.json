Well, I finally did something about it - I built my own RSS reader app!</p> <p>It&#39;s called Today, and after some evening and weekend coding, it&#39;s finally on the App Store. I&#39;m pretty proud of it. </p> <p>The idea came from my work at Automattic (just hit 7 years there this week!), where we use RSS feeds constantly. I kept thinking, &quot;Why isn&#39;t there a simple, clean RSS reader that just... works?&quot; So I made one.</p> <p>The cool part? It has some AI features built in - but the AI runs entirely on your phone, so your reading habits stay private. It can help you figure out what&#39;s worth reading when you have 50 unread articles, or suggest interesting stuff based on what you usually like.</p> <p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/today-rss-reader/id6754362337\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/today-rss-reader",
