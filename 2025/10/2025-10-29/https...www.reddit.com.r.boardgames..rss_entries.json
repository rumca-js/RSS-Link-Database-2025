In splendor, she never shows her tokens before buying a card, and I once caught her paying less for a high value card. She makes people not use the turn at all when you still can take three and discard three tokens when you already have ten tokens. In ticket to ride Europe, she never shows what colour is being used for tunnel attempt and keeps discarding other colours while marking a route for a very specific colour. She also makes us give her more turns at the end so that she can finish her tickets and put long routes and also making 15/21 points for the longer routes (excuse: we didn\u2019t tell her that we are almost done with trains though it is an open info).

The Capra faction board has two green resource slots highlighted, showing both pollen and fiber highlighted. The Appendix states that they start with &quot;2 fiber and/or pollen&quot;. My girlfriend thinks this means she gets to pick up to 2 of each of these as starting resources, but can only keep three total because there&#39;s only three spots on the starting faction boards. My interpretation is that you take two total resources between fiber and pollen. Can anyone help us figure out which is correct? Thank you!</p> <p>Update: She said she won&#39;t listen to randos online, can anyone provide a source? I know it seems pretty clear she&#39;s wrong, but that is making it hard to find something online because no one else is asking this question precisely because it&#39;s so clear.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",

I think he&#39;d like games with tactile pieces like Ticket to Ride or Monopoly, where are things to physically move around the board and pick up. My mother is good with anything- we even play Cards Against Humanity with her when the kids are in bed.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I recently played the base game for the Quest for El Dorado and really liked it. I didn&#39;t play with the cave variant because my group is relatively new to games. I really liked all the concepts, but felt like it was over too quickly. I felt like I didn&#39;t have enough time to reap the benefits of most cards that I bought and the games were more luck than anything else. We for the most part played the beginner to medium maps. I understand deck builders involve a decent bit of luck, which is why I love them because it combines strategy and luck. However, just didn&#39;t feel like strategy mattered much as I&#39;d like. Does this improve with the expansions and cave variant? Should I design longer maps so that it feels more drawn out and more dependent on how your deck is built? Any suggestion or insights are welcome, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ShrimpTaco17\"> /u/Shrimp",

Seems very simple, but the devil is in the details. </p> <p>Both marines and enemies are very fragile: one hit is enough to take them down, and genestealers can never end, unlike marines. And while you roll just a single die whenever anyone attacks, it is a pretty evil kind of die, which loves to let you down.

Because this will be our first purchase (they could be pricey here in my country) we want to buy a one that can cater to 6 or more players just in case our friends also want to try. I also listed additional preferences below (we are not strict with it but we would like to find one that ticks all the boxes). Thank you for the suggestions!</p> <ul> <li>Purely co-op between all players not a 2v2/3v3/Tag team </li> <li>Not requiring one player to play the Monster/Final boss to play the game</li> <li>No round timers.
