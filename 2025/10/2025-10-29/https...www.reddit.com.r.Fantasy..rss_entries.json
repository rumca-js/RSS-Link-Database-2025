I think I read 3 of the 4 books before the film came out and the film just totally put me off the whole series. Not only did I dislike a lot of the casting but I also didn\u2019t appreciate them 1- making Amma and Marian Ashcroft one character and 2 - missing out so many important moments of the book. now I understand that sometime they have to do this but for me it just ruined it all. The casting of old man Ravenswood I liked - always adores Jeremy Irons and personally loved his take on the character.

I usually see it in modern fantasy settings where powerful people would otherwise be fighting in densely populated and urbanized areas, used as a way for the author to get around having to deal too much with the possibility of civilians getting hurt or collateral damage. These &#39;realms&#39; often also have convenient plot side effects like electronics not working, magic being stronger inside, or being filled with monsters that the characters can train against. They&#39;re also obviously useful for settings where magic is a secret, giving the character the place to go all out without unavoidably revealing themselves to the public.</p> <p>Having a predetermined arena for your fights it&#39;s pretty useful to avoid the kind of questions that Marvel had to create &#39;Damage Control&#39; to answer, and also helps avoid the inevitable quest",

Some are done well, some not so much.</p> <p>There&#39;s a sweet spot where a lush world with truly morally grey characters and the story is melded with a background romance that adds to the story and does not distract from it. What are some of the ones you have enjoyed that the plot isn&#39;t carried by the romance but still has that delicious romance sub plot? </p> <p>Give me your favorite books/series that no one talks about. </p> <p>Some of the books I have loved are: Realm of the Elderlings, Black Jewels Trilogy, Kings of the Wyld (yeah this one has like no romance but it was a banger), Throne of Glass series, and Six Scorched Roses. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HistoricalAd9356\"> /u/HistoricalAd9356 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1oipwfg/what_are_the_best_lesser_known_fantasy_books_with/\">[link]</a>",
