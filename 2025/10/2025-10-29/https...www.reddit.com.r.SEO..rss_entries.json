But I don&#39;t have a strong backlink profile, my highest backlink has an authority score of only 20. My website is 10 months old btw</p> <p>So my question is, how imporant are they truly? I feel like I am doing fine without, but I am considering investing time in it to accelerate progress even further. </p> <p>That comes with another question tho, how the f** does one get many backlinks without spending money? Cold outreach has almost never worked for me, and I feel like not many websites accept guest posting anymore or charge for it. What are some other strategies I could attempt? I am a bit lost in the backlink world</p> </di",

Last week it was down 11%</p> <p>In GSC, we&#39;re seeing the opposite, it&#39;s up. Last week up 9%.</p> <p>Can anyone explain this? Or guide me through the steps to validate it?</p> <p>We\u2019re also a Canadian website suspecting the decline results are from Quebec due to cookie law.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FlightTraditional932\"> /u/FlightTraditional932 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.red",
