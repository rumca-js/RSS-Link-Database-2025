But it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/27/trump-javier-mileis-electoral-triumph-argentina\">Donald Trump</a> who emerged the biggest winner.

Keep and combine any trimmings into a ball and re-roll as and when required. Pastry keeps well in the freezer, and by skipping two time-consuming steps in the traditional recipe \u2013 that is, making the pastry and caramelising the onions \u2013 this one comes together about an hour faster. Instead, the onions are cooked upside down, steaming and caramelising beneath a blanket of pastry with anchovies and black olives for a fast, fun twist on a French classic. And if you have less pastry, you can always halve the recipe.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/oct/29/quick-tasty-caramelised-onion-tart-recipe-zero-waste-cooking-tom-hunt\">Continue reading...</a>",
