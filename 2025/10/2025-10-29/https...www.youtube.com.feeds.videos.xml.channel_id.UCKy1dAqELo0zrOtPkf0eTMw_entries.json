So, what better excuse to recap the events of this iconic action sci-fi franchise? From the classic 1987 original Predator, it\u2019s 1990 inner-city sequel Predator 2, the more recent installments like Predators and The Predator, not to mention the xenomorph-infested questionably canon crossovers, Alien Vs. Predator and AVP Requiem, the scattered timeline of this series is almost as confusing as its naming convention. With Prey\u2019s first foray into Predator period-pieces, and the crash course in Predator: Killer of Killers, these alien hunters have been showing up on earth for quite some time now, and based on the trailers, Predator Badlands will take place further into the future than we\u2019ve seen yet, steering as clear of the convoluted canon of the Alien movies and Alien Earth, while still incorporating the shadowy dealings of Weyland-",
