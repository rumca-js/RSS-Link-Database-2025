Preferably that will make me think about it for days and more. A book that will be fascinating to read to and will Hook me up then make me feel like I&#39;ve just read something that will impact my life. I prefer if it&#39;s heavy, fiction or non-fiction doesn&#39;t matter I just want It to be valuable to make me want to read more. If it has a polish translation it would be a welcome thing as despite the fact I understand English rather well still it&#39;s easier to digest the content in a given story through the native language plus I want to broaden my vocabulary.</p> <p>Preferably something that is both meaningful and touches on deeply human topics while also teaching the reader a thing or two</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Post_Mylawn\"> /u/Post_Mylawn </a>",

Just trying my luck here, I&#39;d also like to see reader&#39;s opinions here aside from google. </p> <p>I recently read Asa Akira&#39;s &#39;Insatiable&#39; and it got me out of my reading slump, it was a fun read. I liked reading their experiences in a non linear format. Aside from the sex/drugs, I found more humor with how it was being retold and the unapologetic bluntness. There&#39;s also some kind of conversational aspect to how they write their books, like they&#39;re actually talking to the reader which didn&#39;t make any page feel boring. </p> <p>Do you guys have any other similar books that have some edge of scandal to them with similar elements and tone?

I am a big romance reader and generally have only read manga but have been branching out into novels in the last year and a half or so. I recently read strange weather in Tokyo by Hiromi Kawakami and LOVED it. I\u2019m looking for something similar. Bonus if it\u2019s an age gap relationship (middle aged or older ML), written by a Japanese author and has some element of surrealism, but not mandatory. I have enjoyed some historical fiction from American authors as well, but rarely enjoy the contemporary romance I\u2019ve read (i.e., Ali Hazelwood, Abby Jimenez books) I really just prefer anything without modern pop culture references. I can\u2019t stand when the characters mention listening to Taylor swift and stuff like that in books. Not for me.

I&#39;ve read another book from this author and something about their writing doesn&#39;t go well with me. Was obsessed with the couple tho *Mechanics of Love - literally just finished this one. upset that they only got together for a couple of the last pages though. Would&#39;ve loved to see more of them being obsessed with each other </p> <p>....while we&#39;re here if anyone has age gap(liked 1) The house mistress (bit of a problematic gap but the writing is so good and im upset the author doesn&#39;t have a similar book 2) Mistakes were made - a bit too much angst for my liking bit ",
