Three models show how you can dress up as Glinda, Elfaba, and the cowardly lion from the movie \"Wicked.\" And, no couple has gotten more attention than Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. Swift and Kelce are a great go-to couples costume for Halloween 2025. Labubus were the hottest accessory of the year. They are furry, elf-like creatures with toothy grins, another great costume idea.",
