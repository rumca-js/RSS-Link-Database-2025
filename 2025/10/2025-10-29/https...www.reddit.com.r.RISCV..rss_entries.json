Also if I ever mistype between Sophon, Sophos or Sophgo, I apologize.

This should explain the first paragraph a lot more. I genuenly am thankful they replied to that - they really didn&#39;t need to reply to some odd german dude&#39;s rambling...but they did - props. o.o</p> <blockquote> <p>Dear Ingwie,</p> <p>Thanks for your interest in Sophgo RISC-V products.</p> <p>First of all, for sure we cherish ",
