While I could eventually get it mostly running thanks to Jackify, the speech and music would never run properly except when launching Skyrim unmodded. No amount of DLL overrides, protontricks or launch options helped. </p> <p>Eventually I downloaded and installed GE Proton. The game works perfectly with 500+ mods. </p> <p>So if you&#39;re running into an otherwise unresolvable bug, give GE Proton a try. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bassoonova\"> /u/Bassoonova </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1oitw9v/psa_trouble_getting_a_modded_skyrim_mod_organizer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1oitw9v/psa_trouble_getting_a_modded_skyrim_mod_organizer/\">[comments]</a></span>",
