Most of us are subscribed to dozens of apps, tools, and memberships \u2014 but only use a handful regularly.</p> <p>We\u2019re building a smarter way to track what you\u2019re <em>actually getting</em> from those subscriptions \u2014 and automatically highlight what\u2019s worth keeping (and what\u2019s not).</p> <p>Before we finalize the design and features, we\u2019d love your input.<br/> It\u2019s a short 3-minute survey that\u2019ll help shape how the product works and which problems we tackle first:</p> <p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5GBkD5lbIF4Ok7AoHny6u-n3qrYaO4l8bZXMR3WMY9DSgPw/viewform\">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5GBkD5lbIF4Ok7AoHny6u-n3qrYaO4l8bZXMR3WMY9DSgPw/view",

The important part is that you can&#39;t just turn off the restrictions and can&#39;t even UNINSTALL the app. That&#39;s because it uses Android&#39;s MDM system. If you want to remove the app, you have to wait a specific amount of time that you choose when installing it (ranging from 3 to 30 days). So that&#39;s enough time for you to change your mind, or, at least, you get a guarantee of 3 days with no doom scrolling.</p> <p>So the goal is to achieve the perfect &quot;tool&quot; smartphone: get access to communcation, navigation, banking etc. apps, but no social media, no games, no gambling.
