I remember specifically there was a train with like train robbers and you had to try and shoot them off of the train as it was moving. It was a side scroller game as much as I can remember. </p> <p>I know it&#39;s not a lot to go off of but it&#39;s what I remember of them. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/x-Justice\"> /u/x-Justice </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1oh3gfb/im_looking_for_2_games_from_the_mid_to_late_90s/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1oh3gfb/im_looking_for_2_games_from_the_mid_to_late_90s/\">",

I downloaded it to give it a try, and it&#39;s really sick. There&#39;s no visuals, it&#39;s a completely audio based game down to the menus all having narration, but it&#39;s still a regular game with exploration, combat, everything. It&#39;s a lot of fun and it got me thinking, are there any other games like it that are fully able to be played by people without vision? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DevDaNerd0\"> /u/DevDaNerd0 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1oh0wia/what_games_are_completely_playable_by_blind_people/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1oh0wia/what_games_are_completely_playable_by_blind_people/\">[comments]</a></span>",
