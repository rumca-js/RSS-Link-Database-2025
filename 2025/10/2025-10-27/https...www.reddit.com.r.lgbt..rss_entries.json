I was out as ftm trans, and then \u2018detransitioned\u2019 until recently. I have bouts of severe \u2018dysphoria\u2019 that result in me cutting my hair and hiding away all my makeup and wearing clothes that hide my figure. It always ends, though, only getting bad every couple of months. I think about going on T, what changes it brings that I like or don\u2019t like, and wanting to revamp my entire wardrobe. Otherwise, I\u2019m incredibly feminine in my day to day life. </p> <p>I don\u2019t know what this could be, if anybody could offer advice.
