The drive I put in my pc is making a clicking noise every 5 seconds like clockwork. I know that WD drives have pwl that causes this exact thing, but seagate drives don&#39;t have the same feature. I&#39;m wondering what else it could be, is this normal or am I looking at a bad drive already? I wouldn&#39;t imagine it would fail so soon. But if it is I have others I can swap to.

Don&#39;t use hardware RAID because if your controller dies you&#39;ll end up with quite a big problem to rebuild and recover data, specially if you can&#39;t find the exact model anymore 3. If you have volume to spare and don&#39;t need speed you most likely shouldn&#39;t need RAID 4. Having a UPS and an automated shutdown script is just as important as your actual data</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MorgothTheBauglir\"> /u/MorgothTheBauglir </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ohc1yf/what_lessons_have_you_learned_from_raid_setups/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ohc1yf/what_lessons_have_you_learned_from_raid_setups/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Buy two more 6 TB drives and fill the remaining bays. 2. Replace my current two 6 TB drives with higher-capacity ones (and maybe expand further later).</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to figure out what makes the most sense in terms of cost, performance, and future expansion. Any suggestions or things I should consider?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CucumberMother2850\"> /u/CucumberMother2850 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1oh6fzv/which_drives_should_i_buy_storage_upgrade_advice/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoard",

The photos were mostly from the 70s-80s and I need help trying to find a good scanner that can scan at the best quality.</p> <p>I have three options currently, 1. The Epson Perfection V600 (Might be too slow)</p> <ol> <li><p>The Epson Perfection V850 Pro (Might be overkill for prints)</p></li> <li><p>The Epson FastFoto FF-680W (Might be bad quality, not work with delicate photos, have a lot of maintenance, not be good with blacks)</p></li> </ol> <p>I want to save these photos with the highest quality possible. I used a Canon AE-1 with color Kodak film for the most part (If it matters) I would also want to know what dpi to use for good quality but not too overkill.

I had bad experience with Seagate and usually buy WD My Book but it&#39;s expensive.</p> <p>My logic has been to buy multiple drives because if a huge drive like 22 TB fails then it&#39;s over and I spent a lot of money on it. But at the same time, can&#39;t have a room full of like 4 TB drives, they take up space. So I go with somewhere in the middle like 12 TB drives.</p> <p>About three fourth of my drive remain untouched and the rest is moved to different folders or deleted or edited. I use my drives for home videos, pics from my phone, ebooks and shows I downloaded, music, occasional games or software.</p> <p>I have a few hundred dollars set aside and given my very limited budget (this is it for like a year), I want to make the best of things. How should I approach this? What brands and what models and what types of drive?",
