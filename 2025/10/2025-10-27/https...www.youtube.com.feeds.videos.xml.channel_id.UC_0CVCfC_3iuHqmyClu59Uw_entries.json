        "description": "In this video, we take a first look at the all-new Ayn Thor, one of the most unique handhelds to hit the scene. Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, this dual-screen AMOLED gaming handheld feels like a modern-day Nintendo DS \u2014 but way more powerful.\nWe go over the design, specs, ergonomics, software, and dual-screen functionality that make the Thor stand out. From the bright 120 Hz AMOLED main display to the customizable lower screen UI, this thing is sleek, fast, and surprisingly lightweight.\nWe also cover emulation performance, including PSP, Wii U, and 3DS gameplay, and discuss how the dual-screen setup actually enhances the experience. Whether you\u2019re into Android gaming, emulation, or just love new handheld tech \u2014 this might be one of the coolest designs yet.\n\nBuy the AYN Thor Here: https://www.ayntec.com/products/ayn-thor\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Halloween sale code for softwa",
