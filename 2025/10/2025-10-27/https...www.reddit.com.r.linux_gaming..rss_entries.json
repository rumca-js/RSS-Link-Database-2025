I&#39;ve just installed Reshade in to FFXIV (non steam version) and I think it&#39;s installed correctly (I followed the instructions for installing Reshade with scripts provided by kevinlekiller). At the end it says I need to:</p> <p>Run the game with this system variable set: WINEDLLOVERRIDES=&quot;d3dcompiler_47=n;dxgi=n,b&quot; </p> <p>Now, I actually don&#39;t know what this means nor how I would do this on a non-steam game. I tried running FFXIV without doing this step, but it comes up with errors of not compiling certain .fx files so I imagine this missing step is causing this. All advice is appreciated from this new Linux user.</p> <p>The specific distro I am using is Bazzite. I can also provide more details if needed.

For example, in Red Dead Redemption 2, l used to get a stable 80 FPS on high settings, but now the game is unplayable (around 5 FPS). I&#39;m also experiencing major FPS drops in less demanding games. l&#39;ve installed the latest drivers for my graphics card and tried running games through Proton&#39;s compatibility mode, but nothing has helped.

The devs of Winboat have made a tutorial on how you can get single GPU acceleration. It took me a little bit but I love how I can just press one key and windows loads and I can use the professional apps that require GPU acceleration. Right now the performance is like 25% which is better than nothing. In my opinion it&#39;s way better than messing with scripts and having black screens most of the time for single GPU passthrough. I hope one day it&#39;s possible to play games like this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aynmable\"> /u/Aynmable </a> <br/> <s",
