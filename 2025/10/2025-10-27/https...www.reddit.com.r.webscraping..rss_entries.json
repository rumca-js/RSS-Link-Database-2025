I am scraping job websites like indeed etc. I use tor when I can but the vast majority of sites pretty much just block all tor exit nodes. I am not sending any cookies or any information I care about in the requests since I am scraping without an account. From testing I have already seen some free proxies man in the middle attack me and send back malicious responses, but I should be okay? My code looks for certain things to determine if the request was successful, and if it is not present throws it away. I don&#39;t see how malicious proxies could affect me, other than tracking my use of them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dfgdfgdfgdfgdfgd123\"> /u/dfgdfgdfgdfgdfgd123 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1oh1xtb/free_proxies/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping",
