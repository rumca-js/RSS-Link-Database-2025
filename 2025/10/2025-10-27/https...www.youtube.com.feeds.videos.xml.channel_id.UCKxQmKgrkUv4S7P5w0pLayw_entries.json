        "description": "Batman: Dark Patterns Vol. 1 - We Are the Wounded\n\n\u25b8 Set during the early years of Batman\u2019s career, Batman: Dark Patterns delves into four mysterious cases as he attempts to cement his place as Gotham City\u2019s protector while the city itself fights back against him. This is the Dark Knight Detective at his most stripped-down core, a man relying on his wits, his skills, and little else as he tackles some of the most twisted mysteries Gotham City and its protector have ever encountered.\n\nCase 01: We Are Wounded\n\nA series of sickeningly gruesome murders has sent shock waves through Gotham. Are these the random works of a serial killer, or is there something more sinister at play? Batman attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery before any more victims are claimed.\n\nFOLLOW ME HERE!\n\u25b8 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/ComicsExplainedSub\n\u25b8 Twitter: http://twitter.com/Comicsexplained\n\u25b8 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/comicsexplained\n\nVideos Everyone Loves:\n\u25b8 New To Invincible?
