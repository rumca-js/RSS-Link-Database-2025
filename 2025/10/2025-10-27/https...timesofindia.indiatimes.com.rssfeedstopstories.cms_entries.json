        "description": "Jad Tarifi, founder of Integral AI and former Google AI team member, warns that PhDs may no longer guarantee relevance in the fast-moving AI era. He argues that multi-year degrees risk obsolescence before completion and should only be pursued by those genuinely obsessed with their field. Instead, he advocates learning from life, developing emotional intelligence, and embracing adaptability. Tarifi suggests that passion, not credentials, is the key to staying ahead in a world where technology evolves rapidly.",
