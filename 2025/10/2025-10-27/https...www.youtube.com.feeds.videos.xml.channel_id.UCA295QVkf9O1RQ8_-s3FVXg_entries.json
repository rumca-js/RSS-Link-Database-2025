This video dives into the paradox: from Japan\u2019s ghost villages and South Korea\u2019s record-low fertility to India\u2019s looming OADR shift, we map how fewer births ripple into schools, jobs, taxes, and power. We unpack the \u201cwhy\u201d beyond \u201cit\u2019s expensive\u201d: contraception and choice, changing marriage norms, career incentives, hypergamy debates, climate dread\u2014and yes, the real rupee cost of raising a child in 2025.\nWe track the financial, emotional, and opportunity trade-offs, then zoom out to policy misfires (Romania\u2019s Ceau\u0219escu era) and the coming demographic center of gravity in Africa. This isn\u2019t pro or anti-kids; it\u2019s about making an informed choice with eyes wide open.\n\nWatch till the end for a grounded, human conclusion that brings the debate home.\n\n\ud83d\udcccFollow us on Instagram here: htt",
