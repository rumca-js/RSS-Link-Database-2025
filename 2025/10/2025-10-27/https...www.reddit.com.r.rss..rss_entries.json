The original idea was simple \u2014 I wanted an easy way to share what I\u2019m reading and discovering online with my friends, integrated with major social networks.</p> <p>It turns out the project did better than I expected (despite a few hiccups along the way). So now I\u2019d love to share the latest version and a demo with you all \u2014 and I\u2019d really appreciate any <strong>feedback or ideas</strong> to help improve it.</p> <p>Thanks for taking a look! \ud83d\ude4f</p> <p>\ud83d\udd17 <a href=\"https://feeder.works\">feeder.works</a><br/> \ud83d\udcbb <a href=\"https://github.com/runawaydevil/thefeeder\">GitHub Repo</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/runawaydevil\"> /u/runawaydevil </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1ohno6o/i_built_the_feeder_a_tool_to_sh",
