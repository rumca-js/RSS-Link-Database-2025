        "description": "[The Conversation Africa] In Africa, less than one in five continental airline routes are direct. Air connections are decided by factors like trade levels, diplomatic relations, and whether there's enough demand to make a route financially worthwhile. Because there are so few direct connections in Africa, getting from one country to another often requires travellers to fly to Europe or the Middle East and transit there. This increases the costs of travel within Africa, and limits tourism and investment flows.",
