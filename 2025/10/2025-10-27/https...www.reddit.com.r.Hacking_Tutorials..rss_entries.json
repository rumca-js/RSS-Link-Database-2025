I am a supervisor and I had an employee text me and tell me that he thinks i accidentally shared a note from my note app that was super inappropriate. He then told me he deleted it but doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. Since he said he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, I can\u2019t press him. However, I haven\u2019t used my notes app for anything in a really long time and I have found no evidence on my end that there was any note created recently to share. I even looked through my deleted notes and my iCloud. And the notes I do have are mainly grocery lists\u2026 There isn\u2019t even a link suggestion in my text thread to said person. This is a really good employee and I don\u2019t think he would make this up.</p> <p>This is the paranoia part\u2026 I do have two people I work with whom I could see forging a note and putting it in my name to look bad\u2026 Everything I search says it\u2019s imp",
