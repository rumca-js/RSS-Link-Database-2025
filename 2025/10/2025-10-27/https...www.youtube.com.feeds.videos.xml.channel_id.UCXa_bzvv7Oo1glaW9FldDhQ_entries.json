        "description": "Promising the most substantial overhaul for generations, Sports Interactive\u2019s now not-so annual football management sim returns after a year-long hiatus. Football Manager 26\u2019s core focus appears to be streamlining: overhauling UI for quicker decision making, sharpening tactical flow to reflect the modern game, and smoothing recruitment to foster frictionless squad development season-by-season, and more. \n\nIn many ways, FM26 is a suite of overhauled systems to purposely renovate the game\u2019s fundamentals. Supporting these innovations is the series\u2019 switch to Unity Engine, bringing a graphical overhaul which Sports Interactive have used to boost FM26\u2019s authenticity and realism. This video discusses 15 things to know before buying; with streamlining the overarching focus, getting the best out of any squad - from global icons to lower leagues - could be the most enjoyable it\u2019s ever been.",

        "description": "Bounty Star's overall cozy pace feels at odds with its gameplay loop, where repetitive activities lead to boredom more than relaxation. Even the side bounties begin to repeat, but you can't pursue their optional objectives again for more cash. \n\nIf the combat felt more fluid or the missions offered more variety \u2013 heck, even if the story kept up with Clementine's character development rather than serving as an accessory, Bounty Star could have stood out. Instead, it teeters more towards sedative than contemplative on the regular.",
