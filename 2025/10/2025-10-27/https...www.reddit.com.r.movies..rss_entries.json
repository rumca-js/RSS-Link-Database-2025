Maybe a friend had a copy, It was so long ago. </p> <p>I\u2019ve rewatched it a few times since then and am unhappy with how difficult it is to get a hold of a legitimate copy. Right now it seems like the only way you can watch officially is with the DVD, which only offers standard definition.</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen some clips of a remaster online and it looks fantastic. Why they\u2019re sitting on it is beyond me. Sometimes, movies like this have a scuffed fell and look better in SD (imo), but this definitely has so much potential as a fully officially remastered film. They recently just put out Live in Pompeii in IMAX, and it was incredible. I\u2019m curious how many people think for the 45th anniversary here in 2028 if they\u2019ll do some",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I wanted a \u201cpurely entertainment\u201d movie and decided to watch Jurassic World Rebirth. I knew it wasn\u2019t gonna be good but did not expect it to be so bad. One of the main reasons why is that it looks CHEAP, but I don\u2019t know how to explain. I expected a lot of CGI and green screen stuff, but it somehow looked like it was something low budget from 2002 despite being a big studio film from this year. I had this feeling with a couple of movies recently and I wanna complain correctly lol so can someone who understands a bit more about VFX help me understand?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Used-Treat-1100\"> /u/Used-Treat-1100 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oh2tgr/how_come_expensive_movies_look_so_cheap/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oh2tgr/how_come_expensive_movies_look_so_cheap/\">[comments]</a></span>",
