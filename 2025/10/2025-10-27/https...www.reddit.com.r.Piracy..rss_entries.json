The reason i want to do that is that internet quota where I live is limited to 200Gbs a month used by a family of 4-5 persons, and it barely lasts 20 days without downloading something big, so I need a way to handle the heavy lifting online and only pull down the smaller compressed files.</p> <p>Looking specifically for services that support AV1 (for max efficiency) or H.265/HEVC, with good specs like GPU acceleration, parallel processing, and handling for massive files.

Unfortunately in most cases, the bitrate isn&#39;t mentioned in posts on indexers so I&#39;m going to show you how you can easily calculate this yourself so you know what quality movie you&#39;re getting.</p> <p>The formula to calculate the overall bitrate (video + audio + subtitles) is as follows:<br/> <strong>Size of the file (without any reparation files) / length of the video in minutes / 0.007.</strong></p> <p>So if you see a movie post with a size of 55 GB and movie length of 120 minutes, you load the nzb into NZBget/SABNZB for example and there you can easily see that the size of the actual file without reparation files is 50 GB. Now you apply the formula to get the overall bitrate of the file: <strong>50 / 120 / 0.007 = 59.5 Mbit/s.</strong></p> <p>It can be that the movie you&#39;re downloadi",

This was so artists could be compensated for private copies. I&#39;ll repeat myself, private copies of material you&#39;ve already owned, not piracy.

I&#39;d love to leave Spotify and go &quot;off grid&quot; somewhat with my music and just have an MP3 player. I used to download music years ago but the game has changed and I&#39;m new to it all. One thing that did irritate me is some of the titles had symbols like dollar signs and other bs that would often hide the songs in the heap of an &quot;Unknown&quot; playlist. Is there a site that&#39;s easy to use, has cover art for the song and a proper title? I have a huge library and would need a site that has access to LARGE number of artist even some that are underground.
