I\u2019m specifically looking for fantasy settings. I\u2019ve been browsing xenofiction, but most of it seems to be animal fiction which I don\u2019t want and the few that weren\u2019t were sci-fi. </p> <p>There\u2019s such an abundance of races/species in fantasy; I just want a story where the pov isn\u2019t human. Doesn\u2019t matter how humanoid or inhuman the protagonist is, so long as it is apparent that they aren\u2019t. Basically, if they could be switched for a human without major consequence then the story doesn\u2019t apply. </p> <p>The best example I know would be Books of the Raksura by Martha Wells. I\u2019m in the middle of that series and it strikes so many chords that I love but don\u2019t really see anywhere that I\u2019m craving more. </p> <p>I would love to see more reccomendations from you if you know of any.

In the movie, a man from space crash-lands on a planet whose culture resembles vikings\u2013and a space monster crashes with him that he wants to kill. He, with his advanced knowledge, gets help from the more primitive vikings to kill this creature, who they understandably believe to be a dragon-esque creature.</p> <p>This idea of a person being placed back in time, or in another world, far less advanced than the one they came from, and helping them defeat a common enemy, is really cool to me. It\u2019s an idea that lends itself to sci-fi or fantasy. So I was hoping I could get some story recommendations that mirror this set-up. I would like the world to be either medieval or viking-esque, I would like it to have action, and even a little romance is okay.</p> <p>*As an ",

What really struck me is how human he feels \u2014 he still acts like a teenager, full of emotion, awkwardness, and growth. He doesn\u2019t abuse memories from his past life, nor does he get some overpowered system or divine gift \u2014 no golden finger, no hidden cheat, just pure effort and hard work.</p> <p>There\u2019s no random apocalypse or forced \u201csave the world\u201d plot pushing him forward. Instead, he chooses to improve himself. The side characters \u2014 especially his family \u2014 actually feel alive with their own goals, beliefs, and pace. They\u2019re not just background NPCs orbiting the MC\u2019s life.</p> <p>What really sold me is how grounded the progression feels. The MC isn\u2019t overpowered; he struggles to even keep up with his peers. When tragedy hits, it\u2019s emotional but no",

I felt the novice and nun relationships closely resembled those of the Harry Potter books, but I think that\u2019s a good thing.
