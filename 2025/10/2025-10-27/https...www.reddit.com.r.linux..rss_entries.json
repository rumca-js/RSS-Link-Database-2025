Earlier this year I started working on a Linux distro which would help me further understand OS design.</p> <p>After a short amount of work I found that what I had was just Arch with some re-wording done, despite the fact I had plans for other parts to the system I was and am yet to develop. It made me lose motivation until I had an idea when I woke up this morning. It&#39;s still for me to learn and get experience from but if people like the idea, I may actively work on it once I finish the initial development.</p> <p>If you think it&#39;s a bad idea then that&#39;s fine since the goal isn&#39;t to replace anything else or have something that anyone would actively use but rather just for me to have fun and potentially make a YouTube video out of.</p> <p>Blog post: <a href=\"https://songbird-project-blog.pages.dev/blog/the-plan-for",
