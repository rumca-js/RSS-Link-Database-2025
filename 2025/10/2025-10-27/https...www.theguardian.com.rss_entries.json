Here\u2019s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic</strong><br>\n \u201cDo you think somebody could kidnap a kid and keep him underground \u2026 in the sewers?\u201d For those of us who have been far too terrified of Stephen King\u2019s Pennywise to ever watch the It franchise, this origin prequel series is best watched through fingers (or with eyes closed throughout). Developed by the team behind the more recent films, the supernatural horror is set in 60s America, following the events of a small town with missing locals, plucky kids, gruesome goings-on and suspicious new residents. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd reprises his role as the evil clown, but it\u2019s not just him doing the petrifying.

I\u2019ve had one about almost every home I\u2019ve ever known and the idea of those spaces never quite leaves. Imaginary they may be, but not consciously made-up, and so they persist as supernatural aspects of place that are particular and real to me. It\u2019s with a similar thrill that I find myself eight miles from home staring at something I&nbsp;never knew was here. A labyrinth. Not a neopagan installation, but likely one of just a handful of turf&nbsp;mazes in Britain, and the smallest, possibly, in Europe, at under 6&nbsp;metres across.</p><p>Having spotted it on Google Maps while looking for something else, I dropped everything to come, as if delay might show it to be another dream.
