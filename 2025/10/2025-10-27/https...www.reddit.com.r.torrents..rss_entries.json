I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s possible to set a tracker like <code>http://&lt;myPublicIp&gt;:&lt;forwardedPort&gt;/announce</code>, but apparently it won&#39;t help at making long-lasting connections because every time I reconnect to the VPN (I have a ProtonVPN Plus subscription) the public IP and forwarded port change.</p> <p>Is it possible to use BitTorrent the way I intend?
