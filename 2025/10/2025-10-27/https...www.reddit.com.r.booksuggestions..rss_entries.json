I listened to The brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky and liked it too. </p> <p>Then I listened to The idiot and Crime and punishment, once again trying to replicate the joy I got from the books, but they weren&#39;t as spriritual as I had hoped. I also listened to White nights and The dream of a ridiculous man, both of which I enjoyed. </p",

I&#39;m actually craving for some Ghost Romance, I have read many with male ghosts. Do you have any recommendations for any Romance books, with a female Ghost and a alive man? I have actually read a prompt and it made me curious, as if book like this is actually written by some authors. Please do recommend books in any form, PDF, Epub, Kindle, Wattpad, AO3 and others.
