With meaningful upgrades such as a ProMotion display, better battery life, and improved camera sensors, Apple has made it a much better deal overall. This year, Apple has poured so many upgrades into its standard model that I'll recommend it to most people, not just first-time iPhone buyers or those on a budget.",

        "description": "Apple is reportedly developing a vapour chamber cooling system for the next-generation iPad Pro, expected around spring 2027. According to analyst Mark Gurman\u2019s Power On newsletter, the feature will improve heat dissipation, allowing the device to stay thin and maintain strong performance during heavy use. The new iPad Pro will likely feature Apple\u2019s 2nm M6 chip, debuting in Macs next year. Apple first introduced vapour chamber cooling in the iPhone 17 Pro series, which effectively reduced overheating, especially during gaming.",
