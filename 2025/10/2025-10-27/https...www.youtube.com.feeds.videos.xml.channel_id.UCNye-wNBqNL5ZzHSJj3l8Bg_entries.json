With global access, this three-part series examines the real consequences of climate change for our civilisation, through the rest of the 21st century and beyond.\n\nIrish journalist Philip Boucher-Hayes visits climate hotspots, from Greenland\u2019s melting glaciers to sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s weather extremes, from the flooding of agricultural land in Bangladesh to the thaw of the Siberian permafrost.

That's about 66,000 tonnes of unexploded ordnance scattered across the territory.\nAt least 53 people have been killed and hundreds injured by the explosives left behind.\n\nReconstruction in Gaza faces further obstacles from unexploded ordnance.
