My budget is a bit tighter now than it was when I initially built my server, so I want to avoid unnecessary expenses. I\u2019ve observed that my HDD temperatures are quite high, and I\u2019m looking to switch to a better-ventilated solution. I have a rack with a shelf that originally housed a SilverStone Sugo Series SG12 SST-SG12B-V2. However, I needed more space, so I upgraded to a Fractal Design Node 804. Despite having multiple fans, I\u2019m unable to achieve sufficient airflow to keep my seven 28TB drives cool. I\u2019m considering the Rosewill 4U Server Chassis Rackmount Case | 15 3.5\u201d HDD Bays as the best option. Ideally, I would like to transition to a proper rackmount server or a separate JBOD, but my system performs exceptionally well aside from the heat issue. I don\u2019t want to invest in building something new at the moment. Thank you in advance for your guidance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; ",
