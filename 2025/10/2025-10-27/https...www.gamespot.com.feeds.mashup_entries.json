You'll rarely catch me at a time in my life when I'm not reading, watching, or playing something in the genre. If you can relate, then you surely also love the Halloween season, because it's a time when so many others try to match your vibe, if only for a few weeks.

During the Halloween season, Twitch itself gets in on the action with its annual Fright Fest, which is back for 2025.
