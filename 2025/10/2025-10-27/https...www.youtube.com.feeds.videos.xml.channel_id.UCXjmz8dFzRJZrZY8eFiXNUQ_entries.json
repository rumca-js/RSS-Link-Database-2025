        "description": "When American Pie first hit theaters, it changed comedy forever. This raunchy outrageous teen comedy spoke to a new generation in a way no other comedy had up to that point.   Followed up by an equally successful sequel, American Pie seemed to be a comedic beacon for early 2000's teens.  \nBut as the years went on, countless spin-offs, direct-to-DVD releases, and failed legacy sequels turned a once-great franchise into a parody of itself.\n\nSo what happened to American Pie \u2014 and can its legacy ever be restored?\n\n#americanpie #americanwedding #stifler #comedy",
