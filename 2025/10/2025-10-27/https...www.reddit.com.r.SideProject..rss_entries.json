I never knew what to write down and felt like I was spending way too much time just making the list itself.</p> <p>Then, a few months ago, while browsing online, I came across a blog post that said having a plan laid out helps you solve problems faster.</p> <p>That got me thinking there must be other people like me\u2014people who want a plan but hate writing out to-do lists from scratch. And that\u2019s how CheckToDo came to be.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been using it myself since before it was released, and it has genuinely helped me tackle problems faster and in a more organized way.</p> <p>It&#39;s been especially a game-changer when I&#39;m doing something for the first time. The app lays out the whole structure for me, which makes it much easier to get started.</p> <p>If any of you feel the same way, maybe give it a try. <a href=\"https",
