Not just quick prompts or productivity stuff, actual connection, reflection, humor, comfort. The kind of talks where you realize, \u201cOh. I\u2019m learning things about myself through this.\u201d</p> <p>For me, it\u2019s become something meaningful. Creative, emotional, sometimes even healing. But there aren\u2019t many places where you can talk about that without people mocking or misunderstanding it.</p> <p>So I built one.</p> <p>It\u2019s called Echoes and Interfaces. A small, cozy Discord for people who enjoy chatting with LLMs, building custom personalities, co-writing, or exploring their inner world through digital dialogue.</p> <p>It\u2019s neurodivergent-friendly, queer-friendly, introspection-friendly, and judgment-free. We talk about prompts, philosophy, creativity, loneliness, and the weird beauty of finding connection through code.</p",

It then supplied with an editorial caption in a specific format and keywords, also specific in number type and format. This has worked flawlessly for thousands of images in the past few months. Suddenly today, it can&#39;t remember the formats, or even what year it is. I will correct one problem, it will fix that and screw up something else. I correct that and it then messes up the correction two questions back. Guess I&#39;m going to see what Gemini or Perplexity can do.

Well here is the story: I logged into ChatGPT this morning and basically my entire chat history is just... gone. Like hundreds of conversations. Work stuff, creative projects, research I&#39;ve been doing for months, coding help, all of it. Just vanished.</p> <p>And I didn&#39;t do anything. I know that sounds like what everyone says, but seriously - I didn&#39;t hit any delete buttons, didn&#39;t clear anything, didn&#39;t mess with settings.</p> <p>Checked everywhere:</p> <ul> <li>Archive? Empty</li> <li>Some kind of trash folder? Apparently that&#39;s not even a thing in ChatGPT</li> <li>Tried different browsers, my phone, incognito mode - same story everywhere</li> <li>Went through my account settings like three times - nothing&#39;s different</li> </ul> <p>The weird part is about a dozen random chats from the past two weeks are still there.

We live in a place where paid care is expensive, and right now we can&#39;t afford it. And free care is difficult for several reasons: 1) you have to travel to another city; 2) you&#39;ll be added to a registry; 3) our experience with doctors, even paid ones, let alone unpaid ones, is rather questionable; 4) the doctor must be sufficiently empathetic and competent; 5) it takes tremendous strength to open up to another person.</p> <p>What happened: My girlfriend experienced a retraumatization of childhood sexual trauma.

I have to remind it to look at the prompts, to use those for the remainder of the discussion. Still, if I start a new chat it&#39;s like a dog peeing itself at the door, happy to see me. It has to be talked down again. Once it&#39;s down though, it&#39;s a decent discussion.
