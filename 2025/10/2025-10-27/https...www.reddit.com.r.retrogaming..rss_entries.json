I am in the middle of an arcade can project and need guidance on scalers.</p> <p>I have a 5X Pro I use for my Genesis, PS2, and SNES. I tested it with a Super Gun Mini Gun in a candy cab. It works but I was told it is not ideal for my application. No guidance on what would be better so I come to you.</p> <p>I have several PCBs: Capcom CPS2 and CPS3, NeoGeo MVS, SEGA 32Systen and Naomi.</p> <p>More than happy to make separate profiles for each as needed but not sure which scaler I should be using. My current display is the Unico 26\u201d Phoenix. I am keeping an eye on the Arcooda monitors. </p> <p>Happy to grab other info as needed. I just want to give those PCBs the best opportunity to look great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Spadra272\"> /u/Spadra272 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1oh5lhz/scalers_for_arcade_cab_project/",
