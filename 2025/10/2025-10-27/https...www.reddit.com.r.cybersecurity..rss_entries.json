I find their content to be quite good.</p> <p>I&#39;m taking cybersecurity seriously and am considering purchasing a premium course. Would you recommend buying TCM Academy&#39;s premium course or THM Premium? If you have some other recommendations, that&#39;s too appreciated.</p> <p>Just to clarify, I don&#39;t need an A+ certification, as I\u2019m already working in tech support and as a junior networking admin. However, I would like to revisit networking topics. My goal is to build an industry-level portfolio through homelabbing, acquire relevant certifications, and gain practical experience.</p> <p>Thanks in advance for your suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ill_Web3\"> /u/Ill_Web3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ohc814/seeking_advice_before",

Feel like lately it has been \u201cstressful\u201d but not \u201cchallenged\u201d enough. I can manage my tasks but the reason why I had chosen this path is because I expect my days to be always different or at least be interesting. But lately it has just been repetitive. Maybe I\u2019ve joined the wrong companies? I\u2019ve always been in medium-small companies so maybe I should aim for a more bigger global-ish company that would allow me to go into different roles.</p> <p>I have expressed it multiple times to my boss that I want to build playbooks + automations, which to be fair I have but not often because those now gets passed on to someone else.
