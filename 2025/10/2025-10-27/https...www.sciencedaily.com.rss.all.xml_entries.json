The study followed thousands of adults for two decades, linking poor oral health with major cardiovascular events. Regular dental checkups dramatically reduced these risks, hinting that simple oral care could play a vital role in stroke prevention.",

Despite models predicting a decline, researchers found that freshening surface waters are currently keeping deep CO2 trapped below. This stratification effect may be only temporary, as intensifying winds bring deep, carbon-rich water closer to the surface. If mixing increases, the Southern Ocean could begin releasing more CO2 than it absorbs.",
