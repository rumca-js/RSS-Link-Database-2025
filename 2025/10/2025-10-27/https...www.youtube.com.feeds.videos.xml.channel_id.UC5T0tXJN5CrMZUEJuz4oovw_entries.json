A history module called Decolonizing Tolkien et al, taught at the University of Nottingham, uses a text that says orcs and other dark-skinned characters in the trilogy are the victims of \u201cethnic chauvinism\u201d. - The Telegraph\n\nHere we go again, not a year goes by without some activist/academic attacking our beloved Professor. If someone thinks orcs are anything other than creatures, they told on themselves.\nThis is not a debate about orcs or the villains of Middle-earth, it is a battle for our culture.\n#amazon #lordoftherings #ringsofpower \nEdited by @QTRBlackGarrett",
