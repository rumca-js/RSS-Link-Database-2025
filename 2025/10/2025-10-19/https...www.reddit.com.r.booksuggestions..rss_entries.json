This person actually loves to read and for Christmas this year I\u2019d like to find a book that could help gently shift their perspective (something that reminds the reader that money, status, and possessions don\u2019t define a meaningful life, and that empathy, kindness, and human connection matter far more).

The story explores Hattie&#39;s relationship with her uncle, her family&#39;s struggles to cope with his condition, and the tragic events that unfold during the summer. </p> <p>If I liked this book when I was a young reader, do you have any ideas what I might like as an adult? I\u2019m not looking for youth novels or children\u2019s novels, I mean literary fiction novels with a similar kinds of themes?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Purple_Fox5479\"> /u/Purple_Fox5479 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1oac9ad/as_a_kid_i_loved_this_book_what_should_",

I liked the quick pace, and that I was hooked enough to not put the book down. However, I did find some of the plot points a bit laughable/unrealistic and very cringey. Like I said, I enjoyed them nonetheless, but am seeking recommendations that are similarly addicting and fast paced but possibly less cringe? These books helped get me out of a reading slump and I want to keep riding the wave!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/treeappreciator\"> /u/treeappreciator </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1oabjw2/something_like_the_housemaid_butbetter/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1oabjw2/something_like_the_housemaid_butbetter/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Specifically in either the paranormal (ghosts/hauntings specifically\u2014 bonus points if it features a creepy doll of some sort, but it isn\u2019t necessary) or slasher subgenres. (please note that when I say slasher, I mean something kinda reminiscent of fun, classic horror movies. I\u2019m not interested in anything overly disturbing, upsetting, or disgusting. In movie terms, I want something like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, NOT like\u2026 Saw or Terrifier, if that makes sense).</p> <p>These are the main things that I\u2019m interested in reading, however, I\u2019m willing to give other things a try! So if you\u2018ve got something that doesn\u2019t quite fit this criteria but is still in the horror genre, feel free to recommend it! I might give it a try anyway.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SisterKosho\"> /u/SisterKosho </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
