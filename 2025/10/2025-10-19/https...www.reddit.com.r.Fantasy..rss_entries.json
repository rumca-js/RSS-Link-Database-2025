Ideally, something dark, mature, and immersive \u2014 where every page feels heavy with mystery, prophecy, and danger. Nothing is too grim or too dark for me but it all has to make sense.</p> <p>As reference points, I absolutely loved:</p> <p>Empire of the Vampire \u2013 I adored the worldbuilding, the vampire hierarchy, how truly terrifying they are, and the revelations that unfold (especially at the end of book 2). The grim tone, the sense of death at every step, and the feeling that something monumental is always lurking behind the curtain and how everything is slowly unravelled.</p> <p>The Suneater series \u2013 I love the first-person perspective, the slow uncovering of ancient civilizations and forgotten truths, and how the antagonists are more than just \u201cevil\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re complex, frightening, and fascinating. The mystical and prophetic undertone",

I read all of <em>The Witcher</em> books this year and absolutely loved them, but since they\u2019re more of a modern take on the genre, they do a lot of deconstruction of traditional fantasy.</p> <p>I imagine a lot of newer fantasy books do this too, since they\u2019re often built on older stories and try to stand out by being different. But I\u2019d really like to experience something that has that more traditional, classic fantasy feel.</p> <p>The closest I\u2019ve read so far is <em>Conan the Barbarian.</em><br/> If possible, I\u2019d prefer something that isn\u2019t too long. I know I\u2019d never make it through <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.
