Glad to be joining this community!</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of starting my own home project and I&#39;ve been instantly overwhelmed by all the available possibilities. I want something to run apps like Sonarr/Radarr for series/films and basic backups, which could be automated or manual. Maybe could even use internet file access to replace other services like Dropbox/GDrive.</p> <p>Considering all this, and based on some comments recovered around the subreddit, I will get an <a href=\"https://aoostar.com/es/products/aoostar-r1-2-bay-40t-storage-nas-intel-n100-mini-pc-black?variant=49817168838954\">AOOSTAR R1 </a>(16 + 512GB configuration) and install Unraid on it. I&#39;ll start using a couple old 3,5 1Tb HDDs I had lying around, but will eventually upgrade them as required.</p> <p>Would you say this is a good starting setup or would you change something of it? I can&#39;t spend much more money, otherwise I would go for UGREEN NASyng DXP2800, ",
