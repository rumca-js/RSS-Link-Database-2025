I ideally want to backup my entire PC image since here recently Microsoft has been breaking things and I am planning to upgrade to Windows 11 sometime soon. I also need to enable some BIOS level settings for games, which a friend of mine broke his bootloader doing, after I had already rebuilt it once, ended up being too far gone and had to wipe everything, luckily his PC is pure gaming stuff so he said he wasn&#39;t losing anything important at all.</p> <p>For the most part, this drive setup could just be cold storage as I don&#39;t mind storing all of my active working files on my PC and then transferring them off once complete and delivered.
