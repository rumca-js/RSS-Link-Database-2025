So I have a good Alienware desktop PC, and an old 2013 Dell multimedia laptop that actually lasted a surprisingly long time - I used it up until 2021, and it still played a lot of indy games from GOG and everything until then, it has Windows on it. So it did become painfully slow till the end of use and I think it was Windows slowing it down. So now I have need for taking a laptop elsewhere, just for word processing and study (with reading scientific papers online). I\u2019m curious, is there a simple Linux version that I could install on it (deleting windows) that would make it run decent again just for these couple of activities? Or should I just buy a new laptop. Thank you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",
