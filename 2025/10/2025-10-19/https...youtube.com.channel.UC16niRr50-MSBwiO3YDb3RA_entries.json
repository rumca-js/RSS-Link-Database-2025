        "description": "Today, new allegations against Prince Andrew have appeared in the Sunday newspapers, accusing him of asking his police protection to investigate Virginia Giuffre just before the newspaper published a photo of her alleged first meeting with the prince. Prince Andrew has not commented on the reports, but consistently denies all allegations against him.\n\nVictoria Derbyshire and Simon Jack stand in for Laura and Paddy, joining Henry to discuss the latest accusations as well as what options are left for politicians, and the Royal Family, as Giuffre\u2019s brother asks for the King to strip Andrew of his title as Prince.\n\nPlus, how do we get our energy bills down? Energy secretary Ed Milliband, his shadow Claire Coutinho, and Green party leader Zack Polanski all spoke to Victoria this morning and offered alternative visions. But what do the public want?\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
