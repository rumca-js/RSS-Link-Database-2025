Hah, they&#39;re allergic to MicroSD slot that&#39;s why. And my retro file space is atrocious too. I need my 1.5TB MicroSD which currently sits in this RG Slide. Sliding controller is a huge bonus too, unlike phones. I rather my handheld very pocketable and compact and one that has a controller.

Too much hassle setting them up, not enough time with family,kids, business. I have my NES, Saturn, Wii and Wii U, PS1,2,3, 4 pro, Genesis w/32x, Virtual Boy, Gameboy SP, Dreamcast, Xbox, Xbox 360, A couple PSPs , Lynx and Vita that really don&#39;t get used anymore. I do still use some of my other consoles,but these mostly just sit. If I play them it&#39;s not for long and it&#39;s probably been over a year since I&#39;ve touched them, as emulation does good enough for what I want to play. Am I just hoarding them or should I be selling these off. I don&#39;t need the money, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt. Any thoughts? Am I just holding on to my past and times that I had so much fun with friends and my brothers playing?
