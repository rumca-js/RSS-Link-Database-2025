        "description": "In his latest update George stated he is 'still interested' in the Winds of Winter, but \"he loves other things too.\" It almost feels like fans are being strung along to keep the money train going. While I do believe he thinks he can finish Winds, A Dream of Spring will forever be a dream.\nThe only thing George RR Martin truly owes his fans at this point is honesty. Until then, words are wind.\nEdited by @QTRBlackGarrett",
