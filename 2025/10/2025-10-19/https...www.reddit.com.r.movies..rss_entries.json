Even in the trailer Keanu says \u201cI gave him money and it solved most of his problems\u201d </p> <p>Then started thinking about how so many movies cannot land that answer.

I expected a spoof that made a bunch of jokes at the monsters&#39; expense similar to modern horror comedy movies, instead I noticed that the scenes with the monsters were all treated seriously and played completely straight like they were from any of the previous Universal Monster movies. Only Abbott and Costello&#39;s scenes had any comedy, if they weren&#39;t on screen there were no jokes, and even when they were on screen, the monsters and other characters were still meant to be serious and/or scary. </p> <p>This got me thinking, I admittedly haven&#39;t seen that many old comedy movies, but most of the ones I&#39;ve seen (especially Marx Brothers movies) are similar in that regard.

I had always assumed multiple weeks, if not a couple months. Assumed large time lapses when it cuts to black between scenes. Looked it up online and most sites claim 5 days. Which made me really wonder if that was right. Blair is locked in a shed for like half of that, but during that time he digs out an ice cave and creates half a ship from helicopter parts? Am I getting that wrong? Either the duration should be way more than 5 days or that seems like a very odd inclusion in the story. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kemmack\"> /u/kemmack </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oagn7l/the_thing_1982/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oagn7l/the_thing_1982/\">[comments]</a></span>",
