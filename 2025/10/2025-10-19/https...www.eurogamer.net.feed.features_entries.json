The first four generations of Pok&eacute;mon games took us on a whirlwind tour of Japan. Red and Blue were set in a fictionalised version of Greater Tokyo, with dense cities and urban sprawl. Gold and Silver whisked us down to Kansai, with gorgeous temples and leafy towns. Ruby and Sapphire looked south to subtropical Ky&umacr;sh&umacr;, all seaside cities and swathes of blue ocean. Diamond and Pearl donned their winter coats and flew to the chilly northern island of Hokkaid&omacr;, with its craggy peaks and snowfields.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/as-pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-we-return-to-pokemon-legends-arceus-rose-tinted-take-on-the-past-and-the-hard-questions-it-raises-about-japanese-history\">Read more</a></p>",

It barely feels like seven days have passed since last time, but here we are again with another Weekly Digest - in which we recap some of the highlights you might have missed over this past week on Eurogamer. And what a busy one it's been! Connor's been over in Paris for Evo France, reporting from the long-running fighting tournament's inaugural European event; Jim on the video team has been delving into the decade-long (and counting) development of the promising Elder Scrolls total conversion mod Skyblivion; Tom has had his hands all over the ROG Xbox Ally X, and we've had a load of reviews, from the surprisingly peppy <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review\">Pok&eacute;mon Legends: Z-A</a> to Double Fine's sublime Keeper. For this week's full recap, read on!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-weekly-digest-19th-octobe",
