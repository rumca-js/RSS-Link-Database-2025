        "description": "Game Freak deserves credit for Pokemon Legends: Z-A. It would have been extremely easy for them to simply do more of what had worked well in the past. Certainly it would have been safer in terms of keeping their fanbase happy. But they chose to do something completely different, and completely new and challenging. \n\nA lot of what they tried here doesn\u2019t work as well for me as their previous experiments have, but the value of continually trying new things itself cannot be overstated. Then, too, the core gameplay loop remains incredibly compelling and fun, and the playground of Lumiose City is incredibly fun to explore, and a surprisingly fleshed out setting. There are things that work here, and things that don\u2019t, which unfortunately means that the game is, by definition not as great as its predecessor was, which hit it out of the park on most things. \n\nBut there are gambles here that really pay off \u2013 the single setting allows for Game Freak to have the most realized setting they have h",

Though technically a prequel, Gears of War: E-Day returns horror themes that defined earlier entries. Despite the development hell of Fable Legends, a new entry in the series by Playground Games appears closer to a reality than ever, even if there's so much we've yet to see. \n\nEven Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill, once thought dead and buried alongside whatever sense Konami had as a development studio, emerged with some stellar remakes and Silent Hill f.\n\nThen there's Ninja Gaiden 4.",
