Since I&#39;m not the biggest fan of seeing a stack of games I&#39;ve started turning some forward so I can see their art. But of course now I can see a bit of bulging as the box wants to separate from the components.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking magnets might be an easy fix. Has anyone done magnets themselves? Other than just buying those really expensive ones.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/milkyjoe241\"> /u/milkyjoe241 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oawwyn/has_anyone_tries_using_magnets_to_secure_box_lids/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oawwyn/has_anyone_tries_using_magnets_to_secure_box_lids/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Ordering internationally would cost me twice that of MRP. I am travelling overseas and planning to get as many board games as I can. Here is the list of games I am thinking. Let me know if I should add/remove or swap any. 1. Ark Nova 2. Spirit Island 3. Dune Imperium 4. Wrymspan(one of our friend already has wingspan) 5. SETI 6. Unmatched : cobble and fog 7. LOTR duel for middleearth 8. Splendor duel 9. Sky Team 10. Brass: Birmingham 11. Heat: pedal to the metal 12. Faraway 13. Jaipur 14.
