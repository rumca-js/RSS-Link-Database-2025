This could let some CPU cores be running real-time \"RT\" kernels or other non-traditional uses between CPU cores. It wasn't clear how far the multi-kernel patches would get especially with some initial negative views toward it and Bytedance separately proposing \"Parker\" for multi-kernel usage just days later. In any event, today a second version of the multi-kernel Linux patches were posted...",
