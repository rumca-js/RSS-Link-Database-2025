I like the price and ease of fast mail and the security of proton. I am find with having two clients, I just don&#39;t know if it makes since it in my case. I now have a custom random domain that Im going to use for friends/family emails and set up aliases for all the non important email (subcriptions/un important logins/etc.) I am thinking about getting a more personal custom domain for more &quot;important stuff&quot; banking/wellness/insurance/etc. Before I bought the third domain, I wanted to consider all my options. Outside of yearly renewals from the domains, Im about trying to pay no more thant $7 a month for email. I also thinking about getting the proton unlimited monthly on Black",
