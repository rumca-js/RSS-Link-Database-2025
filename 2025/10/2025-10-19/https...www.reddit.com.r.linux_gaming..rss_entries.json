I have to pull it all the way to 1000 for the middle box to dissapear. Is there like an .engine fix or something in the game files that is known to be changed in this instance? On W11 the calibration box matches and the fire looks a proper red like it should. The Wayland command i tried was PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 PROTON_ENABLE_HDR=1 and gamescope -f -W 2560 -H 1440 --adaptive-sync --hdr-enabled game-performance -- %command%. I honestly notice in pretty much all games the brightens is raised a little from windows when calibrating in game.

Then again about 2 minutes or more delay to load the game. All this time huge fps drops, most time is 0-4 fps. Then in game as soon as I move or turn the camera(without move) drops fps to 0-5 again, cpu/gpu load drops to 5-15%. Without moving fps is 120 or more and gpu load rises 50-70% and cpu about the same. Same behaviour and in cut scenes.</p> <p>I tried proton/proton experimental/ proton-GE 10.18, which didn&#39;t make any difference. Also tried low/med/high presets and native/fsr2/fsr3/ frame generation on/off, but nothing helps.

The gist of it is games becoming so slow in framerate to the point of being unplayable, after closing any other game. I have 1 chance to play a game lag-free before the lag bomb occurs and I need to restart. This &quot;lag bomb&quot; can also occur in realtime after about 30-40 minutes of gameplay, but it&#39;s much more easily replicatable by simply closing and relaunching a game. I&#39;ve been living with it for so long it&#39;s part of my routine at this point, restarting/logging in before a session. Log in, play game fine, close game, start game again, lag bomb.</p> <p>I just randomly discovered a much better workaround: <strong>restarting my monitor.</strong> Finally no more having to close the game and log back in.
