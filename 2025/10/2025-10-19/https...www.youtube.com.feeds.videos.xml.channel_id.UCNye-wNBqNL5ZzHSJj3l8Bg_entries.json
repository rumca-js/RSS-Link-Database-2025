In Deir al-Balah\u2019s central market, crowds have returned, and goods fill the stalls, but high commission charges on cash withdrawals have made it difficult for many Palestinians to afford basic necessities. \nAlthough these rates have been reduced from 45% to 20%, the financial burden remains significant.\nAuthorities in Gaza are working to stabilise the economy by regulating food prices and tackling steep commission rates. \nSellers, relieved to be trading again, highlight the need for international pressure on Israel to allow cash flow into the region to address the ongoing crisis. \nAs banks cautiously reopen following the blockade, they offer a glimmer of hope for long-awaited economic relief.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Ibrahim al-Khalili reports from Deir al-Balah, Gaza, Palestine.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish",
