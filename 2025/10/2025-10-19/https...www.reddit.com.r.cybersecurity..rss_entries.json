I was recently testing out a Windows 98 virtual machine (not related to cybersec) and while trying to connect it to the internet, I had seen some posts saying that it was very dangerous to connect such old software to the web, as it was unsecure and whatnot. I was conflicted, as a video from 2017 by MattKC showed the system to be <em>too old</em> to be properly infected by anything.</p> <p>So here&#39;s my question: Is it really that unsafe to connect a PC with W98 to the internet these days?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SethThe_hwsw\"> /u/SethThe_hwsw </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ob379s/about_using_old_software_and_connecting_to_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ob379s/about_using_old_software_and_connecting_to_the/\">[comments]</a></span>",
