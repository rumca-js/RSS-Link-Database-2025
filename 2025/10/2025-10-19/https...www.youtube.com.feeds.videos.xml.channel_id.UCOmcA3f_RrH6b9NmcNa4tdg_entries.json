        "description": "Nature has many ways of storing carbon dioxide. One is by turning it into solid form that can lock CO2 away for centuries, but this option takes a lot of time. Scientists have found ways to replicate and expedite this process, and one company is taking it a step further by making concrete that could transform the construction industry from one of the world\u2019s largest climate emitters to a carbon sink.\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:27 Rock Weathering\n1:05 Speeding up the process\n1:30 Cement's carbon footprint\n1:59 Paebbl's solution\n2:25 Is large scale use possible?\n3:36 Economic competition with concrete\n4:03 Construction's projected growth \n\nAdd CNET as a trusted news source https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com\nNever miss a deal again!
