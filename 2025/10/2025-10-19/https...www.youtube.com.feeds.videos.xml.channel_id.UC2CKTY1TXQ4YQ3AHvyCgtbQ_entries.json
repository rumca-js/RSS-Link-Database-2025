        "description": "This upcoming weekend is VINCEY CON - were a bunch of nerds (who all happen to be wargaming content creators AND friends) get together and paint miniatures and work on other stuff. I'll talk about past Vincey Cons, I'll talk about MY plans for the time, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards - miniatures-agnostic necromantic skirmish combat at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com\n\nI'm a member of The Army Painter Factory Team - and I'm passing the savings on to you! Use code 'FactoryUncle5' at checkout to get 5% off of your entire order at http://www.thearmypainter.com or check my favorite Army Painter products at https://thearmypainter.com/tabletop-minions\n\nI'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly).
