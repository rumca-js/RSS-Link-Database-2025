Players choose to play as either wind-up bunnies or the Carnival Monster.

To stay active, they need to help each other - wind each other up, find keys, and revive teammates. But every action makes noise, which can reveal their location. Sometimes it&#39;s safer to play dead and hide among the bodies.</p> <p>The monster hunts the bunnies, stealing their charge to stay alive. Each monster has its own abilities. For example, the Magician can detect bunnies pretending to be dead - but checking takes time.</p> <p>No two matches are the same ",
