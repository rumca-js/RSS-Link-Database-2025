Now, I&#39;m seriously thinking about making this my full-time gig. But here&#39;s where I&#39;m stuck, I have no idea what to charge for these backlinks. I&#39;ve been working through middlemen and they pay peanuts for the quality of links they are getting, but I feel like I could do better on my own.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried Upwork, but haven&#39;t had much success there, and I&#39;ve had a few clients recently just ghost me after the work was done, which is super frustrating.

The learning curve feels quite steep but I\u2019m getting to grips with some of the useful features, assuming of course that the data presented is accurate. I\u2019m a small business. single marketing manager working with an external agency for some planning and execution. So the monthly cost of the SEMrush toolsets collection eats a good chunk of my marketing budgeting. But if I can improve my marketing return 25%, it\u2019ll be worth the cost and effort.
