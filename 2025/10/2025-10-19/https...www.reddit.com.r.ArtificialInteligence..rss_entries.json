Recently I came across a write-up from <a href=\"https://techquarter.io/ai-machine-learning-services/\">TechQuarter </a>that talked less about model tuning and more about deployment, monitoring, and actually making AI useful in real-world apps. That hit home because most of our issues weren\u2019t with the AI itself, but everything around it. We started rethinking our approach. Instead of building every piece from scratch, we began testing out managed services that handled things like data drift, versioning, and integration.

It\u2019s like we all started sanding down the way we talk so it fits better inside a feed. I catch myself doing it sometimes. The mirror isn\u2019t just showing us anymore.
