I chose the lines to be in that shape because it feels almost human. I used the idea of shrugging your shoulders to indicate you don&#39;t really care as the main point because, we really don&#39;t!

And it&#39;s not like I dont like people, I love having connections, it&#39;s just when I start dating I begin to loose that feeling. Like I can really like someone, they make me really happy, but we start dating and I feel gross and just don&#39;t want to date. I don&#39;t want to do the things people who date wanna do. I can&#39;t even hold hands. </p> <p>But then I can like fictional characters a lot, but the thought of anything romantic with real people is really distasteful to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Audience-4781\"> /u/No-Audience-4781 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1oad8ox/what_sexuality_am_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1oad8ox/what_sexuality_am_i/\">[comments]</a></span>",
