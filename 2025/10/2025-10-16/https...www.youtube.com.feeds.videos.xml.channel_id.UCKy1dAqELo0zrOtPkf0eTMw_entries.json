        "description": "When you get a spontaneous call from the president of Nintendo of America, you don\u2019t ask too many questions. You just take the call.\n\nChris Maple was being asked to make a new logo for Pokemon, which at the time existed only in Japan as Pocket Monsters Red and Pocket Monsters Green. Nintendo wanted to release the game in the West with a Blue version and, later, a Yellow Pikachu Edition. But the company wanted a new logo to fit the rebrand from \u201cPocket Monsters\u201d to \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d, and was struggling to find someone to nail the look. Maple wasn\u2019t given any instructions on what Nintendo was looking for, though, he says. Just one parameter: he had just one month to make it.\n\nMeet Chris Maple, a Seattle-based designer who unwittingly stumbled into creating one of the most iconic logos in the world.\n\n#IGN",

Judging by the many, many different ones we\u2019ve now seen across multiple hands-on demos and videos, it appears that they\u2019re frequently a showstopping spectacle that puts all of your abilities to the test. One such headline attraction is Golden Star, a monstrous mechanical dragon that we fought at the Seoul offices of developer Pearl Abyss in preparation for this month\u2019s IGN First. If you watched our last gameplay video, you\u2019ll have already seen this mighty boss in action, but here we\u2019re going to take you behind the scenes to show you how it was designed, all the way from the sound of its beating wings to the method of its downfall.",

        "description": "Battlefield 6's multiplayer reviewed by Justin Koreis on PC, also available on Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nBattlefield 6\u2019s multiplayer action is expertly crafted, wrapped in a wonderful layer of destructibility that both looks great and materially affects the flow of combat. The gunplay is excellent, with weapons that are accurate enough to reward skilled shooting, but have just enough sway to promote a bit of careful thought while you take aim. I wish the early progression didn\u2019t delay the fun of loadout building quite as much, and a few of the maps would benefit from some rebalancing, but most of the options play really well overall. Besides, those are minor gripes with what is otherwise a great time. Like a precision shot from my trusty M2010 sniper rifle, this one\u2019s a hit.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #Battlefield6",
