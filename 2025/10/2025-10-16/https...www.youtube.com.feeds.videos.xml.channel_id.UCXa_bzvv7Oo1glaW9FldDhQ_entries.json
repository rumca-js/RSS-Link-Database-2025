        "description": "NASCAR 25 is here and we were quite excited to dive into iRacing's first take on the popular racing franchise. But has its attempt to craft a racing simulator without comparison been a successful one? The answer to that question's a little nuanced. We spent some time with the new title, and came away impressed with how it performs on the tracks.\n\nBut there are issues that cannot be ignored outside of the stadiums, and they hold this one back from being what we believe it could have been. Join us as we take a look at what works and what doesn't with this racing title that could have enthusiasts smiling away at their screens while the rest of you wonder what the fuss is all about.",

        "description": "While a great story or excellent mechanics are always welcome in video games, there's a case to be made about crafting a visual experience that lets its systems come together and create immersion and engagement that feels natural. Some titles on the PlayStation 5 make their visuals do the talking better than others.\n\nWe've come up with a list of our favorite graphical presentations that make the most of the PS5's current-gen leanings, spanning a number of genres and stories. These games bring brilliant visual styles, and technical marvels that make them stand out, and they deserve a shout out for the way in which they bring their stories to life.",

        "description": "Of course, as most fans are aware, Ninja Gaiden 1's story didn't immediately jump into the sequel. In the same year that Ninja Gaiden 2 was released, another title, a spin-off, would arrive a few months prior on the Nintendo DS \u2013 Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword. \n\nCute naming, especially given the penchant of many titles on the platform to incorporate \u201cDS\u201d into their names, but it meant even more considering the focus on the legendary weapon.",
