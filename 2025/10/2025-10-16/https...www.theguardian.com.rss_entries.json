With a vibe that has more in common with an Alpine spa hotel than the poky rooms and grim corridors usually associated with housing for elderly people, the building \u2013 by architects Witherford Watson Mann \u2013 reinvents the almshouse for the modern era as a place of care, shelter and social connection.</p><p>As a building type, the origins of almshouses extend back centuries, giving a semblance of dignity to the poor, the old, the sick and the marginalised. Sequestered from the outside world, with cellular dwellings arrayed around courtyards, they evoke a sense of pastoral benevolence.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/a",

Larry David did it. So did Andrew Ridgeley. Now this witty and heartbreakingly sad chamber piece from screenwriter Robert Kaplow and director Richard Linklater tells the all but unbearable story of Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart just after his split from Richard Rodgers. He is played with campy brilliance, an unspeakable combover and fake smallness by Ethan Hawke, who is often digitally reduced in size \u2013 but is also occasionally filmed standing in an off-camera hole to look up poignantly at taller characters, facing Hart\u2019s vertical challenge as Jos\u00e9 Ferrer once played the diminutive Toulouse-Lautrec.</p><p>Hawke gets big, world-weary laughs with Hart\u2019s riffs on the hidden gayness of the ",

Since then, he\u2019s been consistently admired for his warm tone, effortless musical line and theatrical originality. His debut recital album continues that trend, but don\u2019t expect the usual lineup of Handel arias or Dowland lute songs. On Refound, a collection of art songs with reinvention at its heart, his choices are eclectic, idiosyncratic even, but also profoundly satisfying.</p><p>Connections and parallels abound.

Along with witchcraft and necromancy, Hekate is also associated with boundaries and crossroads, acting as protector and guide to lost travellers. In art, she is commonly depicted holding torches to show the way, and accompanied by a black dog or serpent.</p><p>In Hekate the Witch, the poet Nikita Gill reimagines the life of this enigmatic goddess in verse. Born during a war between the old Titan rulers and new Gods of Olympia, Hekate is birthed alone by her Titan mother, Asteria, who tells her she is destined for greatness. The pair live alone in a dilapidated palace but are forced to flee when Zeus and Poseidon come to enslave them. Seeking refuge in the Underworld, Asteria is denied entry but",

Quite something, because of the competition. One of the great strengths of this rewarding production \u2013 the first to be staged by James Brining since he became artistic director \u2013 is its sharp characterisation. Every one of Chekhov\u2019s frustrated figures, variously in search of love, validation and applause, is drawn here in bold lines, clear and precise.</p><p>For Quentin to stand out in the role of Irina Arkadina, the egotistical repertory actor slumming it in the country for the summer, means pulling the focus from a richly realised ensemble. When she holds court, centre stage, it is as if she draws Lizzie Powell\u2019s early-autumn lights towards her, glowing in the attention while the rest of the busy household becomes her attentive, obedient audience.</p><p>",

Question any of it for a second \u2013 as I did in the final episode of this third series, when the new US president asks the prime minister whether Chequers is his family\u2019s ancestral seat \u2013 and it begins to crumble.
