I didn&#39;t guess the ending, because my brain went to the worst scenario - main character is a killer with DID and that&#39;s so very bad and scary. It didn&#39;t go there and I&#39;m thankful.</p> <p>I guess I&#39;m a house horror person now. I also really liked how Maggie essentially lost the small town connections, which maybe she never really had. It&#39;s really a profound revelation, but even the sillier narrative of her father&#39;s book was quite fun. Didn&#39;t think it was or might be Indigo Garson, and though the falling snakes were a gross spectacle in the beginning, it was overused by the end. And &#39;&#39;Revealing her true nature. A predator.&#39;&#39; line was pretty damn goofy. Maggie is pretty much a better writer.</p> <p>My edition also had a snippet of Survive The Night, the book I watch a witchcindy video about.

Obviously, this is an important subject that many of us feel passionate about but unfortunately it has a tendency to come in waves and drown out any other discussion. We obviously don&#39;t want to ban this discussion but we also want to allow other posts some air to breathe. In order to accomplish this, we&#39;re going to post a discussion thread every month to allow users to post articles and discuss them. In addition, our friends at <a href=\"/r/bannedbooks\">/r/bannedbooks</a> would love for you to check out their sub and discuss banned books there as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AutoModerator\"> /u/AutoModerator </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o8a38f/banned_books_discussion_october_2",

I couldn&#39;t have named a contribution he made to the era apart from giving the Queen someone to mourn for decades and lending his name to some public monuments. It is, after all, the <em>Victorian</em> age. </p> <p>The Albert that emerges in this biography is a much more talented, interesting, and active man than history gives him credit for. He could stand tall in an era filled with remarkably accomplished personalities.

I&#39;d say my overall DNF is 50-75%. Hopefully that number will go down as I learn to get better at choosing things that I&#39;ll be most likely to enjoy.</p> <p>My approach from now on is to allow myself to be as picky as I want to be. I don&#39;t want to burn myself out again, especially since I tend towards mood reading.

The things that actively happen or happened are sometimes short and sweet and are very easy to imagine. Regardless of what mood I am, I enjoy it because if I&#39;m sick or tired I can just gloss over the text without actively thinking and then I can go think about it later, and if I&#39;m really in the mood to read I have whole paragraphs of someone else&#39;s brain to pick through. </p> <p>With these books, especially We Need to Talk About Kevin, the narrator presents herself the way that she wants to be seen. She says a lot of things that I either agree with or disagree with or things I can think about, and the distance makes it so there&#39;s less room for interpretation and there&#39;s only so much room for my opinions. .
