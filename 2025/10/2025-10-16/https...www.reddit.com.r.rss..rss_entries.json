I don&#39;t mind visiting the site, once I&#39;ve decided that I want more, but it needs more than a headline and a link. I feel like I&#39;ve cornered myself into an echo chamber of my own design and every attempt to get a wider view is hampered by the poorly implemented feeds by news orgs.</p> <p>I&#39;m being deliberately vague on what I mean by &quot;news&quot; because I would like to keep this discussion focused on technical aspects, based on the implementation of RSS and how usable it is as a consumer. I&#39;ll decide if I care for their writing and reporting myself.</p> <p>I don&#39;t suppose someone has a publicly available list, gist, or OPML they would be willing to share. </p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/justec1\"> /u/just",

No ads no distractions etc. So far I\u2019ve noticed a huge demand for rss services like this. Not sure if i should continue spending any more time and effort building it as a lot of the rss feeds are no longer working. For instance AP News has no rss services anymore. Any thoughts? Are there any alternatives to create rss feeds from websites? The information is not behind paywalls. If you\u2019d like to try my web app for free longer than the 14 day free trial I can provide an access code. My app is kindlenewsdaily.com </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fastReports\"> /u/fastReports </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1o7rmlu/is_rss_truly_dying/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1o7rmlu/is_rss_truly_dying/\">[comments]</a></span>",
