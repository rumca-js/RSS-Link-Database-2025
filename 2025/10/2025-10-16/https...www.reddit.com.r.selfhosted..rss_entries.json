I&#39;ve been doing a lot of reading recently into selfhosted machines, like NASs like urgreen and synology, DASs for just some extra storage and what not, but as of now I&#39;d like to dip my feet into a home based server with a smaller form factor. ive seen things like the fractal Terra be used to this effect and I was wondering if its a solid jumping in point, I&#39;ve built computers before so I&#39;m not to worried about that but I do move a lot and was primarily looking to have the machine host a Jellyfin server, AudioBookshelf, tubearchivist and what not. I plan to use a combination of m.2 SSDs and 2.5 SATA SSDs for media storage since ive had...shaky lucky with HHDs in the past, so I understand if just getting a DAS for my current solution is not the best idea (since I&#39;m informed that the speeds SSDs allow won&#39;t be met with a DAS) </p> <p>Ive also seen things like the ASUSTOR Flash",

I was with OVH for almost 2 months with a Ryzen 7 9700X at $65, but the problems started appearing with daily crashes for weeks without support being able to provide me with any solution. Then I purchased a Ryzen 7 5700X server from Sparked Host for $106, but it also suffered crashes and is not entirely stable from what I noticed. I also realized that I need the speed of a 7th or 9th generation processor. </p> <p>I&#39;ve looked at alternatives like Hetzner, InterServer, mevspace, hostkey, but I&#39;d like someone with experience to recommend an option.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Heavy_Conflict_1375\"> /u/Heavy_Conflict_1375 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1o7w5zp/i_need_an_suggest_of_dedicated_server/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.",

Currently, the way I have the VPN setup is with wg-easy hosted on a VPS, and wireguard installed on my server&#39;s host, and on my laptop. The problem I have is that when I have wireguard enabled on the server, my outbound traffic seems to get routed through the VPN, which I don&#39;t want, as it broke some of my connections to services such as my Minecraft server. I tried setting the home server&#39;s allowed ip&#39;s to the wireguard subnet, and that fixed the outgoing connection issues, but now I&#39;m unable to remote into the server through the VPN from my laptop.
