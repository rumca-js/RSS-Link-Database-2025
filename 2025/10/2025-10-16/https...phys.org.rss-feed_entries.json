These quantized units of spin waves describe how spin precession propagates. Similar to electrons, magnons can transmit information in a conductor. However, they do so with much lower resistance and thus a fraction of the energy consumption.",

With political instability, climate change and extreme weather events, food supply chains are becoming increasingly precarious\u2014and when a certain product or recipe goes viral on social media, they can be stretched to breaking point. Charles Spence, professor of experimental psychology and co-author of \"Digital Dining: New Innovations in Food and Technology\" discusses how digital platforms are setting food trends, and how artificial intelligence (AI) might play a role in the future.",
