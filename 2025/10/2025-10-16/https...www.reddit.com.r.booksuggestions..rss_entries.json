Her apartment is gorgeous (no photos on here or I&#39;d include it but you should give it a google). Anyway she said she makes every guest at her house leave with a book. My bookshelf has gotten unruly and I definitely can&#39;t afford two copies of every book I love, but I have started making every guest leave with something. My boyfriend wants me to cull the herd and this is one way I have of doing it. So far nobody has wanted to take anything I really care about and its nice to hear from my family (that&#39;s mostly who&#39;s staying I have many siblings) about what they think of the books I gave them. Idk it feels nice- if I was ever super rich I&#39;d put a book next to each table setting at a dinner party so every guest leaves with something.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

I keep picking up books, reading a few pages or a couple of chapters, and then just\u2026 stopping. It\u2019s not that the books are bad in fact, some are ones I\u2019ve been meaning to read for ages but I can\u2019t seem to stay focused or get that spark back. I used to love getting lost in stories staying up too late just to read \u201cone more chapter,\u201d carrying a book everywhere, feeling genuinely excited to dive into a fictional world or an interesting nonfiction topic. Now I feel like I scroll endlessly or rewatch the same shows instead. I want to get back into reading, but I don\u2019t know how to push through this slump. So, I\u2019m wondering: What do you usually do when you hit a reading slump? Are there any books that helped you fall back in love with reading? Do you switch genres, reread old favorites, or just take a break until the mood strikes again? I\u2019m open to",

I mean, the last books I can remember that truly made me laugh out were either Joshua Cohen\u2019s The Netayahus or Norm Macdonald\u2019s autobiography, and those were years ago.

I\u2019ve enjoyed some of the funny classics such as the works of Terry Pratchett, A Confederacy of Dunces, Catch-22, etc. In terms of comedy movies I do love the Coen Brothers.

Growing up, I have read and somewhat liked Diary of a Wimpy Kid, American Chillers, Michigan Chillers, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone. Recently, in my college class, I read The Diary of Ann Frank, which was absolutely life-changing, and I never thought I could actually tear up reading a book. This has inspired me to seek more inspiration and embark on a journey of reading. Before that, I had read Prisoner B-3087 by Alan Gratz, which was also phenomenal (Not saying I only like holocaust books, but that has been the case). I have also read Frankenstein, but that felt too complicated and boring to me. I&#39;m generally into any genre; please let me know of your suggestions!

Anyway I love reading romances but being both a dude and hormonal (I hate puberty\ud83d\ude2d) means that whenever those spicy scenes come up when I\u2019m reading in class or anywhere else that\u2019s public it\u2019s really easy to see if you get my meaning, so I was looking for romance books that won\u2019t do that to me. When it comes to what type of romance books I normally like heartwarming stuff and rom coms, I like other stuff to but I normally hate the dark romance stuff or the borderline criminal/abusive stuff, I have almost finished the Windy City series by Liz Tomforde (loving it but can\u2019t always read it in class) and have finished the Rose Hill series by Elsie Silver (didn\u2019t really enjoy the first one but the rest were great) and I also liked Beware of chicken (yes I\u2019m counting it as romance-ish). Anyway I\u2019m gonna stop yapping and any help is appreciated and I will ",
