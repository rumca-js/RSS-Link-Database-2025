It&#39;s an AI-powered collection manager for card collectors.</p> <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> I collect sports cards and Pokemon cards. Managing everything in spreadsheets was a nightmare - manually typing card names, looking up prices, trying to track portfolio value.</p> <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> SlabTrack uses AI to scan ANY card (graded or raw) and automatically: - Identifies the card (95% accurate) - Pulls live eBay pricing - Organizes your collection - Tracks portfolio analytics</p> <p><strong>Works for:</strong> - Graded slabs (PSA, BGS, CGC) - Raw cards - Sports cards (all major sports) - Pokemon cards</p> <p><strong>Free tier:</strong> 7 scans/month, no credit card required <strong>Paid plans:</strong> Start at $4.99/mo</p> <p>Link: slabtrack.io</p> <p>Would love to hear feedback from fellow builders!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",
