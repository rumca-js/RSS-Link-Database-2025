People around me say that they\u2019re an ally but I know they\u2019re not with how they talk about trans folk or make gay jokes. I\u2019d like to be viewed as who I am as a person. Me being queer is part of who I am but that\u2019s not all I am. It\u2019s just a very lonely and scary feeling.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lanky_Perspective957\"> /u/Lanky_Perspective957 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1o81a19/being_a_lesbian_is_scary/\">[link]</a></spa",
