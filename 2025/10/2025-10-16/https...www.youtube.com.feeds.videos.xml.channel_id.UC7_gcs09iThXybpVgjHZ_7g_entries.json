        "description": "Thank you to Cyber GhostVPN for Supporting PBS. Learn More About Cyber GhostVPN:  https://cyberghostvpn.com/PBSSpaceTime\n\nDoes quantum mechanics allow the future to retroactively influence the past, as in the infamous delayed choice quantum eraser experiment? How about we get an actual quantum physicist--who many of you already know--to show us how to do this experiment at home, and hopefully set this matter to rest.\n\nCheck Out Looking Glass Universe: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LookingGlassUniverse\n\nAnd Check Out Matt\u2019s Conversation with Mithuna\nhttps://youtu.be/QPuVtvIOYcM?si=TQovlQ6kW_6PPxKy\n\nSign Up on Patreon to get access to the Space Time Discord!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/pbsspacetime\n\nCheck out the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!\nhttps://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetime\n\nSearch the Entire Space Time Library Here: https://search.pbsspacetime.com/\n\nHosted by Matt O'D",
