It added that preparations were ongoing with Egypt.\n \nAs part of the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire plan, Hamas had to return 20 living hostages and the bodies of another 28 hostages.\n \nIn return 250 Palestinian prisoners and about 1,700 detainees were released by Israel.\n \nThe US is downplaying the threat to the Gaza ceasefire deal after Hamas says it needs more time to find the remaining bodies of Israeli hostages.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#Israel #Gaza #BBCNews",
