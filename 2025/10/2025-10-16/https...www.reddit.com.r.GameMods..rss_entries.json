You can have various goals in the playthrough, to complete the game, beat a certain amount of bosses or try to reach a specific tool. You will have to be prepared for anything that is in the next room and that seems fun to me.</p> <p>I would want it to be a set configuration per new game, so for example if you go back through the same door, you end up in the same randomized place, not a new one.
