These were fully restored machines, recapped and in excellent condition \u2014 I\u2019m extremely picky about the details! Of course, they were also very carefully packed to ensure safe delivery.</p> <p>With the first sale, the buyer contacted me shortly after receiving it, claiming that the Trapdoor RAM expansion didn\u2019t work. Honestly, I didn\u2019t feel like dealing with the return process, so I agreed to a \u20ac60 partial refund just to resolve it quickly.</p> <p>Last week, I sold another one. According to the tracking info, only 20 minutes after delivery, the buyer messaged me saying the RAM expansion wasn\u2019t working, that he had already ordered a new one for \u20ac42, and that I should pay for it \u2014 plus give an additional 50% discount on the whole purchase price for the amiga.</p> <p>That\u2019s when I got suspicious and only accepted a full return in",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So, I just recently finished Champions of Krynn on an emulated Amiga 500 with 1.3 kickstart and workbench. The game ran fine, so I figured that with the seuquels (DKOK and DQOK) it would be the same. </p> <p>As I was creating a new party for Death Knights of Krynn, the game wouldn&#39;t let me select one of the pre made characyer icons, which is a shame, as those icons are far superior to the ones that the player can make. When I try to select them with my mouse the current icon buffers/glitches for a second, and then it stays the same. I have tried with cursor keys and even the numpad, with no results.</p> <p>I should mention that I&#39;m playing it from hard drive (emulated, obviously), and that I&#39;m using a Skidrow crack (though I have tried with a supposedly original version from floppy and the problem presisted).</p> <p>Any help/advice would be great, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",
