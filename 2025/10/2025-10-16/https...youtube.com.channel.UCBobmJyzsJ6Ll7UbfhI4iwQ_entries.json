        "description": "OpenUSD is rapidly becoming one of the most efficient solutions for building and managing data within studio pipelines. While Unreal Engine supports exporting data in USD format, its native implementation has certain performance limitations that require customization to fit into a pipeline.\n\nIn this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, Jonghwan Hwang of Sony Pictures Imageworks demonstrates a high-level concept for integrating Unreal Engine into a studio pipeline using OpenUSD. This includes basic USD export from Unreal Engine with Python, developing scripts to parse assets into USD layers, and adding patch scripts for refining USD data to meet specific pipeline requirements.\n\nThrough a case study of a simple film Unreal Engine scene structure, the session showcases how these optimizations enable more effective data exchange between Unreal Engine and other DCC tools.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#OpenUSD, #Python, #SonyPicturesImageworks, #UnrealEng",

        "description": "Girraphic, an international broadcast and advertising agency, has been fortunate enough to be a part of some of the most-watched streaming events in recent history, from Netflix's Paul vs. Tyson and NFL Christmas Gameday to Amazon's Thursday Night Football series. These broadcasts all share one thing in common: the integration of augmented reality (AR) graphics from Unreal Engine.  \n\nThis presentation recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025 looks at how Unreal Engine techniques and workflows fit into the live TV space, revealing the lessons Girraphic learned along the way. The session covers challenges like hardware requirements, scene and graphics layout, multiple camera tracking systems, live control of Unreal Engine, and the choice of HDR vs. SDR.\n\nThe session also explores where real-time 3D is going next as it gains backing from forward-thinking streaming partners. This talk is for anyone interested in understanding how Unreal Engine can be used for augmented broadcast graphics, and",
