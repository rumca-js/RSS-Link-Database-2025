I am currently modifying the case for aesthetics and have it apart.</p> <p>I have also read that the Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 can be used as a WiFi streaming device for Spotify Connect, which now streams lossless audio. </p> <p>Is there a way to use the power source in the PlayStation 1 to power the Pi in tandem, mount the Pi in the case so it can stream audio, and retain the PlayStation Hardware for its CD capabilities?</p> <p>Secondly, the Pi can be used as an emulator but I read it means removing all PlayStation hardware (sacrificing the CD usability). Can the Pi be used to both stream and emulate? </p> <p>Ill keep researching but if this is possible, ill need a step by step instal manual if it exists. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Laxdog03\"> ",
