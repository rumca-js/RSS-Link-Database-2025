Each one has a unique receptor - like a lock and key - that lets it recognize infected cells.\n\nBut since there are lots of different infections, your body makes millions of different T-cells, EACH ready to spot a new intruder.\n\nBut how does it know what\u2019s an intruder and what\u2019s just\u2026.YOU?\n\nHere\u2019s what they discovered\u2026 \n\n#shorts #nobelprize #physiology #medicine #science",
