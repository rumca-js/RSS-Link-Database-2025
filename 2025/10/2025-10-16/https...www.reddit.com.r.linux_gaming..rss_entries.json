Now, I know that this is an odd issue that\u2019s most likely down to the hardware or whatever, and most likely no one here ever had an issue like this or could easily replicate this\u2014 but I\u2019m just so annoyed that I got this close to running this game on this silly laptop and it has an issue I\u2019ve no ide",

I had just installed fallout new Vegas which is a pretty old game but it was running absolutely horribly. I went back lowered settings and noticed that my detected gpu in the game launcher is the Rx 5600 xt which is in my PC and not in the laptop. So could this be the reason? Did steam install shaders cache for a gpu that&#39;s not even there making my lag spike so bad. Like I can&#39;t even get into gun fights it gets laggy and stutters a lot. How can I solve this pls. Note: it ran fine when I had windows on this laptop.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mak_786094\"> /u/mak_786094 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1o8bo9d/shaders_cache_giving_me_issue/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1o8bo9",

For now I&#39;ve had it happen in Elden Ring, Armoured Core 6 and Alan Wake, all on Steam/Proton.</p> <p>I can work around it by setting the quality to max, but I&#39;d like my frames back. Is this a widely know issue and is there some fix for it? </p> <p>Other than setting the quality to max, it seems restarting the game works as well, and in the case od ER, just quit to menu and go back, but it comes back as soon as I die and respawn, and sometimes when I just rest at a grace (I assume the layers get reloaded when that happens in ER). </p> <p>I&#39;m on Fedora 42 KDE with nVidia drivers, all up to date.
