As of now, I have just 1Tb disks, one is the backup of the other.</p> <p>Since I&#39;m getting my space occupied very quickly, and that I only have a laptop PC, currently using my disks via a docking station, I was minding about buying more storage. Specifically, 2 8Tb HDDs. But then, I gave a look at the wiki here and got into a rabbit hole. Should I instead build a NAS? I don&#39;t have that much budget though it now seems as the best long-term investment.</p> <p>If you could point me to a specific setup or way to go, I&#39;d be glad, since by now I&#39;m more than lost.

Were they effective, affordable, or easy to use?</p> <p>3) Did you run into problems verifying content like false positives, high cost, or tech hurdles?</p> <p>4) If you could change one thing about content verification or deepfake detection, what would it be?</p> <p>I\u2019m researching general frustrations and real-world experience for a project.
