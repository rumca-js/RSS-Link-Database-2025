I got a Microsoft 365 phishing link that opens up in Chrome enhanced security browsing with no problems. I tried multiple security extensions that say the link is clean (even though the URL is like m1crosoft.share-files.land/important-file). BUT, if I just share a screenshot of the webpage with ChatGPT it says to close the webpage immediately because it is a phishing website. So what I&#39;m getting at is, where is the Google Gemini AI, or ChatGPT extension, that can just protect everyone from phishing websites? Because clearly my prompt of &quot;you are a cybersecurity expert, what is your take on this webpage?&quot; was all it took for it to be the ONLY security solution to call out the phishing website. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/have_you_tried_onoff\"> /u/have_you_tried_onoff </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments",
