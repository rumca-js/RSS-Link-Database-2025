        "description": "Pivotal have developed a one person aircraft that can take off vertically, fly like a plane and then land vertically again, and unlike many similar EVTOLs this one is actually certified and for sale in the USA!\nhttps://www.pivotal.aero/\nI visited the company a couple of months ago with the hope of getting to play around in their simulator, but before I even started they upped the ante and offered to train me so I could actually fly the real thing, and you'll get to see that happen in part 2.\nFor now I want to explain why the aircraft is designed this way, why the strange looking shape makes total sense and why electric motors are about more than battery powered flight.\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scottmanley",
