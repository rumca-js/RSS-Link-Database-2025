I was unfamiliar with the stack and the community was condescending when I asking a question about the tech stack. I personally use NextJS, Open WebUI uses svelte. So I ran into this Open Source NextJS Open Web UI clone, and I love it. It&#39;s still new so it only has like 20%, if even, of the features, but thought I should give it a shoutout. It only has one dev working on it and I think it should have more attention.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/blexotti\"> /u/blexotti </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1o7vog6/found_an_open_webui_clone_with_a_nextjs_stack/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1o7vog6/",
