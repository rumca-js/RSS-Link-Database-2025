My boyfriend recently got a vr headset for his college course on game development, and I can play on it when he&#39;s not using it! He&#39;s mainly using it for the class and doesn&#39;t know many games for it, and I don&#39;t know much either. When I try to look up games to buy it&#39;s a lot of combat games, which are cool but my favorites are Stardew or Animal Crossing. It doesn&#39;t look like there are any VR games like that, but is there a game that comes to mind that&#39;s a bit more laid back or casual?

I&#39;ve heard that multi-threading is crucial for calculations required for VR, which may make the 265KF more effective with a higher core count, but the 9800X3D is currently the king of gaming (with some uncertainty regarding VR gaming).

Or is there a viable solution to keep using it in win11?</p> <p>Any and all advice appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MaybeMyRealAccount\"> /u/MaybeMyRealAccount </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1o7w4ug/hp_reverb_g2_and_win11/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1o7w4ug/hp_reverb_g2_and_win11/\">[comments]</a></span>",
