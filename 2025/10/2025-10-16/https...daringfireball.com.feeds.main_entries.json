        "description": "<p>Good and thoughtful graphic essay by Matthew Inman, expressing why he dislikes AI-generated art. It\u2019s been widely <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/10/0047680-the-oatmeals-take-on-ai\">linked to</a>, largely approvingly. I fundamentally disagree with the premise. Near the start, Inman writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When I consume AI art, it <em>also</em> evokes a feeling. Good, bad,\nneutral\u2009\u2014\u2009whatever.</p>\n\n<p>Until I find out that it\u2019s AI art.</p>\n\n<p>Then I feel deflated, grossed out, and maybe a little bit bored.\nThis feeling isn\u2019t a choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think it very much is a choice. If your opinion of a work art changes after you find out which tools were used to make it, or who the artist is or what they\u2019ve done, you\u2019re no longer judging the art. You\u2019re making a choice not to form your opinion based on the work itself, but rather on something else. If you refuse to watch Woody Allen movies because of his personal life, that\u2019s a choice, but you\u2019re choosing not to watch",
