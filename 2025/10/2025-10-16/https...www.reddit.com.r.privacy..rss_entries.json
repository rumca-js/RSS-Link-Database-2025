Say I wanna start fresh, now reducing my online fingerprint to the absolute minimum (likely not zero, but maybe 0.1). How easy is it to do that? </p> <p>I\u2019d imagine the first thing to do is move to a completely new location for a new IP address. Then ditching literally all of my old tech, email addresses, and online accounts for new ones. Then set up a bunch of open source junk on them to degoogle/microsoft/apple them, along with setting up my internet and network connections for maximum privacy (DNS, VPN, etc.). That should seem like the basics, but what else have any of y\u2019all experienced with this process? What difficult or unexpected things came with starting \u201cfresh\u201d and trying to remain as \u201cfresh\u201d as possible? </p> </div>",
