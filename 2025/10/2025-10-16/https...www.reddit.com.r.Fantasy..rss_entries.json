He loves reading and particularly likes fantasy. Recently he\u2019s read most of Rick Riordin\u2019s books, Wings of Fire, Eragon, Harry Potter (didn\u2019t like it as much), and the The Hobbit. Any suggestions? The first book of a longer series is always good as a place to start. Books for older teens would be good. He prefers male protagonists and little to no romance but will pick up anything. </p> <p>Edit: Whoa, thanks for all the recommendations. If anyone is still commenting, yes, he\u2019s going to read Lord of the Rings soon. Sci-fi leaning books are great too.

I don\u2019t mind dark triggers at all \u2014 the darker and more morally gray, the better. Romance is optional, as long as the characters and the stakes matter. <strong><em>Well</em></strong> written smut is absolutely accepted. </p> <p>What I really crave in fantasy is deep friendships, revenge arcs, clever writing, humor, and poetic prose that lands at the perfect moment. I <em>don\u2019t</em> need sprawling, headache-inducing politics \u2014 just a story I can follow and get invested in.</p> <p>I\u2019m happy with little or no romance, as long as the world is immersive and the characters actually matter. Basically, I want fantasy that makes me care, makes me laugh, and sometimes makes me gasp.</p> <p>Any recommendations? I\u2019ll take all the heartfelt, witty, reveng",
