Does the community working in this space see the rise of dangers thanks to ai powered attacks and exploits as something real?

Most of my high school and early college was spent working retail/Labor (McDonalds, Panera, Amazon Warehouse), the most technical knowledge I ever received was writing Hello World in Python. I did not attempt to learn at all. </p> <p>Eventually, I realized college wasn&#39;t working out and I needed to generate income due to my dad suffering a heart attack and making me realize if I ever wanted to support my family I would need to bring in money. I simply had no time for 3 years of schooling or even bootcamps. </p> <p>One of my close friends bought a new PC that I helped him build, just by watching youtube, this sparked my interest into computers and eventually IT.
