It automatically sorts emails into categories, highlights what actually matters, pulls out real tasks, and even drafts replies so you\u2019re not stuck typing the same stuff over and over.</p> <p>I originally built it to save myself from email burnout, but it\u2019s starting to feel useful enough to share. It\u2019s still early (closed testing right now), and I\u2019d love some honest feedback from other devs \u2014 UI/UX, flow, features, tech stack ideas, anything.</p> <p>If you\u2019re curious to try it out or just want to chat about the build, DM me and I\u2019ll set you up with free lifetime access while we\u2019re testing. Always down to trade feedback too \u2014 happy to look at your projects in return \ud83d\udc40</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Foreign_Grocery_6399\"> /u/Foreign_Grocery_6399 </a> <br/> <span><a ",

It could be text first, maybe video later. The chat ends automatically when time\u2019s up, and both people remain anonymous unless you both want to reconnect.</p> <p>To avoid awkwardness, the app can provide conversation prompts or mini-games. Safety is key: you\u2019d have anonymous IDs, the ability to block/report, and no personal info is shared unless you choose to.</p> <p>Basically it\u2019s like a tiny daily adventure meeting someone new from anywhere in the world, without the pressure of social media or dating apps.</p> <p>Would you try this?

I know it sounds like one of those &quot;too good to be true&quot; deals, but it&#39;s totally legitimate and simple. People often ignore this because they assume there&#39;s a &quot;catch,&quot; but there really isn&#39;t one.</p> <p>To give you a concrete example of Bonus Arbitraging, here\u2019s a way you can make $20 in just 2-3 minutes:</p> <p>Here are the simple instructions:</p> <ol> <li>Sign up on the <a href=\"https://gemsloot.com/?aff=shg\"><strong>Gemsloot platform</strong></a> <em>(this link includes the bonus)</em>.</li> <li>Find the SoFi Plus offer for $30 (you can use the search bar for &quot;SoFi Plus&quot;).</li> <li>Click the offer, make an account, and subscribe to SoFi Plus for the month, which costs <strong>$10</strong>.</li> <li>Once you&#39;re subscribed, Gemsloot pays you <strong",

At the same time, I\u2019ve been hesitant to point them at my main codebase because I don\u2019t fully trust them on my local machine. To keep things safe, I\u2019ve been spinning up a separate VM whenever I need to run an agent-driven task, then tearing it down when I\u2019m done. That workaround has let me customise agents and hooks while keeping my projects isolated \u2014 but it\u2019s clunky and not exactly cost\u2011effective.</p> <p>This experience has led me to explore an idea I\u2019m calling SentryForge: a secure, isolated sandbox where AI coding agents can run autonomously without exposing your source code or proprietary data. It\u2019s still very early days \u2014 I\u2019m trying to figure out what would make such a system trustworthy and useful.</p> <p>I\u2019d love to hear from anyone who\u2019s wrestled with similar concerns.
