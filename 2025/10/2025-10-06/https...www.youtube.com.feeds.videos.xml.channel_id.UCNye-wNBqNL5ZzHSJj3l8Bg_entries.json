        "description": "Speaking to Al Jazeera from Cairo, former Egyptian assistant foreign minister Hussein Haridi outlined key sticking points in Trump\u2019s Gaza peace plan, including Hamas\u2019s disarmament, the creation of an international stabilisation force, and Israel\u2019s continued security control over Gaza. \nHe said the plan\u2019s first phase should focus on releasing hostages, delivering humanitarian aid, and initiating an Israeli withdrawal. \nHaridi added that Hamas must redefine itself as a political rather than armed movement, but stressed that any disarmament must be tied to Israel\u2019s full withdrawal from Gaza, urging Arab and Palestinian unity on the issue.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDownload AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n#DonaldTrump #UnitedStates #Is",
