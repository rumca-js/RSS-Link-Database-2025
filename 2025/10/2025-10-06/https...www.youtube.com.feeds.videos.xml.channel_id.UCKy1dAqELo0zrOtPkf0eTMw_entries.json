        "description": "In 2024, we learned\u00a0that Marvel Studios co-founder David Maisel is spearheading a new shared universe called Ekos. Launched in conjunction with Aspen Comics and inspired by the work of the late Michael Turner and former DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns, Ekos aims to be the next big shared universe in comics. Ekos Vol. 1 was a big hit on Kickstarter, and now the creators are back for Vol. 2. \n\nEkos Vol. 2 is produced by Maisel and Aspen Comics and features a creative team of writer J.T. Krul, pencil artist Alex Konat, digital inker Mark Roslan, color artist Peter Steigerwald, and letterer Josh Reed. The crowdfunding campaign for this graphic novel begins on October 6, 2025.",
