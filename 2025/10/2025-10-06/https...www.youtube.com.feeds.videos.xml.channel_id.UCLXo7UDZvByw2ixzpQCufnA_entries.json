        "description": "We like to think of memory as a record of the past. But that\u2019s not really what it is. Memory doesn\u2019t keep the past \u2014 it can also remake it. It stitches fragments into stories, and those stories \u2014 true or not \u2014 are what we end up calling our life, and sometimes, our collective history.\n\nSean\u2019s guest today is Charan Ranganath, a neuroscientist and author of a book called Why We Remember. The two discuss the strange alchemy of remembering and how the stories our minds create end up creating us.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: Charan Ranganath, neuroscientist and author of Why We Remember\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
