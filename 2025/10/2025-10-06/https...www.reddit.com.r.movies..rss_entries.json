Adames, who had been cast after an open call, was between five and seven years old when cast, and his character Phil Dawn was six. He did not have any subsequent film roles afterwards. Adames&#39; performance was criticized by contemporary reviewers, who according to critic Ray Carney, expected Adames to be &quot;cute and cuddly&quot;, and when he was not, they judged that Cassavetes had failed. Eric Henderson of Slant magazine posited that the criticism was due to Adames&#39; vocal delivery, which he compared to &quot;what Paddy Chayefsky would sound like impersonating Alvin Chipmunk&quot;. Roger Ebert praised Adames&#39; performance, calling him &quot;well cast&quot;.</p> </blockquote> <p>Some critic",

It&#39;s pretty rare for me to watch a movie I know very little about but I saw it had good reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and starred Jim Cummings who I&#39;ve followed on social media for a while and has some really good takes on getting low budget movies made.</p> <p>I really enjoyed it. It&#39;s a low budget movie but you can see every single dollar they had is up on the screen. The performances are rock solid and its twisty turny enough to hold your interest.</p> <p>It&#39;s the kind of movie everyone complains about doesn&#39;t get made any more so I feel like it deserves to make more money and I wanted to give it a shout out.</p> <p>If you know of other movies that have been lost amongst the noise then please give them some love here.</p> <p>EDIT: Interested to know why you loved it too. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/corsair965\"> /u/corsa",
