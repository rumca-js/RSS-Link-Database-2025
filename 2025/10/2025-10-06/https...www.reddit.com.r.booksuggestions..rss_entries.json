I lean very heavy into the dystopian young adult aspect, however am not set on it. I have also read and loved Serial Killers and Mass Murderers: Profiles of the World&#39;s Most Barbaric Criminals, as well as Conversations with a Killer: Ed Kemper.

I&#39;m thinking something like Ocean Vuong&#39;s Time is a Mother or Pessoa&#39;s The Book of Disquiet. I really enjoy listening to audiobooks like these. Long drawn out prose that doesn&#39;t necessarily have one huge plot point. I read a lot of poetry, but when listening, I essentially just want &quot;long form&quot; poetry if that makes sense.

Though there should be romance but not the main focus But don&#39;t suggest books with no romance bcoz i want it.<br/> My favorites are HARRY POTTER (it&#39;s my love)<br/> Another is Relenless by Karen Lynch It&#39;s also my love like i loved it soo much.

I&#39;m looking for medieval-style fantasy books written in 3rd person that include a lot of gore, violence, and sex/smut. Can be any sub-genre as long as it&#39;s fantasy. Can be male or female pov, as long as it&#39;s written in 3rd person. I do not enjoy books written in 1st person. Standalone or series, either one is fine. Think Game of Thrones or Spartacus, that level of sex and violence. I&#39;ve read the Barrow by Mark Smylie and really enjoyed that.

My last reads were \u201cdark matter\u201d and \u201cRecursion\u201d, which I enjoyed. </p> <p>I don\u2019t get too involved with non fiction, but I did like \u201ckitchen confidential\u201d and \u201cthe road to Jonestown\u201d.</p> <p>Thank you in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mconroy95\"> /u/mconroy95 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1nz6rhr/book_suggestions/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1nz6rhr/book_suggestions/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I would prefer something decently lengthy and rich in story. Think Odin\u2019s child by Siri Pettersen (a great read, my current book!) but Greek instead of Norse.
