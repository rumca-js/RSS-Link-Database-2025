I&#39;m 22, I&#39;ve never had a girlfriend, never hugged a woman, held a woman&#39;s hand, kissed a woman, or had sex. The majority of society discriminates against short men, consciously or unconsciously, because they laugh at them and make fun of them. But thanks to AI, it will soon be possible to have virtual, very realistic boyfriends and girlfriends. I am incredibly excited about this because we are just at the beginning of a wonderful journey.
