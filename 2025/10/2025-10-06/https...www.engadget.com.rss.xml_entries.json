Amazon always has lead-up sales in the days and weeks before Prime Day, and it\u2019s wise to shop early if you\u2019re on the hunt for something specific and you see that item at a good discount.<br><br>Prime Day deals are typically reserved for subscribers, but there are always a few that anyone can shop. We expect this year to be no exception, and we\u2019re already starting to see that trend in these early Prime Day deals. These are the best Prime Day deals you can get right now ahead of the event, and we\u2019ll update this post with the latest offers as we get closer to October Prime Day proper.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-octob",
