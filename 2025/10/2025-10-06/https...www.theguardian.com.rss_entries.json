I\u2019d broken up with my long-term girlfriend but was hoping that we\u2019d get back together, which is why the chorus goes: \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna make it.\u201d A friend had told me she was dating a guy who\u2019d just done a car advert, which must have been in my head when I wrote: \u201cHe\u2019s got a brand new car. Looks like a Jaguar.\u201d The second verse, about us starting again in a house in Devon and drinking \u201ccider from a lemon\u201d, was probably inspired by playing gigs in little clubs down there when Feeder were starting out \u2013 and by my teenage years in Wales, when we mixed cider with lemonade.
