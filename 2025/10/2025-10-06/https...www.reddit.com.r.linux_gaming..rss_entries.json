As win10 support ends very soon and me not wanting to go back to win11 because all the bloat, and them wanting to put in popup ads, I was searching for a linux os that I can have all my apps and games. While I was searching multiple sites said &quot;Bazzide os&quot;. It does seem really good on paper, but sholud I switch?</p> <p>Questions: 1) I only see it in videos as ps3 type interface, any way to change it to desktop type?</p> <p>2) how will I install all my apps as brave, google, whatsapp, telegram, signal, etc?</p> <p>3) will I be able to install tlauncher? (Please no hate, I am not ready to spend 300nok on a game) or any other games that are by themselves and without launchers like steam or epic.</p> <p>Any help will be appreciated!

I tried changing the Proton versions and all on The properties menu but none of them seem to work, and if I try some of the older versions the games won&#39;t even launch. And these games ran almost perfectly on this laptop when I used Windows. now when I try running them on Linux, they Just have a really poor performance, They&#39;re extremely slow and buggy and I can barely get past the main menu screens. And they all have the same issue, regardless If they&#39;re meant for low-end machines or not. Does Proton only work perfectly with GPUs that can support Vulkan? (My laptop uses an integrated GPU, obviously.) is there a fix to it? Am I doing something wrong? </p> <p>Here are the games I&#39;ve tested until ",

In Windows, I\u2019d just open joy.cpl and recalibrate, but I\u2019m not sure how to do this properly on Linux.</p> <p>I tried running jscal -c /dev/input/js0 to calibrate, but when I test it with jstest, the values are all wonky:</p> <ul> <li>At rest (0% press): Shows 255 (shouldn\u2019t this be 0?)</li> <li>Fully pressed (100%): Only goes up to 113 (instead of, say, 255 or 32767).</li> <li>The brake and clutch work fine, though. They correctly hit 0 when fully pressed.</li> </ul> <p>This means in-game, I\u2019m stuck at half throttle, which makes driving <em>super</em> frustrating. I\u2019ve seen some old posts about manually editing /etc/joystick.jscal, but I\u2019m not sure what values to put in there.</p> <p>Has anyone run into this before?
