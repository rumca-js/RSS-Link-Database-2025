After a while, i wanted to dispose of it, worried about someone taking it, i bent it in half the more i could, but I didn&#39;t really verify if the motherboard was broken (the screen was shattered in a lot of pieces). And tossed it (in a regular bin, i know it&#39;s wrong).</p> <p>A bit of history on this phone. Nexus 6 launched with cryptography but i modded it and think it was disabled after a while since it hindered performances. I used it for a while until about 2017 where i changed phone, and wiped it a couple times in the meantime. The phone was then lended to a friend and back to me, full wipe again. After some time i also decided to use it as a second phone, so i modded it again, so full wipe again. The phone had mostly nothing on it by the tim",
