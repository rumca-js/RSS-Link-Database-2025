        "description": "Today, negotiators from Israel and Hamas head to Sharm El-Sheikh in Egypt to start indirect talks over an end to the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIt appears this is the closest both sides have come to a deal since the war began two years ago. But Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan - which Israel has agreed to and Hamas has partly agreed to - is really just a framework, only a few pages long. So will the talks survive the detail? Adam talks to Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent, about how the next few days could play out?\n\nAnd, yet another French prime minister has resigned, less than a month after being appointed to the role. S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, a former armed forces minister, was France's fifth prime minister in under two years. What does President Macron do now? Adam speaks to co-host of the Global Story Tristan Redman and Marion Solletty Politico\u2019s editor-at-large in France.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCN",
