        "description": "Google's new developer verification requirements starting September 2026 will force ALL Android app developers to register with Google - even those avoiding the Play Store entirely. F-Droid, the trusted open-source app store used by millions, just published a damning response calling it a \"death sentence\" that creates an impossible catch-22 designed to kill alternative app distribution. I break down F-Droid's response, why Google's security argument falls apart, and what you need to do before it's too late to save Android's open ecosystem.
