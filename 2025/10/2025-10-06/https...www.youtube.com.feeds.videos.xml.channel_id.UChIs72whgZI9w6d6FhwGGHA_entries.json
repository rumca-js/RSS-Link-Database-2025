These laptops and desktops can be saved, or in the very least, the valuables (like aluminum and copper) can be removed and smelted down into reusable materials. Parts like CPUs can be repurposed into computers with broken CPUs or used in education, good batteries can be taken from laptops with dead motherboards and installed into laptops with dead batteries, and so forth. Kramden organizes these \"Geek-a-Thon\" events and Steve attended one nearly 20 years ago, but this time, he got to see how they actually arrange them.\n\nThis event was super fun! Not everything in here is because of Windows 10 support ending; Kramden does this all the time, for any computer or reason. That's also why you see some Macs in here.",
