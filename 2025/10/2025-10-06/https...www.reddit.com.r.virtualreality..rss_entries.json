From looking at all the reviews, they have seem to be every positive. It supports eye tracking and facial tracking but these are separate add-on purchase. I don\u2019t mind spending the extra 200 for face and 400$ for eye. I am a binged everyday vrchat user, and most of the people I come across mainly use quest pro for face tracking. But the con of getting a quest pro for face tracking you loose the opportunity to hook up your valve index controllers. Pairing the index controllers with any quest headset there tends to be a lot of drifting issues. The dongles have been outdated it seems, but if u use the original headset it prevents the drifting issues I have tested and bought a valve index just to pair my controller with my quest 3. I have spent 200 on seperate dongles brands thinking it was the dongles. </p> <p>The major answer I want is if anyone out there has owned the focus 3 or cu",
