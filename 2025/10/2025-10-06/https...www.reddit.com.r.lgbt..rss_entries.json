We have lived together for three years, and the past couple years we have started discussing marriage and potentially looking into adoption.</p> <p>A week ago my partner came to me and told me he thinks he is non binary, this honestly didn\u2019t come as much of a surprise as he has always suffered with pretty severe body issues and has never seemed truly comfortable with himself. I never mentioned my suspicions to him as I felt that it wasn\u2019t my place to assume and if he did think he was in the wrong body I felt he had the right to decide when to talk about it with me. </p> <p>I told him I support him no matter what and it does",

He went on a bit of a rant about how people are so quick to label themselves when they\u2019re just figuring it out. (Which, I agree that the pressure to label yourself is uncomfortable, but I think a lot of people find labels helpful.) He admitted that he had feelings for a guy once when he was 19-ish, but said that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not straight.
