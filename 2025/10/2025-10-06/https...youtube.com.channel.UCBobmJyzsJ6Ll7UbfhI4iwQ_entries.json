        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, Adam Creighton and Kevin Nappoly of Enduring Games provide a high-level summary of low-level implementations and differences in development required to add the latest gaming platforms to concurrent development, with examples of in-development or just-released games. \n\nThis session is designed for seasoned game teams making diverse content with UE5, to give considerations to help them avoid pitfalls and continually push the power of Unreal Engine to release more content for concurrent platforms, all with unified pipelines.\n\nTopics covered include considerations for asset and graphics pipelines, render models, unique features in UE (and alternatives when not supported for the target platforms), and concurrent multiplatform development.\n\nFind out more about using Unreal Engine to create games here: unrealengine.com/uses/games\n\n#EnduringGames, #GameDevelopment, #GraphicsPipelines, #RenderModels, #MultiplatformDevelopment, #UnrealEngine",
