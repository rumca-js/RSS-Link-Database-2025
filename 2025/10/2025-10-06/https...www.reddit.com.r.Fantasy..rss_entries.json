As I see it each of the books told the same story from different perspectives (which was new for me, but I liked it, especially when the prologue&#39;s mirrored each other), but BoD does lift the veil a little further so it seems the main danger is resolved. That said, it leaves you wondering what book 3 is about. Since the first two could mirror each other so well, its hard to imagine for me (but thats&#39; propably beacause I&#39;m not a writer) that book 3 will be yet another perspective. It got me to thinking about the overarching subject and how the books, even if its in a way re-threading the same story points, still &#39;handle&#39; the subject differently. That&#39;s how I came up with my take on the trilogy:</p> <p>Subject: The Thread of Kithamar. Books Subjects:</p> <ul> <li>Dreading the thread</li> <li>Cutting the thread",

Before either she announced that her next series would be called Folly. The anchor story in the collection is set in the Folly universe. The preface says it\u2019s a scene from her next project.</p> <p>The novella is decidedly not. It\u2019s closer to Uprooted and Spinning Silver. And the page where she announced Folly is now gone, so there appears to be no active account of whether this is still her plan or if she has changed her mind. I know Martha Wells has life events that may put a pause on finishing Murderbot, but I have hear no such thing about Naomi Novik.</p> <p>Anyone have any quotes from her on how that\u2019s going?

How does retirement work in a world where people don\u2019t die?</p> <p>Why do people just accept dying in a very short notice? Like that first kid in the school just dies without having family with him after about ten minutes of realizing he\u2019s gonna die.
