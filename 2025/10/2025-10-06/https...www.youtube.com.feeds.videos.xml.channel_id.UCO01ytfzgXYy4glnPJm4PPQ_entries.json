        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, a monstrous killer murdered a child a few years ago. He's currently a free man. How is that possible? This case is not only shocking. It should be a wake up call for the country. Also, a federal judge tells Trump that he's not allowed to deploy troops to Portland. Is it time for Trump to finally defy these activist judges and let the chips fall? Also, the democrat attorney general candidate in Virginia detailed his violent fantasies in writing, fantasizing about murdering his political opponents and watching their children die. But has this revelation caused a single democrat, anywhere in the country, to call for him to drop out? Of course not.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:35 Opening\n01:57 - 28:20 He Murdered A Child. Now He\u2019s Walking Free. This Case Should Be A Wake Up Call For The Country.\n30:56 - 36:44 Federal Judge Blocks Trump's National Guard Deployment To Portland\n36:45 - 46:25 Bad Bunny Wants You To Learn Spanish To Understand His Trashy Lyrics\n46:26 ",
