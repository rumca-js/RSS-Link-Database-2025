He says that after 40, humans typically lose about a <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003998.htm\">centimetre of height</a> every decade. Men lose <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4103973/\">0.08-0.1%</a> of their body height per year. Women typically lose 0.12-0.14% per year.</p><p>Some of this is caused by increasingly slumped posture as we get older. People who sit or stand with a curved spine for prolonged periods of time \u2013 perhaps at their desk \u2013 may find that, over time, their spine assumes that position naturally. Older people sometimes stoop to find a more secure centre of gravity too.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/06/is-it-true-that-you-get-shorter-as-you-get-o",

That was back in the summer of 2024 and Anderson, now an England international, has rarely looked back since joining Forest. For much of the first half he eclipsed even Sandro Tonali and, overall, was comfortably Ange Postecoglou\u2019s best player. Yet Anderson is human and when his loose pass offered Bruno Guimar\u00e3es an opening, his subsequent attempt at a recovery tackle was mistimed and sent Guimar\u00e3es crashing in the area. The Brazilian had already shot Newcastle ahead from 25 yards and from the spot Nick Woltemade scored his fourth goal in five starts. Tellingly, at the final whistle both Postecoglou and Howe made concerted efforts to console Anderson. If ",
