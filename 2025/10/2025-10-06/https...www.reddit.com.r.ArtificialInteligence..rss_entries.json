(September 24, 2025)</a></p> <p>This is a talk by Kevin Buzzard about how people are trying to teach AI how to do mathematics. The video is 48 minutes long so you might want to skip ahead to 18:40 or so.</p> <p>At one point in the talk, he makes the following analogy. You can talk to an LLM and ask it to multiply two small numbers and it will give you the right answer. Not too long ago, if you asked an LLM to multiply two very large numbers, it would confidently give you a wrong answer. However, OpenAI figured out that you could give the LLM a calculator or teach it how to write python code in order to solve harder arithmetic problems. People are trying to do something similar with math. Instead of rerouting to a calculator or using python, researchers are trying to teach AI how to translate between natural language and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w",

Work, projects, planning his life (he\u2019s fully riding the wave).</p> <p>And then there are these kid in my neighbourhood, somewhere around the age of 12 or 13. School going kids...but AI is part of literally everything they do. Homework, games, chatting, planning stuff. It\u2019s just normal for them. And that hit me. This is how the next generation is growing up. AI isn\u2019t some \u201cspecial tool\u201d to them, it\u2019s just life.</p> <p>So yeah\u2026 makes me wonder if we are we even capable of keeping a balance anymore? Do we want to?

It sounds small, but it is not. You can no longer view 100 results at once. The new hard limit is 10.</p> <p>Here is why this matters. Most large language models like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity rely directly or indirectly on Google&#39;s indexed results to feed their retrieval systems and crawlers. By cutting off the long tail of results, Google just reduced what these systems can see by roughly 90 percent. The web just got shallower not only for humans but for AI as well.</p> <p>The impact was immediate. According to Search Engine Land, about 88 percent of websites saw a drop in impressions. Sites that ranked in positions 11 to 100 basically disappeared. Reddit, which often ranks deep in search results, saw its LLM citations drop sharply.</p> <p>This is not just an SEO story.
