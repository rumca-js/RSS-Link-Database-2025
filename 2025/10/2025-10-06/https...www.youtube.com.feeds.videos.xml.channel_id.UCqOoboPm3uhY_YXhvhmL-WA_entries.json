        "description": "Team Apocalypse takes on a major project, building a high-water truck for the Pompano Fire Department. Meanwhile, NBA star Shaquille O'Neal visits to get his own custom Super Truck, highlighting the team\u2019s creativity and skill.\n\n#Discovery #TruckDynasty\n\nAbout Truck Dynasty: \nIn the multi-billion-dollar custom truck business, no one builds louder, more outrageous, or more sought-after creations than Florida's own Apocalypse Manufacturing. As if the builds alone weren't challenging enough, owners Joe and Ashley Ghattas also manage Ashley's over-the-top \"New Jersey Extra\" family -- who just so happen to make up the company's sales and marketing teams. There's Ashley's father, Jerry, or \"Pop,\" an old school car salesman from a bygone era; her youngest brother, Frank, the handlebar mustache-sporting sales machine; and her eldest brother, Jerry \"Jr,\" the most over-the-top and intense marketing guru in South Florida.\n\nSubscribe to Discovery: https://www.youtube.com/@discovery\n\nAbout Discove",
