Better raiding, new lands, vast new adventures, yes, but it's also a game that has become less collaborative. Many players are an island, separated from their peers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan\">Read more</a></p>",

It's because of their price. Five years after this generation began, the consoles have never been more expensive, and it's not a pattern we're used to. We're used to prices going down - to manufacturing improvements shrinking both the physical size of the machines and their price. But not this time. This time, it's different.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them\">Read more</a></p>",
