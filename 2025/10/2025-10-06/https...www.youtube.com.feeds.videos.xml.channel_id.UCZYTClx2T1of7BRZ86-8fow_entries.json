        "description": "There's one human innovation that's so critical to our lives that every modern human group seems to have it. And you probably have some in your craft drawer - it's glue!

No wonder it's stuck around for so long!\n\nHosted by: Savannah Geary (they/them)\n----------\nSupport us for $8/month on Patreon and keep SciShow going!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scishow\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our SciShow email list to get the latest news and highlights: \nhttps://mailchi.mp/scishow/email\n----------\nHuge thanks go to the following Patreon supporters for helping us keep SciShow free for everyone forever: Eric Jensen, David Johnston, Alan Wong, Cye Stoner, Bethany Matthews, Adam Brainard, Friso, Matt Curls, Chris Mackey, Garrett Galloway, J.V.
