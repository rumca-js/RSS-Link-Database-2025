I wasn&#39;t that whelmed by the movie, but I didn&#39;t think the book would be that much worse. It&#39;s not a classic, it&#39;s obnoxious. </p> <p>It carries too much stereotypes like women hating each other, being friends to hate other women, submitting to unsatisfying, hurtful sex while treating it like a sacred mantle and just in general it&#39;s a really hard pivot from wonder of magic to women who don&#39;t need no man subcoming to being hateful hags and only that hatefulness kept them friends.</p> <p>Oh, and the children. I didn&#39;t like that they all give birth at the end of the movie, but I hate that being a free woman comes with hating your children even more. I don&#39;t even register that Jane has kids up until the last hundred pages. Sapphic motives? Just to play up the perversion I guess, because from what I&#39;ve managed to catch with my too annoyed brain is that they all fi",

And maybe I\u2019ve just been performative about books and reading physical books. It\u2019s just so much more convenient to read on my phone and I don\u2019t need to worry about if I have enough light to read, if I have space in my bag to carry whatever size book, etc. . I can just whip it out anywhere. And I know people carry books around with them and read wherever they go but IS THAT EVEN REALISTIC? Reading on my iPad is fine too but it\u2019s just so bulky to hold and type my notes in. Anyways this was just a rant about how I\u2019m finally enjoying reading because of the convenience of my phone. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Googoocaca_\"> /u/Googoocaca_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1nz8ivw/i_am_reading_a_book_on_my_phone_and_its_great/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/book",
