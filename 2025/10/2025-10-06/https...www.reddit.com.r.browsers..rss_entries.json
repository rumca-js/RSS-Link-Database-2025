The problem is that no browser I&#39;ve tried\u2014Chrome, Arc, Firefox, Brave, DDG\u2014has an option to import data from it.</p> <p>My main workaround attempt was to manually copy the profile files (Bookmarks, History, Cookies, etc.) into Chrome&#39;s user data folder to use it as a middleman. Unfortunately, that process failed, likely due to some incompatibility.</p> <p>So, I&#39;m left wondering if a browser with a &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;manual select&quot; import feature even exists. I&#39;m imagining a tool where, instead of picking &#39;Chrome&#39; or &#39;Firefox&#39; from a list, you could manually point the importer to a specific folder path (e.g.,",

I was using that only for one fking reason, it was its ability to switch between recently used tabs. This was the only reason for me to stay there and not touch any other browser, since none of the browsers could implement this at such a level. But today I discovered firefox has silently implemented this feature into their browser using ctrl+tab. You can refer the screenshots. It was great, although needs some practice for fingers. Now finally... finally... I can use a browser with peace. Its a winner for me. Firefox has everything, its well optimized, it has android support, it has a password manager, it has wide extension support, its an og like chrome, it doesnt collect data and its a winner. Let me know your thoughts on this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd-Sy",
