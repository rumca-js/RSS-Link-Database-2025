        "description": "\u25b8 The Absolute Universe, originally referred to as The Elseworld or the Alpha World, is a parallel reality that emerged concurrently with Earth Omega following the creation of the Infinite Frontier in the wake of the last Metal War. Along with Earth Omega, the Elseworld is one of two poles of the expanded Multiverse-1.\n\nIt shares many similarities to Earth 0, but instead of having hope and justice at its core, as embodied by Superman, it is built from despair as embodied by Darkseid.\n\nFOLLOW ME HERE!\n\u25b8 Subscribe: http://bit.ly/ComicsExplainedSub\n\u25b8 Twitter: http://twitter.com/Comicsexplained\n\u25b8 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/comicsexplained\n\nVideos Everyone Loves:\n\u25b8 New To Invincible?
