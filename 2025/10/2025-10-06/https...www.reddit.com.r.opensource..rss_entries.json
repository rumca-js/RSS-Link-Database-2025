I would like to have a simple app I could deploy on my local cluster that I could serve to my local network. Then, I\u2019d like to be able to put in a customer\u2019s payment information with them over a call. From there, I hit submit and it charges them and forwards the money to my bank. Similarly, I would like to be able to do it backwards in case I need to refund someone. Does something like this already exist that I can simply deploy and configure? Or, do I need to build it myself? </p> <p>Thanks, yall! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Whole-Watch-7980\"> /u/Whole-Watch-7980 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1nzkssn/payment_processing/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1nzkssn/payment_processing/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Instead of just showing: &quot;you had 1000 visits today,&quot; it actually tracks the stuff that matters for your business.</p> <p>Why I built it: Most analytics tools focus on vanity metrics like page views. But if you&#39;re running a business, you need to know which feature drive revenue, where your best customers come from, and how people actually use your product.</p> <p>The code is open source on GitHub, and we have a hosted version if you don&#39;t want to self-host. Been using it for my own projects and it&#39;s been really helpful for understanding what actually drives growth.</p> <ul> <li>Product: <a href=\"https://metricswave.net\">https://metricswave.net</a></li> <li>Repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/metricswave/\">https://github.com/metricswave/</a></li> </ul> <p>What do you think?
