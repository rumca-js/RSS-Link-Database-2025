But some people do not like scary films. Some people do not like films where there are any intense emotional moments <em>whatsoever</em>. This is mostly a list of those films.

Similarly, Finding Nemo cannot be included because it is a film about a grief-stricken father searching for a son he believes might be dead. But Cars, a film about some cars, can. The scariest that Cars gets is when a car has a near-miss with a train.

It\u2019s sensual, visceral and, she says, totally intuitive</p><p>A couple of summers ago I was in a club in Manchester, dancing alone in the dark, when bodies suddenly flooded the dancefloor. Androgynous men and women all dressed in skin-tight, skin-coloured lace. Their lithe limbs and torsos flinched and flickered; they slithered and strutted. They were alluring and unhuman, sexy and weird. I was in the middle of ROSE, an immersive dance collaboration between record label Young and Sharon Eyal, an Israeli choreographer now based in France, who has become one of the most in-demand on the contemporary dance scene over the last decade. In her works that have come to the UK \u2013 Killer Pig, OCD Love, Saaba and more \u2013 Eyal\u2019s strangely intoxicating choreography taps into the sensibility of nightclubs and catwalks, as well as something much more primal in the gathering of bodies to move as one together.</p>",
