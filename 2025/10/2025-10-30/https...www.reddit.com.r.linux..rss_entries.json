After multiple uninstalls and reboots , checking pacman logs and bash history i finally booted in arch after removing libinput-config.

Until that time, I&#39;ve made a small project out of this little laptop. I&#39;ve torn it down, wiped away some grime, repasted the chips, and swapped out the disk drive with my deceased gfs data on it for a sata SSD drive. It only has one ram slot filled so when I get the $10-20 I&#39;ll be getting another stick. </p> <p>Anyway, I&#39;m trying to push this little guy to perform it&#39;s absolute best it can. Maybe use it as a living room media PC. I have limited experience with Linux so I was wondering what distro people recommend? She used Lubutu and that&#39;s the live boot I tried using.

I&#39;ve tried to manipulate the preference menu the best I can in between that and Google research I&#39;m not coming up with any luck. I&#39;m on Kali not that I think that makes a difference.

I have been using Ubuntu Cinnamon for awhile for both school and home use (gaming, programming, vr, game dev, etc) and it seems to be a very well maintained, functional, and stable distro with good support through .deb packages for printers n such, and the apt repository seems well checked and stable. It also seems to have good peripheral drivers built in. Seemed a little silly for it to not include flatpack by default but thats easily fixed. Overall though, I am still a relative newcomer to Linux and haven&#39;t been in the community that much until recently, so I am a lil out of the loop.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/megaslash288\"> /u/megaslash288 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ojn5oz/whats_going_on_with_the_dislike_of_ubuntucanonical/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ojn5oz/whats_going_on",
