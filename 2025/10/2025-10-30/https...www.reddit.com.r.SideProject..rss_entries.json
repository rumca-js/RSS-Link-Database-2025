Then you add a home screen widget to see your weekly miles, updated in the background, even when the app is closed. And you set it to export your running workouts to a Google Spreadsheet on a schedule, also while the app is closed. The App is called RunData, and it is currently on TestFlight. If interested, please check out <a href=\"http://rundata.cc\">rundata.cc</a> and enter your email for a TestFlight link! By the way, you can open the app if you want and explore your runs in depth.
