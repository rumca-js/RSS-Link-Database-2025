        "description": "Recruiters on LinkedIn are still losing it \u2014 like full-on meltdown mode. One says it\u2019s \u201cunprofessional\u201d to have call screening turned on. Another says you\u2019re \u201ctrying to escape\u201d if you keep your jacket on during the interview. Apparently, being thirsty, not being thirsty, answering the phone, not answering the phone\u2026 it\u2019s all wrong.\n\nIn this sequel to my last video, we dive back into the chaos of recruiter logic \u2014 where professionalism means guessing the exact tone, hydration level, and jacket position that will get you hired. From recruiters mad about \u201copen to work\u201d banners to others bragging about avoiding them entirely, it\u2019s the same corporate theater \u2014 just with new clowns.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been told you\u2019re too professional, not professional enough, or that your ringtone ruined your career \u2014 welcome to LinkedIn. You\u2019re gonna love it here.\n\n#RecruiterCringe #LinkedInLunatics #JoshuaFluke\n\nNeed a resume / cover letter? \u27a1\ufe0f https://joshuafluke.store\n\u2022 \ud83d\udd0d Resume Reviews\n\u2022 \u270d\ufe0f Custom Resume",
