I used an app called WePlay (a social/voice chat app) and at some point, it asked for storage access, which I allowed. I also sent a few pictures through the app \u2014 nothing inappropriate, just regular photos \u2014 but now I\u2019m scared that the app might\u2019ve kept copies of them or accessed other files on my phone or scanned my entire gallery and uploaded all the pictures on their servers even deleted photos and videos.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already uninstalled the app, revoked permissions, and cleared cache/data. But I\u2019m not sure if that actually removes my photos from their servers or if they could still have them.</p> <p>Is there any way to check if an app uploaded files while it had storage access? And is there a proper way to ask WePlay to delete all my data and pictures from their servers?</p> <p>Any advice on how to stay safe or confirm my photos aren\u2019t being misused would mean a lot. \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",
