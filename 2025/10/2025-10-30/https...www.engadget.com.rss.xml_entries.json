To do that, the Pinterest Assistant looks at the items you&#39;ve saved and the boards you&#39;ve created (for example, a board full of living room decor inspiration), compares it with the things Pinterest users with similar taste have saved and displays visual results tailored to you.</p><figure><img src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Pinterest-Assistant",
