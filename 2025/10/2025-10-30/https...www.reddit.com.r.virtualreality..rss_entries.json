Getting into it turned out to be quite difficult though, i guess i have to download that luke ross vr mod and set it up. I was just wondering is the headset i have compatible with the mod and the game before i pay up for the mod. Any info and help regarding this issue would greatly be appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ol1s1kohan\"> /u/ol1s1kohan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ok8mjn/htc_vive_cosmos_and_cyberpunk/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ok8mjn/htc_vive_cosmos_and_cyberpunk/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It&#39;s basically as good a product as the Q3, only with a better display but three times the price. It lacks the wow factor the AVP has. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still think the AVP is crazy expensive for what it is. But at least it gives you some experiences no other headset will.
