This is not AI written so bear with my bad english.</p> <p>I did my test on Cyberpunk 2077.</p> <p>So, I was wondering how can I cut down background processes to maximise gaming performance and my journey began with creating a build of DWM, which will do nothing but launching steam in bigpicture mode.</p> <p>I plan to use this alongside my KDE Wayland session running on TTY2. So while my KDE session is running, I plan to switch to TTY4 (or similar) and use `startx` to start a session of steam bigpicture. Initially plan was to just launch gamescope from startx (.xinitrc method) and get on with my life, but the performance was identical to my KDE Wayland session with whatever optimisation I could find.</p> <p>When I found that there is no significant performance gain, I switched over to my plan B of writing a minimal build of DWM, no extra keyboard shortcut nothing, just launch steam bigpicture and hand",

I don&#39;t really play much multiplayer so I&#39;m not worried about anti cheat compatibility. I appreciate any advice as I&#39;ve never used Linux before although I am pretty tech savvy and not afraid of using CLI for some things. I&#39;m just sick of windows BS and am ready for something better.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Boring-Bus-8721\"> /u/Boring-Bus-8721 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ojqt59/ditching_windows_which_distribution_of_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ojqt59/ditching_windows_which_distribution_of_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>",

A much more resource heavy-game such as Elden Ring doesn&#39;t even use up that much memory in comparison either.
