        "description": "Bread has been a staple food for thousands of years, and in recent times sourdough bread has been making a comeback. It is regarded as natural, nutritious, and full of flavor. But what exactly happens during this complex fermentation process? And how do wheat fibers influence bread quality? These questions were at the heart of the doctoral research conducted by V\u00edctor Gonz\u00e1lez Alonso, a researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). He studied the role of arabinoxylans, a specific group of dietary fibers in wheat, during sourdough fermentation.",

        "description": "A research team has created a new kind of electrochemical \"two-in-one\" system that turns plant-based molecules into two useful products at once. Using a finely tuned single-atom ruthenium catalyst, the process combines two chemical reactions, oxidation and hydrogenation, inside a single electrolytic cell, much like cooking two dishes in the same pot without mixing up the flavors. Details of the research were published in the journal Advanced Energy Materials on October 15, 2025.",
