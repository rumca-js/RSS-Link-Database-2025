I&#39;ve been scouring the internet for a solution, so I&#39;m hoping to find some help here.</p> <p>I just played my first game of Azul Duel. It was a lot of fun, but more complicated than regular Azul. Because it is more complex, the first time we opened it, we did not play a game, we got discouraged reading the rules and packed it up for later. I think I LOST TWO BONUS CHIPS when I unpacked it the first time and they&#39;re just gone forever now. I would love to replace them without having to buy the whole game again. I have a 3D printer, but I don&#39;t know what a complete set looks like because I have never seen them all together. I probably just accidentally threw them out a month ago.</p> <p>Does anyone know where I could find a solution?</p> <p>Thanks so much in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/colinferno\"> /u/colinfern",
