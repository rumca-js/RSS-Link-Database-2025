I used this macbook previously for \u00ab normal \u00bb activities like social media, buying stuff from Amazon\u2026 I got another computer but I don\u2019t want it to be related to any deep web activities.</p> <p>My questions might be dumb, but If I do a factory reset, will all the data related to me on this computer will disappear, or could a skilled hacker/government agency would still be able to find data ? Should I factory reset and also completely remove MacOS ? Should I just burn this old MacBook and buy a cheap computer instead ? </p> <p>The idea here is to access the deep web in the most secure and anonymous way possible. I don\u2019t mind setting up a proxy or any extra security step I might not know about yet. So I\u2019m definitely open to your recommendations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwaway2442244224\"> /u/Throwaway2",
