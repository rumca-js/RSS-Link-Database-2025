        "description": "Rules of Engagement: The Grey State is a wildly unique extraction shooter. It takes place within a variety of different horror realms with gameplay that fuses objective-based extraction with a royale pace and some RPG progression sprinkled on top.  \n\nHunt: The Showdown inspired some of the extraction shooter ideas while the studio\u2019s previous game, Ring of Elysium helped define some of the battle royale elements. \n\nWith a projected 2026 release on PC, this horror-themed free to play extraction shooter is sure to scare and delight genre fans and newcomers alike. The monster designs in particular are a standout, and the team has even expressed interest collaborating across horror franchises to diversify its creature roster further.",

        "description": "This one time in ARC Raiders, while scrounging around for resources, a regular rooftop stroll turned into a battle with ARC and a squad wipe at the hands of another team who used our own zipline against us. Another time in ARC Raiders, we ventured into the forest and went up against a Leaper \u2013 unprepared, it promptly wiped two of us out before cleaning up the third in their desperate bid to revive me. Yet another time in ARC Raiders, we engaged in a tense sniper shoot-out \u2013 I went down in a lame attempt to flank them from below, but a timely rez on an ally before my escapade contributed, however little, to our team ultimately escaping.\n\nI'm not the biggest extraction shooter aficionado on the planet, but Embark Studios' latest, which should be available by the time this is live, had me thoroughly engrossed.
