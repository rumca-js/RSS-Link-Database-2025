        "description": "This session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm explores procedural content generation (PCG) techniques for large-scale entertainment venue designs, including stadiums, arenas, and theatres.\n\nWatch the video to see how modular approaches to architectural design coupled with PCG can enable rapid, performant pathways for digital conceptualization and design phases.  \n\nThe session also touches on approaches to enriching entertainment venues with interactive elements via PCG, how RealityScan can be used as part of the modular approach, and how we can share these modular pieces on the Fab marketplace to empower the wider community of users in their own design journeys.\n\nLearn more about procedural content generation in Unreal Engine here: dev.epicgames.com/documentation/unreal-engine/procedural-content-generation-overview\n\n#ArchitecturalDesign, #ProceduralContentGeneration, #RealityScan, #Fab, #PCG, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestStockholm",
