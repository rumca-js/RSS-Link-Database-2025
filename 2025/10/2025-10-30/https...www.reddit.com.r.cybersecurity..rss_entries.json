Regulators call. The board wants proof of control. Everyone is using their perspective to drag the event in a different direction when none of them really have a clue what they are doing.</p> <p>Some people I have talked to have said that one way to improve this is to use tabletops as a safe space to root out where the chaos will appear and refine muscle and organizational memory around those areas.

But when I started learning practical things, I couldn\u2019t understand anything. I realized that, for me, theory is important in the beginning so I can understand how things work. I have no background in this field at all everything is new to me, especially since I\u2019m learning in English. I\u2019m also trying to learn how to form sentences, read, and write, especially in this area. Please, I\u2019d really appreciate some advice for someone who started at the end of 2025 and knows absolutely nothing. Did I miss the train? For context, I\u2019m someone who pays a lot of attention to details I need to fully understand something before moving on to the next topic, which means my learning process might take more time.</strong></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",
