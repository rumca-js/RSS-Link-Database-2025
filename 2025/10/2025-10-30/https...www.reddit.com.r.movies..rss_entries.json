I absolutely love films that feel as close to real life as they can. Being lost in your 20s, struggling to make ends meet, friends and close ones drifting apart and those changes hurt but acceptance and patience comes along with it. I love how it wasn\u2019t too fast or had a grand happy ending like see she\u2019s rich or she found love but the whole film felt like a process of growing up and the ups and downs that come with it. It felt like a warm hug. 10/10 performances, screenplay and direction.

I was wondering if I could get some recommendations for some movies that in some way glorify killing Nazis (or general white supremacists/fascists). </p> <p>I want something that feels like the Wolfenstein game reboots, though I&#39;m open to more grounded films, as long as they have some form of Nazi suffering by the end.</p> <p>On my list so far are three films that I feel demonstrate the vibe I&#39;m seeking better than my words:</p> <p>- JoJo Rabbit (2019) <em>dir. Taika Waititi</em></p> <p>- BlacKkKlansman (2018) <em>dir. Spike Lee</em></p> <p>- Inglorious Basterds (2009) <em>dir. Quentin Tarantino</em></p> <p><em>(also maybe Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) dir. Steven Spielberg)</em></p> <p>I would love a wide array of suggestions. Any setting from the 1930s to the future, in any country, in any multiverse. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some old WWII propaganda films that could fit the bill, or niche animated superhero from the 50s and 60s. J",
