        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>What are some books where authors created a weapon from scratch? Meaning they didn\u2019t take something like a sword and make it magical or larger or smaller, but created a weapon that doesn\u2019t or hasn\u2019t ever existed. It can, though, have influence from other weapons, or a use (stabbing, piercing, slashing, shooting, pounding) similar to other weapons. As long as the series has one original weapon. I know I\u2019m asking for a lot, but this has fascinated me based on briefly looking into weapon creation throughout history.

Like\u2026 an unhealthy backlog-destroying amount. With anime constantly pumping out isekai, manhwa doubling down on regression power-fantasy stories (I haven\u2019t even broken into the Chinese meta yet), I\u2019m curious what the <em>rest</em> of the fantasy scene has to offer \u2014 books, movies, TV series, anything.</p> <p>The thing is, I\u2019m <strong>not really a big book reader</strong>. The only series I seriously read was <em>Percy Jackson</em> way back \u2014 I got up to <em>House of Hades</em> and just stopped.
