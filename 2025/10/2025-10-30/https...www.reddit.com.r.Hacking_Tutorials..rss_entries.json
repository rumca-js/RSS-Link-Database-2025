I was thinking about ProtonVPN and I was wondering if they support a Custom DNS, I use a PiHole, Mullvard didnt play well with it and i couldnt establish a connection to the Internet due to Mullvard blocking the DNS server even though &quot;allow LAN devices&quot; was activated.</p> <p>I mainly use the VPN to torrent and to surf the web.

Im wondering if the ethical hacking course on cisco is worth even doing. </p> <p>Context:</p> <p>I already took a few courses and I can confidently say I have a intermediate knowledge base on networking &amp; security, endpoint security, cybersecurity so on and so forth.</p> <p>Is this course right for me or is there other FREE offline courses yall can recommend?</p> <p>P.S. Im aware of THM, HTB and many other resources exist but I feel like doing that after I take any form of ethical hacking course would be the better way to go about things. Let me know your thoughts and opinions on the route I should take.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Rare_Needleworker571\"> /u/Rare_Needleworker571 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ojrw4n/cisco_ethical_hacking_course_good_or_bad_whats/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacki",
