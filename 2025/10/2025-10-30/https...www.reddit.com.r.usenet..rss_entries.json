It returns too many results even when filtered by categories. How do you use query where it only searches for the query entry. For example I&#39;m looking for just the word &#39;nite&#39;. Than it returns everything with nite in it. Like infinite, unite etc. I just want only results with the full word nite. I&#39;ve tried putting it in&#39; &#39;and &quot; &quot; but the search results always seem full text not the exact word.
