Here\u2019s where my brain is at: </p> <ol> <li><p>My main website page is ranking in the #1 position for 3 keywords in my main city/service area. (YAY!). </p></li> <li><p>I have built 4 additional service area pages for cities near by my main area. The current rankings for each main keyword I want to rank for is: 12, 21, 21, 40.</p></li> <li><p>The keyword difficulty % for those pages is the following: 2, 3, 14, 38. The first two are incredibly low\u2026 and should be super easy to improve ranking for.</p></li> </ol> <p>Additional context: - All of the content on the service area pages is unique - general SEO principles have been followed for each of those new pages</p> <p>With all of that information, what do you propose the best plan of action is to increase the visibility of those additional pages? Surfer SEO to help with content/keyword placement? </p> <p>B",
