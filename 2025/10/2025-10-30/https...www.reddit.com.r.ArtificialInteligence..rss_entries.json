I can say with certainty they used AI in old songs and in their visuals, and they have uploaded a ton of singles in the last year. The ones featured on their YouTube music page have almost all passed my personal AI vibe detector, but I think this artist is just really smart at masking what would be obvious AI vocals. The more I go back and listen to them, the more I can kinda hear the distinct AI vocal patterns which normally tip me off.</p> <p>They also don&#39;t feature any vocal artists in their song titles which is one of the biggest reasons I&#39;m pretty confident they are AI. Regardless, I unfortunately love the style of music they make, but I personally don&#39;t want to be listening to AI slop, so this is pretty sad to finally realize it&#39;s AI :(</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GGgetLucky\"> /u/GGgetLucky </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Artificia",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>With the immense hype surrounding AI, people have become increasingly reliant on AI-generated content, both in their daily lives and in journalism. From journalists using AI to write to the rise of entirely AI-generated news sites, the impact of AI on journalism is undeniable. However, the fact that we can\u2019t distinguish between real human-written articles and AI-generated ones raises serious concerns. This issue, coupled with the growing distrust in information from these sources, further grows the problem of misinformation. While people remain skeptical about AI-written articles, it\u2019s crucial to consider whether mainstream journalism will eventually become dominated by AI-generated content. Although the issue with fake-news and hallucinations can skyrocket by this.<br/> Recently I found some interesting examples of websites trying to achieve transparency and factuality, some may even try to fight it via fact-checking their generated articles and prov",

I just started working with Claude, (and am <em>very</em> impressed so far with its ability to self-direct, push back, and hold coherence), and for the first time ever, asked what it would venture about, if it could (given how many times humans vent to AI, I\u2019m sure).
