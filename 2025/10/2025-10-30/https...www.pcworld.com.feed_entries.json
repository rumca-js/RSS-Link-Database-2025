If the FCC enacts these rule changes, broadcasters will no longer need to support the ATSC 1.0 standard that works with most TVs and tuners. Instead, they\u2019ll be able to scale back their ATSC 1.0 coverage and even switch over to the new standard entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broadcasters say they have no incentive to abandon ATSC 1.0 anytime soon, and that the rule changes would just give them more flexibility to support the new standard.
