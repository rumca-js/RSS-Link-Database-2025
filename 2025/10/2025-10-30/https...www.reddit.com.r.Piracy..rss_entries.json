Like I already mentioned a few days ago I am worried that at some point no new anime sites with big library\u2019s will come up after said anime sites or similar ones will get killed (the severs are killed) etc. also I know there is the index that exists but the index does not show exactly when or how old a site is etc. hence why I wanted to ask your guys what your opinion is on that matter.

( Sorry for the bad photo I was getting ready for my art club meeting I didn&#39;t have time to take a proper screenshot ) I downloaded this crack of cities skylines II on the official KaOs Krew site and then tried on 1337x.to after this issue. Both sources had the same problem : when I downloaded the files, I opened Install.exe and right after it : my antivirus blocked this file because it was infected by : &quot;FileRepMalware&quot;.</p> <p>I also know that I should have opened as an administrator this file. I just wanted to ask if this is even normal for KaOsKrew to have something like this inside their cracks and should I still install it ?

Played around for some time and suddenly I got a message from Windows 11 &quot;do you want to grant [that program] permission to use your location&quot;. Ofc I declined and was a bit worried at first why it asked that just after some time. Rechecked simplewall for the entries, but that looks fine.</p> <p>So the question that came to my mind: Apart from using a firewall like simplewall, are there any other precautions to keep certain software from phoning home? Is it possible that programs use microsoft system parts to somehow report possible piracy? I would never use the software for productive environments or share any native files with anyone (since I heard they might use internal IDs that might get flaged as pirated and tracked back to you).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",

If everybody pirates, there would be no interest from the corporation, or even small creators sometimes, to create content and there will therefore be nothing to pirate in the first place 2. If everybody pirate there will be people that try to get money out of this piracy, maybe by offering paid services for convinience (basically paid piracy streaming platforms) so this will essentially recreate the same system 3. If we try to achieve a semi-piracy (donationware model for example), this will lead to a big instability in the markets and will eventually either lead to number 1 or restrict content creation teams to lower the cost and make them more predictable (doesn&#39;t sound so bad actually)</p> <p>I would like to hear what you think about this !</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Conversation-1430\"> /u/Ok-Conversation-1430 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://w",
