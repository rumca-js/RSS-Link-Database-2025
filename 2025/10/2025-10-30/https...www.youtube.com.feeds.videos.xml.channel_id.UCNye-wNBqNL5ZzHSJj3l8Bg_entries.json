Initially branded a national security threat during Trump\u2019s first term, the app\u2019s Chinese owner, ByteDance, was later pressured by Washington to sell its US operations or face a ban.

Harsh US sanctions, reimposed by the first Trump administration, are making it difficult, if not impossible, for healthcare workers to access the drugs and equipment they need. Although designed to apply political pressure to the communist government, in reality, the sanctions hurt civilians the most. The infant mortality rate is rising, and life expectancy is falling.\n\nCREDITS: \n\nA film by Ed Augustin and Reed Lindsay with Belly of the Beast\nProducer : Daniel Montero\nDOP : Alfredo Lazcano Valera\nEditor : Ren\u00e9 Alejandro D\u00edaz Rodr\u00edguez\nFinishing Editor : Jameel Hodzic\nSound mixing : Linus Bergman\nColour grading : Kishore Kanchan\nGraphics : Merve Urkan - Abdulrahman Yousef Khaledi\nDigital Producer : Riham Mansour\nProducer : Amy Anderson\nProduction Executive : Ciara Richmond\nExecutive : Producer : Alexandra Pauliat\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bi",

Now, as climate change warms the Mediterranean, sea turtles - driven by rising sea temperatures - have begun arriving to lay their eggs on her city\u2019s shoreline. But the beaches they rely on are under threat. Mass tourism, unchecked development, and the recent floods are eroding these vital habitats.\n\nAt 27, Carla is an environmental lawyer and conservationist who works with her father to restore the beaches and protect turtle nests, knowing the species\u2019 survival depends on their efforts. After the catastrophic 2024 floods, Carla rallies her community to act fast to restore Valencia\u2019s coastline. With turtle nesting coinciding with peak tourism, Carla urgently needs volunteers to protect each nest - and time is running out.\n\nAfter the Floods is a documentary film by Adriana Cardoso and Rodrigo Hernandez.",

        "description": "Almost a year after the fall of the Assad regime, Syrians are facing another fight \u2013 for justice and accountability. \n\nIn this Start Here On-The-Road, Sandra Gathmann travels to Syria to find out how the country is confronting its past and how people are trying to rebuild their lives after years of war. \n\nUp to 300,000 people in Syria are missing and there are thought to be as many as 66 mass graves across the country. We meet Wafa Ali Mustafa, as she faces up to the reality that her father, who\u2019s been missing for twelve years, is most likely dead.\n \nWe go inside the newly-opened Syrian Identification Centre, where forensic scientists are carrying out painstaking work to identify bodies. And in an exclusive interview, we introduce one of Syria\u2019s \u201cshadow warriors\u201d \u2013 a lawyer who risked his life to help smuggle out 1.3 million documents, creating an archive of evidence that links war crimes to regime officials at the highest levels, right up to Bashar al-Assad himself. \n\nStart Here also",
