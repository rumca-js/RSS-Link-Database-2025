        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everybody. Just wanna ask how CodeRabbit is for open-source projects. I help maintain a Python library that gets steady PRs, and I\u2019m kinda getting tired of all the reviewing. It\u2019s just the sheer volume of trivial stuff I need to sift through. Most issues are small like missing docstrings, weird naming, config typos. But we still burn hours waiting for someone senior to review and merge.</p> <p>I\u2019ve looked at CodeRabbit as a possible solution because they say it\u2019s free for OSS repos, and it supposedly does PR summaries, runs linters, suggests fixes, and explains why something is flagged. Just wanna know if it\u2019ll live up to the expectations</p> <p>Anyone here use CodeRabbit for their open-source projects? Does it integrate smoothly with GitHub/GitLab?Hope you can help me out.
