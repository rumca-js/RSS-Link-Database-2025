        "description": "<p>Security and integrity of the Python packaging ecosystem is critical, and the smallest unit of a packaging ecosystem is a \"package\". Python packages use existing archive formats like ZIP and tar to distribute Python projects to their users. Archives seem simple on the surface, but many ZIP and tar features can be abused to confuse implementations into seeing different contents of the same archive.</p><p>These vulnerabilities affect the \"integrity of the ecosystem\" if tools can't agree what a package contents actually are. This can cause many downstream issues, such as vulnerability or malware scanners giving different results from the package when installed on disk.</p><p>The Python Software Foundation Security Developer-in-Residence, Seth Larson, <a href=\"https://alpha-omega.dev/blog/slippery-zips-and-sticky-tar-pits-security-and-archives-white-paper-by-seth-larson-python-software-foundation/\">published a new white paper</a> with <a href=\"https://alpha-omega.dev\">Alpha-Omega</a>&n",
