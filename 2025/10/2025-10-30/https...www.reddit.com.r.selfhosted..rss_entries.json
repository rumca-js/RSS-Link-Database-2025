I&#39;ve mainly just been hosting Jellyfin on my local network, but I want to host my own server for Counter Strike: Source, which I have recently become super addicted to. Obviously, I would need to forward one of my ports to open the server up to the public instead of just keeping it on my local network. However, I live in an apartment complex on what I have been told is fiber optic internet. The entire complex operates on one single network, and each resident has their own unique login. There are no routers in our units, but there is a panel in the ceiling of my bedroom closet, which I believe is where the signal comes from. Because of this, I have no way of getting into my wi-fi&#39;s administrator panel to start port forwarding.
