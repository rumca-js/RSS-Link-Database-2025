I have this one boy with ADHD who struggles with spelling mistakes and finding worda to express himself. That&#39;s why I recommended him to start reading but he&#39;s just not into it, he finds it boring and non-atractive. I&#39;ve suggested him to start reading a book together and talk about It in our classes to make it more... Didactic or tempting I Guess. He&#39;s into series like The last of us or breaking bad, plays video games such us fortnite or gta and has a lot of cuestions regarding to spaces, zombies, aliens... Sci-fic books, maybe?

I absolutely loved the love triangle, the pacing, and of corse Rhysand.</p> <p>Spoiler alert </p> <p>What I really liked about him is that he wasn\u2019t just a \u201cshadow daddy\u201d with anger issues. Rhysand actually gave Feyre freedom, trained her, and supported her instead of trying to protect or control her. That dynamic completely hooked me, and now I\u2019m chasing that same feeling.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to a book fair soon, so I want to stock up on some new series. Here\u2019s what\u2019s on my radar so far:</p> <p>Fourth Wing \u2013 I\u2019m probably going to buy all three books because I\u2019ve heard good things. Throne of Glass \u2013 I\u2019m a little scared I\u2019ll miss the romance since I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s slower on that front. Quicksilver \u2013 Not sure I\u2019m into the vampire/werewolf vibe, so I\u2019m hesitant.

K was reading before too but I got my city library membership in Feb. I read quite some books till Oct 2024 and after that IDK why but my habit derailed and basically the person who usually took a month to complete a big 400 page around or more book started taking 2 to 3 months. After that I just read two books and then stopped reading. I&#39;m a student so academic pressure is also there and well let&#39;s just say like everyone I&#39;m also stuck with my phone. Before I used to replace sometime of it by books but now everything I do is on phone. My habit is basically dead at this point but my city library membership is still there and it&#39;s pretty big.
