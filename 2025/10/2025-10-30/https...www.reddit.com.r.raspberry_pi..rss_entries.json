I&#39;ve never used a pi before, so apologies if I ask anything dumb.</p> <p>I want to use one of waveshare&#39;s 64x64 LED displays to readout the signals from the detectors, and I was looking at using a MCP3008 ADC to convert the analogue signals from the detectors into a digital signal for the pi (speaking of which, I&#39;ve got a 2gb raspberry pi 4B). I&#39;m also planning on using the ADC to measure some potentiometers to use as dials for controls (for threshold energy, for example).</p> <p>The issue I have is that both the display and the ADC feed off the same pins on the GPIO, and they specifically overlap on pins 19,21,22 and 23. Can these pins be easily subsituted, as I don&#39;t imagine they can be shared between the devices? From looking at the raspberry",
