I&#39;m running a degoogled AOSP rom with only FOSS software and everything else sandboxed. My last hurdle is replacing Gmaps. I&#39;ve looked at OSMand, Organic Maps and CoMaps, but none of them have the real time traffic reporting that Gmaps has. Are there any FOSS mapping platforms (Preferably built on OSM data) that have this feature?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ScrumptiousRump\"> /u/ScrumptiousRump </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1ojow10/gmaps_alternative_with_realtime_traffic_data/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1ojow10/gmaps_alternative_with_realtime_traffic_data/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It&#39;s been a long time since I un-Googled myself, although I still need to delete the Google account but it would be a matter of time. I no longer use Gmail at all and now I use Tuta, Proton Mail among others and I would like to know how to link my Tuta and Proton account to the email clients so I don&#39;t have to have so many email apps installed, there is the browser but I want to use an email client to see how it goes, I want to use Thunderbird but it is very difficult to link them there. It asks for a bunch of settings that I don&#39;t know what they are, I tried to leave it as it was and just put in the alias and password but it didn&#39;t help. Does anyone know how to do it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Supermagicstar\"> /u/Supermagicstar </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1ojleet/how_do_i_link_my_tuta_and_proton_mail_account_to/\">[link]</a></sp",
