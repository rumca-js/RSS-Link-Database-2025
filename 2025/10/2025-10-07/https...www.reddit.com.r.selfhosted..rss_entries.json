I&#39;d appreciate some advice on what an ideal set-up would look for what I want.</p> <p>What I want is: *Hosting a Plex server *Hosting a nextcloud instance *Hosting other various tools? (Discord bots, audiobook servers, etc)</p> <p>What would be an added bonus: *NAS backup and storage capabilities</p> <p>What I have is: *My old gaming PC</p> <p>My initial idea was a setting up Truenas Scale on my old PC, installing nextcloud, Plex, etc via the app store that it seems it has. But other places seem to say maybe this isn&#39;t the best idea?

The goal of PHPSSG is minimalism and simplicity, keeping everything in plain PHP without framework dependencies that aim to abstract the language.</p> <p>Why another static site generator? Most existing ones are in Go, Ruby, or Node. PHPSSG is for developers who want to use PHP and composer, without being locked out of packages due to version conflicts (PHPSSG only depends on php-di). It runs in any PHP environment, including shared hosting.</p> <p>The project is not yet at 1.0, but I am finalizing the API, documentation, and starter templates. Feedback before the stable release would be very useful and I would very much appreciate everyone&#39;s thoughts.</p> <p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/taujor/php-static-site-generator\">https://github.com/taujor/php-static-site-generator</a></p> </div><!--",

With downloading content becoming more and more difficult over the years, I slowly without realizing started paying for streaming services and now would like to peel that back and go back to aquiring things on my own. I have that part sorted out. What I was hoping to recommendations for is the NAS part. Synology is nice, but it&#39;s overkill for what I need. I&#39;ll never use DNS, DHCP, mail server, and all the other bloatware that comes with it. I just need something for some simple network file sharing, the ability to use iSCSI perferred. Plus, cost is a factor. I can&#39;t really justify the cost of a Synology at this point. So I&#39;m looking for some rec&#39;s. I&#39;m tech/computer savvy - been working in IT for over 20 years. So I thought I would pose the question to this community to sort of jump start the research phase for my new little project. Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC",

AppSheet looks great, but for now, I don\u2019t need too many features \u2014 I just want to keep things organized.<br/> Ideally, I\u2019d like something I can manage locally and upload as an APK or program.
