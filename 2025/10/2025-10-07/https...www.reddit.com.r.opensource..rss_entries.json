Meeting notetakers like Otter, Fireflies, and Recall send your company&#39;s conversations to their cloud. No self\u2011host option. No data sovereignty. An API\u2011first, open\u2011source, microservice\u2011based, scalable stack is the natural response here. Notetakers are shiny UI products\u2014not what tech teams need. What&#39;s needed is a simple API, not another interface.</p> <p>What I built: An open\u2011source meeting transcription stack (Apache\u20112.0) that you can fully self\u2011host. Send a bot to Microsoft Teams or Google Meet, stream transcripts in real time, and keep everything on your infrastructure. It&#39;s a data access layer you can feed into AI\u2014without third\u2011party servers touching your meetings.</p> <p><strong>The journey so far:</strong></p> <p>I shipped v0.1 back in April 2025\u2014Google Meet only, and within days the #1 request was Microsoft Teams sup",

On the other hand, this is essentially a HTTP server, which can be deployed anywhere. When I&#39;m in high school we can use chrome book, but only chrome is allowed to use and with a strict blocking.
