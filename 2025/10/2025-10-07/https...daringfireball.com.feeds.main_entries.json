        "description": "<p>Ryan Christoffel, 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Alarms and timers are now harder to dismiss thanks to a <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/06/ios-26-1-beta-2-makes-alarms-harder-to-accidentally-dismiss/\">new\n\u2018Slide to stop\u2019 gesture</a>. Both alarms and timers were\nupdated in iOS 26 to utilize a new design with much larger\non-screen buttons than before. Now in iOS 26.1 beta 2, Apple has\nreplaced the \u2018Stop\u2019 button with a new sliding gesture that\nrequires a little more intentionality. This should make accidental\nalarm dismissals more rare.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That\u2019s one of several changes that caught my eye. Seems like a great idea. Another notable change: <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/10/ipados-26-1-beta-brings-back-slide-over-adds-microphone-adjustments/\">Slide Over returns to iPadOS</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/06/ios-26-1-beta-2-features/\">Juli Clover\u2019s rundown of changes in iOS 26.1 beta 2 for MacRumors</a>.</",
