We were literally less than a two minute walk from it, so I told her let&#39;s just go and get it. However she was really insistent that we dont and that we can get it later cause she made dinner and doesn&#39;t want the food to get cold or something. So after dinner I tell her I can go grab her phone for her, but she insited that she goes and that I dont go with her. Then her husband B steps in and is like oh let me go with her since it&#39;s dark and whatnot. She ends up just giving my keys to him and he goes. At the time I was really tired because I had an exhausting day so I didnt fully realize. </p> <p>Now here is where my suspicions started; it should have taken only like 2 minutes to the car and another two to get back,",
