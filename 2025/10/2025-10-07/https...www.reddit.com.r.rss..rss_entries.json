It\u2019s a minimalist RSS reader that emails your feeds instead of making you open another app or site. </p> <p>I&#39;m big on privacy, so no analytics, trackers, advertising, or algorithms. </p> <p>You can even follow subreddits, just paste in any subreddit URL and pick your filter (hot, new, top, etc.).</p> <p>It&#39;s very much in beta, but fully functional. If you want email, only $1/mo to cover email service costs. If you want to test it out, DM me and I&#39;ll send you a code for free access.</p> <p>Check it out and let me know what you think: <a href=\"https://feedzombie.com\">https://feedzombie.com</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/fumanchudrew\"> /u/fumanchudrew </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
