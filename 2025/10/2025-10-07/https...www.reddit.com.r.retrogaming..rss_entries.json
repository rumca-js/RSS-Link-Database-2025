It belonged to a friend of mine, which is why I don&#39;t remember the name. I played it on a Gameboy Advance between 2002 and 2006. It&#39;s a Looney Tunes fighting game, more like a beat &#39;em up, not 1v1, lots of enemies, and side-scrolling. At least, Looney Tunes characters were playable. I especially remember Lola Bunny, who was an &quot;ally&quot; character that you could call to shoot a tennis ball at enemies. I remember another character can throw an anvil at enemies. You faced increasingly stronger and more numerous characters. And there was a color swap when they were stronger.</p> <p>I searched with chatgpt and Grok, but I couldn&#39;t find it. It&#39;s not Operation Carrots, Acme Antics, or Back in Action. That&#39;s all from memory; there may be some mistakes. You can ask me questions, maybe it will bring back memories</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",
