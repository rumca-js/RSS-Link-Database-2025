Every time the platform updates its API, you&#39;re debugging.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been experimenting with a dedicated service, <a href=\"http://Streamrecorder.io\">Streamrecorder.io</a>, to handle the automated, continuous archiving, and it\u2019s been incredibly stable.</p> <p>I&#39;m keeping <code>yt-dlp</code> for one-off downloads and manual captures, but for guaranteed, long-term archival of high-traffic platforms like Twitch and Kick, a cloud service just eliminates the maintenance headache.</p> <p>Has anyone else here moved away from manual scripts for scheduled archival?

(name-of-track-2) </code></pre> <p>And so on and so forth.</p> <p>I use Open Video Downloader, and I have NO idea if for some reason it has different formatting than ytdlp (which would make no sense) but for the life of me, I can&#39;t get either playlist_index or playlist_autonumber to work as intended. I either end up having each track be (01.), the tracks starting from (00.) instead of (01.), or for ALL of the numbers to completely disappear.</p> <p>Any help to figure out how to get this to work properly would be greatly appreciated.
