In 2023 I switched to AI and instead of training models for the usual tasks, I decided to test what happens if you give an LLM full control over the story?</p> <p>My experiment looked like this: AI creates a scene, characters, and dialogue. The player makes a choice and the story branches. No scripted events, every action leads in a new direction. At first it looked like chaos, but over time out of this chaos a visual novel engine started to take shape.</p> <p>That\u2019s how Dream Novel appeared (a project that is still at an early stage, but already works). It showed me that AI can be not just a tool for assistance, but a co-creator that writes the game together with the player in real time.</p> <p>And now I want to ask the community: do you believe that AI can really become the director of a game or will it always remain just a tool in the hands of hum",

I mean, look at how children become intelligent. We don&#39;t pump them with petabytes of data. And look at PhD students for instance. At the start of a PhD, most students know very little about the topic. At the end of it, they come out as not only experts in the topic, but widened the horizon by adding something new to that topic. All the while reading not more than 1 or 2 books and a handful of research papers. It appears the AI researchers are missing a key link between neural network and human intelligence which, I strongly believe, will be very difficult to crack within our lifetimes.
