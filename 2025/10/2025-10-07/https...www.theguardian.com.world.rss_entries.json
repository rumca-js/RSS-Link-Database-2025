In 2014, a backbench Labour MP named Shabana Mahmood lay on the floor of her local Sainsbury\u2019s in protest against the sale of products made in illegal Israeli settlements. A week later, she spoke to crowds at a Free Palestine protest in Hyde Park, of the \u201ccompassion and humanity expressed for the people of Gaza \u2026 from every race and every religion.\u201d</p><p>Compare and contrast with the 2025 Shabana Mahmood, now home secretary, whose new policies could see people arrested for the very same actions. She has just announced a fresh tranche of anti-protest policies that would allow police to re-route, and potentially shut down protests which repeatedly take place in the same area because of their cumulative impact.</p><p><em><strong>UK news</strong></em> | Neighbours of the Manchester synagogue ",
