I get around this by using Piper and an extra keyboard to map 7 to one of my mouse buttons so I can still use ampersand and any game controls that require pressing 7. However it seems that every time I turn on my computer, Piper changes the macros to also be pressing the left control and left alt buttons. It&#39;s more just a PITA for now as I&#39;m planning to get a new keyboard soon anyways. Has anybody else experienced this? I tried searching but couldn&#39;t find anything. I&#39;m on bazzite if it matters by the way.</p> <p>Edit: I thought it would work that way, but apparently it doesn&#39;t. I tried remapping it and nothing happens when pressing the buttons and nothing happens if I try mapping any of the other number keys as a macro. Why can&#39;t keypresses be mapped individually? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hoveringkiller\"> ",

I&#39;m studying how non-native speakers develop English fluency through gaming at University of Barcelona. A few months ago I posted here recruiting non-native English speakers and got a great response, thank you!</p> <p>Now I need native English speakers as a baseline. What does native speaker fluency look like when talking about games? This baseline lets me identify which fluency patterns in non-native speaker data develop through gaming exposure versus general proficiency.</p> <p>I think this may especially interest the community because the entire research stack is completely free and open-source software. No proprietary AI services, no data sent to third parties. </p> <p>If you&#39;re an 18+ native English speaker who plays or has played any video game, I have a 5-minute study with audio recordings that needs your participation.</p> <p>What&#39;s involved: - 5 short monologue speaking tasks - Chat",

Me and another friend both run Arch based OS&#39;s (I use vanilla Arch and she uses Garuda linux) and all of a sudden after a recent system update neither of us can open any worlds in modded minecraft. After attempting to open the world it hard crashes our PC and freezes completely after saying &quot;Reading world data&quot; for a few seconds. Interestingly enough when testing various things I noticed that this does not happen on Vanilla minecraft ONLY on modded even when using the same launcher. Please let me know what I could do to better look into this or if someone had this same problem and found a solution. </p> <p>My PC specs incase its relevant are:<br/> AMD Ryzen 7 5800x<br/> AMD Radeon 9070 xt 16gb<br/> 32gb Ram</p> <p>Thanks in advanced for the help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",
