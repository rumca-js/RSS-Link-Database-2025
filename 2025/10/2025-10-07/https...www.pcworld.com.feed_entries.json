Case in point: the massive 34-inch LG UltraGear OLED curved monitor, now a whopping 51% off. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F15CGTGW/\">You can snag it for $691.42</a>, down from its usual $1,400 price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While $691 might seem quite a bit of money, it\u2019s actually a rare find because this monitor is rarely below $800. The LG UltraGear 34GX90SA features a gorgeous 3440\u00d71440 resolution, an ultra-smooth 240Hz refresh rate, and a super-fast 1ms response time. This all means it\u2019s a fantastic choice for gamers, video and photo editing, streaming content, and just everyday activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its 800R curvature is a bit more pronounced than most monitors in this category, but it will definitely deliver an immersi",
