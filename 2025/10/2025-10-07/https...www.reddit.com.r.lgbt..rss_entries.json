My brother, 16M, is also LGBTQ and is dating a Genderfluid person. He felt like naturally the first person to come out to. He immediately supported, but he made fun of me a little for stealing my other brothers middle name on accident. He said he&#39;d get me a binder soon since my chest dysphoria is pretty bad. TW: transphobia for the next paragraph.</p> <p>So my dad is very openly transphobic, he has talked a LOT about how much he hates the community. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever tell him. I tried telling my mom, and she just immediately shot me down and said I had to be diagnosed to be trans. But, my brother supports and I&#39;m so glad i don&#39;t have to hide from at least someone in my family now!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gaaaayymotherfucker\"> /u/gaaaayymotherfucker ",
