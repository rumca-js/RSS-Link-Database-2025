        "description": "Scientists have discovered that bacteria living inside tumors can produce a molecule that fights cancer and enhances chemotherapy. The molecule, called 2-methylisocitrate (2-MiCit), was found to make colorectal cancer cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy by damaging their DNA and disrupting their metabolism. Experiments using worms, flies, and human cancer cells confirmed its potent anti-cancer effects.",

Using Bell\u2019s test across 73 qubits, they proved the presence of genuine quantum correlations that can\u2019t be explained classically. Their results show quantum computers are not just bigger, but more authentically quantum. This opens the door to more secure communication and stronger quantum algorithms.",

Researchers studying two major heatwaves in the Gulf of Alaska found that plankton shifts caused carbon to build up near the surface instead of sinking. This disrupted the ocean\u2019s ability to store carbon for millennia and intensified climate feedbacks. The study highlights the urgent need for continuous, collaborative ocean observation.",
