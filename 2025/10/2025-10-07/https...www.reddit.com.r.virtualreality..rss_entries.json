I want to upgrade, I don&#39;t care that much about pancake lenses as I&#39;m used to the quests 2 lenses. I just want full face tracking, I&#39;m not sure which one to go for and It&#39;s so confusing on which ones good or not. Looking at every YouTube video of reviews gives me mixed results. </p> <p>I plan on doing VR Content so I want something accurate and has not a lot of issues with tracking. I&#39;m nervous to try a Quest Pro since I dance a lot and sweat/moisture in the headset can destroy it. Along with the strap design being not that good, and since I go upside down a lot for fun on my bed, I don&#39;t want it falling off. My quest 2 has no issues staying on my head, so I want something that wouldn&#39;t be hard to stay on during dances. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mephy_Undead\"> /u/Mephy_Undead </a> <br/> <span><",
