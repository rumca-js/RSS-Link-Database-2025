People join pretty often, but NO ONE uses the forums!! I get that there is other things people might be more interested in like worlds revival, re-aol, or file hosting, but its sooooo annoying cause I&#39;m essentially the only person (besides mods) who contribute to the forums of this super cool site. it was also made by its ex owner wirla burla which is cool cause they (used for lack of knowledge on their pronouns) seem to be very active in some niche community&#39;s. anyway, if this seems cool pleeaaassseee join and use the forums</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Disastrous-Shine-725\"> /u/Disastrous-Shine-725 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oldinternet/comments/1o0h3sr/could_i_get_a_few_p",
