I just switched to using Linux Mint in light of the impending dropping of security updates to Windows 10. However, when I switched over I noticed that all of the colors on my screen are washed out. I think this is because the MSI True Color program is no longer working, and that was making my screen viewable. Now its hard to look at it for any length of time. Does anyone have a similar program they could recommend so I can actually use my computer without my eyes hurting?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/The_MadMage_Halaster\"> /u/The_MadMage_Halaster </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1o0ul4r/just_switch_to_linux_mint_now_my_colors_are/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1o0ul4r/just_switch_to_linux_mint_now_my_colors_are/\">[comments]</a></span>",
