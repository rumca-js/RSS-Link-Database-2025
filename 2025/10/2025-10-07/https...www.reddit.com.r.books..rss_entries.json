On one hand, there\u2019s evidence that people are reading less, attention spans are getting shorter, and functional illiteracy especially among younger people, is on the rise. On the other hand, there are more books being published than ever, new authors emerging constantly, and bookstores appear to be thriving.

The serial killer presented in the book is &quot;tradicional&quot;, not much different from what you typically see in books, series, and films of this genre. For me, personally, the most interesting character is the forensic pathologist. From the very first description, he was intriguing and a little bit enigmatic, and I think he could have been the serial killer; honestly, the book would have been very good if it had been him. The discovery of the killer&#39;s identity is also done without much creativity... While the police discover the serial killer&#39;s name at the police department, Erika makes the same discovery simultaneously.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Writers often focus on visuals, but some of the most powerful moments come from senses we cannot see.</p> <p>I remember reading Perfume: The Story of a Murderer by Patrick S\u00fcskind. The way S\u00fcskind described scents was so vivid that I could almost smell them. The description of the tannery where Grenouille worked, the stink of animal hides, blood, and sweat mixed together, was so intense that I could almost smell it. It made me feel both disgusted and amazed at how powerful the writing was.</p> <p>Another example is in Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, when the Hogwarts feast is described with roast chicken, sausages, treacle tart, and pumpkin juice. Reading it as a kid made me crave food I had never even tasted before, and that feeling stayed with me.</p> <p>And in The Road by Cormac McCarthy, the silence of the empty, burned out world was described as barren and dead to the point that it made me hear nothingness. It was chilling, like silence",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Mine is Eruption, by &quot;Michael Crichton&quot; and James Patterson. I knew going into it that it wasn&#39;t going to be a masterpiece, but at worst I expected a quick and exciting airport book. Quick it was. But my word, what an atrocious book. Poorly written characters, a cookie cutter plot, glaring plot holes, and just a waste of time. And that ending .... My God. After a day or so,I chalked up the decision for the ending to Patterson not being aware of Crichton&#39;s opinions on global warming, and his position that nature couldn&#39;t be helped out. But Patterson didn&#39;t get it, so it all just fell apart.</p> <p>Just God awful. </p> <p>Palate cleanser, Between Two Fires.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kerberos824\"> /u/kerberos824 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1o0163z/most_disappointing_title_of_the_year_so_far/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"",
