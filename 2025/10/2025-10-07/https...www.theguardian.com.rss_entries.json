I\u2019d dropped out of my university literature course \u2013 with the arrogance of youth, I thought I could read books anywhere. After a chance meeting in a Putney pub, I got a job as assistant cook in the <a href=\"https://www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk/\">Bird Observatory in Fair Isle</a>. At that point, I didn\u2019t even know where Fair Isle was. I came from Devon and hadn\u2019t made it farther north than Durham. Scotland was unknown territory.</p><p>Of course, Fair Isle is part of the Shetland group and lies halfway between Shetland mainland and Orkney. That summer, I fell in love with the Northern Isles, with the romance of the isolation, the bleak beauty and the stories. Over the summer, I worked in the observatory with Alison, an Orcadian lass, who was there for her college holidays. \u201cW",

Inadequate staff training coupled with jammed fire doors aiding the spread of the fire and the subsequent release of deadly hydrogen cyanide gas from burning laminates resulted in the deaths of 159&nbsp;people. The disaster was initially blamed on one of the passengers \u2013 a&nbsp;lorry driver and convicted arsonist. The fact that this suspect was also one of the fire\u2019s casualties and thus unable to refute the charges against him was almost certainly part of the reason why the truth about the tragedy took so long to come to light. In 2020, a six-hour documentary revealed that the fire had most likely been started deliberately as part of an insurance fraud.</p><p>In the first volu",

The subject is none other than his cousin Rodrigue, who is consumed with a weighty secret: both he and his wife Reine are living with Aids. Within their deeply religious community, the condition is sorely misunderstood; in his fervid sermons, the local pastor associates Aids and HIV with witchcraft, curses, and even God\u2019s punishment. Such superstitious and moralistic sentiments take deep root in the minds of the believers, worsening the social stigma surrounding an ongoing health crisis.</p><p>Unable to speak their truth, Rodrigue and Reine are torn between their private troubles and public personas.

It led to a war of revenge that has now lasted for close to two years, killing more than 65,000 Palestinians and causing the widespread devastation of Gaza, including destroying 92% of its residential buildings.
