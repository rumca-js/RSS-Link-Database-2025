All I remember is that it was too complicated for my little kid brain to wrap my head around the mechanics, there was a scary looking green creature (frog?) on the front of the rectangular box, it had a map-style board that I believe was stylized as a forest?, and some of the components included round wooden tokens and (maybe) orange Monopoly Chance Looking cards \ud83e\udd14 I&#39;m pretty sure its name was a made up word that had no meaning outside of the game - that or it was a word far removed from my little kid vocabulary \ud83d\ude02 All google searches have come up with Frogger and other frog-themed games that are NOT the game I&#39;m looking for at all. I have been trying to figure out what the game was for ages with no luck!</p> <p>Second game is not a board game, so feel free to ignore. It was a flash game I think. Disney Villian themed from the early 2000s. I know it involved the poison apple from Snow White,",

I was thinking trailer park tragedy which i have already but I think my hubby wants Pimp n homicide. Anyone willing to trade?</p> <p>I want to keep it fun and relaxed while making it memorable. Any thoughts?? Tips or guidance on throwing a smooth and easy to follow party would be much appreciated! Ooh and is it possible for me to play? Even though I have to print everything out??</p> <p>Thank you :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Last_Student8784\"> /u/Last_Student8784 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1o00rvu/murder_mystery/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bo",
