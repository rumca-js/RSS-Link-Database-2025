They have not done UI upgrades like proper chat history page like Claude and Grok have, they lock users out with safety features and keep old models reluctantly, zero quality of life changes. They add apps and payment features and think of ways to milk people who use the website instead of the API, with future advertisements. Every new feature they add takes you off the ChatGPT website like Sora, codex, agents workflow.</p> <p>They forget their roots and what made them special in the first place, when a company starts doing that, it usually doesn&#39;t last long.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Adiyogi1\"> /u/Adiyogi1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1o00t9r/i_think_openai_are_trying_to_move_people_away/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a",
