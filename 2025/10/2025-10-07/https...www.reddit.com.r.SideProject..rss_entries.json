I wanted to make a space where you could stumble upon interesting facts, but instead of just reading plain text, each fact would feel like a mini visual story. That experiment eventually turned into <a href=\"https://facturious.com/\">Facturious</a> \u2014 a simple web app that serves up random facts with dynamically matched background images.</p> <p>The concept is straightforward: every time you ask for a new fact, the app pulls from a curated database, extracts a couple of keywords from the text, and uses them to fetch a high-quality, relevant image from Unsplash. The result is a full-screen fact with a visual backdrop that ties to the content \u2014 almost like a mini National Geographic spread. You can scroll back through your visual history, share individual facts, and keep discovering as long as you like. Everything loads almost instantl",
