Not too long ago I tried my hand at this by torrenting Bladerunner off of Archive.org but first of all there were multiple options for the original Bladerunner alone and couldn&#39;t figure out which was what was relevant to my search, then torrenting was confusing as it seemed to linger on the seeding process, like it was buffering, and finally the contents from the torrent left me confused as there were several files, none of which appeared to be the movie itself. I&#39;ve also tried just downloading off of sites like Steamrip but every time I try it slows to a crawl and never seems to finish downloading, and every time it says the connection is interrupted it just starts the download all over again. Are there better places to pirate content? What is the best ",

There&#39;s a few small games that he&#39;d like to pirate but he doesn&#39;t want to go through the hassle of picking and subscribing to a trusted VPN, and setting it all up.</p> <p>My theory is, if the games are small enough to fit in my google drive, and since that&#39;s no longer a torrent, not a p2p download, is it safe to just send him the games via my google drive, or is it still tracked and still too risky?</p> <p>As far as I know, DDL&#39;s do not require VPN&#39;s since they&#39;re not tracked, and it&#39;s the p2p download you gotta watch out for.

I am not sure entirely where to look for this information but for someone who has pirated in the past with the basic precautions but maybe not enough and now wants to move to being better about their security, is there anything I should check on my computer itself?

Basically ive been planning to torrent a ton of art courses but my current pc has no space and im also a bit paranoid to torrent them on it because i want to get them thru a telegram group and its not as reliable as fmhy. I was thinking about getting a super cheap laptop and stacking it with art courses/patreon things/etc (i want to download as many as possible since theres not any specific thing im looking for) but even the cheap laptops are a bit too expensive for me lol. i was thinking of getting a cheap tablet and doing this on there but i&#39;m not certain it&#39;d be a viable device for this kind of thing. I&#39;ve never downloaded these kind of torrents before so i&#39;m not sure if they only come in video form or there&#39;s more applications to it. I&#39;d really appreciate some insight and advice, thank you! Btw i&#39;m looking for advanced tutorials",
