        "description": "With Ghost of Yotei being well-received among critics and audiences alike, we thought about what the future could hold for Sucker Punch's amazing action-adventure franchise. There are several great points in Japanese history that could serve as the playground for the next Ghost, each bringing its own narrative threads and the potential for a drastically different gameplay loop this time around.\n\nCould the next Ghost be an Ainu warrior, looking to preserve his or her way of life and opposing Japanese colonization. Could they be a cog in the war machine of the Imperial Army or the Shogunate during the Boshin War? Could they be a pirate, resisting oppressive trade policies in the Wokou era? The possibilities are endless, as is the potential for the next title in the Ghost franchise to be the ultimate take on the character.",

        "description": "Battlefield 6 arrives this week for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, and we've already gone over everything it improves on from Battlefield 2042. But how does it compare to the last numbered title, Battlefield 5? \n\nThe latter launched in 2018 but garnered controversy for several reasons (the premature abandoning of post-launch support also didn't help). Still, it's interesting to look back and see just how much has carried over and improved.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the 15 biggest differences between Battlefield 5 and Battlefield 6.",
