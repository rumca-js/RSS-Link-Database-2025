So, I built <strong>QuickStart</strong>, a CLI tool which allows you to import service configs into a central registry once, then start them from anywhere or export them to a compose file in your workspace with simple commands. Some of the features are: - Import/export services between your registry and workspace easily - Start services without maintaining compose files in every project - Save complete stacks as profiles for full dev environments - Actually has decent UX suggests fixes for typos, helpful error hints.

Once in a while, like maybe 15% of the time, it successfully starts and is available on port 8080.</p> <p>While troubleshooting, I have noticed that if I stop the Dozzle container and then manually start it with <code>sudo docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e DOCKER_HOST=tcp://socket-p",
