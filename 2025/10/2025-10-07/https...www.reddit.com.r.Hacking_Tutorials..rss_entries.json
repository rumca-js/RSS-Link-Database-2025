According to what they told me in a tarot reading, I was hacked on July 31st, or that person shared my number with someone else and they hacked me. Later, I consulted experts on the subject, and they told me that just by sharing a Telegram link, I can&#39;t be hacked. I also add that I didn&#39;t click on any links, I didn&#39;t give passwords or QR codes to anyone, either in person, by email, or through links requesting them. I don&#39;t see any strange logins in my WhatsApp, Telegram, or Google account. My phone is a prepaid one; I don&#39;t know if that increases or reduces the risks of SIM-swap. However, in the tarot reading, they told me that the third person to whom the link was shared was a female hacker, and she gave her all my info, especially my WhatsApp info. I&#39;d like someone to tell me if a hack of my cell phone, especially WhatsApp, was possible in a tangible way.</p> ",
