While historical fiction is more what i&#39;m after i don&#39;t mind some fantasy books in there either - I would just prefer if it&#39;s more low key if at all possible, some modern non fiction written as more of a narrative is okay too!

As an adult, I&#39;m a big fan of ASOIAF and Joe Abercrombie&#39;s First Law and Shattered Sea series (though not Age of Madness because that just hit too close to home). I also love the Warhammer universe a lot. As for non-fantasy, I like the Expanse by James S. A Corey, and The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory, for example</p> <p>I enjoy prose that is evocative, but not too flowery or purple, or even worse, redundant. The opposite of something like Wheel of Time, where I felt like the words were overstaying their welcome. My favourite is when the prose says things without saying them (either by structure or subtext), books that have respect for the reader&#39;s intelligence. I like characters that are flawed and believable, unlike something like LOTR. I want characters who I dont fully understand, who are a bit arbitrary or self-sabotaging, but are still clever",

It doesn&#39;t need to be nihilistic or anything, but just having darker themes and darker events and perhaps endings that aren&#39;t all that pleasant, although good endings are welcome, too. </p> <p>I&#39;ve tried Pilgrim, by Mitchell Luthi, and I *hated* it. Felt like it didn&#39;t go anywhere, the characters had no depth, and I felt as though I didn&#39;t understand what was happening. Plus, it was a little too grounded in reality, if that makes sense.

I don\u2019t mean just one defining event (like their parents dying), but rather that they change gradually through the experiences they go through.</p> <p>An example that comes to mind which evokes this feeling is The Walking Dead. In terms of books, the Red Rising saga also gave me that sense \u2014 where sometimes the characters do morally questionable things or even outright atrocities, but you still understand the reasons behind their actions. Obviously, another example could be Game of Thrones.</p> <p>I\u2019d prefer fantasy, but honestly, if the characters have that kind of evolution, the genre doesn\u2019t matter as much.

It\u2019s not that it was bad, I just think that my brain is so fried from doomscrolling that reading feels like a chore. Also, the formatting kind of confused me regarding the dialogue.
