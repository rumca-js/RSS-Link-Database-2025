They then proceeded to try changing passwords to random sites as well as post crypto scams over my social media. Recently they also made an Amazon transaction which I have now frozen my card over.</p> <p>Does anyone have any ideas where they might&#39;ve got in so I can try patch it? </p> <p>I have already changed passwords and logged out of all devices for my things.
