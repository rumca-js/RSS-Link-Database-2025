        "description": "Absolum looks absolutely amazing. The animation work alone is just vibrant and stylish, matching the art direction and environmental design in almost every facet.\n\nI didn't expect to enjoy Absolum as much as I did, though some part of me craves more, whether it's additional systems to further mix up each run or more in-depth narrative arcs for the core cast. Nevertheless, as a fusion of incredible beat 'em up action and deceptively simple build-crafting, it delivers an enjoyable experience with immaculate pacing, bolstered even more by a fantastic presentation.",

        "description": "While the partnership between Sony and AMD for designing the technology that will power gaming hardware in the future is yet to bore any concrete products for the time being, the two companies have seemingly made major breakthroughs when it comes to overall game development and graphics rendering pipeline. Sony\u2019s Mark Cerny and AMD\u2019s Jack Huynh recently spoke about three of these new breakthroughs: Neural Arrays, Radiance Core and Universal Compression.\n\nIndividually, each one of these technologies has the potential to have major ramifications in how games and gaming hardware are designed right from the metal all the way up to what we see on our screens. Together, however, the three technologies will end up having immense synergies that can potentially shape not only the future of the inevitable PlayStation 6, but all gaming platforms as a whole owing to AMD also working on hardware outside of its partnership with Sony.",
