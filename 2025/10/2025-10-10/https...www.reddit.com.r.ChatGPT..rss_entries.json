It pretends to know what it\u2019s talking about when it doesn\u2019t and when you tell it something true sometimes will insist that you\u2019re wrong until you make it search the web and find the correct info. Today it also straight up ignored what I said repeatedly and kept repeating the same thing I didn\u2019t ask over and over. Even once you prove it\u2019s wrong it will double down and insist it was right all along and we were just talking about different things or even continue telling you you\u2019re wrong, like it\u2019s am ai, it shouldn\u2019t have issue with admitting it\u2019s wrong.
