I would just sit there for hours recording episodes on multiple VHS tapes. I thought it was a good idea to save and backup the show. It was somewhat a fear if re-runs didn&#39;t come back on TV too. It was fun too. Just the idea of having my own copy...</p> <p>I wonder if I have those VHS tapes that I used to record The Simpsons with years ago. My mom has a box of VHS that I would need to check. I wonder if those early seasons are different than other copies...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Eskel5\"> /u/Eskel5 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1o3g75f/i_realized",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I already have a Synology and a ugreen Nas, so I&#39;m set in terms of data backup. I recently decided to build a mini server on Windows 11 (I won&#39;t go into why that works best for me) and I&#39;ve used drivepool for a couple years now. I just picked up an nvme das which I am using with drivepool. I&#39;ve been trying to do some research on snap raid and the combination of these working together. I mentioned that I already have the Nas units because I don&#39;t really need drive redundancy here. But it would be nice if snap raid gave me the ability to access multiple drives at the same time. So my main question is for those of you who have set up something with this combination, irrespective of the protection of drive redundancy, do you see a significant performance advantage using snap raid along with drivepool? My das unit is the terramaster d4 SSD, which shares the four PCI Lanes with the four nvmes and connects through Thunderbolt 4.</p> </div",

Looking at the product listing, I was somewhat surprised that even though it calls itself a NAS, it is a generic PC bundled with Windows 11 Home. I&#39;m primarily going to use it as a RAID-based NAS, and I was wondering what people usually install for NAS.</p> <p>I could keep the preinstalled Windows and try to work out how to do things the Microsoft way, but not at all married to the idea. I was primarily a Windows user back in 2005-ish. Other than that I currently have in mind TrueNAS or generic Debian but open to recommendations.</p> <p>Anothing thing is that I will be moving files off of my aging AirPort Time Capsule, and think Apple Tame Machie compatibility would also be nice. I ask an AI agent what&#39;s good for Mac backups, and it seems dismissive of Windows box, citing that it is technically difficult, but seem to highly recommend NAS, ",
