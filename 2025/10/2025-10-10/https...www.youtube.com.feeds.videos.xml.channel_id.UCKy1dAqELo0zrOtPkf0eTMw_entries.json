Gunn has big plans for Peacemaker outside of his HBO show, with the DCU expanding next year with Supergirl, the Lanterns series, and the Clayface film. In other news, Warner Bros. has set a date for the Minecraft movie sequel. It's expected in July of 2027, and director Jared Hess is expected to return along with most of the cast. And finally, join the stars of the live-action How to Train Your Dragon as they explore the new Isle of Berk in Universal Epic Universe at Universal Orlando Resort.\n\nPresented by Universal Orlando Resort and its new theme park, Universal Epic Universe.\n\n#Peacemaker #IGN #DC",

        "description": "Welcome back to Next-Gen Console Watch! This week Daemon, Max, and Ryan take a look at Microsoft's recent comments committing itself to another generation of gaming console hardware. The Xbox brand had a pretty rough week recently, when they announced a price hike on their Game Pass Ultimated service, on top of the already-announced hardware price hike. Fan response was, as expected, not great, with the Game Pass membership website reportedly crashing due to the number of people logging on to unsubscribe. Does another generation of Xbox hardware make sense for Microsoft? And how can they go about fixing the Game Pass service?",
