Even though this will be possible through ADB, I still can&#39;t help but worry that it will be very challenging if, even with ADB, there&#39;s no way to install unverified apps. How will apps like YTDLNis, for example, behave, considering that video download apps, especially from YouTube, don&#39;t appear on Google Play? This potential developer verification could prevent apps of this type from being verified. Although Google claims not to be interested in the app&#39;s content, this doesn&#39;t inspire confidence. They could easily choose which apps can be verified and which can&#39;t, suggesting that apps that violate Google Play guidelines or impact services like YouTube could be considered unverified and treated as potential security threats.
