Exantus stabbed to death 6-year-old Logan Tipton during a home invasion near Lexington, Kentucky in 2015. He claimed he had a psychotic break and could not remember the incident. He was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity. He was sentenced to 20 years for assault. Good behavior and education credits earned him automatic early release. Cops say Exantus failed to register as a felon in central Florida.",
