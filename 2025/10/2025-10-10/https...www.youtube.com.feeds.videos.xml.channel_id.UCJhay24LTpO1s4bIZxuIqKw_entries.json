Leading a team, as an engineer, can be even harder. Many of us are better at developing software than we are with people and feel our value lies in actually writing code. When you step into team leading, there are more people than code and your value increases.\n\nOver the last 25 years I\u2019ve been unexpectedly dropped into team leading a number of times, but three and a half years ago I chose to do it. It took at least twelve months for me to realise I was only starting to understand what leading a software team is and what it means.\n\nJoin me for some of the highs and lows of team leading and an insight into some of the things I learnt to help me be a better team lead. I can\u2019t promise a panacea as I still have much to learn, but I hope to help you avoid some of the mistakes I made.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJo",
