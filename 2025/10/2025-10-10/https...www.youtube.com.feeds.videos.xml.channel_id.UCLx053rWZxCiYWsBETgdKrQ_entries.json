        "description": "Taking a look at the Mitsubishi Oberhofer Edition monitor, a 15-inch LCD from 1999 encased in a glossy walnut burl bezel intended to fit in with fancy '90s executive decor. Hollywood home offices in particular, it turns out. And selling for just $1,800! Considering their previous solid wood monitors were $5,000 this was basically a steal... if you lived in Beverly Hills, I guess.\n\n\u25cf LGR things elsewhere:\nPatreon https://www.patreon.com/LazyGameReviews\nBsky https://bsky.app/profile/lgr-yt.bsky.social\n\n\u25cf Background music licensed from Epidemic Sound:\nhttps://www.epidemicsound.com\n\n\u25cf Random LA footage licensed from Storyblocks:\nhttps://www.storyblocks.com/\n\n00:00 what is this thing?\n02:14 no really, what is it\n04:31 the rest of the story\n07:24 Control Alternative\n09:28 testing it out!\n13:14 Commander Keen 4\n14:55 Jazz Jackrabbit\n17:31 Doom\n18:52 XGA Unreal Tournament\n20:16 so that's what it is!\n\n#LGR #retro #computer #wood",
