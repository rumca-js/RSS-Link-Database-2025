BTW this game has two different endings and I&#39;m on track for the true ending. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to beat it this weekend/week so that I can finally play other games next weekend.</p> <p>What about you guys? What are you playing this weekend and why? Anyone doing horror games in preparation for Halloween? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LabRat2329\"> /u/LabRat2329 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1o30eac/what_retro_games_are_you_playing_this_weekend_oct/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1o30eac/what_retro_ga",

For about $30, you could make a high-quality cart, pop it in a repro case, and have something that looked great on your shelf. Just solid, not like those cheap Chinese knockoffs on Etsy.
