Torrent hash is similarly hidden behind JS. If you care about privacy, you&#39;ll have JS disabled on warez sites, and without it there&#39;s no way to even open the technical tab and manually copy the hash. The site forces you to use JS.</p> <p>Why would they do that? Is it to avoid automatic DMCA filings against them? Won&#39;t stop manual ones. Is it to stop competition from copying their DB? It&#39;s all in DHT, so they could just grab torrent description (which is available without JS) and correlate it with entries in DHT.</p> <p>Not looking for an official answer from their staff, since they have no IRC/discord, no forum, <em>nothing</em> apart from contact form that I&#39;m sure dumps all messages straig",
