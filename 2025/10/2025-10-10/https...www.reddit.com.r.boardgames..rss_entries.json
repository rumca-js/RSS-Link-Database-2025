I&#39;ll provide all of the information I remember.</p> <ul> <li>it was a family board game, kid oriented. Very colorful, and very unique characters</li> <li>the characters were made out of cardboard and were held up by plastic stands. They weren&#39;t human, they were all some weird variation of monster, I think my favorite piece was some sort of alien or sea creature -I believe the game came with dice? But I mostly remember having to move based on cards.

If I get 8+ money in a turn, I&#39;ll always buy a province. If there is a trashing card in the kingdom, I&#39;ll trash estates and copper. If there is a mine I&#39;ll use it to trash copper into silver. </p> <p>I still lose. It&#39;s close (about 40-45 points every time) but one bot is always just a bit ahead of me. </p> <p>Any tips?

It&#39;s nice and big, but when I&#39;m playing lengthier campaign style games that take many hours to play through, there are nights I&#39;d like to take a break and play something else. I&#39;d prefer to not have to put away my campaign game because I would have to set it right back up afterwards, so I&#39;ve been trying to find some sort of elevated table or platform that I can put on top of my current table, giving me a play space for a second game for a night. I imagine this is part of the appeal of boardgame tables with leaves that go over top of a sunken play area, but I don&#39;t need to buy a whole new table just for this (I&#39;ve already got a decent table, after all!)</p> <p>I&#39;m curious what kinds of solutions other people have chosen or developed for this situation. Anyone have any good suggestions in 2025?</p> <p>Sear",

I love buying cards or adding them to my tableau in just the right order to see how well it benefited me in the game.
