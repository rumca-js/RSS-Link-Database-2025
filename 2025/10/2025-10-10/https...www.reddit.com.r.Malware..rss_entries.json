Well that happened to me but with some sketchy website or something that said my firewall was outdated and stuff. I clicked cancel and I just completely shut off my pc because it was playing loud sounds and a voice saying &quot;You are currently being infected with a trojan viru-&quot; then I shut off my PC.
