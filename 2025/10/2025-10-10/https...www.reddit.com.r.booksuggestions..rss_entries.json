She has a hard time remembering details over stories but can tell over arching story lines. This is a book/biography I can read in time to see her (this coming weekend lol). So preferably not SUPER long as I am a slower reader! I have no in depth knowledge of WW2 so something fairly base level is good! THANK YOU! </p> <p>Here\u2019s a text from her below about what she\u2019s been reading!</p> <p>Ha! Interesting question. I read a variety of fiction, including mystery detective, etc. also historical fiction. And just anything that looks interesting. Can&#39;t read regular print anymore but have library app so thousands of books on iPad. Problem is I read a lot and forget a lot. Have read some on WW2 including bio of Churchill that your mom found in large print. Very interesting relationship between him and Roosevelt. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON ",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have read Stanislaw Lem&#39;s &quot;Memoirs found in a bathtub&quot; and numerous PKD titles. Familiar with Le Guin&#39;s forays into psychedelic sci Fi but did not care for it. Biggest drawback to Lem and Dick titles for me has been the objectification of women. The story doesn&#39;t have to be about girls or involve them in any way, or feminism or anything , but being a woman for so long it really pulls me out when the author starts talking about breasts or something in a lecherous fashion, particularly concerning young women, of which I am one and thus feel this weird discomfort by proxy. Dislike romance in fiction generally. Interested in the esoteric, isolated yet busy, infinite and mysterious and important feel of Lem&#39;s title in particular. It is probably my favorite book to date. There is also a bit of retro style disconnectedness from the time before cell phones that adds to this, but it&#39;s not a major factor.

I&#39;ll be leaving around the 20th. I&#39;m looking for a romance book of some kind to put on my Kindle for the flight there and for the evenings. Something light, easy to read. Don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s WLM, WLW, MLM. So essentially what&#39;s your favourite easy read romance? I&#39;ll edit this post with books I like the look of :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DustPanLint\"> /u/DustPanLint </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o31yxv/for_a_trip/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1o31yxv/for_a_trip/\">[comments]</a></span>",
