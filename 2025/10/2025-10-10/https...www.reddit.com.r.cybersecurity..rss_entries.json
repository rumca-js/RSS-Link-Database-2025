One of the more frightening attacks I&#39;ve read about (and thus am writing about) is the phishing attack in which a victim gets a deepfaked audio call &quot;from a boss&quot;, which then gets cut off and followed by an email asking the victim to do something. This seems to me like it would fly by most people easily, and I haven&#39;t seen this covered in any corporate phishing training I&#39;ve taken.</p> <p>However, I&#39;d like to make sure I&#39;m backing this up with citations and sources on how prevalent or possible the phone hijacking is so that the deepfaked audio call appears to come from a trusted number. This is a bit different from what most SIM swap sources talk about.</p> <p>If anyone has pointers to sources or reputable articles on this type of attack and can share, that would be lovely. </p> <p>thanks in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",
