        "description": "Britain in the 90s had some great number one singles. Songs that summed up a moment, stretched the boundaries of what pop could be, yet have stood the test of time. \u201cNothing Compares 2U\u201d. \u201cDon\u2019t Look Back In Anger\u201d. \u201cWannabe\u201d. \u201cFirestarter\u201d. \u201c...Baby One More Time\u201d. From this list you would think the British record buying public had excellent, undeniable taste. But then there are other songs where you wonder \u201chow did that become the most popular song in the country?\u201d Whether that\u2019s because it\u2019s a confusing mish-mash of genres, defiantly uncommercial or offensively not very good, this is an exploration of those songs: The stories of the Most Bizarre UK No. 1s of the 1990s.\n\n#ukcharts  #90spop  #musicdocumentary \n\nFact-checking by Chad Van Wagner.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:45 TV Present & The Phantom of The Opera\n04:21 Heavy Metal at The Top\n07:46 Gregorian House\n11:01 Pink, Yellow, and Pear Shaped\n15:26 The Charleston For The 90s\n19:04 Probably about Courtney Love\n23:30 Brightly Coloured ",
