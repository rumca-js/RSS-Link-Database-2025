        "description": "In 1992, something unprecedented happened in Los Angeles: rival gang members negotiated a historic peace treaty, significantly reducing violence across the city. Aqeela Sherrills, one of the key negotiators of that treaty, continues to bring his vision of community-led peace programs to cities across the US. He shares how the new initiative Scaling Safety is empowering trusted local leaders to redefine public safety and create lasting change from the inside out. (This ambitious idea is part of The Audacious Project, TED\u2019s initiative to inspire and fund global change.)
