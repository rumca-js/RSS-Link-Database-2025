Chinese-Canadian Hollywood actor Simu Liu returned to Beijing for Mid-Autumn Festival, and one line\u2014\u201cthat in China I can still live a relatively normal life\u201d\u2014sent the comments section into meltdown. Some said he was doing PR; others said he was being sarcastic. While the whole internet is still shaken by the Yu Menglong case, this sentence looks more like a mirror\u2014reflecting the absurd reality of China\u2019s entertainment industry: here, \u201cliving normally\u201d has become a luxury, and \u201cdaring to tell the truth\u201d has become a risk. From Hollywood to scenic-spot stages, from Shang-Chi to the \u201cre-employment\u201d of mainland and Hong Kong stars, a chill of the times is spreading across the Chinese-language entertainment world.
