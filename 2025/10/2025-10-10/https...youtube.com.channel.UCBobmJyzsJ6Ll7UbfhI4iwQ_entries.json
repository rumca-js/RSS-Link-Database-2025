        "description": "In this session, Roland Geraerts of uCrowds explores the core design ideas of the TerraCrowds engine, including its integration with Unreal Engine components like MetaHumans and MassAI. \n\nThis session covers memory-oriented design, crowd logic for controlling characters, and the Explicit Corridor Map for efficient pathfinding. Other topics include best practices for writing (memory-oriented) high-performance code, offering insights into achieving speeds up to 100x faster than object-oriented approaches. \n\nCome by and hear how Geraerts and his team designed an architecture that enables accurate pathfinding where NPCs move naturally and avoid obstacles effectively. You\u2019ll see first-hand how Its multi-level planning architecture\u2014from global route planning to local adjustments\u2014enhances realism and control in simulations.\n\nThis session demonstrates how to effectively utilize the software in simulation scenarios and digital twins. Attendees will gain hands-on knowledge of working with the U",

Look no further than the Collaborative Viewer Template\u2014but then look a little further and let's customize the heck out of it.\n\nIn this session, Alex Coulombe of Agile Lens showcases the many modular components, design review capabilities, and various navigation options this underused template offers; with a little elbow grease, you can easily add a wide range of features, from additional menu options to worldwide multiplayer, pixel streaming, and even cross-platform compatibility. And while this template is developed with enterprise in mind (it has architectural and automotive variants), this session also covers how use the basic structure of the project for a wide variety of industries, including games!",
