If they want the war to end, it will end,\u201d Elmasry told Al Jazeera. \u201cIf Trump is so personally invested and has already made a determination that this is the end of the war, and if he\u2019s made it clear to Israel that this is the end of the war, then I think we\u2019re going to get the end of the war,\u201d he added. Since Israel began its war on Gaza in October 2023, the US has provided its top ally with billions of dollars in military aid as well as unwavering diplomatic support. Both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, had rebuffed calls to curb that assistance.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.faceb",

He says we know that yesterday, Qatar\u2019s top diplomat was in Paris meeting other foreign ministers and officials with respect to looking forward after this first phase of the Gaza ceasefire. He adds that if this ceasefire holds \u2013 hopefully \u2013 the next phase brings with it complications with respect to governance, eventual reconstruction, and things like the disarmament of Hamas. Stratford reports that a statement just released by Qatar states that Doha will be spearheading reconstruction efforts and humanitarian support in Gaza. It said it will include humanitarian grants, and it\u2019s something both the US and Israel have accepted. They\u2019ve accepted Qatar\u2019s leadership in these efforts, interestingly, with respect to future governance and this thorny issue of some sort of interim authority in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: h",
