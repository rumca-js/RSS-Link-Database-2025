It&#39;s a popular and legitimate side hustle right now. </p> <p>Basically, you just log in and claim about $1 from each site. It only takes me about 5 minutes to run through my list, and it builds up to around $600 a month. There&#39;s no catch... it&#39;s just how these sites are legally required to operate (they need to give out &quot;free entry&quot;). </p> <p>A lot of people are skeptical at first, but it&#39;s completely transparent and it works.

Even though there were already apps doing something similar, I wanted to try my own take, something more playful and just the way we enjoy sushi nights.

No matter the country, topics like AI, fast fashion, and pop culture dominate online discussions. But when you look deeper, each region has its own unique flavor \u2014 for example, fashion in East Asia vs the West has completely different emotional tones.</p> <p>Building this project taught me a lot about how communities form around interests and how fast attention shifts.<br/> If anyone else here has tried building data-driven tools or web apps like this, I\u2019d love to hear what challenges you faced in collecting or visualizing social data.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Access-6495\"> ",
