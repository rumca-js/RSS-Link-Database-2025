        "description": "In today\u2019s Hollywood, remakes are everywhere \u2014 most of them unnecessary, uninspired, or forgettable. So when it was announced that Phil Lord and Chris Miller were rebooting 21 Jump Street, many assumed it would be nothing more than a lazy nostalgia cash grab.\n\nInstead, what we got was one of the best action comedies of the last 15 years. With sharp writing, self-aware humor, and incredible chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, 21 Jump Street not only defied expectations but became an instant cult classic for a new generation of fans. \n\nDo YOU think 21 Jump Street is the best comedy remake ever made? Or do you have another favorite? Let us know in the comments!\n\n#21jumpstreet #channingtatum #jonahhill #johnnydepp  #remake",
