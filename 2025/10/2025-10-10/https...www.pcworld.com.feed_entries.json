But who has the time (or funds) to deck out a home office as it deserves? Well, one thing you can do without breaking the bank is replace that clunky traditional power strip with a much better one like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D12KTDKT/\">this Anker 8-in-1 USB charging station</a>\u2014and now\u2019s a great time to grab one because it\u2019s on sale for $19.99 (was $25.99) on Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This charging station features four three-prong AC outlets oriented in opposite directions so your bulky plugs don\u2019t get in the way of each other.

This solves that problem with built-in USB ports along the bottom edge\u2014two USB-C, two USB-A\u2014so those AC outlets can be reserved for importance stuff (like mo",

Yes, it\u2019s true that hard drives and SSD don\u2019t last forever. Unlike hard drives that give audible warning signs that they\u2019re on their last legs, SSDs can fail at a moment\u2019s notice without any kind of overt sign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you can notice the signs of a failing SSD. For instance, the once-quick transfer speed slows to crawl, there are frequent program or system crashes, or file system access errors or SMART errors occur. If you notice these things, especially in combination, there\u2019s a good chance your SSD is on its way out. In that case, it\u2019s time to prepare for the worst and do the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-listicle-chart\"><div class=\"listicle-cha",

But that just results in the text being copied over with formatting all askew. No, a better way to do it is to use Excel\u2019s built-in data copying feature. Not only is it simple and easy to do, but the data will be copied over with perfect formatting as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-to-d",
