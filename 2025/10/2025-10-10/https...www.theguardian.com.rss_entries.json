Supposedly, screenwriters Jim and John Thomas heard this jape and wrote Predator \u2013 which, after a few rewrites, a new lead (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and a change of title from their original spec script, became one of the most enduring sci-fi action films of the 1980s.</p><p>In truth, the timeline doesn\u2019t add up.

If this sounds like I\u2019m being snide, I\u2019m not. The pair improvise and film a dance, during which Harper, with amused tolerance, weathers her mother\u2019s try-hard moves and Beckham, weathering her daughter\u2019s condescension, reminds us that dancing was never really her thing.

The 25-year-old Ghanaian-Nigerian chef knew online dating in Accra, Ghana\u2019s capital, was treacherous for transgender women. Despite this, she decided to create a profile in February 2019.

Inside a room lit by a blue light, he locked the door. She sat, nervously waiting for him to make the first move. Suddenly, two people with torches appeared out of nowhere, filming her. \u201cIt felt like I was in a dream,\u201d she says, recalling the realisation that something terrible was about to happen.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/10/torture-blackmail-extortion-the-dangers-of-queer",
