This was the Allen Telescope Array, funded by a donation from Microsoft co-Founder Paul Allen\nhttps://www.seti.org/projects/ata/\n\nThis year I was invited out for a tour of this facility, but it would be a 4+and hour drive so as soon as my plane came back from the mechanics I put it high on my list of places to go. I was met by Dr Alex Pollak who is in charge of Operations at the facility and knows a lot about the hardware from antennas through to the data center and the power to support this.\n\nFind out more about the SETI Institute here:\nhttps://www.seti.org/\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me d",
