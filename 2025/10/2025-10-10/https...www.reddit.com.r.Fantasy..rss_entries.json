But they are all mostly epic and focused on world building.<br/> And I love that. But right now I wanted to try listening to sequels or something similar but I am bit tired.<br/> The last time I felt tired. I listened to Piranesi. And it was a great breather in between. Good audiobook too.</p> <p>I have recently finsihed the first law trilogy, first 2 books or Riyra, Kingkiller Chronicles, Tainted Cup, First book of Suneater.</p> <p>I would like to continue these all. But when I start listening I have problems keeping attention, probably because I need something in between. What can you recommend me?

Please tell me where I\u2019m wrong. Hopefully someone reads this and gives it a try. The new (gorgeous) paperback is like $8 on Amazon.</p> <p>REVIEW: Bradbury called this Midwestern surrealism. It\u2019s surreal, and it\u2019s Midwestern. The plot is tight, and honestly not mind blowing in itself. That, to me, is maybe the only non-mindblowing part of this book. It zips along. Short simple chapters. Its three protagonists and primary antagonist are all well-realized and complex, the main main protagonist the least so, but sometimes a more neutral narrator helps the others explode on the page. The themes are eternal and powerful. The prose is magnificent (certainly overwritten at times, but I don\u2019t care, it\u2019s just too fun and written with such enthusiasm). The characters are dynamic. The setting is evocative and melancholy and real. ",

The creak of the decks, the salt in the air, the quiet loyalty between people who had nothing left but each other. There\u2019s this moment near the end, where one of them says something so simple, so human, I actually had to close the book for a second. It reminded me why I started reading fantasy in the first place, not to escape, but to remember what being human feels like.

Don&#39;t get me wrong, she&#39;s massively unpleasant. I genuinely didn&#39;t enjoy being in her POV, and I actively started hating her by the end. This is the first series I&#39;ve read where I was <em>relieved</em> the POV protagonist died.</p> <p>And yeah the book has some kinks to iron out, none of it is perfectly executed. But even with all that, Rin makes sense. Her psychology is consistent; it&#39;s just bleak.</p> <p>Rin has been massively traumatized since her childhood. People say the books started as a Harry Potter story, then abruptly changed tone - come on. The series opens with her terrified of being s",

I think they&#39;re cool, stylish, and any character that prefers them over other primary weapons get attention from me.</p> <p>Thing is, I can&#39;t think of many daggers that are iconic, I know there is some like:</p> <p>-Krauser&#39;s knife from Resident Evil 4; -Rambo&#39;s knife from the movies; -The Kunai shown in Naruto.</p> <p>But that&#39;s all I can think on top of my head. Meanwhile swords get much more attention (not a complaint) and there&#39;s ton to think of like the Lightsaber, Sword of Omens from Thundercat, The Blade of Olympus from God of War, Excalibur, Master Sword from The Legend of Zelda series, Guts&#39;s Sword and the list goes on.</p> <p>So I ask, what other knifes/short blades/ daggers do you happen to know in fiction?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Potato-2020\"> /u/Potato-2020 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comment",
