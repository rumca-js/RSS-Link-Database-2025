The partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from the territory triggered a mass return of people back to shattered towns and villages, but the Israeli Defence Forces still remain in control of half of Gaza.\n \nIn a matter of hours as many as 200,000 Palestinians had begun making the long journey on foot, back to the places that were their homes, after being displaced by the fighting.\n\nIn Israel, the friends and families of surviving hostages have been speaking about their relief that a ceasefire deal is in place and their hopes of being reunited with their loved ones within days.\n\nThe ceasefire came into effect after being approved by the Israeli government. Under the deal, Israel pulled back its troops to agreed positions in Gaza. However, the IDF says it will \"continue to remove any immediate threat\".\n \nThe withdrawal triggered a 72-hour countdown to midday on Monday, by which time Hamas must release the remaining 20 living",
