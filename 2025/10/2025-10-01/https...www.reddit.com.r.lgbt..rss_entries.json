It makes me feel sick that i have a uterus and a pair of ovaries inside me. Not only during periods but I feel very uncomfortable thinking about it and i get this thought almost everyday. I HATE pregnancy and everything women related and i don&#39;t feel normal like a woman should. I don&#39;t feel proud of the fact that i have a uterus and most of the times I either wish that i had been a man or that i didn&#39;t have a uterus. Is this normal for woman to feel?

That added to my sense of instability and confusion.</p> <p>Not long after, I started experiencing this intense physical reaction: a pit in my stomach and tightness in my chest anytime I thought about women romantically.
