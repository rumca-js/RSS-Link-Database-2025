        "description": "Vox producer Dolly Li road tripped through northern Nevada to try and find some of these hidden ghost towns and learn about the real history behind the boom and bust cycles of mining in the state. Along the way, she stops by a town that many call a ghost town, but is still home to a dozen residents.\n\nThrough visiting a few abandoned places and speaking to historians about the technology and infrastructure that made mining a key industry of the state, we piece together a rich and fascinating story of Nevada\u2019s development. #nevada #ghost #ghosttowns\n\nThis video is presented by Travel Nevada.
