Inspired by the glut, I returned to an old favourite, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/jun/19/how-to-turn-beetroot-into-mind-blowing-chocolate-cake-recipe\">my beetroot nemesis</a>, a twist on the River Cafe\u2019s famous<a href=\"https://food52.com/recipes/80459-chocolate-nemesis\"> chocolate nemesis cake</a> in which I use the whole beetroot, including its candied magenta stems. Blackberries have a tendency to turn squishy, but even when they\u2019re soft, they\u2019re still juicy and fine to cook with. Determined not to let this bounty go to waste, I\u2019m using some of the surplus in this heavenly, complex, adult dessert, which is rich in antioxidants and endorphin-boosting flavonoids.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/",

This book tells the story of his dying, from the last time she saw him well, on a trip to Great Yarmouth at the end of summer, to his death less than two months later, just nine days after being diagnosed.</p><p>It\u2019s not easy to account for what makes this book so special. Its main character is as unpromisingly ordinary as its title suggests, and some may even find him a little boring. David Perry is the kind of man who spends hours sorting his beloved stamp collection into albums with the aid of long-tipped forceps and magnifying glasses, or filling in his Sudoku puzzle books, or reading the latest copy of the Antiques Gazette, looking intently at porcelain dogs and chased silver punch-bowls.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/01/death-of-an-ordinary-man-by-sar",

The Partisan tells the story of her bravery during the second world war, carrying out dangerous missions for British intelligence. Unfortunately, it is a basically rickety drama, not helped by being one of those films with actors speaking English dialogue in a smorgasbord of European accents. It would be more or less forgettable but for an intense, seductive lead performance by Morgane Polanski (daughter of Roman), letting rip with her character\u2019s tortured dark side.</p><p>The tale begins in 1941, with aristocratic-born Skarbek\u2019s first adventure as a spy, skiing ",
