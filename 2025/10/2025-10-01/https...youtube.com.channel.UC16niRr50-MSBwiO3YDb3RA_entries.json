        "description": "Today, a company linked to Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman has been ordered to pay \u00a3122m in damages after a judge ruled it breached a government contract for the supply of PPE during the Covid pandemic. A spokesperson for Mr Barrowman has described the ruling as \"a travesty of justice\". \n\nIn December 2023, Baroness Mone, a former Conservative peer and lingerie tycoon, admitted to the BBC that she stood to benefit from tens of millions of pounds of profit from the contracts.  \n\nAdam is joined by Newscast\u2019s own Laura Kuenssberg who interviewed the pair at the time.  \n\nPlus, our colleagues at Panorama have a new film out tonight on BBC One where secret filming at Charing Cross police station has revealed evidence of racism, misogyny, and officers revelling in the use of force. Reporter Emma Vardy and Investigations Correspondent Daniel De Simone join Adam to discuss the investigation.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc",

        "description": "The US government has shut down for the first time in six years after senators failed to pass a last-minute funding bill.\n \nThis would now likely leave hundreds of thousands of workers on unpaid leave and halting many government programs and services.\n \nBoth Democrats and Republicans are laying blame on each other when it comes to the shutdown. \n \nWhile Republicans control both chambers of Congress, they fall short of the 60 votes needed in the Senate to pass a spending bill.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n \nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n \n#USGovernment #BBCNews",
