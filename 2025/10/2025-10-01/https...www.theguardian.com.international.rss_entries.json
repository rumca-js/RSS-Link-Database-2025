        "description": "<p>The goal that won this game was a portrait of how it had been played: all in, all the way to the end. A move that started deep in Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s half with Lee Kang-in chased backwards, turning, escaping and going at the same opponents who had been pursuing him, ended in the Barcelona penalty area with Gon\u00e7alo Ramos slotting past Wojciech Szczesny. There were six seconds left, it was the 26th shot of an exhausting and enjoyable night, and now it really was over, Barcelona beaten.</p><p>For an hour of generous effort and high quality, they had gone at each other; for the last half an hour, as Barcelona tired and PSG somehow didn\u2019t, Luis Enrique\u2019s side kept pressing and ultimately justice was done. The European champions still look a step ahead even with illustrious absentees, the Ballon d\u2019Or winner, Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, among them.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/barcelona-paris-saint-germain-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

A piece of late mindlessness from Nico Gonz\u00e1lez gifted Eric Dier the chance to level and earned a draw for the hosts.</p><p>It should have been so much easier for City after Erling Haaland proved their such a thing as a sure bet in Monte Carlo, as his double looked to have secured victory on a subdued night in the principality. Instead Jordan Teze was afforded too much space for the first equaliser and Dier could not turn down the opportunity. There is plenty of time to make up for the dropped points but it was a frustrating match for City who dominated from start to finish but never gave themselves a sufficient cushion that would see themselves over the line.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/01/monaco-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

It\u2019s as if air itself had become a 3D maze, the dancers wriggling through its pathways without touching the sides, or each other. The feel is studious, both in the dancers\u2019 rehearsal-studio attire and in the compositional exactitude. On the almost empty soundtrack, an occasional lo-fi hum will swell and subside. It\u2019s layered and limpid, as subtle as it is incisive: Forsythe choreographs not only the stage, but also our attention.</p><p>Undertainment was one of the most anticip",
