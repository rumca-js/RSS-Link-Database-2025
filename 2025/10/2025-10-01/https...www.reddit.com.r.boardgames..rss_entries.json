We are looking for some recommendations for board games to take along to pass the time at campsites in the evening or in the shade during the midday sun. Because of the international flights, weight and size matter although we are open to deboxing to some degree. We will be taking multiple games, ideally some wouldn\u2018t require a table, perfect lighting and be a little wind resistant. Most plays will be 2-player only. Theme wise we are open, extra points for nature or australia themes and my gf is not too big on fantasy/medieval games. Co-op and competitive both work great. We appreciate both recommendations for smaller filler games as well as longer games (&lt;60-90min) with a lot of replayability. Maybe some campaign games? </p> <p>What we like (on travel and at home): - Marabunta - Sea Salt Paper - Pandemic Legacy (not ",

There is some significant imbalance among the cards, and not in a way that makes the game fun but in a way that brings the experience down. </p> <p>For one example, there are a number of cards that give the option to search the discard pile for a specific card type and take it into hand although a couple of very strong ones let you search the discard pile for anything. The problem is this becomes both unmanageable cumbersome and way too overpowered in a game where the discard pile can easily reach 50 to 100 cards in no time. The Simple Solution would have been to search the top 10 cards of the discard pile for these abilities. It would make them much less powerful and also give more importance to when you choose to utilize them. </p> <p>Another one is that the player powers are drastically ",

The thing is, whoever is good at search for example, will go out, search, find new survivors, get more dice, search more, get even more. Most times we played in 3-4 people one guy had 6 or ao survivors by the end of the game with others having 1-3. It started feeling slightly skewed, especially since having personal goals means less incentive to pass survivors to someone else </p> <p>Yes, they add helpless guys as well, and yes those need to be fed. Still, it always felt that extra action dice are worth it, especially spending all of them on your &quot;best&quot; survivor. So I was wondering if other people encountered this? Do you house rule atuff? Do I get any rule wrong maybe? </p> <p>(I know you don&#39;t HAVE to play the card immediately. Still... Search get survivor search more loop is a bit broken)</p> </div><!-- SC_O",
