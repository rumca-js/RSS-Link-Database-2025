        "description": "Just recently, Windows Copilot got activated on Windows 11 in its full form where the AI companion is now watching everything you do on screen and doing screen shots every few seconds. Then it stores your every action historically. Truly the biggest invasion of privacy ever and they will duplicate your brain on the computer.\n\nThe only OS that's free from this AI Companion BS is Linux. So it's time to move since the spyware is here now on Windows and coming shortly to MacOS and iOS. And it is also now on Google Android.\n\nThis is a series and in this first segment, I will focus on teaching you what kind of computer to buy and this is a modern computer, with modern features for a price between $200-2000. Stay away from cheap new computers. Those are crap and they won't run Linux.\n\nThere is no more time and I warned you about this over a year ago and very few of you made the move. Well, there's no choice now.\n\nDUAL BOOT VIDEO\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VKoG0dKCOk\n\n------------------",
