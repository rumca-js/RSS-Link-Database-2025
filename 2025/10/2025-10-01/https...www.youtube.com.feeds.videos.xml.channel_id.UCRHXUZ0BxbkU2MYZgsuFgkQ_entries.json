        "description": "Welcome to Borderlands 4 the latest release in the looter fps adventure comedy romp of always finding new ways to horde rubbish we find on the ground. Now I am the spiffing brit and today I wanted to see if Borderlands 4 is a perfectly balanced game with no bugs, glitches or exploits. Of course gearbox and randy pitchford would never personally allow a AAA game to release on steam with poor optimisation or overpowered bugs that allow to create an infinite damage build or an infinite ammo build where you no longer need to reload. Of course perhaps Borderlands 4 is not a perfectly balanced game well then we best find out with a montage of funny moments and gameplay from borderlands 4. Who knows maybe you can beat borderlands 4 in one shot. \n\nyou can find the game here but it currently is not included in the steam autumn sale so might be worth waiting till the winter sale to see if gets a discount before buying it: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/\n\nOr you know yo",
