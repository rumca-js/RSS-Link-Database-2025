Whilst there are several good introductions to Senders and Receivers, these tend to be complex technical 'deep-dives' which provide lots of low-level detail, but obscure the high-level concepts and make it difficult to relate Senders and Receivers to the other asynchronous abstractions in C++.\n\nThis talk provides a lightweight Sender / Receiver 'getting started' primer, which will introduce the key concepts (through code examples) and provide contextualisation in relation to other relevant Modern C++ abstractions, such as, coroutines and the on-going work in the Networking TS. The talk concludes by providing links to further resources and gives a look ahead to future work.\n\nSource code for all of the examples will be",
