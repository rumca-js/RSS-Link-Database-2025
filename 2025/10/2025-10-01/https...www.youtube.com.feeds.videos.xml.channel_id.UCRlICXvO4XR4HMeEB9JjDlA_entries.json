        "description": "Since 26th July 1908, the FBI has hunted some of the planet\u2019s most dangerous criminals. But there was a time where nothing like the Federal Bureau of Investigation existed. Railways connecting the country more easily, and rapid swells in population and crime within cities in the 19th century meant existing police forces were no longer able to cope. President Theodore Roosevelt wanted to change that, and make sure they genuinely got the right people for the job. This created a core team of 34 special agents that would be known as the \u2018Bureau of Investigation\u2019.",
