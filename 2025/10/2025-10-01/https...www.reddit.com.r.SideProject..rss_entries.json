That&#39;s exactly why I built Vibe Backup - to give developers the peace of mind that their code is always safe and easily recoverable. </p> <p>What makes this special: It&#39;s built specifically for the &quot;vibe coding&quot; workflow (you know, when you&#39;re in the zone and don&#39;t want to think about backups) . One global hotkey and you&#39;re backed up instantly. Auto-backup on every Git commit with your commit message as the backup description. Visual timeline to see your entire project history. One-click rollback to any previous version. Sync your backup to the cloud.</p> <p>Would love to hear your feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Brilliant-Road-1510\"> /u/Brilliant-Road-1510 </a> <br/> <span",

It sounds too good to be true, but it&#39;s a very straightforward method. </p> <p>Often, their sign-up bonuses are worth much more than the cost of a subscription or trial. If you are disciplined, you can simply sign up, take the money, and then immediately cancel your account. You&#39;re just taking them up on their overly generous offer. </p> <p>Instead of you having to find them, our team did the heavy lifting and identified the 6 best offers currently available. Following our guide, you can make $775 in about one hour. </p> <p>For example, one of the offers is with SoFi. You pay $10 for a subscription and get $30 back, making an easy $20 profit in less than 5 minutes before you cancel. </p> <p>Once you&#39;ve collected the initial $775, you can also tap into a source of consistent supplemen",
