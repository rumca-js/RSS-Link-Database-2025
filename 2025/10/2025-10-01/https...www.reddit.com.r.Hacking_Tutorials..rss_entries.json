I am being watched by my parents when they are away in certain areas of our home. I don\u2019t want to get into too much detail but it is currently an abusive and hostile environment. They have wired cameras set up that have motion detection and live viewing. How difficult (if possible at all) would it be to access it from my computer in my bedroom (no door but mostly out of sight of cameras) so that they can\u2019t spy on me. I would have to be able to turn it back on otherwise they would know. I assume if the camera goes down without ever seeing me, they will not find out. I have no prior knowledge but would like some peace even if it\u2019s small. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Asleep-Drawing4995\"> /u/Asleep-Drawing4995 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/commen",

The idea is to get together to chat about cybersec, maybe help each other with studying, or just grow together by sharing knowledge and having a good time. Think casual hangouts for a coffee or a beer! I&#39;d love to set up something at least once every two weeks.
