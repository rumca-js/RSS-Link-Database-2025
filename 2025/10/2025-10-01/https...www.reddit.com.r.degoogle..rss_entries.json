There are some Linux phones out there, but the hardware is usually trash, it feels like they\u2019re just slapping Linux on a cheap and slow device.</p> <p>What we really need is an OS like Android, but without Google controlling it. Sure, you can buy a Pixel or an older phone and flash a custom ROM, but that\u2019s not a direct solution and it\u2019s one of the reasons why custom ROMs haven\u2019t so many users. In the end, we\u2019re still handing our money over to big companies like Google just for their hardware.</p> <p>Android 16 will be the worst update of history for a open source os. What we really need is an OS that prioritizes freedom, bundled with great hardware not just some bad phones with 3GB of RAM and an LCD screen that cost 500$. With that, we\u2019d have a real alternative to Android and iPhones, and it would be amazing.<",

Right now I&#39;m paying monthly for Google One 100gb, which lets me use google photos and google drive for that amount of storage. I have done a lot of research and found many alternatives for them both but I&#39;m not sure what would fit my needs the most. Self hosting is not an alternative for the moment, I want a cloud service.</p> <p>Mostly, photos is important. I want it to sort by date photo was taken and easily sync from my phone gallery to the service, other functions are not so important to me. And also possibility to store some files. Prefferably I don&#39;t want to pay for 2 different services, one for the files (like google drive) and one for the photos (google photos), but I like having one app for the photos and one for the files, like I do now with google. Or maybe even better, one app for both but where the focus is photos. Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

He made a couple statements that made me question whether degoogling is even worth it. One of the statements was &quot;I can call up a friend and within an hour we can have access to your passwords, your email, etc.&quot;</p> <p>This made me think, Are some people confusing degoogling from digital de-government. Like is the enemy our US government or is your enemy Google? Is it worth it to go through all the trouble? Are we trying to protect ourselves from what Google does with our info or with what the government can gain access to?</p> <p>It just made me think.
