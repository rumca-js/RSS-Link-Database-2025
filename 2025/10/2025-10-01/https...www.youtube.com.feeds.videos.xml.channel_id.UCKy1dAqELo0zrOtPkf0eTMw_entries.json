        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nXbox did it again, and by \"did it\" we mean a Game Pass price hike. And by \"again,\" we mean this is the second time in just over a year that they raised subscription prices. So far, only the Ultimate tier is getting a price increase, from $19.99 to $29.99 \u2014 an jump of 50%. In the U.K., the increase is about 53%. The lower tiers aren't changing in price, but are getting re-branded as Essential (replacing Core), and Premium (replacing Standard). There's also some extra perks coming to subscribers, but already the response from gamers has not been great. And in The Witcher news, creator Andrej Sapkowski regrets a single line that he wrote in the early days of the books, that now has become a big deal in the video games.",

It's a long process to even awaken the Second Sentinel and trigger the Final Audience Wish, and then it's a challenging optional boss fight you can do in Act 2. You can sit inside of his guard and parry many of his attacks, but if he parries you, it's important to remember to jump straight up rather than trying to retreat. The Weighted Belt can also be very useful in this fight if you want to try and sit inside his guard and attack fast and hard.\n\n1:00 - Boss fight begins\n\nLoadout:\nSecond Sentinel (High Halls)\nCrest: Hunter\nThrowable: Cogfly\nAbility: Silkspear\nTools: Druid's Eye, Weavelight, Cogwork Wheel, Compass, Magnetite Brooch\n\nFor more info on Hollow Knight: Silksong, head to our wiki @ https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong",
