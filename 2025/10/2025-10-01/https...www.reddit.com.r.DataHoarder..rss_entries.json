I don&#39;t need a lot of storage, so a 6 or 8 TB drive should be plenty. I want a <strong>reliable</strong> one, so I&#39;ve been looking at WD&#39;s Gold series. Another option would be Black but they&#39;re quite a bit more expensive. Since Gold is marketed as an enterprise drive, would there be any downsides using it in my application? Any other recommendations I should consider? Thanks!</p> <p>P.S. I know, and I have more than one copy of my files. Even so, I would like to purchase one of the better and more reliable models, if possible.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/improveyt\"> /u/improveyt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1nvlhyf/need_help_choosing_a_hard_drive_for_my_backup/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comm",

I have old disc duplicators with a &quot;PRO Duplicator&quot; controller and would rather replace the disc drives with 5.25&quot; USB bays instead of spending a bunch of money on a whole new unit. The controller allows selection of one drive as a source, and copies that source to as many of the other drives that have valid blank media in them. That&#39;s why I feel like it may be possible (if a bit hacky) to replace the disc drives with USB bays.<br/> The big issue I can think of right now though is the fact that the drives connect to the controller with SATA, and the USB bays would use the USB 3.0 header plug to connect to a system. Are there adapters that could make that work? I&#39;m no engineer so I don&#39;t even know if the signals could easily be made compatible, apologies if the question is dumb.<br/> If this isn&#39;t feasible, can anyone recommend a better option for standalone flash drive duplication (the cheaper the better)",

Stripe size 512kB, the rest is default. Array was built from 2 x 16TB WD Red Pro in RAID-0, migrated into RAID-5 by adding the 3rd HDD (yes, it took a VERY long time; 161h).</p> <p>The array is built for storage and uptime of D-SLR photos; range 15-55 MB/photo and thousands of these.</p> <p>In HDD benchmarking I get roughly 400-455 MB/s for writes, and 450-455 MB/s for reads. But in real world copying/moving of files, I move down to &lt;100 MB/s, or lower. Sometimes a copy transfer even halts. This is mostly pronounced when handling small file sizes, in range of kB.</p> <p>How come such a low performance?

Heres the situation:</p> <p>I decided on a DAS for more storage on a mini pc I have connected to my TV that just runs Kodi. I ended up choosing a Terramaster D2-320, namely because of the reviews saying how quiet the fan was (compared to Cenmate units). I ordered a new 8tb seagate barracuda for my own pc, and removed a 4tb hdd from my regular pc to put into the DAS. </p> <p>When I first powered up the DAS, the 4tb drive that was previously in my pc for the last 3 years, seems to make a squealing sound, very annoying. At first I wasnt sure if it was the fan on the unit, but its not, the fan is silent. </p> <p>I started to wonder if this drive has always been this loud, and I just never noticed it because it was in my tower. I do have a spare hdd, a 1tb WD Blue that I put into the DAS, and it made the same high pitch squeal. </p> <p>Then I started to wonder if this is just ho",
