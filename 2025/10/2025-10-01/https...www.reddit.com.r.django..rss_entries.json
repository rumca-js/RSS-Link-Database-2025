So I created a script that pulls listings directly from thousands of employer websites hiring for django roles. You can check it out <a href=\"https://hiring.cafe/jobs/django\">here</a>.</p> <p>Tips for using it:</p> <ul> <li>Advanced boolean query on job titles and more (Filters -&gt; Job Titles &amp; Keywords)</li> <li>Use the \u201cSalary\u201d section to find entries that mention pay details</li> <li>Try the filters \u2014 you can sort by keywords, schedule types, distance, and more</li> <li>You can add multiple locations under the location filter.</li> </ul> <p>Hope this tool is useful! I&#39;d love any feedback or suggestions for improving it.
