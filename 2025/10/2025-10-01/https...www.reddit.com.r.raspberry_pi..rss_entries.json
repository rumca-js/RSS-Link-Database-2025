So if I leave the area and the motion sensors stop sensing motion, they cut the power to the lights. And subsequently the nvr and all camera&#39;s connected to it. When the power comes back on, the nvr and the camera&#39;s boot up again and all is well.</p> <p>Except the camera&#39;s (or the NVR?) don&#39;t remember the order the camera&#39;s were set in. So the TV displaying the camera&#39;s is displaying them in the wrong order. To fix this I could either get power from somewhere not controlled by the sensors, but I don&#39;t know where that would be. My other option is to get something else to display the camera feeds, and I thought of a Pi.<br/> When the pi boots, it will automatically login to a standard user, and the screen would immediately output a 2x2 screen of four specific IP camera&#39;s.
