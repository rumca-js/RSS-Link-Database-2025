But I saw someone post a video of a GTA IV mod today that seemed to fix a lot of issues that the PC version of the game had, and it got me wondering. What does modding look like on Linux? Is it even possible? If so, what does the process look like to add mods to a game? I know this is a big topic, so I understand that there&#39;s no single way of steps to &quot;do mods&quot; but I wanted to get a general sense of what the process is like if you&#39;re gaming on Linux.
