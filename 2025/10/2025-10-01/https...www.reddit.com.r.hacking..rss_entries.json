        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am asking for this school blocking application called Securly. I have been able to log out of the Chromebook and use my own account via a glitch, but it&#39;s too risky. You can&#39;t access anything since there&#39;s an admin lock on the extensions page, and previously I researched and found that chrome://service-workers-internals and chrome://index-ddb-internals worked amazing but that&#39;s been patched since some students decided to F-around too much and find out. Many features have an admin lock, including Linux Developer Environment, dev mode, extensions, DNS, etc. Crosh is blocked too, so no CMD-like terminal. Any advice to not completely delete this extension, but just to force close it like the first two chrome sites did would be greatly appreciated. I also have another PC I&#39;m currently typing on, if that helps. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok-Clothes-8904\"> /u/Ok-Clot",
