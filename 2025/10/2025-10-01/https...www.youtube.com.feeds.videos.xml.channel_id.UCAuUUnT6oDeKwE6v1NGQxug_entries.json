        "description": "\"How do you raise confident and capable children in a seemingly scary and unsafe world? According to Lenore Skenazy, the solution is simple yet controversial \u2014 you leave the kids alone. Lenore is the president of Let Grow and the founder of the Free Range Kids Movement where she argues that parents don\u2019t need to hover over their kids as much because they\u2019ll be more than okay \u2014 they\u2019ll thrive. Chris and Lenore discuss why overprotecting kids can backfire, how parents might be unintentionally stifling children\u2019s innate curiosity, and why one of the best tools to teach kids is to step away and let them learn and problem-solve themselves.\n\nFollow\nHost: Chris Duffy (Instagram: @chrisiduffy | chrisduffycomedy.com)\nGuest: Lenore Skenazy (Instagram: @lenoreskenazy_freerange | LinkedIn: @lenoreskenazy | Website: https://www.freerangekids.com/) \n\nLinks\nInstagram: @letgroworg\nhttps://letgrow.org/\nFree Range Kids: How Parents and Teachers Can Let Go and Let Grow\n\nSubscribe to TED \nInstagram: @ted",
