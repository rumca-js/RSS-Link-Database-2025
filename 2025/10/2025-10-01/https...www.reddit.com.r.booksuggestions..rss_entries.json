I just finished reading Sympathy Tower Tokyo and realized I&#39;d never read anything which focused so much on language outside of non-fiction. And now I can&#39;t wait to read another story with similar concepts. Such as how words shape our reality, the process of changing these words and seeing how they might alter it. I also thought of how dragons have true names for everything in their language (at least i think that&#39;s a trope sometimes) and it&#39;s relation with the perfect &#39;language&#39; concept i read once in Rousseau (prob not the right name for the concept but ill call it that) where he detailed how in a perfect language every object would have its own word.</p> <p>And it had me think how much potential maybe fantsy novels might have with these themes and wondered if anyone knew of any?</p> <p>Oh and I remember watching the movie Arr",

For me it wasn\u2019t even a philosophy or self help book it was siddhartha by hermann hesse. I only grabbed it at a used bookstore because I liked the cover and thought it would be another slow classic but by the end I found myself rethinking how I approach goals, ambition and the whole idea of \u201cchasing happiness\u201d I never expected a random novel I bought out of curiosity to stick with me for years afterward. It made me realize that sometimes the most impactful books aren\u2019t the ones you expect to be \u201clife changing\u201d</p> <p>So I\u2019d love some suggestions: what\u2019s a book that unexpectedly changed your perspective on life?

This is not harry potter lol</p> <p>This book is about a boy who is a mages/ wizards apprentice. It starts with a scene where a powerful magic user kills some people and then we end up in a random village and there is a kid and a village wizard. Its noted most villages have wizards and this one must kinda suck since he is their village wizard and their village is stupid. Pretty sure the child of the people who died in the intro are this kids parents and he is the wizards apprentice. Either the wizard dies in a fire or the kid burns down the shop. Not sure. Eventually the kid travels by boat (i think)to a city where he tries really hard to become apprenticed to another wizard. If he doesnt take a boat there he takes a boat to leave the city eventually. Idk</p> <p>No idea what happens next. Does that ring any bells? Pretty sure there is a mage or wizard guild syst",

I however dont like when my awesome plot gets derailed close to the end of the book by a whole chapter describing a sex scene in more detail than most of the previous chapters combined subsequently turning the rest of the book into main character being distracted from the plot because &quot;oh god he/shes so hot&quot; </p> <p>Sorry for the rant but ive ran into like 4 books in a row like this and its made me want to give up on reading.
