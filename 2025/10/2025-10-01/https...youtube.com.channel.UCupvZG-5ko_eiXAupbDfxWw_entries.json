She\u2019s pursuing an acting career \u2014 and recently posted about doing \u201cscreen tests\u201d in hopes of landing a gig. But Tilly Norwood isn\u2019t a real person, she\u2019s AI-generated, created by Eline Van Der Velden, founder of AI startup Particle6, which says it creates \u201cdigital content\u201d for film and TV.\n\nBut the project sparked a flurry of criticism after Hollywood news outlet Deadline reported on Saturday that talent agents were looking to sign Tilly as an actress and that movie studios are quietly embracing AI-generated content. The Tilly Instagram account racked up hundreds of angry comments, including from some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names.\n\nCNN tech reporter Clare Duffy reports. #CNN #News",
