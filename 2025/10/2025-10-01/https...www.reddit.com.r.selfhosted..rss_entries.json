I also am working on adding Immich and FreshRSS. </p> <p>My question is the following, is it better for a beginner to add Tailscale to each LXC I set up? Or have one dedicated LXC with Tailscale that somehow provides access to all other containers? I know the last one if feasible with subnetting etc but I have no experience with setting this up.

It\u2019s an API gateway for Windows Server (which is also available as a Docker image) that lets you expose legacy applications or SQL Server objects as REST APIs.</p> <p>I realize Windows Server isn\u2019t the most common setup around here, but there are still plenty of environments where people need to put a legacy app online without a built-in secure API. That\u2019s the gap Portway tries to bridge, it proxies requests to internal services and makes them accessible in a secure, modern REST API. </p> <p>If you&#39;ve got legacy software or SQL Server data locked away and need API access to it, you may want to take a look at Portway. Just point it at your database, drop in some JSON config files, and it&#39;ll generate a full OData REST API with CRUD operations, filtering, etc. No changes to your datab",
