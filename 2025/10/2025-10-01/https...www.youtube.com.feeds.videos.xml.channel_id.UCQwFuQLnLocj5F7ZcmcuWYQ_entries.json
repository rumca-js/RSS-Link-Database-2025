        "description": "In this video, we show several examples of nuclear weapons accidents in the United States, also known as Broken Arrows. In addition to showing the accident itself, we also simulate the event of a nuclear warhead detonating and its consequences. Goldsboro, Palomares, Yuba City, Damascus, and Thule are just a few examples shown in this video.\n\n\ud83e\udc82MY WEBSITES\ud83e\udc80\n\ud83d\udd13JOIN: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQwFuQLnLocj5F7ZcmcuWYQ/join\n\ud83d\udcf7Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/metaballstudios_official\n\ud83d\ude42Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/metaballstudios/\n\n\n\ud83c\udfb5MUSIC: (Youtube Audio Library)\nHero Theme (Sting) - MK2\nNight Hunt - Jimena Contreras\nShadow Chase - Jimena Contreras\nReviver - The Grey Room _ Density & Time\nMidnight Trace - Jimena Contreras\nNicolas MF Cage - Ezra Lipp\nStandoff - Density & Time\nLevel - The Grey Room _ Density & Time\nBroken Promise - Jimena Contreras\nAlien or Cake - Jimena Contreras\n\n\n\ud83d\udcddSOURCES:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_nuclear_incident_terminology\nhttps:",
