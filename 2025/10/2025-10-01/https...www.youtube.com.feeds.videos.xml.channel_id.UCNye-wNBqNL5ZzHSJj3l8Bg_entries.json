Refugees face uncertain futures as they are relocated to settlements far from the border, while ongoing peace talks offer little reassurance for those who have only known conflict.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Catherine Soi reports from Nyakabande, western Uganda.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCh",

        "description": "A high-level United Nations conference aimed at addressing the plight of Rohingya refugees has called for renewed global commitment to their cause. UN officials, including Volker Turk and Filippo Grande, emphasised the urgent need for action and additional funding, noting that the Rohingya humanitarian response plan is only 37 percent funded. The UN refugee agency warned that without further resources, life-saving assistance could face severe cuts, with children already dying from malnutrition and refugees risking their lives on perilous journeys at sea.\nThe UK pledged an additional $36 million to support Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, but criticisms emerged over the exclusion of Rohingya voices from the conference. Civil society representatives said the discussions fell short of delivering concrete solutions, with analysts describing the event as a repetition of past rhetoric. While new financial contributions met some objectives, the absence of a clear action plan leaves the Rohin",

They will receive back pay once the shutdown ends.\nMembers of Congress, however, will keep getting paid throughout.\nBesides furlough pay, the CBO said, there could be a long-term impact on the US economy from delays in payments, compensation, lapsed contracts, and an overall fall in demand in the private sector resulting from the shutdown.\nThe 2018-19 shutdown during Trump\u2019s first term as president cost the US economy approximately $3bn, or about 0.02 percent of annual GDP.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Heidi Zhou-Castro reports from Washington, DC.\nEric Ham, a Washington, DC-based political analyst, says the US constitution was designed by the founding fathers to \u201ccreate debate, create negotiation\u201d \u2013 the opposite of how t",
