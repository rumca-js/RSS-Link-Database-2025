        "description": "Fungi may have shaped Earth\u2019s landscapes long before plants appeared. By combining rare gene transfers with fossil evidence, researchers have traced fungal origins back nearly a billion years earlier than expected. These ancient fungi may have partnered with algae, recycling nutrients, breaking down rock, and creating primitive soils. Far from being silent background players, fungi were ecosystem engineers that prepared Earth\u2019s surface for plants, fundamentally altering the course of life\u2019s history.",

By reducing reliance on bulky hardware, it promises to make future fusion reactors more compact, affordable, and reliable.",
