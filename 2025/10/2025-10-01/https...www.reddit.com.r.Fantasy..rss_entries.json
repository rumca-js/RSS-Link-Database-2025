I just finished the book Silvercloak by L.K. Steven and a character gets his hand cut off and replaced with a magic golden one? This reminded me of Jamie Lannister getting his hand cut off and getting a golden one in GoT. Also, in Harry Potter, Petter Pettigrew and his hand. Is this just coincidence?

This seems little unfair to me - not every book can be his best book, after all.</p> <p>It does have most of the strengths of his other books - he nails the atmosphere of a specific historical period (France during the Hundred Years War), his main character is not from a typical fantasy profession (he&#39;s a tavern poet), and he&#39;s got some light supernatural touches from the &quot;half world.&quot;</p> <p>As usual, the narrator will offer his meditations on the meaning of life. Sometimes, these are interesting; sometimes, they fall a bit flat; but, sometimes, they hit so hard. And the combined effect is quite powerful, IMHO. I always have plenty to think about after I&#39;ve finished one of his books (this one included).</p> <p>Written on the Dark is shorter and a bit smaller in scope than his",

The books they are putting out continue to be great stories. </p> <p>Star Wars at the time it came out, and originally on film was a completely novel concept. The lightsaber was in its original release the most unique sci fi weapon out there. Since it basically defies all the concepts of physics. What made Star Wars twice as unique is that it had no book content. It was film first and everything exploded from there. I attribute these two facts to its raging success.

It explored responsibility, leadership, and what it means to protect and care for your own \u2014 not just the mate bond.</p> <p>The problem is, most of the werewolf stories I\u2019ve found since then focus almost entirely on mating bonds and sex. While that can be fine, it gets frustrating when nothing ever goes deeper into pack life, hierarchy, or the responsibilities that come with being Alpha/Beta/etc.</p> <p>Does anyone have recommendations for werewolf books, webnovels, or series that balance the romance with real pack-centered storytelling?
