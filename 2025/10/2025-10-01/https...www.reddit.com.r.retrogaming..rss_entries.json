We had Tunnels of Armageddon at school too, but this one was different. </p> <p>In this game, you were racing through tunnels and using the space bar to jump over obstacles, and I *think* using arrow keys to avoid some as well. I remember levels having different colors, and there was one where everything was black except brightly colored bands forming the tunnels. A similar look to classic Bounce Zone. </p> <p>This game, Jetpack, Commander Keen and Skyroads were my jams!
