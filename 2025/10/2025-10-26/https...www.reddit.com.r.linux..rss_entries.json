Of course I looked into it as all other metrics seemed normal, and thought it might have been some devices running over UASP. I didn&#39;t find any dmesg errors for those devices, system load and performance is normal. It seems to happen when the system is idle, as shown by the screenshots. There is little to no disk activity on this machine when its idle except for a couple of lightweight containers. </p> <p>I thought it was maybe due to the LUKS partition but I have 3 other machines running Fedora also with LUKS and are not experiencing this.

I&#39;m sick and tired of Windows, the constant technical problems or security concerns, especially now when they&#39;re putting AI in every inch of the system. I&#39;m just wondering if Linux is much harder to deal with, or can I use it the same as Windows (aka its installed, and it works fine without me having to check stuff now and then, basically how it works in general, how much is it different from Win).<br/> I use my PC for photo/video editing (cracked Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects), playing games (on steam/epic games), a bit of 3D modelling (Blender) and ofc for everyday use. I have read somewhere Linux Mint is good for such stuff, but I&#39;m no expert and I would appreciate some second opinions and advices on that term :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vronchen\"> /u/vronchen </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.re",

Being able to stack windows up and then SUPER+Arrow to change windows is very powerful and quick. I was wondering, does Kwin or GDM have similar options?
