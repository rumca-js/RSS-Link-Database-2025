        "description": "I first saw The MCON COntroller at CES, and from the prototype to now, it\u2019s come a long way. It\u2019s compact, fully magnetic, works on iPhone and Android, and features Hall-Effect analog triggers, GameSir Mag-Res TMR joysticks, Bluetooth multi-connect, and a clever slide-out design that turns your phone into a full-blown handheld gaming setup.\nIn this video, I test it across Apple Arcade, Xbox Cloud Gaming, GeForce NOW, and Steam Link, along with some emulation and fighting games. It\u2019s sturdy, premium, and easily one of the coolest controller designs I\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 the MCON might be the best magnetic mobile controller of 2025.\n\u2699\ufe0f Specs & Highlights:\n* Works with MagSafe iPhones + includes Android adapter\n* Hall-Effect triggers (full linear range)\n* GameSir Mag-Res TMR sticks (no drift, 1000 Hz polling)\n* Multi-device pairing (up to 3 devices)\n* Detachable MagSafe stand + kickstand mode\n* Compatible with iPhone, Galaxy, Pixel, and more\n\ud83d\uded2 Check out the MCON Controller:\ud83d\udc49 [Official MCON We",
