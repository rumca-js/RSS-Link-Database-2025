My goal is to improve the support of that cooler on my OS.</p> <p>I managed to unpack the PKG file (the firmware update distributed on the official website), which allowed me to get a bunch of files. One of these files is of unknown type, and I think it must be the executable since others files are of known type (config files and medias).</p> <p>The file is named ctrlboard.itu, I uploaded it on limewire.</p> <p>I tried to analyse it using radare2, but unless I&#39;m mistaken, it&#39;s not an arm, mips or riscv binary. However I&#39;m a real noob in RE and may be wrong.</p> <p>If you have experience analysing executables, could you tell me what you think it is ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Parking_Tutor_1652\"> /u/Parking_Tutor_1652 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://limewire.com/d/2mk7V#nqcPtUWXLz\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",
