I feel Root is the most similar to TI but she hasn&#39;t tried it yet</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ju",

(Currently we regularly play Carcasson, Explorers of the North Sea, Hive and Chess).</p> <pre><code> My son has Autism and ideally I\u2019d also like a game which will subtly improve his social skills (ie descriptive language, cooperation, empathy, compromises) as this is an area he struggles with. However he is resistant to overt Social Skills lessons (he finds them boring and tedious) so hopefully a game that he finds fun that can sneak in some social skills is out there for us.. </code></pre> <p>Additionally he loves Space, Science and History, so including those themes would be a bonus!</p> <pre><code> Many thanks in advance for any suggestions\u2026 </code></pre> </div",

HOWEVER I&#39;m concerned it may make going back to SG more difficult.</p> <p>Has anyone played both? Do you find you&#39;re able to pick up either title after having played both? Is Distant Skies a bit faster/less to manage?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JMizzlin\"> /u/JMizzlin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1og78s7/sleeping_gods_is_it_hard_to_go_back_after_distant/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href",
