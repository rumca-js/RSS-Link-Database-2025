At first I thought my controller (8bitdo ultimate 2c, 2,4ghz dongle) simply started to act up, but after trying another controller (switch pro controller with a cable) I had the exact same problem. Changing USB ports didnt help either. So clearly it seems to be an OS or Steam problem. Right now Im on Fedora 42, fully updated, no unusual configurations done at all, using RPM Steam. In Steam I disabled Steam input but tried to enable it too, but the problem persisted. Whats interesting though is the fact that I dont see double inputs on gamepad tester (a website) as well as the Steam input testing option. But there might be a chance that I simply didnt see it, so Im not too sure if this says anything. Chances are that the double inputs are so fast that it doesnt show on test software but still get registered in games.",

Also, when I enable <em>\u201cShow only games that run on Linux\u201d</em> in my library, everything still shows up \u2014 probably because of Proton compatibility.</p> <p>Right now, I\u2019ve set <strong>Proton Experimental</strong> as my default compatibility tool in Steam. Should I turn that off and enable Proton manually per game to check which ones are truly native?</p> <p>Any tips or tricks for identifying native vs Proton games would be super appreciated. Thanks for helping a newcomer out! \ud83d\ude4f</p",

Instead of using the Discord app on the XBox and using his existing Discord server or setting up a laptop to use his existing Teamspeak server, he also insists on using XBox Party Chat because....reasons. We can play cross platform games, but I am unable to voice chat with them because I have only Discord or Teamspeak. </p> <p>Everything I can find about using the XBox Android app in Waydroid are at least a year old and from what I can tell they suggest that there is no microphone support as of the time of their posting.</p> <p>Does anyone know what the current state of voice chat in the XBox app in Waydroid is? Does it work? Do I need an XBox specific account to use the app or does a regular Microsoft account as I would use to log into Windows work?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Huecuva\">",
