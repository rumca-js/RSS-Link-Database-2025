I just tried it with\n<a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10193193-1-800-chatgpt-calling-and-messaging-chatgpt-with-your-phone\">1-800-ChatGPT</a> and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/10/whatsapp-chatgpt.png\">it seems pointless</a>. It\u2019s\nnoticeably slower and uses an older model than just using the\nChatGPT app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A few readers have pointed to one good use case for this gateway: airplane Wi-Fi, particularly on airlines that offer \u201cfree\u201d Wi-Fi for messaging apps like Apple Messages (iMessage) and WhatsApp. The ChatGPT app won\u2019t work unless you pay for full Wi-Fi access on a flight, but WhatsApp does, and through January, you can interact with ChatGPT through that loophole.
