I enjoy crossdressing from time to time, wearing clothes that are traditionally considered \u201cfor women\u201d because it makes me feel good and comfortable in a different way. But it\u2019s got me wondering what that means about my sexuality. I\u2019m not necessarily attracted to men, but society tends to label anything that isn\u2019t traditionally masculine as \u201cgay,\u201d and that\u2019s been messing with my head. I\u2019m just trying to understand whether enjoying crossdressing automatically says something about who I\u2019m attracted to, or if it\u2019s simply an expression of identity or comfort. Would love to hear from others who\u2019ve been through something similar.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Squash-3462\"> /u/No-Squash-3462 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ogn23v/am_i_gay_if_i_crossdress/\">[li",

These parents could rather throw a party when the child is born and after a while they have confirmed their gender identity aka came out. Wouldn&#39;t that be so good?? It feels like gender reveal in this era 25 is so outdated and offensive. Clearly putting up and forcing their view of gender on that little child who is about to be born. LET THAT CHILD EXPLORE IT THEMSELVES!!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Funny_Read_8899\"> /u/Funny_Read_8899 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ogece5/i_dislike_gender_reveal_parties/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ogece5/i_dislike_gender_reveal_parties/\">[comments]</a></span>",
