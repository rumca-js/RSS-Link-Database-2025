I have a membership there, and for years now I have a routine after work and on weekends where I\u2019ll walk a few miles and read while I do it. Pretty leisurely pace, and I just lap the place. </p> <p>Now to be clear, I don\u2019t deeply care what others think about this in terms of like\u2026impacting my self esteem or whatever. I know it\u2019s not usual, but that\u2019s fine, I enjoy it. The reason I ask is that in the last few months, I have been on the receiving end of some incendiary looks and even direct comments. One mother told me it was dangerous to do in a place with kids (I walk like\u20262 mph and always look up). Another person called me Cinderella (my guy, you\u2019re thinking of Belle). </p> <p>It just got me thinking about why something so harmless is seemingly impacting people so much? Does NOBODY else do this? Is it seemingly more dangerous than I realize, or like\u2026 bizarre to the point of being soc",

And a few months ago I cultivated a very healthy dislike for Dorothy Sayers&#39; <em>Whose Body?,</em> unable to finish it due to its virulent anti-Semitism and classism. </p> <p>However, at the end of the day I&#39;m sure it would be <em>The Fountainhead</em>. I like to think it&#39;s had its heydey, much like its terrible author. It&#39;s a ridiculous story, with no literary value - any cheap romance you might pick up at a thrift store is better written. And I&#39;m not seeing or hearing young &#39;uns talk about it, so that&#39;s a good thing, but also what do I know. Better to be safe than sorry.</p> <p>What would you ban?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I just finished reading the Silo book series. My edition includes 3 additional Silo stories by the author, which I read. I regret that. I liked the first story where the guy takes his family to a remote cabin because he doesn\u2019t want to spend his life doing shifts with them in the deep freeze. The freshness of his choice and his experience of doomsday was a good addition to the oeuvre.</p> <p>The second and third stories should have been one, in my opinion, because the first set up the action of the third. I will say that the second story did explain at the cryochambers for women and children weren\u2019t to save them, but to get the men to go along with the plan. Further, because of their misunderstanding of The Order, their calculations for how long they would remain in isolation were vastly incorrect, the reader could see how people came to be in the position of making decisions about who lives and who dies. Ok. It\u2019s a another layer of perspective.</p> <",
