The same goes for Japanese-developed third-party licensed games being way ahead of western third-party ones. Also, unlike Sega, which released some poor first-party titles, Nintendo had a consistent track record for quality (the Mario educational games were third-party) meaning this could&#39;ve been an absolutely huge missed opportunity. Nintendo did actually do a Peanuts game, Snoopy Concert that never left Japan, and it really shows how good license-based games made by Nintendo could&#39;ve been.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ExtremeConnection26\"> /u/ExtremeConnection26 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ogwcwe/unlike_sega_atari_and_nec_nintendo_mostly_stayed/\">[link]</",
