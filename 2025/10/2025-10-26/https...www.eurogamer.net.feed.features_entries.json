That means we're back with another Weekly Digest - in which we recap some of the highlights you might have missed over this busy week on Eurogamer. This time around, Tom was surprised how much he enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden\">Ninja Gaiden</a> 4 despite being officially rubbish at video games; Connor dipped his toes into Arc Raiders and made some new friends (nothing to do with his toes); I embarked on a journey of relentless squirting for my <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator-2\">PowerWash Simulator 2</a> review, and Bertie had a chat with <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dayz\">DayZ</a> creator Dean Hall about his successes and studio struggles.
