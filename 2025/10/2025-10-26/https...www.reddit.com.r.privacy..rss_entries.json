However, I received an email telling me that if I wanted the full 1GB, I had to &quot;set up auto-forwarding from Gmail&quot; within 15 days or I wouldn&#39;t get the 1GB. Why is a gmail account a requirement? I dont want Google to know my proton email. It feels like it defeats the purpose of privacy I&#39;m trying to achieve by getting a proton email. I don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s optional but forcing me to do this to get the 1GB storage feels wrong, like a red flag. It is making me think twice about staying with proton. </p> <p>Am I being too paranoid?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Comfortable_Silence_\"> /u/Comfortable_Silence_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1ogdrsr/why_people_recommend_proton_for_privacy_if_its_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",
