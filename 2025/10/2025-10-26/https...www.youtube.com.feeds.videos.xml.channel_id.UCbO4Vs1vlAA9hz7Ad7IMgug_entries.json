        "description": "The Dwarf enthusiasts over at GRIMSKALD have got retail copies of all their physical assets for their Dungeon Crawler; TORCH & SHIELD. Previously I reviewed this on the Indie Hour in digital but now that it's out in the wild I was lucky enough to get my hands on a copy. Let's check them out. \n\nBig thanks to GRIMSKALD for the Complimentary copy of the box to review. \n\nCheck out the kits HERE: https://www.grimskald.com/category/torch-shield\n\nClick up in the Cards for the Indie Hour feature on the full rules!\n\nMusic \"Retrofuture Nasty\" by Kevin McLeod used via Creative Commons",
