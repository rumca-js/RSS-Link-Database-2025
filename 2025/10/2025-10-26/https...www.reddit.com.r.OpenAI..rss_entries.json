I\u2019m on ChatGPT Plus (GPT-5), and lately it\u2019s been acting weird, shorter answers, skipping steps, and giving surface-level replies that feel like it\u2019s not even trying to think.</p> <p>It used to dig into context, reason things out, and give creative or insightful replies. Now it\u2019s like it\u2019s procrastinating, responding just enough to \u201cpass,\u201d but without depth.</p> <p>No official update is listed after Oct 20, but I\u2019m wondering if OpenAI quietly changed something behind the scenes. Could they be running some kind of &quot;social experiment&quot;or adjusting their profit model by routing more traffic to GPT-5-mini or throttling compute?</p> <p>Curious if others are seeing the same shift or if it\u2019s just me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/N-Innov8\"> /u/N-Innov8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1ogxx",
