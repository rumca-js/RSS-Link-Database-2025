Through social engineering, fake \u201cgangsters\u201d obtained my photo and address and posted that I was a \u201crat\u201d for the gang and that they would kill me. It was clearly an extortion attempt. I used all legal channels in my country and they\u2019re investigating, but the law is slow. The account owners removed the post after they saw I blocked them and didn\u2019t give in to the threats, but X did nothing. The account is still active. They made a new victim today. Here this scheme is called the \u201cfalse gang\u201d scam, and they\u2019re probably scammers with no real ties to organized crime.</p> <p>I got pretty angry and decided to create a fake X account with an email that has no personal data, accessed it via VPN, and messaged the perpetrators in their DMs telling them to remove the photo of the kids because I know they don\u2019t belong to any gang and they would suffer consequences.

However, I didn&#39;t like watching an old video. So, I asked ChatGPT to provide me with websites that offer free courses. They suggested TryHackingMe. I started learning there, and it was great. However, after a while, they asked for a subscription, which I didn&#39;t want.</p> <p>Now, ChatGPT suggested Cisco Networking Academy. They said it&#39;s 100% free, and all of its courses are free. If you want to get a certificate at the end, you have to pay, which isn&#39;t a problem.</p> <p>Now, I want your opinions on Cisco Networking Academy.
