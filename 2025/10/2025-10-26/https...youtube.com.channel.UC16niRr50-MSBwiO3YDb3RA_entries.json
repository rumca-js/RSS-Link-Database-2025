        "description": "BBC Africa Eye investigates South Africa\u2019s underground psychedelic therapy industry, where the pursuit of healing can have devastating consequences.\n \nOne in two people globally will experience some form of mental illness in their lifetime according to the World Health Organisation. \n \nTreating these is a multi-billion-dollar global business, which does not just benefit big pharmaceutical companies. It is a market that operates with little oversight and, critics say, often puts clients at risk of serious harm and even death.\n \nAfrica Eye investigates Cape Town\u2019s emergence as a hub for unregulated psychedelic treatments - and gains rare access to South Africa's network of treatment centres, where illegal drugs are freely administered, leaving participants vulnerable to potentially harmful consequences.  \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

Pochin says \u201cMy comments were phrased poorly and I apologise for any offence caused, which was not my intention.\u201d\n\nAnd we look at Laura\u2019s interview with Former US Vice-President Kamala Harris, in which said said she was 'concerned' she did not ask Biden to quit the presidential race.",

The report says half of these groups could be wiped out in the next decade if governments don't do more to protect them.\n\nIt claims the biggest risks are from logging, mining or drilling for oil.\n Uncontacted groups are extremely vulnerable to basic disease - as such, the report says a threat is posed by contact with evangelical missionaries and social media influencers looking for clicks.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n #Amazon #BBCNews",
