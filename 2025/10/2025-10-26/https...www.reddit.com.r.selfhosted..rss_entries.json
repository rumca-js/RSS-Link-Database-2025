I\u2019m thinking about building something inspired by SQLite\u2019s philosophy. Imagine a single binary you download and run, with a built-in dashboard so there&#39;s no separate Grafana (or whatever) setup. It would have auto-instrumentation where you drop in an SDK and get basic metrics and errors automatically. Everything gets stored locally and so it&#39;s fast with no external database needed. Plus a simple event API where you can just write something like event(&quot;user_signup&quot;, {plan: &quot;pro&quot;}) for custom tracking.</p> <p>Basically observability that doesn&#39;t require more infrastructure than the app you&#39;re monitoring.

I&#39;ve also read about using <code>env_file</code> mounts and then setting strict file permissions (like 600 or 400) as another approach.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking to enhance the security of my Docker setup.

These layers can then be processed by build containers, to make liveboot isos, disk images, or anything else you can dream up a recipe for!</p> <p>This opens up a lot of new possibilities for deploying software at home. For example, I&#39;m a big fan of making custom Debian Liveboot images, since they start from a completely predictable state on every boot.</p> <p>To learn more about the syntax, features and builders, there&#39;s an entire <a href=\"https://chrivers.github.io/raptor/\">Raptor book</a> documenting as much as possible.</p> <p>Raptor is still very much in development, but it has reached a stage where it is useful for real task",

According to chatgpt, if i have &quot;set: &#39;rs0&#39;&quot; and &quot;stateStr: &#39;PRIMARY&#39;&quot; when i use rs.status() in mongodb, it should work, but it didn&#39;t for me. I am pretty new to this and have been going by what chatgpt has been telling me regarding how to set it up.</p> <p>Can anyone please tell me how I might be able to fix this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrDugeHick\"> /u/MrDugeHick </a> <br/> <s",

The fact that it doesn&#39;t support videos is unfortunate; however, I wanted to come up with a workaround.</p> <p>I noticed that images are stored without compressing them or manipulating them whatsoever, so that gave me the idea of concatenating a video at the end of the file to see if it was trimmed out or not.</p> <h2>How it works</h2> <p>JPEG files end with an EOI (End of Image) marker (bytes <code>FF D9</code>). Image viewers stop reading at this marker, so any data appended after is ignored by the viewer but preserved by the file system.

It exposes a SABnzbd api and can serve as a drop-in replacement for it, if you&#39;re already using SAB as your download client.</p> <p>The only difference is, NZBs you download through NzbDAV won&#39;t take any storage space on your server. Instead, files will be available as a virtual filesystem accessible through WebDAV, on demand.</p> <p>I built it because my tiny VPS was easily running out of storage, but now my plex library takes no storage at all.</p> <h1>Ke",
