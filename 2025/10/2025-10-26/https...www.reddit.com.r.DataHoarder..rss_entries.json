In this thread i would like to discuss options on how to make it more power efficient in a money efficient way.</p> <p>110W * 730h (about 1 month) * \u20ac0,33/kwh = 30 euros a month. It is not a fortune, but i prefer to spend money on hardware instead of power.</p> <p>My current setup is an older supermicro 2U chassis. I replaced everything inside of it besides the power supply and the disk backplane. I swapped the mobo with a MSI b450 mobo, which i run with a Ryzen 7 3700x, 64gb ecc memory, and no GPU (this is why i bought the admittedly kinda shitty MSI board). I got 2 SSDs to boot proxmox and run a few VMs. VMs like a VM in which i torrent linux isos, and a VM for homeassistant. I also got a 8x8tb RAIDZ1 pool for storage of said linux isos.</p> <p>If you were to take my current setup and want to make it more power efficient, what steps ",

We all know DVDs don&#39;t store a lot of data on a single disk, and blu rays are expensive, along with the huge overhead to entry for tape drives.</p> <p>One benefit of DVDs/Burnable disks is you can&#39;t accidentially erase everything. To get around the limited storage of 1 dvd, I found its very easy to write a small program to split up a bigger file and burn it to multiple DVDs. Is it the fastest method of accessing? [No, and its a last resort method while not having to pay for Glacier storage]. However, you can&#39;t make the same silly mistake I made and format an entire 4TB drive.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ttyyuu12345\"> /u/ttyyuu12345 </a> <br/> <spa",
