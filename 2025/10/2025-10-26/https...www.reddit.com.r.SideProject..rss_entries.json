For years I\u2019ve loved exploring new places, but I started to feel that travel planning had lost its magic. Between endless comparison sites, listicles, and \u201cAI travel hacks,\u201d the process began to feel like work.</p> <p>I missed the feeling of quiet discovery: walking through a town, hearing local voices, finding something real. So I started building Teravia.</p> <p>Teravia is a calm travel app for people who feel overwhelmed by planning. Its goal is to make exploring the world feel effortless and human again. Instead of more noise and optimization, it focuses on connection between travelers and the places they visit.</p> <p>The bigger vision is to use technology gently, to remove friction rather than add it, and to make travel personal again.

I think it was the first multiplayer game to use Apple Intelligence features (iOS 26 on device LLM and image generation).</p> <p>It uses Apple&#39;s on device LLN to generate stories and uses ImagePlayground to illustrate them. It supports multiplayer mode via Game Center so you and a friend can take turns contributing to the same adventure together. The app is just 11 MB using all native libraries which I think is quite impressive for an app using an LLM (although not sure how much space the system libraries themselves take up).</p> <p>I thought it was really cool to have an on-device LLM to work with and wanted to see if I could teach myself the new FoundationModels library. In doing so I came up with something that was fun and I decided to release it as a game. I call this a &quot;game&quot;",
