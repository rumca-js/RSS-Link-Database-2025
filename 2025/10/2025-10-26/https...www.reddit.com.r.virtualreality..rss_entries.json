The current issue is that I can&#39;t seem to connect 2 of the controllers for some reason. It&#39;s the same 2 that won&#39;t connect every time after I unpair using the commands, but I know they aren&#39;t broke cause after I unpaired all of them the very first time, one of my original pucks I used for 3-point suddenly won&#39;t pair now. I tried installing, uninstalling, trying the beta, unpairing, repairing.
