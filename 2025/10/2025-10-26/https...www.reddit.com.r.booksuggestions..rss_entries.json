I have studied history in college but the outlook on the Cold War was very European-centric so there&#39;s a lot I don&#39;t know about the intricacies of US policies and the consequences in Africa, Latin America... But also the role of jazz, and political assassinations.

We meet once a month to discuss the book and then we decide with a pool what the next book will be. Anyone in the club the suggest any book. I came up with the idea that maybe we could start doing themed months, where all the suggestions have to adhere to the theme. I need suggestion for a few more themes. The ones I have are: - queer - fantasy - sci-fi - crime - horror - historical (set al least 100 years in the past) - contemporary (no older than 10 years) - (auto)biographical - graphic novel - classic - non-fiction - story collection - freebie (everyone reads any book they want and present it to the others)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Aegean2424\"> /u/Aegean2424 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ogsalt/bookclub_ideas/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksug",
