I quickly started on ship of magic but kyle as a character hurts me to my core, i was struggling to not break down in angry tears with just about every scene he is in, he just brings to mind so much stuff id rather not recall from my childhood. Anyway i got about 1/3 through the book and i reached a breaking point and i searched him up on the robin hobb wiki.</p> <p>When i saw \u201ckyle was\u201d i breathed an audible sigh of relief </p> <p>I quickly scrolled to the bottom of the page avoiding undesired spoilers and saw in the last paragraph the sentence: \u201cwas hit by a barrage of arrows, killing him instantly\u201d </p> <p>This alone gave me the strength to continue through the liveship trader trilogy </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/doomshad\">",

It immediately captured my imagination: dark, poetic, and filled with cosmic symbolism.</p> <p>I couldn\u2019t believe it had never been adapted before, so during the pandemic I began developing a fantasy story inspired by it. That story has since grown into a larger creative project that\u2019s been years in the making.</p> <p>What I love about the original tale its blend of myth and astronomy, an eternal dance between light and shadow. In my version, the characters even draw their names from celestial references: the scientist Edmund (after Edmund Weaver, an English astronomer) and the woman, Neoma (\u201cnew moon\u201d in Greek).</p> <p>The journey hasn\u2019t been easy.

She&#39;s on a mission to find the legendary pirate ship, the Red Marley. Unfortunately for her, the Marley has been taken by Ignacia, a blessed and ruthless Prognosticar of the Maiden (think the Spanish Inquisition with an even bigger obsession with fire). After freeing the Marley, you must work to revive her motley crew of overpowered cursed pirates, sail the Lost Caribbean and find Black Eye Mordechai&#39;s treasure.</p> <p>Gameplay: This is a stealth strategy assassination game.
