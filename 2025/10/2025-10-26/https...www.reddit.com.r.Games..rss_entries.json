The game was also updated during Early Access with better bot support, so the game now plays much better if there aren&#39;t enough players.</p> <p><strong>Overview of the 2 factions:</strong></p> <p>1) <em>Soldiers</em> - First-person shooter (FPS) that mixes elements from boomer shooters, tactical shooters, and arcade shooters, where you face off against enemies that must be exposed by a light source before they can be damage",
