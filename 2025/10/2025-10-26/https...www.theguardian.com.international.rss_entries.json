It was not quite last season, when defeat here approaching Christmas was a ninth in a dozen matches, but it was equally painful.

But the assistant referee raised his flag and, as Haaland lay wincing, a check from the video assistant referee confirmed the goal would not stand.</p><p>There is sufficiently much more positivity surrounding Pep Guardiola\u2019s side at present but this proved another frustrating trip, Matty Cash\u2019s superbly taken strike ultimately the difference.
