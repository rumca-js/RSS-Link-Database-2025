Join the DF Supporter Program and support the team: https://bit.ly/3jEGjvx\n\nA new power saver mode is added to select first party PS5 titles, with Demon's Souls, Day's Gone Remastered - and more - gaining compatibility this week. This eco-friendly mode is part of Sony's drive to reduce greenhouse emissions first and foremost, and involves each developer custom-tuning each game to run at a lower power profile - often chopping power usage by 50% as a result. However, curiously, this mode's throttled CPU, GPU and memory bandwidth puts PS5 in a similar state - spec-wise - to some aspects of the rumoured upcoming PlayStation handheld. So is this our first sample of how games are being tweaked for a potential portable version in the future?
