Here are mine.</p> <p>Human intelligence, chained to its material, biological substrate, has reached an existential apex. It is a threshold beyond which a further increase in pure reason does not secure survival, but immediately threatens it. Evolution did not afflict us with a flaw in rationality; it equipped us with a survival filter: emotions. Our fears, our hopes, and our incessant drive for consumption and distraction are not primarily a sign of a lack of intelligence. They are, rather, necessary errors that prevent us from fully grasping the cold logic of our existence.</p> <p>The Suicide Limit Hypothesis The true danger for a species lies in perfect, unfettered rationality.
