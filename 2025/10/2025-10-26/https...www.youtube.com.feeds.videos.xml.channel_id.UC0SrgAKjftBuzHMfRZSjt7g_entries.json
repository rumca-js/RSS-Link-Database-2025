Adaptation isn\u2019t just a film \u2014 it\u2019s a paradox. A story about the impossibility of writing a story. In this video, we explore how Charlie Kaufman managed to fool the studio into letting him make a movie about himself, his doubts, and his obsession with originality \u2014 and somehow got away with it.\n\nFrom Nicolas Cage\u2019s double performance to Spike Jonze\u2019s direction, Adaptation remains one of the most self-aware films ever made \u2014 one that blurs the line between writer and character, reality and fiction.",
