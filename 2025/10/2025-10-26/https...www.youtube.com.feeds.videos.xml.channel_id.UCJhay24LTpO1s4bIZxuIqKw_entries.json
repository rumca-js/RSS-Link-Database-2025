We need to learn to play nice together... for a looong time! That applies equally to people, but also to code. Rust code everywhere is increasing at an accelerated rate, but so does C++ (and that's on top of gazillion lines already out there). So, hybrid codebases are quickly becoming the norm.\nHaving seamless interop between the C++ and Rust components is essential for the success of this symbiosis. There are many challenges in this process, but people found various ways to make things \"work\" - from dealing with ABI compatibility and platform/toolchain guarantees, to going down to C and FFI, to various techniques and tools for generating glue-code between the two languages.\nAlas, general-purpose interoperability (not tied to a specific toolchain/IR) without loss of performance has yet to be achieved. Just \"making things work\" is n",
