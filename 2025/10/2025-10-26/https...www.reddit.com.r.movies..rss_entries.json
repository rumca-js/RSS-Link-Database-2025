But sometimes names do get changed for one reason or another.</p> <p>One notable example is how in the original Universal Frankenstein movies, Victor Frankenstein was renamed Henry Frankenstein, and Victor&#39;s friend Henry Clerval was renamed Victor Moritz. I have heard conflicting reasons, one was that excecutives thought that the name Victor sounded too &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;unfriendly&quot; to American audiences in 1931, the other more likely reason was that instead of the book the movie was adapting a play that had made the same name changes (why the play changed the names is also unclear).</p> <p>Another example is how in Ralph Bakshi&#39;s Lord of the Rings, it was thought that Saur",

So the frame will always look bad if you hit pause and stare. But that is just about the only major flaw this movie has, and its easy to get used to. The music, cinematography and animation all slap so hard. The standout feature though is the writing. Every single joke is clever, the plot is well paced, all the characters are unique and interact well with each other. </p> <p>And the premise, outright hillarious. I wont spoil anything but its a tightly interwoven set of threads that recontextualize each other; which all get expertly revealed in the correct order to maximize impact. Not to mention that despite the fairy tale aestetics, it delivers emotional moments and covers interpersonal relationships with light hearted respect. Also there is mystery and foreshaddowing for those paying attention and trying to piece the puzzle together before the characters do.",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Based on the best selling novel by Ira Levin and directed by Roman Polanski, Rosemary\u2019s Baby is about Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move to a New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and odd neighbors Roman and Minnie Castavet (Sidney Blackmer, Ruth Gordon). When Rosemary becomes pregnant she becomes increasingly isolated, and the diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth. Just finished watching this on TCM and it\u2019s a classic. Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes are really good in their roles. The film moves at a slow pace but it doesn\u2019t get boring and actually keeps you invested in what\u2019s going on. Great movie it is if you all haven\u2019t seen it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikeyboy101591\"> /u/Mikeyboy101591 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ogb0cz/rosemarys_baby_1968/\">[li",

The idea is that we all vote on a movie to watch during the week, then hop on a voice call to talk about it, share thoughts, maybe dive into some film theory, or just nerd out about what we liked or didn\u2019t.</p> <p>It could be anything: classics, new releases, weird arthouse stuff, or whatever the group feels like.</p> <p>I feel like there are a lot of us here who love talking about movies but don\u2019t always have people in real life who want to dig into cinematography, writing, soundtracks, and all that.</p> <p>Would anyone be interested in joining something like that?</p> <p>DM me for my discord if interested!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Few_Hurry1205\"> /u/Few_Hurry1205 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1og784",
