But paying $90 year, even with the current BFCM sale, I don&#39;t know if I can justify that when there are clearly less expensive options out there.</p> <p>One of the features that has sort of transformed the way I&#39;ve read through my feeds, is annotation. I&#39;m not an academic or honestly, someone I would consider a POWER USER, but being able to mark up blog posts to circle back to later or to grab a snappy quip, it is great! My quick research makes me think, if I want a good annotation program, that is probably separate from my RSS reader and potentially another subscription.</p> <p>Other things I like about Inoreader in case it helps to see if there are other ones out there:</p> <ul> <li>Full article view. Being able to read all my posts through Inoreader and not have to look at these sites, beautiful. Seems like some full article views are more pulling up the site within the reade",
