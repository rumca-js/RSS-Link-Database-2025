I&#39;m looking for some book suggestions, where it&#39;s not written down for the main characters that they are gay, but as the story goes on, they start to realise that they fell in love with each other. Like in The spear cuts through water by Simon Jimenez, or Little Mushroom by Shisi, and I think it was like that way in Wolfsong by T.J. Klune too. I find these love stories much more special than when we learn in the first chapter that the main guy is gay. Are there any more good books this category?

I\u2019m looking for a book about art created in times of peril, and art created in protest for my dad. He\u2019s an amazing artist and tends to express himself through days and weeks of making massive, stunning oil paintings. He\u2019s also prone to deep episodes of depression and rage- he lives in the rural south in the US and feels alone in his resentment of the sociopolitical position of this nation, and the rest of the world. He\u2019s recently started making his art public but feels like he has to sanitize his own dark feelings in his work. He loves to read so I want to get him a book that makes him feel like he has company when he makes his art. He needs to know that art has always been used in protest, and that his art is allowed to be dark, relevant, and sometimes painful to witness. Any suggestions would be very welcome. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",

I also like shows that can captivate me with their world, worlds that draw from reflected reality and is realistic, but unique and complex. I love to see parrelels to the world and how humans behave, systemically, maybe even addressing oppressive systems that mirror our own but more unique. It doesn&#39;t have to be fantasy or sci-fi, but I like those, could also be historical fiction ect. For instance, One of my favourite shows is Legend of The galactic Hero",

But this one was surprisingly readable. It bridges the gap between basic bio concepts and actual high-level molecular medicine without making your brain hurt.</p> <p>Here is my simple review of the science it covers and why I think it\u2019s worth it:</p> <ol> <li><p>It treats Cancer History like a Detective Story Instead of just listing facts, it walks you through how we actually figured this stuff out. It starts with the 1960s and the Rous sarcoma virus. It explains the discovery of the src gene and the huge paradigm shift when we realized cancer isn&#39;t usually a foreign invader it\u2019s caused by proto oncogenes (our own genes) getting corrupted.</p></li> <li><p>The &quot;Gas Pedal vs. Brake&quot; Anal",

I thought it was such a clever idea, a sort of Pygmalion-esque story, but with a written character instead of a statue. However, I bought it without reading a single page in the store beforehand. Now I found out that the prose and English is a bit too difficult and abstract for me. Hopefully later in my reading journey I will be able to pick it up again. But right now I was wondering if there are any similar stories.

As the tittle suggests, im looking for books that cover more recent world events, not particularly only limited to geo-political conflicts.</p> <p>For reference, im from South America, living in Denmark, and im constantly seeing the good, the bad and the ugly of both sides of my story in those places. And i have regular deep talks and discussions with good friends, also in my situation, observing things people from here might not be aware of.</p> <p>I have read during university and after, some know books, like Howard Zinn\u00b4s and Eric Hobsbawm\u00b4s &quot; the 4 eras&quot;.<br/> Those in particular would be a re-read, just because its been such a long time and could be nice to refresh the content, also because so much happened in my life and the world.</p> <p>Contents and subjects im interested in:</p> <p>-Recent world history events</p> <p>-geopolitical conflicts - any of the wars in the last 50 years</p> <p>-big corporations - ( food pro",

He also liked Percy Jackson, as he likes mythology. He loves dragons, but he didn&#39;t like Game of Thrones. He doesn&#39;t like Marvel.</p> <p>He reads manhwa and manga too.

King at his best: character-driven, tense, and very human.</p> <p>Fairy Tale \u2013 Stephen King Enjoyed parts of it, but not my favorite.

Different kind of King \u2013 more crime/mystery, but still a page turner.</p> <p>Stranger in a Strange Land \u2013 Robert A. Heinlein Thought the first half was great, but the second half got pretty weird for me and lost some of its appeal.</p> <p>Project Hail Mary \u2013 Andy Weir What a great sci-fi book.
