I remember I played talisman when I was a kid and i loved this game. I don&#39;t remember much from it but I don&#39;t think it was complicated, yet it gave me a sense of wonder. It doesn\u2019t have to be a role playing game just to have this journey experience feeling, and has a map, like something we can move our characters/armies/whatever on it. And I prefer a game that I can still buy in retail, unless the price of used is reasonable and it is not one of those games that has high value. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by",

I made my first 2 \u201ctickets\u201d pretty quickly, then worked on 2 more a little bit more ambition tickets. I was 1, two piece connection away from having completed them both, and having ALL of my rails connecting, when my fianc\u00e9 sabotages me for no reason other than she didn\u2019t have any more moves to make!! Sabotage hadn\u2019t even crossed my mind. I wanted to win on merit. Making my tickets was my goal, beating her would\u2019ve just been a fun little bonus. Over 1/2 of my gameplay destroyed in a 2 car move! I was devastated.
