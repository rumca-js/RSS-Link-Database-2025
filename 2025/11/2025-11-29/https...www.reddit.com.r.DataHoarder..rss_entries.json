The disks are not currently merged in any way, each has a single ext4 partition and has its own mount point. I would like to merge the sets of disks (22TB + 20TB + 10TB +10TB + 10TB on each machine) into an identical pool on each machine, with a single mount point (probably /data).</p> <p>My understanding is that if one disk in a mergerfs pool fails, it doesn&#39;t affect the data on the other disks. I am using a 3-2-1 backup strategy (the two machines plus Backblaze), so is this a good use case for mergerfs? If I&#39;m using mergerfs can I simply replace a failed disk and restore from backups, and be back in business on that machine?

I have tried to update the firmware with a Windows PC by using the tool that is provided from the terramaster forums. However, the &quot;USB Searching&quot; bar is constantly stuck at 39%. I have four 4TB HDD and I have tried to use two of them to update the firmware. When trying to connect it to the Nucbox initially, I used a USB 3.2 to USB-C because the Nucbox does not have a USB-C port. </p> <p>I have been working on getting a media server set up for the first time, hence the want for the DAS.
