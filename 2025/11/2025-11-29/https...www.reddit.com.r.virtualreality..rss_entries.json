After finally getting my hands on good hardware, I\u2019m eager to play some pcvr games like the forest. However, my pc is too far from my router for an Ethernet connection, and I currently don\u2019t own a link cable. I\u2019ve tested out airlink and steam link. While they do work, there is a lot of stutter and lag, I\u2019m guessing due to the \u201cdouble wireless connection\u201d. My question is if I should fold and get a link cable off amazon and if these issues I\u2019m having won\u2019t continue through a wired connection. My pc specs shouldn\u2019t be the problem, I\u2019m runnning an rtx 5070, amd 7800x3d, 32 gb ddr5 6000 cl30 RAM. Drivers are up to date. Edit: Also, I noticed the game also shows up on my monitor while playing.

I wanted some advice since I&#39;ve been browsing around used sites like Vinted and I see Oculus Rift and Rift S for 100 euros or HTC Vive for more or less 130 euros. I wanted to know if they&#39;re good choices for PC VR gaming in 2025. I have a PC that could handle them (Ryzen 5 9600x &amp; RX 9060 XT 16 GB) or would you recommend a used Quest 2 or Quest 3s for PC VR?

My current price range is around $900, and while I&#39;d like to wait until Valve posts more details, I get the feeling it&#39;ll be nearer the upper end of my budget. Full body tracking is really interesting to me, but not a must get, I&#39;m mostly curious what pricing looks like because there seem to be a wide variety of options and I&#39;ve no clue what might end up working with the Frame. My PC is powerful enough that I&#39;d like to run things off of it as opposed to the headset most of the time. What things should I know? Are there any easy to recommend bundles that just go together? Would I need base stations for full body tracking even with the Frame&#39;s IR still picking up the controllers at odd angles?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Have you ever tried copying an old 3D film? I bought Shrek 3D and it&#39;s copied itself really strangely. It&#39;s not inline at all. 2D works perfectly but 3D looks wrong. I have no idea if it&#39;s because it&#39;s an older 3D film but each eye is not in line with each other. Has anyone else tried copying an older 3D film and had the same problem? I use makeMKV and save it as an MKV file. I&#39;ve never had this problem before and I wonder if the film is just incompatible with the Quest 3 for example</p> <p>I was watching on a Quest 3 using 4KVR which works really well normally</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CupcakeLikesTheStock\"> /u/CupcakeLikesTheStock </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1p9dn6o/copying_old_3d_films_that_used_to_have_red_blue/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1p9dn6o/copying_old_3d",
