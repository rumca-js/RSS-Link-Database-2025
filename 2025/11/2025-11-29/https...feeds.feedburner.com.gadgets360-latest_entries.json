Their key advance is an aluminium electrode embedded in a gallium\u2013indium alloy, allowing it to \u201ccrackle\u201d and self-heal under strain as liquid metal fills emerging gaps. Alongside this, a newly designed stretchy conductive polymer maintains electrical performance while repeatedly flexed. Together, these materials enable durable, flexible OLED screens suited for future wearables, medical patches, implantable sensors and bendable consumer devices.",

        "description": "Resetting your UPI PIN in Google Pay is now easier, even if you don\u2019t have your debit card. Google Pay supports Aadhaar-based verification for many banks, allowing you to reset your PIN as long as your Aadhaar is linked to your mobile number. This is especially helpful if your card is lost or unavailable. Not all banks offer this option yet, but where supported, the process is quick and hassle-free. The guide walks you through each step so you can resume payments smoothly.",
