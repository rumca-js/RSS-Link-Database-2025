        "description": "Asylum seekers will be banned from using taxis for medical appointments from February, the government has announced.\n\nIt comes after a BBC investigation found some people had travelled long distances by taxis or minicabs, with one asylum seeker saying they went on a 250-mile cab journey to a GP, costing the Home Office \u00a3600.\n\nIn response, the government launched an urgent review into the use and cost of taxis to transfer asylum seekers from their hotels to appointments in September.\n\nNow the government has confirmed it has spent an average of around \u00a315.8 million per year on transport for asylum seekers.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

A further 79 were injured and dozens remain unaccounted for.\n \nEight people have been arrested on suspicion of corruption over the renovation works the blocks had been undergoing. Three others were detained on manslaughter charges.\n \nThe cause of the fire has yet to be determined, but officials have said it spread up and between the blocks rapidly because of flammable materials placed on their exterior.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#HongKong #BBCNews",
