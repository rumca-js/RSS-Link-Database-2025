        "description": "<p>A new edition of the iconic Warhammer Quest board games is always something rather special. After Blackstone Fortress and Cursed City, 2025 sees the return of the series. But Warhammer Quest: Darkwater does quite a few things differently: A flat-lay map book instead of tiles, ability cards instead of dice, and a brand-new optional skirmish mode. Whether all these changes come together, and whether they justify the eye-watering price tag, is what we\u2019ll be exploring in this review, along with a look at the gorgeous miniatures and their sprues.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/11/review-warhammer-quest-darkwater/\">Review: Warhammer Quest: Darkwater</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
