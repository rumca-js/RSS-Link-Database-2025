And there are good reasons why. Its cameras are fantastic, the battery life is better than ever, and they have double the storage space compared to last year.\n\nBut in the midst of all this excitement, I can\u2019t help but point out a few things about Apple's iPhone 17 Pro that bothers me, and I don\u2019t think are getting enough attention.",
