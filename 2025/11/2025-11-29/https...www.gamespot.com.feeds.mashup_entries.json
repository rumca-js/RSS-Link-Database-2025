But if those folks aren't your speed, fortunately, there are six other skins on the Season 1 battle pass that you can enjoy.</p><p>Four of those skins are just regular humans, including a skater girl named Carina who has blue hair and a cast on her right wrist, who's sure to be an instant favorite.

        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, Kill Bill, was famously so long that it was split into two separate movies: Kill Bill Volume 1 and its sequel, Volume 2, released about half a year apart back in the early aughts. Soon, it'll celebrate a re-release, Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, which stitches the movies back together and adds new scenes, too. But even a movie of its length has scenes left on the cutting room floor. Using Epic's Unreal Engine, Tarantino is closing a chapter of his career that's been more than 20 years in the making.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Totally separate from the new scenes found within The Whole Bloody Affair, The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge is a roughly 10-minute scene built in Unreal Engine that brings together the Kill Bill series and, unexpectedly--or perhaps not--<a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/\">Fortnite</a>.
