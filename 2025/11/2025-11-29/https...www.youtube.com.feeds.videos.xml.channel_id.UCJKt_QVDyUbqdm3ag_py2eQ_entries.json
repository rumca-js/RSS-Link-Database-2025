Playback using SND Player v1.51. Brainworx VST effects applied.\n\nSTe hardware has its issues, mine is not an exception. The infamous DAC whistle was removed using iZotope RX 6 spectral de-noiser. Crackling during DMA audio playback, while not 100% eliminated, got improved dramatically after applying Exxos STE DAC CRACKLES POP FIX (additional grounding for U500 and U501 via bodge wires).",
