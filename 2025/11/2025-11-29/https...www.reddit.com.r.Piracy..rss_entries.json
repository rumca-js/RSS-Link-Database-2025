I freaked out, because I checked and indeed, it works with my other Spotify account. But when I checked my account on the official website and app, it was fine? My playlists are in place and I can turn on music. What is this? Has anyone encountered this? Should I freak out??? What should I do? Is this even the right place to post this???</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/According-Passage405\"> /u/According-Passage405 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1p9xm6h/is_my_spotify_account_bannedblacklisted_for_using/\">[link]</a></span",

Now I thought maybe 1dm+ might be cooked so I tried soul and then aloha and then lj downloader and every single time the download failed or stopped. I thought maybe these sites might have blocked these downloaders cause I can still download normally and fully from anime piracy sites. Then I decided to stream from these sites and it literally has tids and bits missing inside the video itself, which explains why the downloads were failing in the first place. This means there&#39;s something wrong with these hosting sites and not the downloaders. I used vpn too but it was still the same. Can anybody else confirm it too cause it&#39;s annoying as hell.
