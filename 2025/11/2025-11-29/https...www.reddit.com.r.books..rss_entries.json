I went in expecting something mid to hold me over until I get back to my main reads, but this thing hooked me way harder than expected.</p> <p>Deeplight felt different. It has this strange, heavy atmosphere where the ocean feels alive in more ways than one, almost like a character that\u2019s been watching you the whole time. The entire setting has this eerie, sunken-god energy that reminded me of the video game Dredge, and I mean that as a compliment. That same vibe of \u201cthe sea is hiding something ancient and hungry\u201d is all over this book. Not full horror, but definitely unsettling in a way that kept me turning pages at 2AM.</p> <p>The characters were surprisingly solid too.

Fantasy, sci-fi, romance, thrillers, magical realism \u2014 I\u2019m happy to explore anything that brings back that spark.</p> <p>If you have a book that made you fall in love with reading (or fall in love with it all over again), I\u2019d be grateful if you shared it.
