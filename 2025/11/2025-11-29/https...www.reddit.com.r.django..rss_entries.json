A few people asked about attachments and whether the backend could run fully on its own, so I added two new things.</p> <h1>1. File uploads with signed PUT URLs (GCS)</h1> <p>You can now upload attachments directly in a room.<br/> The backend generates a signed PUT URL and the file goes straight to GCS, so the server never handles the upload payload. if you don&#39;t configure GCS, it will fallback to direct file upload into the static dir.</p> <h1>2. Standalone backend UI</h1> <p>The backend now has its own simple UI that works without the separate frontend.<br/> This is mainly for people who want to drop a chat module into an existing ERP or dashboard without wiring up a full React app. It uses htmx + alpine js.</p> <p>You can try that version here:<br/> <a href=\"https://chat-backend.mnaveedk.com/\">https://chat-backend.mnaveedk.com</a></p> <p>Just a he",

The DX is in many ways better now with min apis being function based compared to the mess that is DRF and class based nonsense therein, it&#39;s refreshing that a language like C# which you&#39;d think would be abusing classes is actually more ergonomic than DRF for writing apis. </p> <p>I&#39;m just a bit confused by the auth story in .NET - but my gut feeling is most places will be using AD which will have a good story for managing AUTH. </p> <p>I don&#39;t think the django templates + htmx is a viable alternative to a good react SPA + solid backend serving json. </p> <p>Anyone made the jump with 10? I&#39;m missing hot code reloading, it takes a minute to restart the process because it has to compile first but maybe i&#39;ll get used to that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/tuskerr\"> /u/tuskerr </a> <br/> <span",
