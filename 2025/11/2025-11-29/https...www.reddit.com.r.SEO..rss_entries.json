The guy has been really communicative and has seemed incredibly knowledgeable on what he is doing so I didnt have any concerns. A few days ago my web guy who handles my hosting and the one who built my site reached out to say he noticed a huge increase in backlinks and sent me a whole report that the strategy the SEO guy was using is toxic and needs to be stopped immediately. I forwarded the email to the SEO guy and he completely disavows the web guy. So basically I don&#39;t know who to believe and need a 3rd party who can really tell me whats going on. They clearly both want my SEO business but I am very concerned now because I am a small business and these dollars REALLY need to count. Is there a way someone could help me determine what the real story is?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OkCelebrat",

Does ubersuggest really suck or does the dude just suck?</p> <p>2) page optimizer pro is from Kyle Roof dude is a legend, so does that make his software awesome?</p> <p>3) any other ones out there? Ah refs and Semrush keep popping up but they are pretty expensive, any thoughts?</p> <p>4) Adobe just bought Semrush apparently, is that a good or a bad thing in your opinion and why?</p> <p>5) Lastly, I will eventually do a side biz for small businesses helping them with SEO like im doing for mine because call me crazy but its addictive and fun af to see your pages and numbers climbing the ranks. </p> <p>6) lastly because im in Taiwan I need dual language keywords, specifically English and ",
