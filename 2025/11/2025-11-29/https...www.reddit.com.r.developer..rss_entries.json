I&#39;m a full stack developer with frontend being my strong point. I&#39;m thinking about transition to either DevOps or GenAI but confused about what should pursue. GenAI is completely new for me but Devops i know containerization, cloud etc so less preparation required for me but i see 3-5 yeara of experience required on all the job listing so need some suggestion from you guys. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Malyaj\"> /u/Malyaj </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1p9gxxf/need_a_suggestion_on_transitioning_from_developer/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1p9gxxf/need_a_suggestion_on_transitioning_from_developer/\">[comments]</a></span>",
