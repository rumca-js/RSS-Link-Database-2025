I had epubs of the books he was looking for so I looked into setting up a plex like service for ebooks. I have Kavita running in a docker container on my MacBook Pro (I\u2019m actively looking for a Mac mini to leave at home to serve plex, kavita and other stuff but currently just have my laptop which I also bring to work). </p> <p>When I\u2019m at work all ports are basically locked down so I use proton vpn which keeps a random port open for me. I tried setting up NGINX with a little script and it was working great except that NGINX broke the epub images no matter what. We are talking about 12 hours of trouble shooting through muddling around myself, tutorials and also 2 different AI assistants (Docker\u2019s AI agent and Chat GPT). Funny enough ChatGPT seems to be better at configurations but no matter what NGINX continued to break the images. ",

I host a few game servers and other services for a tiny community of friends. After updates the servers sometimes needed a restart and I was not always around to do it. We wanted a way for a few trusted people to restart containers without giving them full access to the host. Out of that little problem DDC was born. Over time it grew a lot and with the 2.1 releases it became a tool I am genuinely proud of and something I now use every day to manage my own Docker setup.</p> <p>In short DDC lets you control your Docker containers directly from Discord. You can start, stop and restart containers, check their status, view live logs, manage configuration and use a web dashboard for deeper control. Everything stays inside Discord where your community already communicates, and DDC integrates cleanly with any type of Docker work",

I have Seafile installed and working, but the app never successfully connects to the server. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve tried at least one other and failed.
