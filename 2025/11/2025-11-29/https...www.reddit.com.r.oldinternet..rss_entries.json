So the cops moves the cop car a bit behind and the serial killers were moving a bit infront of them, then, they all stopped and the cops asks them if they can put a song in the radio of the cop car, and they point as if they said yes, here is the funny part, the serial killers dances super cool and they surprised the cops and they also danced XD, after of many funny songs and dances, well the cops had to go home and they said goodbye to the serial killers and they returned the goodbye with their hands. All this happened in one night.</p> <p>I hope you all can find that video, it was so nostalgic.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SmallEconomics6173\"> /u/SmallEconomics61",
