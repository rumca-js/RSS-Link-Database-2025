As a sidearm it works well, but I am yet to discover whom or what gave it the tone it has.</p> <p>Secondly, no, I do not use essential oils for my blade, my gold reserves cannot stand such trivialities and from my master&#39;s experience it is not so worth it.</p> <p>Additionally, we should give more props to druids these times around. One gave me this bark piece that empowers my wand! (The lower one, upper one&#39;s my teacher&#39;s).
