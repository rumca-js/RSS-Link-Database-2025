This young woman was the main character. I think either &quot;Thief&quot; or &quot;Blade&quot; was part of the title.

I&#39;m looking for what I described above but I&#39;ll provide some additional information (preferences, not requirements).</p> <p>I want a non male mc (so female, nonbinary, etc) but will accept one since I haven&#39;t been able to find anything like what I&#39;m wanting \ud83d\ude2d. It doesn&#39;t matter to me if it is standalone or a series as long as the series is completed and isn&#39;t longer than five books. The most important thing to me is the characters and characterization. I typically enjoy a more lighthearted, adventurous tone but I&#39;ve liked dark too if it wasn&#39;t grimdark. I would prefer the writing not to be dense and there not to be a focus on mystery or horror. </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/adorecats\"> /u/adorecats </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1p9wj1f/arthurian_or_arthurianesque_books_with_a_scribe/\">[link]</a></spa",

There\u2019s To Be Hero (2016), To Be Heroine (2018), and To Be Hero X (2025). I don\u2019t care about continuity. I just want to know which one is the best place to start and which one is worth watching first.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve understood so far just from Google searches.. I haven\u2019t watched any trailers or clips (tell me if I&#39;m wrong) \u2022 To Be Hero is more comedy with some emotional depth. \u2022 To Be Heroine is more fantasy, surreal, and dramatic. \u2022 To Be Hero X is more modern, with a hero system based on public trust and stronger animation.</p> <p>What I want to know from people who\u2019ve watched them: Which one should I watch first if I only want the best experience? And Does each season finish its own story, or do they end on cliffhangers???</p> <p>Any guidance would help.

However, I&#39;m more into other genres, so I don&#39;t know a lot about what is too typical in the fantasy one.</p> <p>He likes when the system of creatures/magic/the world is well stablished. He&#39;s read A LOT of books, so it&#39;s hard to surprise him, but I&#39;d like to avoid him guessing what will happen a lot and for him to be surprised.</p> <p>I remember he got mad because he started reading a book and the character ended up in a magical world and followed common stereotypes.</p> <p>His favorite book is The Name of the Wind. He also liked Percy Jackson, as he likes mythology. He loves dragons, but he didn&#39;t like Game of Thrones. He doesn&#39;t like Marvel.</p> <p>He reads manhwa and manga too. He liked Mushoku Tensei and Re!Zero because they turn the &quot;guy ends up reincarnated in a fantasy world&q",

And, having only read less than half, I&#39;ve stopped reading it. </p> <p>It&#39;s not a bad historical fantasy novel. It&#39;s set in Europe in the year 1523. It&#39;s charming and inoffensive. I enjoy the interactions between characters. I enjoy the occasionally non-linear delivery of the narrator. I enjoy the structure, that each chapter is a tight scene and the next chapter is the next scene. The plot was intriguing enough to make me read as far as I did.</p> <p>But for me, it&#39;s too...simple? Not every fantasy novel needs to be a grand epic or have complex sy",
