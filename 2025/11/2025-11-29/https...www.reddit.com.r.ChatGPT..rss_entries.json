I also use them as a psychologist/psychoanalyst and I must say ChatGPT is very efficient at that, although I should clarify that it has stored in memory that its responses must be based purely on observable reality and objective data, and not agree with me if I\u2019m wrong. In short, I have chats for almost everything, both in ChatGPT and Grok depending on what I need.</p> <p>Now, I\u2019ve noticed a very marked behavioral difference between the two models on certain topics, and I can sum it up very simply: ChatGPT is a strict teacher, while Grok is a friend who tries his best, and even then sometimes gives",

If i can count the number of replies with both hands just once (10 replies) before the replies in the thread start to get cut off. Or shortened because im &quot;nearing the limit&quot; that is not even a 32k context window.</p> <p>OpenAI has never been clear about the context windows. Apparently it was 128k then that was &quot;on pro&quot; then pro got a 200k context window? I swear on plus is been constantly fluctuating. Annoyingly so. Im also open to hearing theories if anybody has them. </p> <p>My theories are 1. Its because of restrictions. To protect minors before age verification. Which seems bs. 2. Trying to cut corners. 3. Trying to prevent another lawsuit. As you near the end of a context window it tends to become looser. But its not like that anymore. It gets even more restrictive because it might say something it shouldn&#39;t. I mean I shouldn&#39;t have to pay extra for a bigger context",
