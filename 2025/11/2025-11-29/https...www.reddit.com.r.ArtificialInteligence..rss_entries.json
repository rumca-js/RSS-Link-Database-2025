Their training is costly, slow and gradual, requiring billions of repetitions. In stark contrast, animals continuously adapt to the ever-changing contingencies in their environments. This is particularly important for social species, where behavioural policies and reward outcomes may frequently change in interaction with peers. The underlying computational processes are often marked by rapid shifts in an animal\u2019s behaviour and rather sudden transitions in neuronal population activity. Such computational capacities are of growing importance for AI systems operating in the real world, like those guiding robots or autonomous v",

But tech giants and AI startups are warning that a patchwork of state regulations could stifle innovation and even slow America down in the AI race against China. This has set up a battle over <strong>who</strong> gets to regulate AI: Washington or the states? </p> <p>On one side, industry players are urging Congress to <strong>preempt</strong> (override) state AI laws with a single national policy. Supporters like <strong>Meta</strong> (Facebook\u2019s parent) have even launched new political action committees to back candidates who favor \u201cinnovation over regulation\u201d at the state level.

I coded for the first 10 years of my career, and the last 20 have been a mixture of software architecture, management, project management, and program management. &quot;Herding cats&quot; is an apt description. I&#39;ve been blown away by vibe coding (Windsurf is my main jam now.) It seems to me that the need for coders is going away. AI can code so much better and so much faster now. However, for now, it can not architect a large system. It makes very poor choices. And I can get a lot built much faster, but I have to use all I&#39;ve learned in software architecture to get it done. I&#39;m often overriding the AI architecture suggestions.</p> <p>The problem is that I learned to architect software mostly by coding. Also, colleges are still teaching mostly coding in the CSC curriculum and are not adapting.
