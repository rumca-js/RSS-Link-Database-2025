        "description": "I used a new restoration and colorization technique and created sound design for this rare 1917 footage from San Francisco, California, showing everyday scenes of the city\u2019s working-class community. The film captures ironworkers and laborers during a transformative era of industrial growth, when long hours, tough conditions, and rapid urban development shaped daily life. This restored version brings new clarity to the atmosphere of 1917 while remaining faithful to the film\u2019s original character.\n\nVideo Restoration Process:\n\u2714 FPS boosted to 60 frames per second \n\u2714 Image resolution boosted up to HD \n\u2714 Improved video sharpness and brightness \n\u2714 Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)\n\u2714added sound only for the ambiance\n\u2714restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) \n\nPlease, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.\n\nB&W Video Source: A/V Geeks (Prelinger Archives)\n",
