I would like to connect from any device in my LAN to the raspberry to visualize the trend. There is not huge amount of data (I&#39;m planning to see only last 7 days data). I&#39;ve tried with a lot of different solutions: </p> <ol> <li>Grafana, uses too much RAM and CPU,</li> <li>NetData, from a performance point of view it&#39;s ok but it&#39;s not possibile to visualize data from database without integration with pandas,</li> <li> Host a local webpage usign a webserver (Lighttp is the most light which I&#39;ve found) than use chart.js f+ PHP for data visualization. The webserver if heavy on the CPU</li> </ol> <p>Do you have alternatives? I don&#39;t what to purchase a more powerful hardware only for plotting two trends ....</p> </",
