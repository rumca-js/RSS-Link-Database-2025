I\u2019ve tried a bunch of CBD/THC blends before, but these hit a really nice balance\u2014relaxing without knocking me out or giving that weird groggy feeling the next morning.</p> <p>The first thing I noticed was the taste. A lot of hemp gummies taste like straight plant matter, but these actually taste good without being overly sugary. Effects usually kick in for me around the 45-minute mark: warm, calm, noticeably less tension. It\u2019s not a \u201chigh\u201d in the traditional sense\u2014more like my brain finally stops running a million miles an hour.</p> <p>I mainly take them to unwind before bed, and they\u2019ve definitely helped me fall asleep faster and stay asleep. On stressful days, I\u2019ll take half during the day and I get that smooth, steady calm without feeling out of it.</p> <p>You can use coupon code ANDYHEMP to get 20% off as well. ",

The site pulls roles that actually match my experience instead of random filler jobs. I\u2019ve used Indeed, ZipRecruiter, etc., and half the listings are duplicates or already expired. With JobOwl, most of the jobs I applied to were legit and up-to-date. </p> <p>The filtering is super clean too. I could narrow down remote-only positions, salary ranges, and companies without clicking around for 10 minutes. It also seemed to recommend higher-quality roles instead of the generic entry-level spam I get on other boards. </p> <p>It\u2019s not perfect\u2014the UI could be a little more modern\u2014but if you\u2019re job hunting and tired of fighting with overloaded platforms, JobOwl is honestly worth trying.

Calendars are too structured and rigid for that, and most task/to-do apps are just simple/passive loggers.</p> <p>Hence I&#39;ve built one myself and I can say that it has really helped me document my thoughts and todos just by chatting with a smart assistant, which also pushes to me frequent reminders and nudges to get stuff done through my a mobile app. I&#39;ve also done quite a bit of prompting and engineering on this so it feels pretty human and not like a typical dumb chatbot/assistant. This setup is mainly for me currently but I&#39;m curious if anyone faces the same problem and would potentially be interested in trying this out, and I may release a version upcoming!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Afraid_Barracuda_749\"> /u/",
