With the rise &amp; advancement of an Artificial Intelligence era, I also think everything surrounding Linux will become ruined. </p> <p>What do you think? Do you think there will be enough of us to collectively keep all things Linux, free from the clutches of the above-mentioned, or that the developers will just give in after Linus isn&#39;t here &amp; start turning all things Linux into another corrupted corporate soup?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ontheriseRA\"> /u/ontheriseRA </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1p9nr68/linux_after_linus/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.red",

While trying to downgrade to Ubuntu 24, AI directed me to hide the EFI folder in order to force a boot from a thumb drive. Now I only get a white background with a flashing folder and question mark.</p> <p>A few more details, the computer itself is a Mac Pro 5,1 that I loaded with Ubuntu 25 (couldn\u2019t get WiFi to work was the reason to go back to 24).</p> <p>Below is the terminal code that it had me put in:</p> <p>sudo mkdir /boot/efi/EFI-backup sudo mv /boot/efi/EFI/* /boot/efi/EFI-backup/ # moves rEFInd + ubuntu folder sudo reboot</p> <p>I now can\u2019t boot up to anything when holding Option and Option+R for internet recovery doesn\u2019t seem to work.</p> <p>Am I hosed?
