My husband had become controlling, first&nbsp;with money, then with almost everything else: what I wore, who I&nbsp;saw, what I said. It crept up so slowly that I didn\u2019t quite realise what was happening.</p><p>We had met as students in the early 1970s, both from working-class, northern families and feeling slightly out of place at a university full of public school accents. We shared politics, music and a sense of being outsiders together. For years, life felt full of promise. When our first child arrived, I gave up my local government job to stay at home.
