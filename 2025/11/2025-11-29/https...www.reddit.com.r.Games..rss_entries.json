Or does this new installment sully the name?</p> <p>Personally, I enjoyed the game but nowhere near as much as Ninja Gaiden 1 or 2. I think it&#39;s 100% better than 3, but I also think no one is going to disagree there. I think the combat pacing was much faster than the other NG games, and it felt a lot more button-mashy. In previous games, I always felt in control of my combos because button mashers would just get punished by the enemies. That didn&#39;t seem the case this time around. </p> <p>Without spoiling too much, I also felt like Ryu got shafted and I was disappointed they went a similar route as Devil May Cry 4 when it comes to the character swap. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Affectionate_Owl_619\"> /u/Affectionate_Owl_619 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

Jennifer replaced Hellena Taylor, who had been the voice of the character up until then.
