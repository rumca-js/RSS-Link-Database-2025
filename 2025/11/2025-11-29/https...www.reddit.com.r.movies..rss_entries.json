Since the protagonists of those were all men he wanted to see the differences when a woman was put in the main role.[3]</p> <p>P\u00e9rin said he was also inspired by movies in which the protagonist realizes that they are in a conspiracy that is too big for them, such as Three Days of the Condor, All the President&#39;s Men, The Parallax View, Blow Out,",
