        "description": "Sponsor: HAVN BF 360 Flow on Amazon https://geni.us/PRsOyke\nThis Best CPU Coolers of 2025 round-up recaps the top coolers we've tested in the past year. This year, we totally overhauled our testing methodology, and this is the debut of the new charts for that. We silently tested dozens of coolers to put together new lists on the AMD 9800X3D and AMD 9950X3D CPUs. This CPU cooler comparison includes benchmarks of the best air and liquid coolers (AIOs) for thermal performance and noise levels, spanning best overall, best budget or value, and more categories. Thermalright and ID-Cooling have taken spots in the budget range the past few years, but now, Sudokoo and Tryx have entered the ring to put up a fight for the higher-end categories.\n\nWatch our PC Best Cases of 2025 round-up! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gCFdN7J4sk\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\n\nLike our content?
