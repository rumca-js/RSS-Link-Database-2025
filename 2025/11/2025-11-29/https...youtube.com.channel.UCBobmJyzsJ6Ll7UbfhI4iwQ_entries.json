        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, we explore the journey Unreal Engine has been on when it comes to managing large numbers of shaders and long compilation times. \n\nWe begin with an overview of the numerous facets of this problem, and an explanation of how they coalesce to make the lives of rendering engineers and content creators difficult.\n\nFrom there, we deep dive into all of the recent and not-quite-so-recent improvements in this area, using the City Sample as a case study to see the impact of all these changes in a practical example.\n\nFinally, we provide an overview of the next steps in this space, with a peek at various additional engine-level improvements we hope to tackle over the next few versions that will continue to alleviate some of these issues systematically.\n\nYou\u2019ll gain an understanding of the various components of the UE shader system, how they fit together, and all of the recent changes that were introduced to minimize shader compilation and cook tim",

        "description": "In 2019, five Unreal Engine evangelists gathered at Unreal Fest Prague to deliver an ambitious talk: 100 UE4 Tips and Tricks.\n\nDespite their best efforts, they famously ended with only 69 tips, leaving unfinished business.\n\nSince then, the legendary EU evangelism team has scattered, their whereabouts unknown, and their Unreal secrets seemingly lost to time. Now, in 2025, Epic Games\u2019 own Ari Arnbj\u00f6rnsson is determined to finish what they started. \n\nHe's assembling a crew once thought impossible to reunite, pulling together familiar faces and forgotten heroes for one last epic mission: finally sharing 100 tips, plus one more for good measure, in one single unforgettable presentation. \n\nWill Ari succeed in getting the band back together? Can they complete their original mission, or will history repeat itself? \n\nWatch this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm to find out, and witness a legendary reunion. Some debts can only be paid in tips and tricks.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine ",
