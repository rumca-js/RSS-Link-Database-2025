        "description": "This street scam is popping up in New Zealand: fake monks approaching people, handing out charms, and pressuring them into donations. Here\u2019s how the scam works and what to watch out for so you don\u2019t get caught.\n\nThis scam works by giving you a \u201cfree\u201d bracelet to seem friendly. Once you take it, they show a donation sheet and expect around $20. It\u2019s not a real charity! Even without pressure, the whole setup is designed to make you feel obligated. Only donate to registered charities. Stay aware!\n\n#scams #scammers #scam",

If you\u2019ve ever walked through the CBD, Queen Street, or around the Sky Tower, you\u2019ve probably seen this - but most people have no idea it\u2019s a scam until it\u2019s too late.\n\nIn this video, I show you exactly how the scam works, how the scammer approaches you, and the psychological tricks they use to make you hand over money.\n\nThis scam works by giving you a \u201cfree\u201d bracelet to seem friendly. Once you take it, they show a donation sheet and expect around $20. It\u2019s not a real charity! Even without pressure, the whole setup is designed to make you feel obligated. Only donate to registered charities. Stay aware!\n\n\ud83d\udd38 Step 1: The Approach\nThe scammer dresses as a monk, often wearing robes and beads.
