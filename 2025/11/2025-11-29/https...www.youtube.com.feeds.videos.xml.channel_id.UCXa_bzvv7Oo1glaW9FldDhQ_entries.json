        "description": "A sequel to Kirby Air Ride was definitely not something that most of us expected, but Nintendo and Bandai Namco have banded together to bring back the GameCube cult classic with flying colours, in a way that very few would have expected. \n\nKirby Air Riders realizes the full potential of its predecessor, delivering a chaotic, colourful and vibrant experience that is not only overflowing with enough content to keep you hooked for dozens of hours, but is unique and enjoyable enough to make sure that you don\u2019t question whether the time you\u2019re clocking in is time well spent.",

        "description": "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is more than just a long-awaited sequel \u2013 it marks a deliberate shift from its predecessor\u2019s design. Its flow is mysterious, isolated exploration; its structure is one of openness rather than strict, linear design; its combat is reshaped by new, empowering abilities, rather than Corruption\u2019s risky power-ups. \n\nStrategies evolve over time, but with the eighteen-year difference between the two titles, you\u2019d expect a technical overhaul as well. Beyond, whilst demonstrating obvious improvements in fidelity, appears to be positioning itself as a showcase for Switch 2.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of tactile differences between both entries too, traversal modes, control schemes, and scanner integration, and more. This video steps foot into Viewros\u2019 world, with Metroid Prime 3\u2019s interplanetary conflict firmly in the rearview mirror.",

        "description": "Very little, much less sarcasm, should be beneath gamers of today, but seeing Red Dead Redemption re-released for the third year in a row does elicit a chuckle or two. Regardless, Rockstar Games' Wild West classic, inspired by the likes of Unforgiven, The Wild Bunch, and many more, launches on December 2nd for Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2. It's also available for iOS and Android users who have subscribed to Netflix, but seeing the open-world title make the jump to current-gen platforms, one has to wonder what's in store.\n\nFor that matter, what is it about this re-release that spurs some manner of debate, even among those who love the original? We'll dive into all that later, but for now, you can look forward to...",
