        "description": "<p>A Tottenham Hotspur manager\u2019s lot is so rarely a happy one. In record time, Thomas Frank has gone through the gamut of his predecessors, from hope to disappointment to what now looks like hopelessness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/23/arsenal-tottenham-premier-league-match-report\">Demolition by Arsenal</a> had already put him on a sticky wicket. A decent midweek showing in Paris, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/26/paris-saint-germain-tottenham-champions-league-match-report\">amid another defeat</a>, had barely increased his credit rating. Defeat to Fulham, a team with an away record as miserable as Spurs\u2019 home form, only intensified the pressure. Frank being appointed by the departed stewardship of Daniel Levy is to be noted; fresh ownership regimes tend to be trigger happy with the managers they inherit.</p><p>Should such a decision be made, and it still seems a premature outcome considering Frank made slow starts at his previous club",
