And while those boundaries have indeed been pushed, the Xbox finds itself left behind in a world where the PS5 and its Pro versions dominates the race for great games. \n\nWith the loss of several heavy-hitting exclusives and some problems with Game Pass, it's been a difficult few years for Microsoft.
