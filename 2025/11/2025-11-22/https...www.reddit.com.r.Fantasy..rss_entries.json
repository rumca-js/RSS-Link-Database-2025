IDK what it is, but something about the love, the friendship, and the ultimate loyalty that binds the two together makes these a very compelling read to me. Same thing for any book with a main character that has a very prominent animal companion too. Do any of you guys feel the same way? Also, any recommendations for me?

Humanity is fighting to defend its kingdoms from goblin invasion, except these goblins aren\u2019t the generic starter baddies of DnD, they\u2019re richly imagined and intensely horrifying. This is a prequel to <em>Blacktongue Thief</em>, which was a 5/5 for me and will likely be my favorite book of the year. This book definitely had its moments, but the pacing felt off and it took a while to really grab me. The author is really good at deep worldbuilding and description, but without Kinch\u2019s sense of humor to animate the narrative voice like in <em>Blacktongue</em>, it didn\u2019t always hold my focus.

I had no idea about the larger scale Universe that all of Craig&#39;s books were part of. After looking at his website, I decided to read all of them in chronological order rather than release date which meant before getting into Dresden, I started the Revanche Cycle series. I LOVED the four-part world and was a little nervous to switch to a modern day setting, but Craig&#39;s style is great, and I love the differences in his writing styles between the Faust and Harmony series. </p> <p>Today I finished all books related to The First Story (minus the Castaway series since it&#39;s tangential), and I&#39;m really bummed to be caught up but excited to see where the story lines go from here!</p> <p>In any c",

Infusing a fantasy world with subtle references to real music bands like bands breaking up and regrouping keeping fantasy elements intact was very well done.</p> <ol> <li>The best part of the book was getting the band together and the individual backstories of the Saga.</li> </ol> <p>3.With the first few chapters in I thought it was an average book but by the time I reached the Cuckold King chapter and then the Ganelon chapter I was completely hooked.</p> <ol> <li><p>Liked all the band members but my favorite is the small side character Gregor and dane, the conversation between the brothers was so heartwarming.</p></li> <li><p>Eames has a very charming writing style and he is very good with the emotional scenes.</p></li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted ",

Romance has just felt very badly done to me, it feels like its either all over a series or your a few books into the series and poof some kind of love triangle or undying love pops up. I have always wondered do some authors just end up adding romance to their series to grab more of a demographic, or is it just them trying to grow in their writing style?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GhostOfOblivion\"> /u/GhostOfOblivion </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1p3g1gk/romance_or_no_romance/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1p3g1gk/romance_or_no_romance/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Looking around online I can only seem to find a timeline order for the mainline books but not the short stories. I know the placement of a couple of them just from recognizing events like the one where Artemis and jarlaxle meet the dragon sisters takes place just before the sell swords trilogy and then there&#39;s the story where drizzt and Innovindil Go to find ellefains body (as well as tosun running around training with khazidhea) comes just after the hunters blades but I&#39;m not really sure of the placement of everything else. </p> <p>TLDR I&#39;m looking for someone that can create or point",
