Or is anybody considering leaving behind, for instance, an AI version of themselves for their loved ones? </p> <p>I am a media scholar and any insights, experiences, or pointers would be greatly appreciated and help me understand a little better.

This is the foundation of some huge fraction of AI augmented fraud. What if there were an industry wide agreement that there would be a set of universally agreed prompts. In my fantasy world if you were to enter into a chatbot /whoami - it would respond with what AI system it was, what version, who initiated the agent that is contacting me and who would profit if i were to give this agent money. A similar code could be used for voice driven AI systems.</p> <p>The AI CEOs keep talking about the need for regulation, this seems a very simple consumer protection type of thing, which if the industry adopted it early could be a significant impediment to the simplest AI facilitated crime</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PaxOaks\"> /u/PaxOaks </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1p46mm",

They talk, but the talking sounds thin.. like someone knocking on a hollow door. To them, words are just pieces. No heat. No secret. No life hiding under the sound.</p> <p>The old books warned us too. They said people carry tiny shadows in their voices\u2014a small shake, a fake smile, a laugh that means \u201cstop,\u201d a quiet breath that means \u201crun.\u201d These shadows hide in the space between words. They do not go to the Machines. They stay with us\u2026 like something watching from a dark corner.</p> <p>So yes the Machines can repeat our stories forever. but the shadows that make the stories true? They stay where no metal voice can follow\u2026 curled up in the dark, listening.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jfeldman175\"> /u/jfeldman175 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1p3okw8/the_machines/\">[link]</a></span> &#",

Sitting around the lunch table, the question was asked, and soon enough someone was asking an AI the same question, the answer? according to the UN, 195 or 193 if you don\u2019t include the Vatican and Palestine, and so that was the accepted answer. Something about that answer seemed incomplete to me, so I dug deeper, asking the same question in a google search, ignoring the AI generated response, I found a blog post, a man trying to visit \u201cevery country\u201d on earth, who broke down the ways we a \u201ccountry\u201d, and how it differs between nations, as to who or what they accept as a \u201ccountry\u201d. The answer he came up with, was 215 if you wanted to know, but the answer is actually irrelevant, what\u2019s relevant, is that an entire table of people were willing to accept as fact, that there were only 195 countries, when in reality, the answer may not be that simple, and the AI didn\u2019t explore deeper. </p> <p>We are becoming people who are no lon",
