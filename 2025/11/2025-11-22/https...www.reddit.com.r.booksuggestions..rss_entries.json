It can be a queer romance but thats not necessarily a make or break point just that it opens up the possibilities.</p> <p>Also can&#39;t be a series.

Since I don\u2019t know Russian or French, I don\u2019t mind reading Crime and Punishment or Les Miserables in Spanish (my first language), but I do know English. In fact, I\u2019ve read books in English before, but very modern ones, mostly science fiction, fantasy and history. So, as a personal challenge and as a way to improve my English (and because English versions are cheaper than a good Spanish translation), I want to try to read, dictionary in hand, English/Scottish/American/Irish classics in their original language. What I\u2019d like is to start with more approachable authors and novels and then progressively get into more challenging reads. That\u2019s where I need your help. I\u2019d really appreciate if you could give me a sort of ranking ",

So my mom wants a book every christmas and I am running out of ideas, maybe you can help.</p> <p>She LOOOOVES Stephen King and really enjoys crime novels (Jo Nesbo, Jussi Adler-Olsen). In her library you&#39;d obviously also find Simon Beckett, Sebastian Fitzek, Dan Brown and the lot, so this whole thriller/crime/suspense/horror-ish literature. I already gifted her the Blue Rose Trilogy by Peter Straub, and Boy&#39;s Life by Robert R. McCammon and she liked both (at least she told me haha). She explicitly said she wants something bloody to get cozy during the winter.</p> <p>Does anyone have any suggestions what she might also like? As I am not living at home anymore I don&#39;t exactly know which books she got already but I am sure it&#39;s primarily the most popular books/authors (like listed above) so more niche suggestions would be nice.

It doesn\u2019t have to be science fiction specifically, but I do like a good dystopian setting. I am open to anything though!

Aside from the rest of the books in that series, are there any other books with a similar background that she may enjoy? Or any authors for me to look into? I\u2019m also not familiar with the fantasy genre, so any suggestions would be really appreciated!! Thank you in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Bitter_Fruit2266\"> /u/Bitter_Fruit2266 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p3fe3o/looking_for_a_book_for_my_girlfriend/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p3fe3o/looking_for_a_book_for_my_girlfriend/\">[comments]</a></span>",
