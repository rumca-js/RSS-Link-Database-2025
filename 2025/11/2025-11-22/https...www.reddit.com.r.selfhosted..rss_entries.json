My goal is to finally ditch icloud completely and run more services like TrueNAS, Nextcloud, Plex, Immich, and Jellyfin. I&#39;ve learned that starting this project with an ARM-based processor was really ambitious. I want to know what is actually reasonable to run on my pi until I can get more equipment.</p> <p>What additional hardware should I get? </p> <p>Also is there an affordable mini PC that can support TrueNas?

I also have a VM for Nginx, so I expose my Forgejo instance under my subdomain (git.mydomain.me).</p> <p>I&#39;m having issues with SSH. I tried both with and without using the built-in SSH server it provides. What happens is that, after configuring the SSH key from my main PC on my Forgejo instance under my subdomain, when trying to SSH into it, either for cloning or just testing the connection, it will actually ask for a password because it tries to connect to the user git on the <a href=\"http://git.mydomain.me\">git.mydomain.me</a>, which clearly isn&#39;t the behavior I&#39;m expecting.</p> <p>Has anyone any idea that could help me?

When i got it, i upgraded with 2x Xeon 2660 v4 and 192GB ram and 4x 10gb ethernet. I used it as a gameserver for a short period of time, but i switched to a 14th gen intel desktop computer. So its currenty just collecting dust. It has 16 2,5\u201d bays, but ive have no use for this as a backup server, media or anything like that. </p> <p>Im kinda new to homelabbing, but im set up with backup, media, vpn, gameserver and so on.

I am trying to create a centralised, redundant private cloud that is accessible from the outside to manage backups, media, photos, videos, and a Minecraft server. The main goal is to use open source software as much as possible to avoid depending on licences. As for hardware, I am considering using Proxmox and SSDs instead of HDDs to reduce energy consumption. On the software front, I plan to use Immich for photo/video library management, Jellyfin for media streaming, and a VPN (Tailscale, Wireguard VPN, or OPENVPN) to connect remotely and automatically back up photos, similar to Google Photos. In addition, I would like to leverage the power of my RTX4070Ti to run a small LLM that automatically tags photos and videos, making them easier to categorise. However, I have some doubts about the hardware. I would like a low-power, quiet mini PC, but I&#39;m not sure which is the best choice. I&#39;ve seen the Zimaboard recommended, but I don",

Most tutorials I find online are using multiple VMs on the same hardware. I am wondering if it would be better to use multiple hardware hosts.
