It took ages to load a game and disc drive was very noisy. i began to save money on my first gaming rig, Atari 2600 . how proud i was. when super Nintendo launched an uncle gifted us this for Christmas. it came with super mario world, pilotwings and illusion of time with a big physical walkthrough guide. later i bought them street fighter games . my brother and i were gaming the hell out of these games. but, we were only allowed to when at grandparents&#39; . so we really looked forward to be at their house. i think i was like 13 years old when mother told us to buy a pc. it was a 486, 40 m",
