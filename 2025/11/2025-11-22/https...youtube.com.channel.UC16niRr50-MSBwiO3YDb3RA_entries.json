Others come across as vague and imprecise.\n \nThe US is keen to press ahead fast under an \"aggressive timeline\" with this draft, with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Ukraine #BBCNews",
