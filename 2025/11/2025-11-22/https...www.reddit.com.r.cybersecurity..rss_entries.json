On one hand, it\u2019s a big milestone. On the other, I don\u2019t want to accidentally make myself look like a \u201cbrand new entry-level\u201d candidate.</p> <p>For context, I\u2019ve been working in IT &amp; Cybersecurity while finishing school (both as a specialist and an instructor), and I also serve in the Air Force Reserve for information systems (did 2 years active duty). I\u2019m not coming in with zero experience. I\u2019ve got about 6 years of experience under my belt along with certs, but I\u2019m overthinking whether posting the graduation will cause recruiters or hiring managers to assume I\u2019m inexperienced just because I\u2019m officially a new grad.</p> <p>For those who\u2019ve been in similar shoes; especially people who worked in IT or cyber before finishing the degree; did posting your graduation help or hurt? Did it affect how recruiters reached out to you?</p>",
