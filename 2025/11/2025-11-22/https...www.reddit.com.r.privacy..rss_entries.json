The company they use is <a href=\"https://www.smartdna.com.au/\">https://www.smartdna.com.au/</a> who have very little about data privacy on their website. Given I&#39;m working with a practitioner, I&#39;m wondering about doing this anonymously and having them order/send it back for me, so I don&#39;t have to identify myself. But I feel like there are probably still major risks to having my DNA registered anywhere, even if not tied to my details. I&#39;ve been told it would be a &quot;functional genomics test&quot; where only a select few genes are actually tested. Does this make a difference at all? I&#39;m erring on the side of just not risking it but would appreciate some input, thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted b",
