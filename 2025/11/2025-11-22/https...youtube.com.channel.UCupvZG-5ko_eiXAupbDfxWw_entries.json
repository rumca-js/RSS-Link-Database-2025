        "description": "Video from Immigration and Customs Enforcement shows federal agents in a car chase in Charlotte, North Carolina. The chase began when federal officers approached 24-year-old Miguel Angel Garcia Martinez, and he drove away, according to a news release from the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of North Carolina. Martinez then allegedly rammed his van into a government vehicle carrying four officers, according to the news release. CNN has not independently verified this claim. The Department of Homeland Security posted on X that one officer was injured. Martinez was federally charged in Charlotte, according to the news release. His lawyer declined CNN\u2019s request for comment.\n\n#CNN #News #ICE #Charlotte",

The family says that eight minutes after leaving the hospital, she gave birth to a baby girl in their car on the side of the road. In a statement, the hospital's president Raymond Grady apologized to Wells saying the hospital staff \"failed to listen\" to her concerns and that they have taken steps to address \"what failed in our hospital.\" Grady says the doctor and nurse involved in the case no longer work there, and that all pregnant patients will be examined by a physician before they leave the hospital. \n\nCNN \"First of All\" anchor Victor Blackwell speaks with Mercedes Wells, her husband Leon Wells and their attorney Cannon Lambert. #CNN #News",
