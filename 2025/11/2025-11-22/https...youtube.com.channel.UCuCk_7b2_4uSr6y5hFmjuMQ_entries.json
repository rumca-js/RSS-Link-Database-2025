Jordan and Ryan Coogler, and they break down choosing between Smoke and Stack, the film's crossroads inspiration, the ambitious juke joint sequence, and a possible Sinners comic.\n\nWe unpack the Sinners' ending and how horror worlds like Event Horizon, Creepshow, The Monster Squad, and The Lost Boys could thrive in comics.\n\nWe also had a Legendary Comics conversation on adapting Pacific Rim, Frankenstein, Dracula, the MonsterVerse, and why monsters like Godzilla and Kong endure as powerful, emotionally rich icons.\n\nChapters\n00:36 \u2013 Michael B.
