The fork worked better \u2014 search was faster, results were more reliable, and it actually made sense to use.</p> <p>But maintaining a fork is painful.

My name is Karan, and today I want to share ten bad programming habits that every developer should avoid. Let\u2019s get straight into it!</p> <ol> <li>Not Grasping the Fundamentals</li> </ol> <p>To become a truly good developer, you need to master the basics. Don\u2019t skip ahead to advanced features without understanding the foundation. For example, if you\u2019re learning Python, make sure you really understand classes, methods, and objects. In Java, know how abstract classes and interfaces work. Without solid fundamentals, moving forward will always be tough.</p> <h1>2. Not Practicing Enough</h1> <p>You can\u2019t become a good programmer just by watching tutorials or taking courses. Practice is key. Make a GitHub account and upload your projects. This builds your portfolio and shows employers you\u2019re motivated and capable. Remember, just watching isn\u2019t enough \u2014 start coding alongside the lessons so you actually learn.</p> </div><",
