        "description": "Scientists at Georgia Tech have created an AI technique that pre-trains exoskeleton controllers using existing human motion datasets, removing the need for lengthy lab-based retraining. The system predicts joint behavior and assistance needs, enabling controllers that work as well as hand-tuned versions. This advance accelerates prototype development and could improve robotic exosuits, prosthetics, and mobility aids for amputees, stroke survivors, and workers who need strength and fatigue reduction.",
