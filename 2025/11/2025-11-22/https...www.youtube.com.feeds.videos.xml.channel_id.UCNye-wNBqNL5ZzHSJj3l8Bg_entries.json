A vehicle was struck by drone missiles, killing five people in the heart of Gaza City.\n\nHe adds that there are seven critically injured Palestinians, including children, at al-Shifa Hospital, which is acutely short of medical supplies.\n\nHe reports that this attack occurred in an area for displaced families who have returned recently after the ceasefire. This happened not far from where we\u2019re reporting, just a couple of hundred metres away. It\u2019s a busy area with lots of street vendors, and many people were passing by when the attack happened, maximising the number of casualties.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\n Download AJE Mobile Ap",

        "description": "A spotlight on the first-ever G20 Summit held on African soil, hosted by South Africa amid complex global tensions and rising international challenges. The summit is marked by the notable absence of key world leaders, including China\u2019s president and US President Donald Trump, influencing discussions and the prospects of reaching a unified final declaration.\n\nThe main issues on the agenda include the war in Ukraine, the escalation in Gaza, crises in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the broader question of global inequality. The summit also highlights the demands of the Global South for stronger representation in shaping international decisions.\n\nAn overview of the pressure South Africa faces to ensure the summit\u2019s success, the possibility of resorting to a Chair\u2019s Statement instead of a joint declaration, and the anticipation surrounding the United States taking over the G20 presidency next year under Trump\u2019s unpredictable stance toward the summit\u2019s outcomes.\n\nAl Jaz",
