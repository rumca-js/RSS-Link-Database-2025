While some of these landscapes melt your heart, some will give you the chills.\n\nDo not fear though; at the end of the day, you will have a heck of a good time viewing a variety of beauties, listening to haunting music, and a real talent of a voice actor.\n\nIn this pure walking simulator, there is an intro and an outro chapter, and between these two, you will have to find hidden black foxes at the end of each scene. All you have to do is to keep your eyes open for every detail.\n\nIf you have an hour to take a no-sweat walk from vistas to vistas, wait no more.
