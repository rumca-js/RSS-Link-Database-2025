When I click the update button it runs the script to update it, It says that it has been successfully updated, but the containers are still the same. So far it hasn&#39;t been a big issue but now Plex isn&#39;t updating either and its causing me to to be able to remote stream due to the older version. I originally thought the issue was that i have docker containers running in a GluetunVPN docker container network but now it is happening to containers outside as well. I really don&#39;t want to start from scratch because that would be a massive headache. Any assistance would be helpful because I cant seem to figure out how to update.</p> <p>Docker version: 27.0.3</p> <p>Operating system: Unraid 7.0.0</p> <p>Plex container log:</p> <p>[s6-init] making user provided files available at /var/run/s6/etc...exited 0.</p> <p>[s6-init] ensuring user provided files have correct perms...exited 0.</p> <p>[",
