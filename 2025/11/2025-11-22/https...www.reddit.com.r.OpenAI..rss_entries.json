It only works if I very precisely select just the text itself. If the selection includes a bit outside the text area, it fails.

I suspect that at some point most if not all users will get such an email (except for perhaps those lucky few who have somehow already been flagged as being over 18). This is very likely tied in with the upcoming release of OpenAI&#39;s much-vaunted &quot;adult mode.&quot; OpenAI will instruct ChatGPT to assume that all users are under 18 unless the user provides proof otherwise. If proof is not produced, the user&#39;s experience on ChatGPT will be restricted to the &quot;kid version.&quot; This will give OpenAI better legal protection against sue-happy parents in the future.</p> <p>That all seems very clear at this point.
