Secondly, what happens if you go to watch those streams and an obscene, if not illegal ad (so anything that&#39;s hate speech, terrorism, nudity, or God forbid, CSAM) pops up? I use Firefox and have an adblocker set up on my laptop. However, sometimes I&#39;d rather watch those streams on my phone on the bed, and I&#39;m stuck using Google Chrome. Not only that, but when you&#39;re fixated on watching the stream, sometimes you won&#39;t even notice the ads until after the period ends, so it&#39;ll take a while to close them. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Beaivimon\"> /u/Beaivimon </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1p3fflu/questions_about_streaming_sports_games_on_a/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1p3fflu/questions_about_streaming_sports_g",
