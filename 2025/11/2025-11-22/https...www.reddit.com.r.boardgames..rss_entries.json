So I was hoping experienced players could tell me, please : </p> <ol> <li><p>Do we often have clues / context that helps us make an informed decision during our turn?</p></li> <li><p>Are we able to steer our character toward the main goal, or is it more like &quot;all roads lead to Rome&quot; where no matter our choices we&#39;ll eventually get there, provided we&#39;re not exhausted first? Or even worse, is it just pure chance, and we&#39;re not supposed to focus on the main objective and should just enjoy the journey?</p></li> </ol> </div><!-- ",
