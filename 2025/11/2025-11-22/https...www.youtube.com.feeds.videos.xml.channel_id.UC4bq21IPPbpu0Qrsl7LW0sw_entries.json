        "description": "Meta now grades employees on how much AI they use.\n\nMeta introduced a new AI driven impact metric and an AI performance assistant, meaning your performance review now depends on how much AI you use, automate, and eventually\u2026 replace yourself with.\n\nEmployees are joking that the only survival strategy is to convince the AI it\u2019s terrible at their job.\n\nFeed it conflicting goals.
