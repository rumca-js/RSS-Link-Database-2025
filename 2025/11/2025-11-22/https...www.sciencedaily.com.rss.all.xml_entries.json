By activating the STING immune pathway using gold-core spherical nucleic acids, researchers were able to reach the brain without invasive surgery. When paired with drugs that boost T-cell activity, the treatment eliminated tumors in mice and built long-lasting immunity. The results suggest a powerful new direction for brain cancer immunotherapy.",
