The first crop of maps are excellent, taking into consideration the new wall run and wall jump mechanics and how that extra dimension of movement adds so much. The weapons are all solid, with the exception of the SMGs, and even though none have really captured my imagination, they're fun to use and fun to grind. The choice to play matches against people at your own skill level or to take your chances in the wild west that is the default mode is the best possible compromise to past complaints about skill-based matchmaking, though I do hope they swap SBMM back to the default option at some point. Fewer parts of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 truly standout above the rest, but the consistent quality across the board this year is really impressive, and the sum of those parts adds up to something great.",
