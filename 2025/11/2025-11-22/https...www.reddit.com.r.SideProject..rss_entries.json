I always struggled to know how a new haircut would look on me, so I decided to build something that actually shows it.</p> <p><strong>How this works?</strong><br/> Upload a clear photo of yourself and pick a reference hairstyle (or upload your own). YourAIBarber blends the hairstyle from the reference image onto your photo in a <strong>photorealistic</strong> way.</p> <p>It\u2019s perfect for trying out different styles before committing to a real haircut, or exploring looks you\u2019ve always been curious about.<br/> I\u2019d love to hear your feedback and suggestions \ud83d\ude4c </p> <p>If you sign in with Google OAuth, you automatically get <strong>3 free credits</strong> to try it out.</p> <p><strong>Try it here \u2192</strong> <a href=\"http://youraibarber.com\">youraibarber.com</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a h",

I&#39;ve noticed that many juniors can write code but haven&#39;t had a chance to work as part of a real development team. So I started a side project called TeamReady to simulate that experience. It&#39;s a 6-week mini-bootcamp where small groups plan and build a project together. You practice Git workflows, standups, code reviews, soft skills, and working with a &#39;product owner&#39; \u2013 while still writing code and building something real. </p> <p>The first cohort (6 spots) is free because I&#39;m testing and gathering feedback. If you&#39;re interested or just curious, you can read the program outline and how to apply on my site: <a href=\"https://teamreadysite.vercel.app/\">https://teamreadysite.vercel.app/</a> .
