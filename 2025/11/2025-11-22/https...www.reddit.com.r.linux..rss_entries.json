I was wondering how I could make something similar on a current computer.<br/> Basically, I want to create a bootable usb stick, that will launch a program to play some cool visuals. The program part shouldn&#39;t be a problem, but I&#39;m not sure how to create a bootable media. I thought maybe customize a live linux? The idea would be to not have start up info to display before launching the visuals. (the visual could be only terminal based)<br/> Any idea on how to do that?<br/> Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SuperTurboUsername\"> /u/SuperTurboUsername </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1p45gl8/bootable_usb_demo/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
