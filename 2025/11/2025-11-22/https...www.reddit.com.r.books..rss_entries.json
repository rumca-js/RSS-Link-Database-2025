While hammers, saws, levels and planes stretch back to antiquity, the screwdriver emerged only in the Late Middle Ages and is the only major mechanical device not independently invented by the Chinese.

In his eyes, everyone is a phony, and everything makes him angry and depressed. I know those who&#39;ve read it say that this could have be a sign of unresolved trauma and depression from the loss of his little brother and a few other things that you learn later on.

I don&#39;t - I tried the audiobook and I couldn&#39;t get past Bishop Myriel&#39;s chapters. I got so sick of him and every damn franc and every piece of furniture and every single wonderful thing he did all the time. He was so uninteresting and it went on for so long that I realized I just wasn&#39;t enjoying it at all.</p> <p>But I love classical lit. I love Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, I liked Moby Dick. I don&#39;t have a problem with big long weighty tomes. I&#39;m wondering if trying to listen to it 25 minutes at a time during my commute was just the wrong way to absorb it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sleepyApostels\"> /u/sleepyApostels </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1p3lv94/les_miserable_audiobook_should_i_have_read_the/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"",
