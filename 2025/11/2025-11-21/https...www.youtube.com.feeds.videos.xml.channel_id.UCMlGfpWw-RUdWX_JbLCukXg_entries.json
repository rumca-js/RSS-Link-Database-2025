It covers the following topics:\n\n- Why defensive programming is a Good Thing (mainly for functional safety, but occasionally also for memory safety)\n- Brief overview of C++26 contracts, and why they\u2019re way better than C assert (spoiler: writing them on declarations, being able to use them in release builds, and language support is just way better than macros)\n- The 3-page \u201cEffective C++ Contracts book\u201d \u2014 best practices you need to know to use them (spoiler: keep compound conditions together, don\u2019t write side effects, understand the pros and cons of installing a throwing violation handler\u2026 that\u2019s pretty much\u2026 it?) \n- Why they\u2019re viable, because they address the key things we need in production (which we\u2019ll list) \n- Why they\u2019re minimal, because we actually need every part in C++26 to use them at scale (wh",
