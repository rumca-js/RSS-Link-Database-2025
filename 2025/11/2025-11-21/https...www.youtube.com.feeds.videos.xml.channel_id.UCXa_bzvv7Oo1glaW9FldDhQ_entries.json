        "description": "Where Winds Meet is among 2025's finest entries, and a game that feels like it's going to be around for a long, long time to come. There's a staggering amount of content to engage with in this game but that's not a reason for its players to keep coming back to it on its own. \n\nIt's the quality of that content, and the number of ways anybody can find to have fun in this world that keeps us as invested as we are into making it a better place.\n\nJoin us as we take a look at why this is a game that's probably going to stay installed on your systems and have you constantly checking back in even if there are new games to play.",

        "description": "Among the many things wrong with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, its bosses are probably the one gripe that we're not going to let go of anytime soon. With designs that are dated, a narrative reason for their presence that doesn't really hold up, and mechanics that are downright plain old boring, they are a showcase of just how uninspired the game currently feels to play. \n\nIn a year filled with excellent shooters with unique ideas, great stories, and incredible mechanics, how has Call of Duty managed to fall so badly? Join us as we take a look at what's wrong with Black Ops 7's most dangerous enemies, and why their bark is worse than their bite.\n\nThumbnail credit: Youtube user Furkay",
