        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I was just thinking of this potential advantage for the coming SF. Before VR, I was massively into Nvidia 3D Vision. It gave a type of depth that flat gaming never could. Running the Model 2 emulator in proper stereo made Virtua Fighter 2 and Sega Rally feel genuinely different, and the same applied to Sonic Generations, Arkham Asylum, Tomb Raider 2013, Borderlands 2 and even Skyrim before VR existed. When 3D Vision was working properly, the games felt like little worlds you were looking into rather than flat screens. Then Nvidia killed it overnight and that whole niche vanished.</p> <p>What interests me about the Steam Frame is a very specific angle almost no one has as yet mentioned. It runs standard Steam games natively through SteamOS/Proton, obviously it has two displays, and Valve leaves everything open like the Steam Deck. Put together, that means there\u2019s a real chance that proper stereoscopic 3D for non-VR games could return. Not the usual \u201cbi",

My main use cases are PS5 Remote Play, watching Netflix/Apple TV wirelessly, and occasionally using the headset as a wireless monitor for my MacBook. I\u2019m not very interested in VR games. Which headset handles Remote Play latency, video apps, and long movie/\u201cmonitor\u201d sessions better? Any real-world experience would help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/flamner\"> /u/flamner </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1p2uj8s/meta_quest_3_vs_pico_4_ultra_best_for_ps_remote/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1p2uj8s/meta_quest_3_vs_pico_4_ultra_best_for_ps_remote/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I don\u2019t have a vr headset but I\u2019ve used one a couple times from friends and stuff, and something I\u2019ve wondered about, how easy is it, if at all possible, to kinda create your own \u201cworld\u201d, not like a full on game but somewhere to hang out. And which vr headset would be the best, no budget? I\u2019ve always liked calming places like a planet or somthing, or even those \u201cyou havnt slept in 10 years, where are you sleeping the hardest\u201d beds, would these be possible to create if I want a relaxing place? also I\u2019ve read another post about how sleeping with a vr headset is not good, but how true is this? bc let\u2019s say I got one of those beds, I was talking about and fell asleep.</p> <p>So basically I\u2019m wondering if what I\u2019m trying to do is possible, and is somthing I can at least learn how to make, or maybe it\u2019s an app that already exists and which headset would be best for this?</",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I picked up the Quest 3 the other day and I&#39;m well aware that dizziness is a common issue with new users. But is it normal to be dizzy into the next morning?</p> <p>For example I sat in bed and watched youtube in the bigscreen app and messed around with the settings for like an hour. Then went right to bed. But when i woke up 8 hours later i had a very faint dizziness from like 8am to 11am.</p> <p>So is it normal to get this even the next day? If so will it get better? </p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/supersport604\"> /u/supersport604 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1p2jjvp/dizziness_in_the_morning_after_using_quest_3/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1p2jjvp/dizziness_in_the_morning_after_using_quest_3/\">[comments]</a></span>",
