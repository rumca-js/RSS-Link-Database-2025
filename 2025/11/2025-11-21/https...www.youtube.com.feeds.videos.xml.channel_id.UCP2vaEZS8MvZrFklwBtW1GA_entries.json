        "description": "Front door project tips\u2026I\u2019m using four @zipwall_llc poles with 4 mil plastic to enclose the space. I make the plastic 8 inches wider than the area. That way the plastic can be sealed against the walls with tape or Foam Rails. This is a great option for painting or doing other work on the door.
