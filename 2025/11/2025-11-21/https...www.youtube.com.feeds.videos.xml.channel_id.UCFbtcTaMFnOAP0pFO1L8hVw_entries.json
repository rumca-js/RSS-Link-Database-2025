We\u2019ve all heard the theories that Stanley Kubrick shot it on a set in Hollywood or that it couldn\u2019t have happened because how can the flag wave if there\u2019s no air on the moon\u2026 But, one of the less popular conspiracy theories out there is that we couldn\u2019t have even landed there in the first place, because astronauts could never survive the \u201cdeadly radiation\u201d of the infamous Van Allen Belt.
