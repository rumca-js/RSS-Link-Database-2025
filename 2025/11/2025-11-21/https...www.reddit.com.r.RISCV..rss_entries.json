Full instructions at: <a href=\"https://github.com/gounthar/openscad\">https://github.com/gounthar/openscad</a></p> <p>This is significant for the RISC-V ecosystem because CAD/engineering tools have been notably absent from RISC-V software availability. OpenSCAD being script-based (uses a C-like language to define 3D models) makes it perfect for embedded systems design, case design, and mechanical engineering workflows.</p> <p>The infrastructure also builds AMD64 ",
