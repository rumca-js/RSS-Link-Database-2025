The prose is great, but my interest is flagging a bit after the brutal (and seemingly pointless) sexual assault that just occurred:</p> <ol> <li><p>Do we ever get a true POV female character? Or just occasional glimpses from their perspective?</p></li> <li><p>If we don\u2019t, do the female characters stay fairly two-dimensional? Ellen is great, but apart from her all the girls &amp; women have only existed to get leered at, beaten up, sexually assaulted, scheme maliciously, or die. </p></li> </ol> <p>I realize that the Anarchy was not a fun period for women to live in, and that sexual violence and oppression were rife. But it\u2019s possible to write women believably and with depth while placing them in a challenging environment, and I\u2019m just not seeing that yet. </p> <p>Thank you for reading!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

I do not mean just &quot;ancient runes glow and spell happens&quot;. I am thinking more like: spells that only work if you hit the right rhythm in a dead language, political conflicts built around which dialect a treaty was written in, wizards who are essentially linguists arguing about grammar while the world shakes around them . Maybe even whole cultures built around how many words they have for a certain concept, and that actually changes what kind of magic they can access. I have read a few things th",

I\u2019ve read all of jujutsu kaisen and Naruto and enjoy that world ending threat caged within the main character vibe. I\u2019ve enjoyed reading about Magik the marvel character and I know there\u2019s more to her story but my girlfriends mum doesn\u2019t like comics or manga so it\u2019s got to be a novel and physical and not too expensive. This is all totally fine and I enjoy sitting down and reading but it\u2019s tricky when you don\u2019t know if the book you want exists or what it\u2019s called so here I am. Skullduggery Pleasant is the kind of humour with high stakes I\u2019m after but that might be pushing it and I\u2019m happy to read content aimed at older audiences too. My favourite series is by Brent weeks so it doesn\u2019t have to be YA content So if anyone knows of anything that exists that would be great </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",

So i started thinking if anyone else has this thing where a pretty minor fantasy character suddenly becomes the emotional anchor of the whole story for you . maybe its the way the author described him, maybe its the energy he carries in the few scenes he is in, or maybe im just projecting way too much nostalgia from when i first read the series at like fourteen and everything felt ten times cooler. idk, it kinda freaked me",

Went on an amazing northeast roadtrip in October with stops in Portland, Kennebunkport, Cambridge, Salem, Newport, and Mystic. There&#39;s a great bookshop in Mystic called Alice&#39;s Haunted Little Bookshop that I&#39;d recommend to anyone passing through!

The book is about a boy, Hollis Brown, who gets possessed, and eventually falls in love, with a ghost named Walt. In a time where I see the majority of mlm writing being made for fetishization, this book was an incredible breath of fresh air. The confusion, the challenges, the struggles of being a gay man, especially being a gay man in a small town like Hollis, are represented so beautifully and tenderly. The yearning in both of them is raw, unyielding, and it feels real. I often find glimpses of myself in Hollis. The need, the desperation, to be seen and to be heard. To be understood. Hollis and Walt share the love for each other that I could only dream of in the late of night, and someone could say I even found myself jealous. Wishing I could find someone who loved me as purely as Hollis loved Walt. Needless to say, this may be on",
