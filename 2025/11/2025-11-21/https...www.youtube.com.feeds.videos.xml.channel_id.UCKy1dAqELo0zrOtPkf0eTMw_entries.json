        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nA financial report from Ubisoft may have revealed the release date for the long-rumored Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake. An entry for an 'unannounced title' dropped March 31st, 2026 is fueling speculation that the remake will be announced soon. The title is supposedly being made by the Ubisoft Shanghai team, the same studio behind Skull & Bones, which itself started as a spinoff of the original AC: Black Flag. In other news, some old friends will be popping up in Resident Evil: Requiem, but don't get too excited over the possibility of playing as multiple protagonists. Requiem's producer confirmed that past characters will show up, but he said to not \"over-hype it.\" And finally, Nintendo is taking down fan-made character art in Kirby Air Riders, specifically those of a bikini-clad Chef Kawasaki. Yes, that's a sentence you just read.",

This battle pits protagonist Gwendolyn fights against a powerful shape-shifting witch named Tyronoe. Gwendolyn is assisted in the fighting by the spear-wielding Sir Lamorak, a Knight of the Roundtable. The trailer also gives us a peek at the combat system called the Dual Frontline Battle System, as you will be able to control both Gwendolyn and Lamorak. We also get a glimpse at a story element with Tyronoe's creation of a mirror-like Folded Realm. Tides of Annihilation will be available on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 (PS5).",
