Inferring neural connectivity considers the cross-correlation of spike timing. Neuromorphic systems utilize online learning algorithms that leverage the temporal correlations of spikes by utilizing spiking neural networks. This research demonstrates real-time, large-scale neural connectivity inference by implementing the presynaptic spike-driven spike-timing-dependent plasticity method on neuromorphic hardware. We validate the capability of the proposed method to perform advanced neuron connectivity inference using synthetic data generated from leaky integrate-and-fire neurons on a multi-scale.

Building upon the nested learning paradigm, which decomposes models into multi-level optimization problems with fixed update frequencies, this work proposes dynamic nested hierarchies as the next evolutionary step in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints.

I&#39;m from Spain, and we&#39;re dealing with some pretty big corruption cases here. At one point, I asked it a question that shouldn&#39;t be controversial at all, you know, nothing that should be censored. It just so happens that our president, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is trying to restrict our digital freedoms right now. Just yesterday, he said he&#39;d get his hands on the algorithms that criticize his party and their corruption cases. So, today, talking to Ara, I simply asked if she thought Pedro S\u00e1nchez should resign, and honestly, we talked for an hour without any connection problems. The first time it froze, I didn&#39;t think much of it. The second time, either. But the third time seemed really weird. Then I started the conversation again",
