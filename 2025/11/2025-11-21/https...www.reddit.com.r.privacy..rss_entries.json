It&#39;s a guide on how to create a contact form that encrypts a message in a browser, using OpenPGPjs, before sending it by email through a backend written in Rust.</p> <p><a href=\"https://zoug.fr/world-most-interesting-contact-form/\">https://zoug.fr/world-most-interesting-contact-form/</a></p> <p>It&#39;s technical, but easy to follow if you have some computer science knowledge. I also talk a bit about Proton Mail, their security model, and Chat Control (not a lot: just asking you to send an email to your representatives if you live in Europe).</p> <p>Check it out and if you have any feedback, I&#39;d love to hear it.
