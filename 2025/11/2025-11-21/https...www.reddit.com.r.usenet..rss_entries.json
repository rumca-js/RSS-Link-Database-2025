He\u2019s been using it for four years and nothing\u2019s happened. Since Usenet providers already operate on low margins, it\u2019s weird that they don\u2019t enforce strict account-sharing rules. He only uses around 500GB a month, so I guess he stays under the radar, and I get that some people run servers, NAS setups, or home PCs. But you\u2019d think providers would make a little more money if they cracked down on this stuff.

When Black Friday or any other sales event comes around, businesses post their offers, and each of those posts builds its own thread full of common questions and genuinely useful details. That\u2019s what makes the space so richly informative. Limiting or collapsing that material is counterproductive for both the community and the services. Compressing everything into a single catch-all table just can\u2019t reflect the depth or quality of the original information. Editing in this way not only diminishes the value of those discussions but also raises real questions about whether the mods understand the purpose of <a href=\"/r/Usenet\">r/Usenet</a>.
