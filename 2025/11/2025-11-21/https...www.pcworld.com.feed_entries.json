Amazon is selling both the Wi-Fi \u00a0and the Matter versions of the Level Smart Lock+ for just $249\u2014that\u2019s 29% off the Wi-Fi version and 24% off the Matter version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2PNT3RN\">Wi-Fi version</a> includes the plug-in bridge that connects the lock to your Wi-Fi network.

All you needed was a good password and, in the early days, you didn\u2019t need a ton of numbers, letters, and special characters to achieve that goal. No need for antivirus software to verify you were logging into legitimate sites, either. Privacy also wasn\u2019t quite as fragile as it is today. Your email wasn\u2019t constantly being lost to yet another data breach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But AI has helped hackers and criminals become sneakier with their attacks, so now the recommendations for best security practices have become more sophisticated, too. Currently, experts recommend the use of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/407092/best-password-managers-reviews-and-buying-advice.html\">unique, random passwords</a> (and the more characters, the better) plus two-factor authentication as a strong baseline.
