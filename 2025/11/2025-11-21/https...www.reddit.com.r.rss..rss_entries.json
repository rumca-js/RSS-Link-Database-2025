I spend too much time tweaking regex filters or unsubscribing from feeds that are 90% irrelevant and 10% gold.</p> <p>I built SignalHub to fix the &quot;filtering&quot; layer of RSS.</p> <p>The concept is simple: Instead of just subscribing to a feed, you build a &quot;Tracker&quot;. A Tracker is a composable set of sources + custom LLM prompts that outputs a clean stream.</p> <p>The Goal: Right now, I am looking for people who are picky about their feeds to try the logic builder. The tool also lets you <em>share</em> these Trackers. </p> <p>I&#39;d love to hear if the filtering logic feels powerful enough for your workflows. </p> <p><a href=\"https://getsignalhub.com/\">https://getsignalhub.com/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fancy-Welcome-9064\"> /u/Fancy-Welcome-",
