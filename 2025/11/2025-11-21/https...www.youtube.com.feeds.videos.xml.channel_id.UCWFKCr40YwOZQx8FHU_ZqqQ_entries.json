        "description": "The OnePlus 15 color variants are made from different materials! Get up to 47% off your Ridge Wallet HERE:  https://www.ridge.com/JERRYRIG Huge thanks to Ridge for making the products I use every day and for sponsoring this video.   The New OnePlus 15 comes in 3 colors. Two of the Colors have Glass backs, and the 3rd color, the OnePlus 15 Sandstorm - is plastic.  \n\nPlastic is not bad of course! I prefer plastic since it does not shatter like glass. Its just good to know what your phone is made of. \n\nGet my smartphone tool kit here: www.iFixit.com/JerryRig",
