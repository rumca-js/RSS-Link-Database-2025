What was meant to be the definitive version of the game launched with numerous bugs and other issues that sparked a backlash against Fallout 4. Now, Bethesda is releasing an update for November and looking ahead to a December update as well.</p><p>Bethesda shared the patch notes on social media. The message didn't directly address the negative response to Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, but it did thank players for their \"continued communication with us on your current Fallout 4 experience.\" The dev team notes that it's focused on DLC installation issues, occasional crashing, and general user experience in the patch.</p><div data-embed-type=\"tweet\" data-src=\"https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1991948030283567417\" dat",
