Discover why reuse may be one of our most underestimated climate solutions, and how small, practical shifts in our daily habits can spark collective environmental change, one refill at a time. Growing up in the mountains of Utah, Jamaica Trinnaman experienced a childhood immersed in nature and adventure, fostering a deep respect for the earth. As one of eight children, she also learned the value of home-cooked meals and minimizing waste. This foundation stood in stark contrast to the waste Jamaica witnessed during her career in the natural grocery industry, inspiring her to open what is currently Utah\u2019s only refill grocery store, in 2018.

With humor and clarity, she walks us through 5,000 years of failed cures\u2014only to show that the hangover may be one of the most powerful biological models we have for understanding aging.\n\nHangovers compress decades of low-grade chronic inflammation into 12 intense hours\u2014triggering the same immune pathways linked to arthritis, heart disease, dementia, and more. Jackie shares breakthrough research showing how inflammation\u2014not dehydration\u2014is the true culprit behind hangover symptoms, and how this inflammatory response may hold the key to preventing age-related decline.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a biohacker chasing healthspan or someone who\u2019s just Googled \u201changover cure,\u201d this talk will change how you see pain, recovery, and the future of medicine.\n\nBecause solving the hangover might ju",

In this visionary TEDx talk, neuroscientist Dr. Annie Kathuria explores the next frontier in regenerative medicine -the emerging science of brain organoids designed for transplantation. While current treatments can\u2019t yet reverse brain damage, Dr. Kathuria outlines a research roadmap showing how this could become possible within our lifetime: developing living, modular brain tissue grown from stem cells that might one day be surgically implanted to restore lost function. Drawing on experimental data and cross-disciplinary advances, she describes how multi-region brain organoids (MRBOs) with replaceable, region-specific modules could progress from concept to clinic, leveraging GMP-grade stem-cell protocols already proven safe in other FDA-authorized studies. Dr. Kathuria explains why this vision is no longer science fiction, but a plausible next step for neuroscience. Advances in vascularization, immune compatibility, and neural integration are s",

From before birth through everyday exposures, we accumulate viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens that can persist in our tissues and nerves for decades, quietly manipulating the systems that sustain us. These microbes are not harmless stowaways\u2014they\u2019re expert hackers of human biology. Persistent pathogens like herpesviruses and Toxoplasma gondii hijack our mitochondria\u2014the cell\u2019s energy factories\u2014and reprogram metabolic and genetic signaling to serve their own survival. They can accelerate telomere shortening and directly interfere with longevity-related genes, driving nearly every hallmark of aging.  If we want to extend human healthspan, we have to confront this hidden enemy. The solution is clear but radical: we must integrate infection biology into the science of aging. That means developing next-generation diagnostics to detect pathogen persistenc",

This talk introduces a child-friendly framework that helps children and the adults in their lives notice, name, and question unfair patterns, including limiting gender norms often described as the patriarchy. Kids see unfairness every day, but we don\u2019t give them the words for it. Lauren Currie shows how shared language can build empathy, confidence, and critical thinking without shame or blame. When children and adults have words for what they see, they are better equipped to challenge harmful patterns and imagine something better. Lauren is the Founder of UPFRONT, an organisation on a mission to transform confidence, visibility, and power for 10 million women worldwide. Thousands of women from over 50 countries have graduated from The UPFRONT Bond, the flagship programme that has become the leading choice for women and organisations seeking to build confidence.
