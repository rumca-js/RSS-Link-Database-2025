        "description": "Robin Hilton | November 21, 2025\nWhen Robert Plant first stepped behind the Tiny Desk on a blustery Halloween afternoon, he took stock of the relatively stripped-down setup. \"This is just like Live Aid,\" he said with a smile. \"I couldn't hear myself there either.\" He was referring to the fact we don't amplify voices or use monitors so artists can hear themselves.\n\nBut if ever there was someone up to the challenge, it's Robert Plant. With a voice that's only gotten better with age, Plant has deftly moved from the full-throated rock and swagger of Led Zeppelin to the more restrained and profoundly beautiful folk, blues and roots music found on more recent recordings. His latest solo album, Saving Grace, is a collection of covers that range from the traditional spiritual \"Gospel Plough\" to \"It's A Beautiful Day Today\" by Moby Grape, a psychedelic rock band that, Plant says, still makes him \"weepy.\"\n\nPlant and his band perform both songs for this set, along with a version of \"Higher Rock\"",
