        "description": "<p>Apple Store:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Hikawa Phone Grip &amp; Stand is a MagSafe compatible adaptive\naccessory for iPhone designed by Bailey Hikawa to celebrate the\n40th anniversary of accessibility at Apple. Designed with direct\ninput from individuals with disabilities affecting muscle\nstrength, dexterity, and hand control, this ergonomic grip was\ndesigned with accessibility in mind from the ground up. The grip\nuses magnets to securely snap onto any iPhone with MagSafe, can be\nremoved with ease, and doubles as a stand to support iPhone at two\ndifferent viewing angles, both vertically and horizontally.\nInspired by modern sculpture, each Hikawa product is an art object\nunto itself. The limited edition Hikawa Phone Grip &amp; Stand is\navailable in two colors, a bold, high-visibility Chartreuse and\nrecycled Crater, exclusive to Apple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Looks like a perfectly cromulent accessory, but <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/11/hikawa-chartreuse.jpeg\">Chartre",

Sturka is a fantasy novelist, and Apple Books has <a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/bloodsong-of-wycaro/id6754341665\">an 11-page excerpt of her \u201cnew\u201d novel <em>Bloodsong of Wycaro</em></a>. Unclear whether it\u2019s Seehorn writing the in-character responses, but it\u2019s definitely Seehorn in the confirmation photo. Reminiscent of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/severance-balloon-generator\">some of the promotional fun</a> Apple has had for <em>Severance</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Both my wife and I are loving <em>Pluribus</em> so far. I highly recommend watching the first episode without even knowing the premise, if you can.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Fun Stunt to Promote \u2018Pluribus\u2019: An Ask Me Anything on Reddit With Carol Sturka\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/21/",
