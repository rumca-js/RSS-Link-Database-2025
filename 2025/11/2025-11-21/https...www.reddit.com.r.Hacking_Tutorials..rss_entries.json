        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Guys, sometimes I have problems with noisy neighbors (listening to loud music late at night). I&#39;ve argued with them a few times, but they always come back to it. I decided to buy a jammer (WiFi and Bluetooth blocker), but the problem is that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#39;t. So I decided to download Kali Linux and test some tools to attack Bluetooth (for educational purposes). So far, I&#39;ve found tools to attack, e.g., Bluetoolkit... but I can&#39;t find/scan Bluetooth devices near me. I tested it with my speaker and three other devices of mine and could only find one. I used commands such as:</p> <p>\u201csudo hcitool scan\u201d</p> <p>\u201csudo hcitool con\u201d</p> <p>\u201csudo bluetoothctl scan on\u201d</p> <p>But I still can&#39;t find/scan Bluetooth devices near me. Is there any interesting program/command for this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mental-Signature-255\"> /u/Mental-Signature-255 </a",

As far as I can tell, there is no direct way to download it from the in-browser FlippingBook. It has some useful information I would love to be able to reference in the future some day, but you only buy access to it for 3 or 6 months I believe. I am just wondering if there is a software that will let me keep this for my own private knowledge after I complete the test/the time expires.
