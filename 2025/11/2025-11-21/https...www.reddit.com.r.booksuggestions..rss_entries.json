You get the idea.) Though that\u2019s not completely necessary! Just a plus.</p> <p>I\u2019ve already read I Was a Teenage Slasher by Stephen Graham Jones and loved it. I\u2019d say this is a good example of the type of book I\u2019m looking for.</p> <p>(Side note\u2014 I\u2019m not interested in reading anything overly gross/disturbing, so please do not recommend any extreme horror or splatterpunk type books.

Kinda was curious to see if anyone could help me out here with this, but does anyone know of any good books to do with the history of LGBT? Specifically the history of the community within America. Obviously it can be about both the negatives and positives as I would love to learn more fully about the history and such of the LGBT within America especially. Books outside of America covering history are also greatly appreciated. Oh also! Would love to learn further about the history of the pride flag throughout the years and its inherent symbolism, so any books on that is greatly appreciated as well. If anyone wishes as well, please free as well to help me understand further why the letters of LGBT are in their inherent order as well.
