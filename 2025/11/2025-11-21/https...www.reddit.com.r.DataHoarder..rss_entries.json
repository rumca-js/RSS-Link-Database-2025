From what I know, Elements have 2 years warranty (mybook is 3 i think). I could get 4 years extra warrranty for 10 Euro, which i guess would be ok if it means that basically I&#39;m fine for 6 years, but is that real? I&#39;m not going to shuck it, but does that warranty mean that if i get some errors on the disk, i&#39;ll get a replacement one? Or at least a reimburse to buy a new one? Anyone have experience and tried it? I read some posts (in this sub) saying its useless but to me 10 Euro for 4 years is definately worth it if thats how it really works.</p> <p>And also, been a while since I bought external hds, whats usually now inside WD elements 20tb? Back then they used the SMRs in the smaller size ones, should be a decent HD right?</p> <p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3",
