        "description": "\u201cForever layoffs\u201d are the new corporate buzzword \u2014 but the truth is way darker.\nCompanies are quietly firing under 50 workers at a time to dodge WARN Act protections, skip severance, avoid bad press, and keep their real layoff numbers hidden. Glassdoor calls it \u201crolling cuts.\u201d I call it what it is: corporate gray-area exploitation 101.\n\nIn this video, I break down how companies are now using micro-layoffs to avoid announcing anything publicly, why job security has always been an illusion, and how this \u201cforever layoff\u201d cycle creates constant anxiety, distrust, and churn. We also look at the data, the WARN Act loopholes, and the corporate bootlickers defending it all.\n\nIf you don\u2019t own the company, you\u2019re not safe \u2014 and the sooner people understand that, the better they\u2019ll navigate today\u2019s job market.\n\nWatch to the end for advice on how to protect yourself, finesse the system, and stay one step ahead of corporate nonsense.\n\nNeed a resume / cover letter? \u27a1\ufe0f https://joshuafluke.store\n\u2022 \ud83d\udd0d ",
