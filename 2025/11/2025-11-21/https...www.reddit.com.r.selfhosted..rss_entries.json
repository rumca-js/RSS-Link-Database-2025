I want to try running small things like a Minecraft server or maybe a simple movie server/Jellyfin setup.</p> <p>I installed Linux and tested a Minecraft server on it, and it actually ran, but not very well. So now I\u2019m thinking of upgrading it a bit: replacing the HDD with a cheap 256GB SATA SSD and adding another 4GB of RAM.</p> <p>The upgrades aren\u2019t expensive, but I\u2019m a student so I don\u2019t want to spend money if the difference is minimal. Do you think it\u2019s worth upgrading this laptop for learning/self-hosting, or should I just leave it as it is?</p> <p>Any advice/experience would help, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Biinosaur\"> /u/Biinosaur </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1p3czss/is_it_worth_",
