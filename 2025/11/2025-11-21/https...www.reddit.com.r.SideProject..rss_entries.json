Instead of writing complex prompts, you choose from templates like Cutting Fruit ASMR, Toast Spread ASMR or Fantasy Beds ASMR, pick object or materials, and the app generates a short video with synchronized sound. Under the hood it uses Google\u2019s Veo 3.1 for video and generates audio together, so each slice or pop matches what you see.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a native English speaker, and this is my first Reddit post in <a href=\"/r/SideProject\">r/Sid",

We\u2019ve had this dream for a while, and today is Day 1 of actually doing it and building in public.</p> <p>We\u2019re starting small: first machine, first placement, first revenue. We\u2019ve been grinding, planning, saving, and trying to learn everything we can. We\u2019re serious about scaling this into something big over the next 5 years.</p> <p>Right now, we\u2019re working on raising the initial capital for our first few ATMs and installation costs. We even put together a GoFundMe to help accelerate the first step (totally optional \u2014 feedback means just as much) </p> <p>Since this is a side project growing into a full-time business, I\u2019d love any advice from people who have built service businesses, or anything similar. Thank you for reading. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/manage/helping-two-young-entrepreneurs-b",
