Picked up a few books and started them but usually only get a few chapters in before something else grabs my attention. </p> <p>Recently I heard about a series, Lattes And Legends, which seems promising. In addition to the whimsical summaries, I&#39;ve also heard tell that it shares some similarities with the infamous Discworld series, a perennial favorite of mine. I&#39;m wondering if anyone else has read these books and would have thoughts on whether they were worth the start. Sadly my bookshelf no longer has space on it for another miss.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Asher_Tye\"> /u/Asher_Tye </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1p3ds2q/thoughts_on_a_series_im_considering/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1p3ds2q/thoughts_on_a_series_im_considering/\">[com",

Truth me told, they don&#39;t impress me now - they&#39;re weird but not in the memorable way, and I wasn&#39;t really a fan.</p> <p>Ugh, it&#39;s so hard to put my feelings on this series down into words. And I can&#39;t help but try to compare it to Animorphs, but that&#39;s just not fair. There really is no comparison. If I had to pick between reading 54 books of Animorphs (filler and all) vs these 12, I would take the animorphs, no question.</p> <p>But, Everworld is not without it&#39;s charms. For starters, I think its greatest strength is the five protagonists, and how real they feel as people. Having read some of Grants solo work, I see a LOT of him in th",

I found myself tearing up in those last few chapters, feeling heartbroken as though I had known those that died on that expedition. Some thoughts:</p> <p>While it is terrible what happened to Doug, I am happy that he was able to reach the peak before he died</p> <p>As everyone began to lose hope for Rob, I myself couldn\u2019t. I kept reading, thinking he\u2019s going to miraculously make it, he\u2019s going to be okay.</p> <p>And BECK. Holy shit my jaw dropped when he walked back into camp. It was like a light in a dark tunnel of events, yet they had already given up on him at that point, they were really going to leave him up there to die despite him refusing to do so. I admire his strength and determination and can\u2019t believe how much the group let him down. Thank goodness he is okay.</p> <p>Overall I think Krakauers raw emotional account really put me in that mountain with them which left me amazed, heartbroken and defeated. ",
