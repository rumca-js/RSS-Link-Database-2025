Problem is I\u2019m not nearly techy or patient enough to leave windows (as much as I hate windows lol) so I\u2019m completely clueless with Linux beyond a handful of similarities with Mac like Wine and minor tinkering on my steam deck - it usually gets passed off to them lol</p> <p>Does the OS have any compatibility specifications? Like can it be converted from a Chromebook or does it have to be a Windows originally, is there a minimum recommended CPU, etc etc. I don\u2019t have a heap of money to drop on a gaming quality laptop, but my work\u2019s been so exhausting lately that I\u2019ve generally been a shit girlfriend and I wanna at least get a decent schooling kit together</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",
