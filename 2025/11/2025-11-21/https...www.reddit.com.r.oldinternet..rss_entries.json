Nowadays, it is like cat nip to me when I run across one. Does anybody still need to interact with one of these types of websites? Are you able to interact directly with it or do you need to utilize a virtual machine? I&#39;m so curious.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/urnicus\"> /u/urnicus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oldinternet/comments/1p31fpy/anybody_still_working_with_a_website_that/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oldinternet/comments/1p31fpy/anybody_still_working_with_a_website_that/\">[comments]</a></span>",
