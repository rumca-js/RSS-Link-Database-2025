While the Xbox 360 is only hitting 20 and it's not an industry shaker to the degree the PS1 was, there's no doubt it earned its place as one of the most important consoles of all time. Xbox managed to challenge Sony in the traditional home console space the PlayStation had dominated with PS1 and PS2, and the console's brilliant line-up of games played a major role in that.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/the-10-xbox-360-games-that-mattered-the-most\">Read more</a></p>",
