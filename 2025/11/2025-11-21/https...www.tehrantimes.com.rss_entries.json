With painstaking research and courage, Zupani\u010d brings to light the shadowy phenomenon of \u201cman-hunting,\u201d exploring how cruelty, commerce and war intersected in a city under siege. In this interview, he reflects on his journey from skepticism to conviction, the resistance he faced, and the moral urgency that drove him to expose this haunting chapter of modern history.",
