        "description": "#science #jacobogrinberg #pachita \nIn Mexico, during the early 1990s, a respected researcher named Jacobo Grinberg claimed he had witnessed something that defied everything science believes about reality.\nDays before he was expected to reveal his findings\u2026 he disappeared without a trace.\n\nGrinberg was a psychologist and investigator at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), known for his groundbreaking studies on perception, human potential, and the unexplained. His work often placed him at the intersection between science and the mystical traditions of indigenous Mexico \u2014 including strange phenomena he personally documented.\n\nAccording to those close to him, Jacobo was preparing to share something far more extraordinary than anything he had published before. Something he witnessed firsthand\u2026 something that \u201cshould not be possible.\u201d\n\nThen, in December 1994, he simply vanished.",
