        "description": "Last month the interstelllar comet 3I/ATLAS made a close approach to Mars and this presented a unique opportunity to observe it from spacecraft that are usually studying Mars. This was partly done because the comet was also passing on the opposite side of the sun during it's closest approach to the sun. \nHowever because of the government shutdown, none of the observations were released at the time, so NASA had a press conference yesterday to reveal the new images.\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/comets/3i-atlas/\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/scottmanley",
