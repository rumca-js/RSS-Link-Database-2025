Her 2022 breakthrough, The Long Count, featured woozy, ambient soundscapes made from electronically processed samples of ancient Maya flutes. On her latest record, Desaceleradas (Decelerated), Beatriz turns her attention to the 90s trend of <em>cumbia rebajada</em>. Slowing the Afro-Latin dance genre of <em>cumbia</em> to a sludgy tempo, <em>cumbia rebajada</em> is a dub-influenced take on a typically upbeat, party-driven sound. DJ Gabriel Due\u00f1ez popularised the style with his bootleg cassettes; two of his earliest releases now form the basis of Beatriz\u2019s experiments.</p><p>Landing somewhere between composer William Basinski\u2019s Disintegration Loops and DJ Screw\u2019s chopped\u2019n",
