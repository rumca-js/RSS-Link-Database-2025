Kepner, 18, was found dead on a Carnival cruise ship. Tew says that Kepner was so afraid of her stepbrother that she often slept over at her friends' home. The 16-year-old stepbrother is under suspicion for Kepner's death. Tew says the 16-year-old had sexually harassed Kepner. The FBI is investigating Kepner's death because it happened in international waters.",
