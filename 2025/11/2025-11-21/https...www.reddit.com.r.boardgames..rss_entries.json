Before we bought the game, we tried to look up reviews and tips, but there was literally NOTHING online about it!! So I wanted to write something for those considering buying the game.</p> <p>Before I start my detailed review, the short answer to whether I recommend buying and playing this game is YES!! 100 THOUSAND TIMES YES!!. This game isn\u2019t the best thought-through game. But, if you have a good group of friends, just dressing up in drag and sharing a couple of drinks will provide fun no matter what! </p> <p>Ratings out of 5 Stars Fun \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 Complexity \u2b50\u2b50 Replayability \u2b50 Preparation - Moderate </p> <p>We played this game with 9 people. (8 players + host) While most of us were well-rounded in our drag culture, a lot of the players were limited in RPG experience.

The spy will lose to every other piece. </p> <p>Due to unique game situations the idea of what card/piece is the strongest can vary. Is it the highest value card or is it the lower value card with the stronger ability better to have. Some games where this dynamic is highlighted.</p> <p>1) Love Letter: The goal of the game is to be the last player standing or be left with the highest value card at the end or the round. The lowest card is the guard with a value of 1. It has the special ability to eliminate other players if they can guess the card in hand. The highest value is the princess ",

There were two players who were playing the game pretty different. One was taking chips based on what was in their hand currently, and only really trading up significantly if their hand changed because of the flop. Otherwise they were happy to slip lower if people took their number, figuring that means they turned a high card into a pair or whatever. The other player was taking chips based off of what probability their hand could be in the future. So if they started out with a poor hand but the first flop put them somewhat closer to a flush, then they would take a higher chip than they did round one to indicate their hand now had a better chance of being a flush. So my question is, is it better to try to communicate what your hand actually is, and not worry about what the potential is, or is it better to try to communicate that the probability of",

In any game she loves combat the most, so is either very combat heavy? I would also prefer if one is more \u201creplayable\u201d without getting dull.

As you have a character, then you upgrade him/her , you have health, abilities etc - you travel across the map - do some encounters - then battle various monsters , then getting some loot / recharge - then rinse and repeat. Sometimes there is some story to it - I don\u2019t personally care - I would rather read a book. Don\u2019t get me wrong - thematic games are great - but when they are getting too serious about it and throw ton of texts at you then\u2026 Anyway - what do you guys think? P.S. we also played Fate, defenders of the Greimheim and I already want to sell it - so I guess tower defense games and alike are not for us </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Direct-Instruction69\"> /u/Direct-Instructio",
