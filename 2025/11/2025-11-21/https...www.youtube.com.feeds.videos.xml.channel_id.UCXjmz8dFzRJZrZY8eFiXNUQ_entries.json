        "description": "When the 21 Jump Street reboot was first announced, nobody expected it to become one of the most influential comedies of the 2010s. Its sharp writing, self-aware humor, and the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum turned the reboot into a cultural hit. One so successful that it immediately spawned an equally beloved sequel in 22 Jump Street.\n\nBut the real shock came after the credits rolled. At one point, Sony Pictures was prepared to greenlight a Jump Street threequel that would cross over with the Men in Black universe.  A potentially wild, ambitious idea that could have redefined studio comedy franchises.   Even Hill and Tatum were champing at the bit to step back into their roles of Schmidt and Jenko.\n\nSo why didn\u2019t it happen? What happened behind the scenes that took this potentially groundbreaking crossover and buried it before it ever saw the light of day?\n\n#21jumpstreet #meninblack #jonahhill #channingtatum #nerdstalgic",
