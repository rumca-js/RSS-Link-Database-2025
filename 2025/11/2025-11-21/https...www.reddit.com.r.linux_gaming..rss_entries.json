Since Sunshine is running as a user session, my PC is completely unreachable until I log in. And it&#39;s really inconvenient since I&#39;m out of the house most of the day. About a year ago I was able to get it working by making a systemd system service (/usr/lib/systemd/system/sunshine.service) to make Sunshine run as root and have access to the whole PC, including the SDDM login screen. Now, when I try it, it pairs to my phone successfully but fails after RSTP handshake, and says my PC could not be reached and to check the allowed ports. This happens even on a local area network with no firewall. Help would be appreciated, I&#39;ve been going mad trying to figure this out.

Basically with games that display a splash window -- often but not exclusively games that run EAC, such as The Finals, ARC Raiders, or Helldivers 2 -- that initial splash screen will be contained within the Gamescope window, but it would then disappear and while the game process will continue running in the background, that specific window will never become visible, almost like gamescope &#39;loses&#39; the game window after the splash screen disappears. i&#39;ve not used gamescope on my desktop because of this, which sucks cuz gamescope does some handy things.</p> <p>This seems to be an issue especially on wlroots-based compositors such as Sway or Labwc, which is what I use.</p> <p>There&#39;s an issue in the gamescope github tracking this: <a href=\"https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/1673\">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues",

But as of now I am sick of the AI updates that crash one or multiple parts of their own OS. I want to swap to Linux but I play a ton of games and use video editing software and discord and I&#39;m scared of how difficult so many people have said it is to run anything on.. Any helpful tips or how to know if its a viable option for me? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DarklingForged\"> /u/DarklingForged </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1p32yn7/i_am_done_with_windows/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1p32yn7/i_am_done_with_windows/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I never though changing from Windows would be so smooth for someone who likes gaming. Yesterday I pulled the trigger and got myself a 1440p 27&quot; monitor and holy crap it is such a difference. Both for games and work. I have for many years been having a dual 1080p setup. </p> <p>If there are any people out there who has been thinking on pulling the trigger on 1440p, then I advice you to go for it. </p> <p>I would like to add that the monitor change has been flawless with Fedora KDE plasma. It worked out of the box with my AMD card.</p> <p>Edit: I have sometimes connect my PC to my 4k TV and yes it is beautiful. But nothing I use as a daily driver.

Also, it would not get locked to the game window after I tabbed out and back in again. </p> <p>Even worse were games with parts that require a locked cursor and parts that allow a movable cursor (like Blue Prince, for example).

I don&#39;t want to start X11 vs Wayland war, please don&#39;t make the comment section a war zone. So, if you attempted to play this mod with Dark Souls 2, you may experienced the same thing as me. Performance monitors showing 60 fps in game with smooth frame time, but the game was choppy after you installed the mod. Switch to X11, it will work perfectly with the mod. I&#39;m on a full AMD PC, and i tested the mod in KDE-Wayland. The mod will stutter if you using Wayland, same thing with GNOME. KDE, Cinnamon, XFCE, Budgie with X11 works fine with this mod.</p> <p>I hope this helped for 2 people at least :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WoodpeckerFun2086\"> /u/WoodpeckerFun2086 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1p",
