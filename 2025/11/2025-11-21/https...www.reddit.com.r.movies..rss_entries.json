However before the movie could start production, Idol got into a very bad car accident, and was heavily injured, hence why Idol didn&#39;t end up playing the role of T-1000. That was a weird choice at the time but looking at it now, it&#39;s crazy that Idol almost ended up getting the role in the first place since he&#39;s a singer and wasn&#39;t an actor in terms of film &amp; television in the first place to begin with.</p> <p>As of a result, Robert Patrick ended up replacing Idol to play the T-1000 and the rest is history.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alternative-Cake-833\"> /u/Alternative-Cake-833 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p3bbmf/the_weirdest_casting_choice_in_a_movie/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"http",

Both serious but also with confidence and a tad of humor.</p> <p>The intro / pre-theme scene is one of the coolest (betrayal right away). I also think the setting and story of the movie is classic and well played. There are also multiple tense moments. </p> <p>Maybe the action scenes are a bit lacking, especially with the later Brosnan and Craig installments.

I have never in my life cried as much as I did for a movie until I watched BBM. whenever I think of how Ennis and Jack never truely had each other I get teary eyed and think of possible other universes where they are happy together and accepted. Jake Gyhlenhall&#39;s performance in the movie is fantastic but Heath Ledger was truly the best part of the movie for me. the way he portrayed his emotions felt so real to me. I have never felt so empty and broken after watching a movie. for years, I always dismissed this movie as just a movie about gay cowboys because growing up, thats all I was really told about the movie. I was not prepared for how this movie would make me",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Where to begin?</p> <p>I guess for starters, how the hell did they get Ed Harris and Malcolm McDowell to star in this movie? Okay, Malcolm McDowell, maybe not as surprising. But Ed Harris was in <em>Apollo 13</em> the following year, so I&#39;m assuming they were both filmed around the same time. He was also in <em>The Abyss</em>, although that was years earlier. I guess his career hadn&#39;t really peaked at the time of <em>Milk Money</em>, but still. I really wish I could ask him how that all went down.</p> <p>For those of you who, like me, had never heard of this movie until now, <em>Milk Money</em> is about a young boy who finds a hooker in the city, gets her stranded in the suburbs, and then tries to set her up with his dad so that she can be his mom. Basically the opposite of that episode of <em>The Boondocks.</em> It&#39;s one of the most bizarre romcoms I&#39;ve ever seen. Actually, it&#39;s definitely the most bizarre romcom I&#39;ve ever see",
