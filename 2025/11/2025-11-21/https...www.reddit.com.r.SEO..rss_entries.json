I run the website for her, but only have an hour or two a week max. I am an amateur, but have picked a bit up over the years. The site is built using Divi 5, hosted on a VPS, pagespeeds are generally 90-100. Main home page, 2 main services hub pages and 10 sub services per hub and an our team page with individual profile pages. I recently added a blog too. All main directory listings are done and consistent. I used Gemini to help with page meta titles, description, schema markup. We rank in the top 3 for all the main keywords I am after, but they are hyperlocal searches so traffic is low but high intent.</p> <p>My question is what should I focus my limited 1 to 2 hours per week on. I want to make the most of AI and automation to maximise what I can achieve in that limited time. I have access paid Gemini, Chatgpt and perplexity, as well as N8N on my vps - I have all thes",
