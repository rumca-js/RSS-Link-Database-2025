        "description": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he is ready to work with the US on \"their vision\" for ending the war with Russia.\n \nUnder the plan, which has not yet been made public, Kyiv would cede significant areas of the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine that it still controls, cut the size of its army, and pledge not to join Nato - proposals it had previously ruled out.\n \nThe White House has pushed back on claims that Ukraine was not involved in the drafting of the plan, which emerged following meetings between US special envoy Steve Witkoff and and Russian counterpart Kirill Dmitriev.\n \nZelensky said he was set to speak to Trump in the coming days about the proposals, which also include plans for Ukraine to forgo many of its weapons.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Ukraine #Russia #US #BBCNews",
