        "description": "Researchers discovered that the common amino acid arginine can block harmful A\u03b2 aggregation and reduce its toxic effects in Alzheimer\u2019s disease models. In flies and mice, oral arginine lowered plaque levels, reduced inflammation, and improved behavior. Its strong safety record and low cost make it a promising repurposing candidate. The findings hint at a surprisingly simple path toward more accessible AD therapies.",
