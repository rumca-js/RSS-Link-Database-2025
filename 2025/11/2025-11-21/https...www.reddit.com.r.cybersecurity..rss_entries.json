We have our own bug bounty and some of our customers do too.</p> <p>A customer issue came in today. It was a vulnerability report they received through their bug bounty program. The report referenced code we generate, so naturally, our customer raised it with us. Structurally, the report looked legit.</p> <p>Based on the phraseology, it was clearly aided by an LLM. Alarm bells started going off immediately, as I read through it. While it was referencing genuine snippets from the code our tool generates - it was also making claims that were clearly not anchored in reality. Reading it felt like I was having a stroke.</p> <p>I&#39;ve heard of LLM generated vulnerability reports, but this was my first encounter with one in the wild. Did anyone else come across CVE slop before? Why do people submit these? What do they hope to achieve?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre",

I just took and passed my ISC<sup>2</sup> CC cert, and I prepped via the official self paced course. I felt like it was mostly really easy, but I didn&#39;t feel like the course completely prepared me for the difficulty, or more accurately, the specificity of the questions. A good number of them seemed to be more in detail than the course material went into. I felt like the practice test was throwing soft ball questions in comparison. I have a BA in Cybersecurity, so I wasn&#39;t super worried about failing that exam since I had my uni knowledge to fall back on, but I&#39;m kinda worried about the SSCP since its been a few years since graduating.

I did Sec+ early mid 2025 and was able to land a job due to some prior network. I have worked for 10+ years in administrative capacity, which was totally unrelated to IT. I have been given an opportunity to get SC-200 and AZ-104 through some voucher. However, my company doesn&#39;t require or work on Microsoft. i feel i am not cut for the role of SOC analyst. It&#39;s rotational shift nature and constant anxiety of slack alerts is taking a toll on my mental health. Its just been an year as soc analyst and want to move to something better in terms of WLB. Does Cloud security offer better WLB per se than soc analyst? Also is it worth focusing on sc-200 or should i go for AWS , if my ulterior motive is to move into Cloud security? I help would be highly appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",
