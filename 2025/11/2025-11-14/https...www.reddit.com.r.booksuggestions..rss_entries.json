It\u2019s like Huxley installed a \u201cpermanent stability patch\u201d on humanity that nobody beta-tested properly. The world-building is wild, the pacing is smooth, and the whole time you\u2019ll be thinking, \u201cWow\u2026 this hits harder than my caffeine addiction.\u201d</p> <p>I read it right after 1984, which was a wild combo. If 1984 is about being crushed by Big Brother\u2019s boot, Brave New World is like being smothered with a soft, fluffy blanket you didn\u2019t ask for. Orwell warns you about fear and surveillance; Huxley warns you about pleasure and distraction. Together they basical",

But the new trailer is making me want to read a book <em>with that vibe</em>: a dramatic, high-intensity, angsty love story. I know I\u2019m not going to get that from the actual <em>Wuthering Heights</em> by Bront\u00eb, which is far more complex but whose \u201clove story\u201d isnt really what the trailer is giving.</p> <p>So\u2026 any recommendations? I\u2019m open to any time period (preferably no Jane Austen, Bront\u00eb sister) ideally with a HEA, but I\u2019m craving some intense yearning and good writing.

She really likes \u201cThe IIiad\u201d and \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d, the book she is currently reading is about Alexander the Great. She has an interest in the Greek and Roman empires and their mythology\u2019s. Does anyone have a specific recommendation for the best epic poem suitable for or related to these interests?

The only books l&#39;ve ever come close to finishing were school assignments, and those always felt like such a chore to me. After years of short-form content, movies, and TV shows, I feel like my attention span and cognitive abilities have taken a hit, and I really want to change that.
