That goes double if you have a big, oversized monitor, like <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2973491/get-a-45-inch-oled-ultrawide-gaming-monitor-for-800-off.html\">this one I just highlighted on sale</a>. Today Huanuo is offering <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DQ17ZGQP\">one that can hold up to 40 pounds (18 kilograms) for $55</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The arm comes from Huanuo, the discount comes from Amazon. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve used this particular model of reinforced arm myself, but all three of my gas-spring arms are similar, less heavy-duty designs from the same brand. And after five years on my desk, all three of them are rock steady. Normally $110, ",

That means you get a bigger, bolder picture to play on, without taxing your gaming desktop or laptop with more pixels to push. Today you can get a 45-inch OLED ultrawide from LG <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/product/lg-ultragear-45-oled-qhd-240hz-0-03ms-g-sync-freesync-premium-pro-smart-gaming-monitor-with-displayhdr-400-true-black/JJ8VPZWYXR/sku/6619493\">for $899.99</a>, a cool $800 off the original price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said, the LG Ultragear OLED 45GX90SA-B pulls a neat trick, blowing out the 3440\u00d71440 resolution and 21:9 aspect ratio normally found on 34-inch ultrawides all the way to 45 inches wide.

This is a further development of the sort of thing that Nvidia applied with DLSS years ago, now taken to greater heights with more complex lighting systems that can reduce noise and grit in ray tracing by rendering at a lower resolution and then upscaling in a very targeted manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p",
