Escorting the Akita Maru was two Akatsuki-class destroyers, Hibiki and Inazuma, flanking the sides of the cargo ship. Due to increased activities of the Spice Kings in and around Ithacarian waters led the imperial government to send escort ships with any civilian ship travelling through Ithacarian waters or ports. The Akatsuki-class was chosen for this role due to being lighter, faster and more manoeuvrable than larger, better protected ships like the Shiratsuyu-class, allowing it to easier intercept smaller vessels and engage larger ships. Their dual-purpose anti-aircraft guns can also track and destroy smaller pirate vessels, something the Shiratsuyu-class are unable to utilise. However, it was the Akita Maru\u2019s cargo than warranted the need of escorting as well.</em></p> <p><em>101,000 imperial firearms and ample amount of ammunition f",
