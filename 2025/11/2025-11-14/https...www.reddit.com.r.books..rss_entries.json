I l really enjoyed the first half, I haven\u2019t read this fast in a while and then the ending started to form\u2026 I got to the point where I saw how many pages I had left and was like there is noooo way to tie up all these loose ends in a reasonable matter with this amount of pages lol and I was right. Loose ends include - spoilers!!!</p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"> What\u2019s going to happen with her aunts blackmail? What story did the reporter have and why did Chloe want to tell it so bad? What did she already tell her? Who hit her adopted parents? Why did it also have to be a car accident? How are they going to find out about Julie? What were the other girls weaknesses that Bella Marie took advantage of? Iz??? The character felt incomplete</span> </p> <p>I still rate the book 10/10 but ",

It also has some exquisitely defined characters and strong scenes.</p> <p>The most beautifully realised part of this book (set around 2021) is where the protagonist, a failed playwright, recovering alcoholic, estranged father and current freelance journalist, hires an apartment in Africa and settles in with a cook a guard and a gardener, to wrestle together his 10,000-word piece on these undersea cables for an online publication. It&#39;s vital, visceral and real and there&#39;s some lovely developments. You get the sense of an author writing what they know. </p> <p>Then you step back and look at the character and the circumstance. You have to ask: why didn&#39;t you go home and write this in your flat. In, like, two nights, while also pitching your next story?</p> <p>McCann is a very successful novelist. The pa",

Libbie in the end? </p> <p>Also, why did Libbie bother marrying Harold and moving to Rhode Island if she was just gonna hide the pregnancy anyway? Like she very clearly did not want to be at Brookhants. Why not have the baby in France and peace out?</p> <p>I actually enjoyed this book for the most part, but I\u2019m bemused by these particular motivations (or lack thereof)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IndigoBlueBird\"> /u/IndigoBlueBird </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1owlwa3/i_finished_plain_bad_heroine",
