        "description": "This image shows two massive galaxy clusters. The vast number of galaxies and foreground stars in the image were captured by NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope in near-infrared light. Glowing, hot X-rays captured by NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory appear in pink. The blue represents the dark matter, which was precisely mapped by researchers with Webb\u2019s detailed imaging.",
