He joins us to talk about:\n\n1. Why he still recommends learning the C programming language in 2026\n2. How he intentionally nerfs hist student's coding editors and LLMs to help them learn fundamentals faster\n3. His vision for self-paced learning, and how it improves on traditional university education\n4.
