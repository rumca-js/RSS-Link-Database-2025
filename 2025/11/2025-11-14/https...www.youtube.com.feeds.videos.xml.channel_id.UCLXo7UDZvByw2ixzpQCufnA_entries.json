        "description": "\u201cIn space, no one can hear you scream.\u201d At least according to the movie Alien from 1979.\n\nBut there actually is a way to listen to space. Astronomers use things called  \u201csonifications,\u201d where they translate data into sound. This visualization is a sonification made by scientists at NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory of the center of the Milky Way. The piano represents infrared light, the violin represents visible light, and the glockenspiel represents X-ray light. And scientists we spoke to say listening to things like this can sometimes be better than looking at images for noticing new phenomena in space. #sound #space #nasa #violin #piano #glockenspiel #unexplainable #podcast\n\n\ud83c\udfa7Listen to this episode now, wherever you get your podcasts.\nhttps://www.vox.com/unexplainable\n\nWatch the full video of space sounds from NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory:\nhttps://chandra.si.edu/sound/gcenter.html\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (\ud83d\udd14) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.g",
