I love things like A Song of Ice and Fire, Lord of the Rings and Malazan, so maybe this book just isnt for me. Does it get better? Does anyone else feel like me, that it isnt like an EPIC fantasy like I thought? Also the writing feels kind of boring and a little plain. I mean absolutely no offence to anyone who might love this book, im just curius what other people think.</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MySerenityx\"> /u/MySerenityx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1oxccnb/the_poppy_war_does_onot_feel_like_fantasy_so_far/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1oxccnb/the_poppy_war_does_onot_feel_like_fantasy_so_far/\">[comments]</a></span>",

In fantasy I can often get dissapointed if I go into a more plot forward book with simpler writing (I had this experience with Brandon Sanderson for example).

Even the engine sounded muted for a second. It lasted maybe three seconds , but it felt like the book leaked into the real world. Like I wasn\u2019t just reading about the forest , I actually crossed its border without noticing.

I read a book a while back called Seize the Day: A World Conquest Isekai by J.V Simms. It was interesting not only in the premise of the story, but also in the morality of the main character. I don\u2019t want to give any spoilers if you want to read it, but the MC is batshit crazy and is just evil for the love of the game. It was kind of refreshing to read an MC who didn\u2019t have to justify their actions every time they did something evil, or care about how others see them. It also had me questioning my understanding of morality in the MCs I read about. Do I root for them because of their goal in the book and to see them grow as a person, or is it because it\u2019s simply a way to escape reality and l",

A lot of books that do this suffer from at least one POV being relatively boring making it feel like a slog, but I thought TSOTF managed to make all three plotlines very compelling, and once I got into any of them, I didn&#39;t want to leave. Switching POVs was still very frustrating though, and it&#39;s especially true for this book because of how disconnected the POVs are. The different versions of Vis are literally in separate worlds from each other, and the actions they take have very minimal effects on each other (unless they die) for most the story. It felt a little like I was reading three separate stories at the same time, which is going to be annoying regardless of how well they&#39;re written.</p> <h1>Res</h1> <p>Res is the most consistent and interesting of the three worlds since it has the characters and settings we already kn",
