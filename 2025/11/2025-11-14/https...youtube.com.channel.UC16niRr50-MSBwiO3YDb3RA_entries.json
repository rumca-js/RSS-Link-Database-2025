But with every technological leap forward comes new challenges.\n \nIn this episode, AI Decoded speaks to ethical-hacker and agentic AI security expert Max Corbridge and AI safety guru Connor Leahy. They discuss how these powerful tools could become weapons in the hands of hackers and what measures we can take to defend ourselves and our businesses.\n \nJoining presenter Christian Fraser is AI Decoded co-host Priya Lakhani, CEO of Century Tech.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#AI #Cybersecurity #BBCNews\n\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features vi",

An alleged $100m scheme, involving money laundering and kick backs, has led to the resignation of senior ministers and engulfed prominent allies of Volodymyr Zelensky. \n\nBut despite the president's public backing of the probe, questions are being asked about what government officials knew, just months after mass protests against controversial attempts to curb the independence of state anti-corruption bodies.\n \nThis week, Lucy Hockings and Vitaly Shevchenko are joined by Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse, and BBC Verify's Olga Robinson. They discuss the fallout from the fifteen-month investigation, and answer all of your questions. \n\nCould we see a western-backed referendum in the occupied territories? Will Ukraine reduce the age of conscription? And how much do Russia and the US cooperate beyond headline diplomacy?\n\nSubscribe",

        "description": "Four people have died and dozens more have been wounded in a wave of Russian drone and missile strikes on Kyiv, according to President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n \nCondemning the strikes as vile and calculated, Zelensky said about 430 drones and 18 missiles had been launched and dozens of high-rise buildings damaged.\n \nKyiv's energy infrastructure was badly hit, leaving some buildings in the capital without heat, officials said. Ukraine's air force said several other regions across the country were also targeted.\n \nThe Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk was hit in an overnight Ukrainian attack. Fire broke out at the major Sheskharis oil refinery, and a ship and apartment blocks were hit, officials said.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Ukraine #Russia #BBCNews",
