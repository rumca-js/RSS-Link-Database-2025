        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi. I bought a Clipper HAT Mini (LTE) for my Pi 5, and on boot it frequently doesn&#39;t supply the HAT with any power, and its doing this weird thing where all ssh connections just hang and timeout forcing me to reboot. I&#39;m using the official power brick for the pi 5, fresh install of the OS (full 64bit), and I&#39;ve tried the HAT on my pi4 which doesn&#39;t have an issue. </p> <p>Just wondering if I&#39;ve missed something or have I just gotten unlucky with a hardware issue?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BluDolphin213\"> /u/BluDolphin213 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1owmpd4/pi_5_not_powering_hats/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1owmpd4/pi_5_not_powering_hats/\">[comments]</a></span>",
