Many of the sick patients were evacuated before the war in Gaza began two years ago, and some are now afraid to return to the battered enclave, where 94% of hospitals there have been damaged or destroyed, according to the WHO. While most have agreed to return. The WHO told CNN that the organization had been asked by the Israeli military to facilitate the transfer of patients early next week. CNN Producer Abeer Salman reports on their cases. #CNN #news",
