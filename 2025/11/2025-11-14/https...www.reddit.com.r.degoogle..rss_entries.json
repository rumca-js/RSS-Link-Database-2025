The problem is that as part of the process of taking back ownership of all my things I have also transitioned to using jellyfin for media instead of Spotify which I used to use. The free Jellyfin app has some limitations for music, and so far I have been happy with using symfonium to access that (tried the trial version). I am reluctant to buy anything through the play store at the moment as I am uncertain if I&#39;ll be able to carry any of that over with me if I swap to for example Aurora.
