He told a story with photos of him and his friends going to some demo party, perhaps in Denmark or Germany. He mentioned hooking up their computers and monitors underneath a staircase on the ferry back to Sweden, and when they tried to set up on a swedish Mcdonalds using the restaurants electrical outlets they where scolded. I fondly remember the quote &quot;Anti-Mcdonalds demo was under production after that&quot;. </p> <p>So I have no idea who this guy was, or if he was part of some of the more prominent demo groups. Almost 30 years have past, site is most likely not online anymore, but would be really cool if this guy frequents a sub like this!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EuroLavaRiver\"> /u/EuroLavaRiver </a> <br/> <span",
