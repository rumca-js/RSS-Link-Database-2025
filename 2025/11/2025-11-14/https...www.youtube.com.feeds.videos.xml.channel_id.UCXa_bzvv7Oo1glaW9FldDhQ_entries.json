        "description": "Rennsport has been talked about quite a lot among racing enthusiasts since its 2022 announcement. But now that the game is here, do Competition Company and Teyon get things right in their pilot effort at an authentic racing sim?\n\nYes, it does, at least in the simulation and the actual racing departments. Tearing up the wide selection of tracks on offer is easier said than done, and this is a game that's going to push your driving skills to their limit. However, the game is light on content and saddled with odd microtransaction prices that are likely to put many players off from experiencing it.",

        "description": "Valve is making some big moves in the gaming hardware space, and it looks like Steam is ready to welcome a busy year ahead in 2026. The Steam Frame, Steam Machine, and a new Steam Controller are the latest additions to a line up that's been a major presence in modern gaming. \n\nBut do these new devices have what it takes to beat the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, the Meta Quest 3, and the PSVR2? Their spec sheets seem to say yes, while their software comes with some unique capabilities that could bring all of your best gaming experiences to a host of devices that let you take them with you in a shape and form that makes them accessible. That's clever, and also an interesting twist to the fading console wars.",

        "description": "Sometimes, it feels like publishers have a mortal reason for re-releasing their games, like a Dorian Gray situation. Almost like it slows their ageing so they can stay in the business and \u2013 what else? - keep re-releasing their games. So after Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition and its myriad of problems, Rockstar Games has announced the most natural re-release of...Red Dead Redemption 1. No, you didn't mishear. The first Red Dead Redemption.\n\nIt's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2nd. Granted, an ESRB rating earlier in the day offered some advance notice, but the surprising bit is that it's also coming to iOS and Android. Not to keep, of course. More on that in a bit, because it kind of explains this whole deal.",
