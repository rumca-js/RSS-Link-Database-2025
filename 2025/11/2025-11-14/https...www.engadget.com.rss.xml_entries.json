Similarly, dealing with larger hordes of energy-sucking Metroids could get pretty frustrating, again due to a lack of precision.&nbsp;</p><p>But the main feeling I came away from the game with was excitement over a fully modernized Metroid Prime experience.

At first, it could <em>only</em> stream games from your PlayStation 5, it lacked core features for a handheld like Bluetooth audio and it felt a bit overpriced at $200 for such a limited product. Add on the fact that home streaming can be notoriously unreliable, since it depends entirely on your ISP and home networking setup, and the Portal simply didn&#39;t make much sense.
