        "description": "A collaborative European research team led by physicists from Slovak Academy of Sciences has theorized a new approach to control spin currents in graphene by coupling it to a ferroelectric In2Se3 monolayer. Using first-principles and tight-binding simulations, the researcher showed that the ferroelectric switching of In2Se3 can reverse the direction of the spin current in graphene acting as an electrical spin switch. This discovery offers a novel pathway toward energy-efficient, nonvolatile, and magnet-free spintronic devices, marking a key step toward the fabrication of next-generation spin-based logic and memory systems to control spin textures.",

Yet current control efforts face growing challenges, driven by rising insecticide resistance and the limited availability of effective vaccines. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms that govern mosquito reproduction has become essential to addressing this public health crisis.",
