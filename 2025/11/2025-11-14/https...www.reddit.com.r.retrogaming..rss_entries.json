It started with wondering why some Nintendo seals of quality on the box are black and some are white and determined that was due to release year. Now I\u2019m wondering how many years did certain NES games continue to be manufactured and released? Say the original Mario for example, released in 85\u2019, how many years did it continue to be put out ? It appears 85\u2019-89\u2019 would have the black seal and then I know there\u2019s white seal Mario box\u2019s so I\u2019m assuming into the 90s. Anyway just looking for some info on this. Are there any resources that would show a breakdown of the games and their initial release year and final year? Maybe that\u2019s reaching. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/wishka\"> /u/wishka </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ox4mdm/manufacture_and_release_years_for_nes_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a h",

However, after doing the research, I am finding these are all garbage. People note that they lag a lot, or they simply stop working after a short period of time. So, I turned to looking at consoles or sticks for the TV. I am finding a mix of answers on these. Some \u2018consumer review\u2019 pages say good things, and others all shun them. I\u2019m curious if anyone has any emulator consoles that they find worth it. The next suggestion was a mini PC with Batocera OS, which is where I start to lose comprehension of how it all works. I\u2019m open to trying that if anyone can help me out with the setup or direct me to a good youtube to watch. Games I\u2019m interested in playing are below, but I would be open to so many more that I haven\u2019t listed. Maybe there is a much easier way to obtain these as I do have an Xbox One X.</p> <p>Mario Kart 64<br/> Kirby\u2019s Dreamland 3<br/> Sonic the Hedgehog<br/",

I\u2019m just wondering what it is about their ads that has me raising an eyebrow. </p> <p>My initial question is if they know much about retro gaming besides selling. Or if they\u2019re Mormon. I don\u2019t mean either as an insult. I\u2019m just wondering what their story is, as something feels a little off base with what I normally come across in this sector. </p> <p>Curious to know if anyone else thinks this. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MiserableEggplant666\"> /u/MiserableEggplant666 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ox0lf2/dkoldies_ads_seem_strange_to_me_why/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ox0lf2/dkoldies_ads",

I was super stoked for this one, but after putting the disc in, the screen goes totally black and the console will eject the disc tray after a few seconds. It doesn\u2019t sound like the drive is spinning or anything inside other than a couple rhythmic beeps every now and then. The console then goes thru the whole space themed startup as shown. Capacitors? Drive itself? The disc isn\u2019t perfect, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad enough to where it wouldn\u2019t be readable at all.

They were laid out flat, and then on the back of the tables he had a 3 or 4 tier rack with even more titles. None of these were in boxes, and every game had a custom printed sticker with some related artwork and the title. If the game was larger than one disk they were bound together with a rubber band. I purchased many! Doom, Heretic, Rise of the Triad, Need For Speed, Decent, Radix: Beyond the Void...</p> <p>I just wanted to tell everyone about this memory. It was a different time, I time that I miss that we&#39;ll never have again. </p> <p>That table blew me away as a kid. Did you have a similar guy in your mall? And if you did, do you still have any of those original, bootleg Floppies? I would love to hear about your experience,",
