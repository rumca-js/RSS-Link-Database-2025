        "description": "This holiday season on @disneyplus, prepare to go where no wimpy kid has gone before. \n\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw available December 5.\n\n In the trailer, Greg continually finds himself at odds with his dad\u2019s outsized expectations. As pressure builds to turn his act around after a series of hilarious near disasters, Greg\u2019s dad presents him with an ultimatum\u2014and a trip to wilderness camp\u2014that just might challenge Greg\u2019s wimpy ways for good. The animated family misadventure is directed by Matt Danner (\u201cLegend of the Three Caballeros\u201d) and written and produced by award-winning series creator Jeff Kinney. \n\n \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw\u201d is the fourth animated feature adaptation in the series to debut on Disney+ following \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid\u201d (2021), \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules\u201d (2022) and \u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid Christmas: Cabin Fever\u201d (2023).\n\nSocial \nX: @DisneyPlus\nInstagram: @DisneyPlus\nFacebook: @DisneyPlus\nTikTok: @DisneyPlus\n\n\u25ba SUBSCRIBE to the channel t",
