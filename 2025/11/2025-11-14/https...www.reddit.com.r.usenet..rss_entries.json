I was trying to find Usenet indexers in the wiki and checked NBZFriends and was concerned about the search terms showing up when you click the cartoons section on the homepage for obvious reasons. I was curious if anyone knew what is leading to these search terms and if other indexers are trusted/moderated. Want to support good indexers and not this.
