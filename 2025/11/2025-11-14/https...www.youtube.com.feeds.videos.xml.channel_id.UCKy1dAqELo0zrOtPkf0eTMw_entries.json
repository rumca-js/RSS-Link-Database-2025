        "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign reviewed by Simon Cardy.\n\nBucking the usual trend of breaks between numbered sequels, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is following just 12 months on from Black Ops 6, and you\u2019d perhaps assume that meant only small tweaks to what was one of the series\u2019 high points last year. But the teams at Raven and Treyarch evidently don\u2019t see it that way, and have instead built one of the most unconventional CoD campaigns to date. In many ways, it doesn\u2019t even feel like a CoD single-player mode. It\u2019s more like a multiplayer experiment squeezed into a campaign shell, playing best when you\u2019re accompanied by squadmates, echoing Zombies or the now-defunct DMZ at times. I recently criticised Battlefield 6\u2019s single-player for playing it safe and not taking any risks, and to Black Ops 7\u2019s credit, the same can\u2019t be said here. The problem, however, is that not many of its big swings hit, resulting in one of Call of Duty\u2019s most intriguing, yet flawed campaigns.",
