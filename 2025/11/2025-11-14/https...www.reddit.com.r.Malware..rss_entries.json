The code is heavily obfuscated in hex, which feels odd for an npm package, even if it\u2019s closed\u2011source.</p> <p>How can I test to see more danger actions ? It is a heavy used thirdparty service used by most big vendors, so I do not want to leave this without spending some time researching</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Federal-Dot-8411\"> /u/Federal-Dot-8411 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https",

Thankfully i acted fast and think ive done everything i need to to stay safe but i was wondering if anyone who is more knowledgeable could look into it and see what it really is i downloadedand opened. This is the website i got it from. Mostly just curious how deep it really goes, what happened was as soon as i ran it they were on my discord account sending msgs and alittle while later just before i changed my google password they send me a picture of them being logged into to my google account. Nothing has happened since. Sorry if this is not the place but im just really curious what it is i downloaded and ran (and how deep it infected my pc)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/blader8844\"> /u/blader8844 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/bgdppq8rk41g1.jpeg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ma",
