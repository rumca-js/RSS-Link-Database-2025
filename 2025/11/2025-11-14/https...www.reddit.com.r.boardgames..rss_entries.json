I&#39;m using OnShape as the CAD program to draw in. As I learn different features, I use that knowledge to design things for various purposes. I recently learned how to do a Wrap and Circular pattern. It was a great chance to make a cup with a very nice hex pattern on it for a satisfying feeling while holding the cup. I&#39;ve posted the models up free on MakerWorld here: <a href=\"https://makerworld.com/en/models/1997037-liar-s-dice-game-set#profileId-2149803\">Liar&#39;s Dice Set</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <",

This one ends up feeling more like being at a horse track where all you really do is place bets. The betting isn\u2019t as fun, real-time, or as varied as something like Ready Set Bet, and the tiny bit of agency you get from playing one card doesn\u2019t feel meaningful. You basically have to luck into the right cards to slow down the hotdog and hope they come out at the perfect moment. Most of the time the safest play is just betting on whoever has the strongest cards showing at the start of the race, because it\u2019s really hard to knock the strong ones off their line.
