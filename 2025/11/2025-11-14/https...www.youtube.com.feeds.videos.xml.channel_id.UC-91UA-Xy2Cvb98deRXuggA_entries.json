In this video, I break down the funniest and cringiest employee anniversary \u201ccelebrations,\u201d from 35-year loyalty awards that amount to a LinkedIn selfie to companies giving workers 10 minutes in Costco like it\u2019s a game show.\n\nWhy do companies act like employees choose whether they get fired?
