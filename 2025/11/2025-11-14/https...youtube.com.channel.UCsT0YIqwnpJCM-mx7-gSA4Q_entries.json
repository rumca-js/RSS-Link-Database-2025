        "description": "Psychologist and memory researcher John Wixted challenges the widely held belief that eyewitness testimony is inherently unreliable in criminal investigations, and explains the importance of uncontaminated memory tests.\n\nJohn Wixted is a Distinguished Professor in the Department of Psychology at UC San Diego. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from Emory University in 1987 and has been a professor at UC San Diego ever since. His research addresses fundamental mechanisms of human memory, both in the lab and in the real world. In recent years, his work has focused on signal-detection models of recognition memory, the neuroscience of memory and amnesia, and eyewitness identification. Professionally, he has served as editor-in-chief of Psychonomic Bulletin & Review (1998-2002), and he later edited the 5-volume 4th edition of the venerable Stevens' Handbook of Experimental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience (2018). In 2011, he was the recipient of the Howard Crosby Warren Medal ",

In this cinematic, soul-searching talk, Ry Shorosky, a trucker, photographer, and filmmaker, shares what a decade on the road taught him about storytelling, masculinity, grief, and grace. From building trust inside a Nevada brothel to witnessing resilience on the edge of nowhere, Shorosky invites us to see America not through headlines, but through human connection.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just about capturing the perfect image. It\u2019s about showing up when the camera\u2019s off - and choosing to listen.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nRy Shorosky is a long-haul trucker turned photographer and director whose visual storytelling has been featured by Polaroid, Apple, and The New York Times. Blending blue-collar grit with quiet observation, Ry explores overlooked places and the people who inhabit them. His work is rooted in empathy, presence, and the belief that the most powerful stories often live outside the frame. Ry Shorosky is an ",

With powerful verse, personal narrative, and data-driven insight, he unpacks the lived experiences of Black men in higher education, and how traditional academic systems often fail to reflect their realities.\n\nRaised in Las Vegas and shaped by both scholarship and storytelling, Wright challenges us to see poetry not as a supplement to teaching, but as a form of teaching itself. He reveals how verse can debunk stereotypes, center joy, and unlock deeper learning in ways exams and lectures can\u2019t.\n\nAt the intersection of intellect and identity, this talk redefines what it means to educate - and who gets to define knowledge in the first place.\n\nAbout the Speaker: Dr. Kevin L.

In this raw and riveting spoken word performance, Rodney Lee unpacks how toxic masculinity scripts boys into cycles of violence, repression, and isolation. Drawing from his own life and his work inside Nevada\u2019s only maximum-security juvenile prison, Lee explores how phrases like \u201cman up\u201d become mandates for emotional detachment - with devastating consequences.\n\nThrough poetic storytelling and lived experience, he invites us to redefine strength: not through dominance, but through empathy, vulnerability, and connection. This is more than a reflection - it\u2019s a call to rewrite what we teach boys about manhood before it\u2019s too late.\n\nAbout the Speaker: \nRodney Lee is a poet, educator, and mentor who teaches English at Nevada\u2019s only maximum-security prison for juvenile boys.

En mi rol de coordinadora he visto c\u00f3mo una familia casi pierde el sue\u00f1o de una hija por no poder pagar un examen, o c\u00f3mo un estudiante con gran vocaci\u00f3n tuvo que abandonar la carrera para sostener a su hogar. Por eso impuls\u00e9 junto a mi equipo un centro de cuidado diario para que madres y estudiantes puedan estudiar mientras sus hijos est\u00e1n seguros, y he acompa\u00f1ado historias dur\u00edsimas como la de una alumna que busca justicia por el femicidio de su hermana. Trabajar con estudiantes amaz\u00f3nicos, que cruzan r\u00edos y realidades muy duras para educarse, me record\u00f3 que la educaci\u00f3n rompe fronteras y es tambi\u00e9n una forma de resistir.

Resignificar los imprevistos y responder desde la curiosidad y la autenticidad.\nPero como todo juego, hay reglas, turnos, piezas y objetivos donde cada uno construye su propia estrategia mientras el juego mismo sucede.\nDar cabida a la improvisaci\u00f3n en nuestra vida, es reconocer que no todo plan est\u00e1 libre de inconvenientes, invit\u00e1ndonos a abrir una v\u00eda de respuesta que aproveche las posibilidades que surgen de la limitaci\u00f3n. \nPero para aprovechar esta capacidad, primero debemos liberarla de los estigmas y miedos alrededor de ella.

Con mis alumnos amaz\u00f3nicos, que no dominaban el espa\u00f1ol, tuve que cambiar mi forma de ense\u00f1ar, volver a recursos simples, usar el cuerpo, el entorno y su propia realidad para que no solo aprendan, sino entiendan. Ellos me mostraron que donde yo ve\u00eda carencia hab\u00eda abundancia de saberes, que con hojas, semillas y la selva se puede hacer pedagog\u00eda significativa. Al ganar su confianza, dejaron de callar por verg\u00fcenza y empezaron a preguntar, apoyarse en m\u00ed y creer en s\u00ed mismos.

Comprendo que mi realidad es el resultado de lo que pienso repetidamente, de las emociones que eso genera y de las acciones que tomo, y que mi prop\u00f3sito se conecta con lo que amo hacer, lo que el mundo necesita, por lo que me pueden pagar y mis talentos (mi propio ikigai).
