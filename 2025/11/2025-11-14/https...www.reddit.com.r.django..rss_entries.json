I&#39;ve created a GitHub repository for implementing row-level tenant isolation in Django projects.</p> <p>I was working on a project that needed database row-level isolation without adding external libraries or risking project stability. This solution does exactly that. It&#39;s ideal for incremental implementations, micro-SaaS applications, and quick setup.</p> <p>Here&#39;s how to use it: simply copy the repository contents into your project and add the `implementation-prompt.md` file to your prompts.
