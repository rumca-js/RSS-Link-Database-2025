        "description": "Who needs a precisely machined firearm? The ammunition is where all the magic happens anyways...\n\n\n\"Improvised firearms (sometimes called zip guns, pipe guns, or slam guns) are firearms manufactured by an entity other than a registered firearms manufacturer or a gunsmith. Improvised firearms are typically constructed by adapting existing materials to the purpose. They range in quality, from crude weapons that are as much a danger to the user as the target, to high-quality arms produced by cottage industries using salvaged and repurposed materials.\nImprovised firearms may be used as tools by criminals and insurgents and are sometimes associated with such groups; other uses include self-defense in lawless areas and hunting game in poor rural areas.\"\n\nMore on Wikipedia: \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_firearm\n\nJoin membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join\nSecond Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA\nMerch: https://qxi",
