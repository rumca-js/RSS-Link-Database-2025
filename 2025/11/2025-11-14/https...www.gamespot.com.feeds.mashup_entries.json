It includes a new map called Stella Montis, which was locked behind a community event that had to be finished first. However, Arc Raiders players didn't waste any time and unlocked Stella Montis in under 38 hours.</p><p>To reach Stella Montis--a map located in the \"cold pristine\" part of the Rust Belt, players had to donate a sizable amount of resources to tunnel through to that location. On <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders\">Discord</a>, Embark noted that it raised the requirements to enter Stella Montis because players were being more generous with resources than the studio anticipated.

If not for snippets of gameplay, Dispatch would simply be a great TV show that I would want to tune into every week.

The original line of Steam Machine mini-PCs launched back in 2015, but poor sales eventually saw these devices fade quietly into the background. So what's to stop history from repeating itself? According to Valve, a better video game catalogue and an effort to give developers an easier time when porting games over to the new Steam Machine are some of the key factors that the company has focused on.</p><p>\"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers\u2019 lives a lot easier.
