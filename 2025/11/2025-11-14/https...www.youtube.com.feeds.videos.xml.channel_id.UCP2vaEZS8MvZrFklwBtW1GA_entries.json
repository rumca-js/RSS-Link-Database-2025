        "description": "PVC pipe cutting and work glove tips\u2026This 4 inch PVC is protecting my shower P-Trap. I\u2019m cutting it with an oscillating multi-tool and carbide blade. The Ironclad Command Microfoam Nitrile Dotted gloves are great for handling tools. Plus they have an A5 cut rating which protects hands from sharp objects like screws or nails.
