Some games are pretty old or can be found for pretty cheap on code resellers, so the issue is definitely not getting back my games, I\u2019ll just buy most of them. But how about my save data?</p> <p>I\u2019m coming from an Xbox, so the only way i could buy digital games is via the Microsoft store. Theoretically, if I: -install a secondary windows partition on the steam machine via external drive, -set up windows there with all my games -back up the save data with Xbox play anywhere -back up the locally downloaded save",

That perfect for hades but booting enshrouded in proton 9 I just get a black screen. The UI is there but everything is blank. It tried all the standard trouble shooting tips, windowed mode, disabling and enabling steam input and all that but I can&#39;t get the controller to work with proton GE latest or experimental. It seems like it&#39;s a problem with experimental and I was hoping someone else has had the same issue. The exact behaviour is the controller works when you load the game, it works for about three minutes and then just stops working. It&#39;s the same behaviour with Hades and Enshrouded. I&#39;ll try it with mass effect 2 and BG3 now and edit this post to see if I can reproduce the problem. I use Nvidia btw. </p> <p>Edit Bazzite Nvidia",

I have been working on some unity stuff that uses the native inputs of the dualshock 4 and the switch pro controller, mostly to utilize the gyroscope in both of these devices. The unity application works without issues on windows, and on linux I can run it through proton (no steam input of course) and have the ds4 register just fine... yet for some reason the switch pro controller does not, like no inputs go through.</p> <p>It is really bizarre cause I made a linux native version of the same unity app, and though the gyro doesn&#39;t work (unity limitations lol) the buttons for the switch pro controller do work through the native app, and my computer can clearly see the controller, so the controller itself, my computer and Unity should not be to blame. I even installed these udev rules to make sure it was visible: <a href=\"https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/game-devices-udev\">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/game-devices-udev</a></p> <p",
