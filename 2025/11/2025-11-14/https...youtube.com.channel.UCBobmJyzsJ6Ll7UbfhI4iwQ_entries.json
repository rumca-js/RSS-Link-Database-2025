        "description": "This session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025 demonstrates the next-generation navigation that integrates Unreal Engine with the in-vehicle map display module of Hyundai AutoEver, a high-quality display with a realistic map and gameplay-like screen composition. \n\nAutoEver\u2019s navigation engine converts online map data into data for Unreal Engine's Scene Graph, from which rendering is performed in Unreal Engine to enable rendering key elements such as map backgrounds, buildings, and route lines in real-time.\n\nTopics include the overall rendering pipeline, including how materials are applied to objects; Hyundai's decision to use vector tiles instead of converting all global map data into 3D assets, to reduce data transmission volume; the company's novel approach for converting vector tiles into Unreal Objects; and methods used to overcome performance issues encountered while applying this new engine to the embedded system.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#HMI, ",
