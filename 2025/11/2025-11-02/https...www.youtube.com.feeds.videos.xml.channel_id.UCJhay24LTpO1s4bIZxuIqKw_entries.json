Providing useful and reusable libraries means stepping outside the C++ syntax to consider other kinds of interfaces provided by our C++ projects.\n\nThis talk goes beyond the C++ syntax to fill in these gaps through an exploration of the other kinds of interfaces and contracts that are implicitly and explicitly provided by C++ projects.\n\nDuring this discussion, contract-based thinking will be applied to the parts of C++ projects that are not C++ source code.
