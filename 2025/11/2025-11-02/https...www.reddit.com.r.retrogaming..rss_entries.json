I\u2019m not a diehard gamer, but I\u2019ve always found more joy in older ones...</p> <p>Anyway, my dilemma is that I\u2019ve gathered a pretty sizable collection, but gaming itself has slowly faded from my life. We\u2019re renovating our house, and space is tight. Almost everything is boxed up in the attic, and the complete renovation is a long-term project (we think about 10+ years). Even if we finish, I don&#39;t think there will be room enough for my collection.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t gamed in months, and I don\u2019t miss it (for now). So, I\u2019m considering selling (almost) all of it. The money would help with the house. But I have mixed feelings because profit was never my goal. My girlfriend is convinced I\u2019ll regret it over time, but I\u2019m starting to feel like I\u2019ve outgrown this hobby. I\u2019d rather own things we both enjoy because she\u2019s not into gaming at all.<",
