        "description": "Schluter KERDI-LINE linear drain installation tips\u2026I installed the channel support and compress it into thin-set mortar with a wood float. This should be even or slightly below the shower tray. Then I apply mortar to the support and embed the channel body which should be level lengthwise. I use the KERDI trowel to add thin-set to the tray and compress the KERDI collar into that to waterproof the connections. This linear drain should look pretty awesome with the floor tile.
