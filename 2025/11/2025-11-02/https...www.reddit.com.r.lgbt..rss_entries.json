Maybe we shouldn&#39;t make one gender the center of our lives, and assume that if you&#39;re attracted to men, that you&#39;re inheritently male centered, and therefore a &quot;spicystraight&quot; or an &quot;an evil bisexual or straight woman&quot; I just honestly hate the double standards and stereotypes, and making your life revolve around one gender.

Like I\u2019d be the \u201cdifferent\u201d one.</p> <p>But lately, I\u2019ve realized I\u2019ve kinda become part of the same stereotype I thought I\u2019d break. I shave my body. I want to paint my nails. I don\u2019t really talk in a super feminine or dramatic way, but people still point out that my hand gestures or expressions \u201cdon\u2019t scream man.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s weird, because none of this feels forced or fake. It\u2019s just what feels natural to me. But then I catch myself wondering if I\u2019m living authentically or just slipping into what society expects a gay guy to be.</p> <p>Anyone else ever felt like this?

It makes me uncomfortable, plus high schoolers can just be really weird about other people\u2019s relationships, especially queer relationships, and some of the comments I got last time about our relationship or my queerness made me uncomfortable. She agreed immediately and shared some of those sentiments.</p> <p>However, since then she\u2019s been very touchy-feely in public and kissed my cheek to say goodbye (and asked to again). I would normally appreciate this, but in public, especially around friends, family, and classmates, it mainly makes me feel uncomfortable and I hate that some of those feelings are transferring onto her in my head.</p> <p>Would it be unfair to tell her that in public I only want to hug and maybe hold hands when we\u2019re sitting beside each other?",

I remember when i was a lil kid how i\u2019d be jealous of the marvel character storm\u2019s outfit (she was on my bedroom wallpaper lol) and how i sneakily put on my moms heels when i was like 8, and how i\u2019d played with dolls when i used to go to an after school babysitter. I thought nothing of this. I also remember when i was like 11 i secretly dated a gay guy, he was so sweet and i miss him kinda lol. I\u2019ve borrowed my moms clothes secretly since around 2022. At first i thought nothing of it then like last year i started putting pieces together and i was like oh shit, i think i\u2019m a girl! For a year and a bit now i\u2019ve had not much dysphoria but i guess \u201cwants and needs\u201d like i\u2019ve desired feminine looks and hair and stuff, but the downstairs part doesn\u2019t really annoy me ig. I get super envious of t girls and im so scared and worried idk what to do, any advice or help is like ",

Not knowing what to do with that info since she isn&#39;t as close to him as she is to me, she told me. I have know and been friends with the guy for almost 20 years and he has never hinted at the fact he may be gay so he may be afraid of telling us. Now i dont want to make him feel cornered or forced to come out but i also dont want him to think our friend group would drop him if he came out which is stopping him from coming out. Should i drop hints about us not caring about peoples sexualities or should I tell him directly that i know and don&#39;t care? Our whole friend group is cis straight guys so i cant count on them picking up on hints and i dont want to tell them since im not even supposed to know. What would make him more comfortable in coming out according to you guys who may have been in his spot or currently",
