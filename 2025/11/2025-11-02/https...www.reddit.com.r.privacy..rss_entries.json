        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Well, this post is the older sibling of another one that should already be on this subreddit, so I\u2019ll keep it brief: I want to receive donations on two platforms: BuyMeACoffee and Liberapay; Ghost is also an option, but I prefer those two. The issue is that I don\u2019t want to use any service that requires KYC, especially since Wise is based in the United Kingdom and we all know the country\u2019s privacy track record. I\u2019m Latin American, which is why Wise was my best option for receiving donations in any currency, but I think that\u2019s now ruled out. When I thought I\u2019d settle for Global66, I discovered Privacy and its virtual cards. I\u2019d like to be able to receive money directly there, then move it to something like Global66, and from there to my bank account, although I\u2019m not sure whether not being a U.S. resident will affect me. Can anyone help me with this? please, i need it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",
