This is all sort out but my malwarebytes is showing up that rundll32.exe wants to connect to some site. The site is ,,<a href=\"http://mi.huffproofs.com/\">mi.huffproofs.com</a>,, (which is probably phising site idk). So I want to ask what is it? is it safe? and if it is not safe how do I get rid of it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Responsible-Bag7906\"> /u/Responsible-Bag7906 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1omsds3/rundll32exe_tries_to_connect_to_potential_phising/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1omsds3/rundll32exe_tries_to_connect_to_potential_phising/\">[comments]</a></span>",

It looked like a pretty advanced project \u2014 letting you inspect kernel callbacks, drivers, threads, handles, etc.</p> <p>But recently, everything seems to have vanished:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>GitHub user and repo</strong> are both gone.</li> <li>The <strong>official website</strong> (<code>openark.blackint3.com</code>) is offline.</li> <li>The <strong>Discord server</strong> is empty or wiped.</li> </ul> <p>Does anyone know what happened here? Was the project quietly discontinued, taken down for some reason, or maybe even found to be compromised or infected so the author deleted everything to cover traces?</p> <p>Would appreciate any info, context. Thanks!</p> <p>Webarchive: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250923104625/htt",
