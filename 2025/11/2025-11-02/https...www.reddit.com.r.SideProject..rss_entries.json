This is a side hustle where you basically collect free recurring rewards from sweepstakes sites to collect at least ~$400+ a month.</p> <p><strong>The quicker and profitable part of this side hustle is farming the welcome offers from the sites, which makes almost $1.5k per month. To make it as easy as possible, here is the exec summary of this:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Sites will offer you a steep discounted offer for &quot;SC&quot; (coins that can be exchanged for real money). You can simply buy these packages at crazy rates like $15 for 40 SC ($40).</li> <li>Now that you have 40 SC, you will be required to play this amount through once, in order to redeem it to your bank",

It can be a quick way to make some extra cash if you&#39;re struggling. It&#39;s called <strong>bonus arbitrage</strong>.</p> <p>Essentially, some companies spend so much on customer acquisition that they sometimes overpay or make mistakes, and you can profit from it. You&#39;re literally just exploiting that inefficiency for profit.</p> <p><strong>Here&#39;s a perfect example that takes 5 minutes (or even less):</strong></p> <p>SoFi (the fintech company) pays platforms $75 to bring them someone who creates an account and makes a deposit, and they <strong>only</strong> require a $25 deposit to qualify.</p> <p>So you deposit $25, they pay you $75. That&#39;s it. Takes about 3-4 minutes total.</p> <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p> <ol> <li> Sign up: <a href=\"https://gemsloot.com/?aff=shg\"><strong>Gemsloot</strong></a> <em>(this is the platform we use for arbitrage)</em></li>",

I almost quit three times.</p> <p>What kept me going: realizing people don\u2019t need more apps, they need <strong>simpler solutions that fit their routines</strong>.</p> <p>Some lessons so far:</p> <ul> <li>Solve a real problem you personally feel.

I spend a few minutes every day collecting free daily bonuses from sweepstakes sites. It&#39;s a popular and legitimate side hustle right now. </p> <p>Basically, you just log in and claim about $1 from each site. It only takes me about 5 minutes to run through my list, and it builds up to around $600 a month. There&#39;s no catch... it&#39;s just how these sites are legally required to operate (they need to give out &quot;free entry&quot;). </p> <p>A lot of people are skeptical at first, but it&#39;s completely transparent and it works. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions about it! </p> <p><strong>\u27a1\ufe0f For the full list of sites and my free guide on how to start, you can find the link here</strong> <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/lionpenguin\"><strong>https://linktr.ee/lionpenguin</strong></a> <strong>:)</strong> </p> <p>The guide is",

But if you\u2019re up for trying it out or sharing your thoughts, I\u2019d be super grateful.</p> <p>If this kind of post isn\u2019t allowed here, no worries. I\u2019ll take it down right away. I just wanted to show my project to people who might find it useful.</p> <p>A little about FlashFind: I made it because I kept getting lost in a sea of tabs every time I tried to research something. Looking up tiny bits of info from a bunch of sites took forever, and it got old fast. So, I figured, why not build something that makes that process easier?</p> <p>Here\u2019s what FlashFind does:</p> <p>\u2014 Lets you instantly search highlighted text on Google, YouTube, Wikipedia, o",
