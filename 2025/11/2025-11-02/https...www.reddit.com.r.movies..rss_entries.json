The movie is set in a post-apocalyptic setting about a group of nine sentient rag dolls, known as &quot;Stitchpunks,&quot; who are the last remnants of life on Earth after humanity has been wiped out by malevolent machines. It came out in 2009, the movie mainly focuses on the character &quot;9&quot;, the youngest of the group, who awakens shortly after the end of humanity. The movie was pretty scary to me when it first released in theaters, but the plot was great. Sadly, though it didn&#39;t get a sequel due to mixed reviews, you should check it out though! 10/10 recommend \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\uddd1\ud83c\udffd\u200d\ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc44</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kidcjcool\"> /u/kidcjcool </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1om9he4/16_years_ago_this_movie_came_out_and_its_s",
