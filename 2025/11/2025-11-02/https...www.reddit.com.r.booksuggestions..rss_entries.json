Also enjoyed Poul Anderson\u2019s fantasy stuff. </p> <p>Also open to nonfiction stories that are good if they end happy, and are overall pretty lighthearted.

I haven&#39;t listened to audiobooks in a long time but I&#39;m going to bring at least 2 along. I&#39;m looking for something that is soothing that doesn&#39;t contain a car accident or similar, perhaps with a great narrator. I love a bit of humor, a fantastic plot, and a gorgeous setting. I need to not cry while driving so no great pain or tragedies, please.</p> <p>My favorite books are The Secret History by Donna Tartt, The Brothers Karamozov, My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, Galapagos by Vonnegut, Bel Canto by Ann Patchett, Touching the Void by Joe Simpson, Ficciones by Borges, Like Water for Chocolate by Laura Esquivel, I Know This Much is True by Wally Lamb, The Crimson Petal and the White by Faber, and Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston.</p> <p>I have already read Project Hail Mary (4 stars), and The Poisonwood ",

I have to reread pages multiple times which ends up taking me an hour+ to get through 10 pages. Since I love fantasy most start out slow and aren&#39;t very fast faced which I&#39;m usually okay with but recently it&#39;s been rough and causes me to stop reading all together.</p> <p>So... looking for a book that will help me fall in love with reading again and hopefully give me the push to get through less fast paced books.

As silly as it sounds, I have struggled to read my whole life. In elementary school whenever we would go to the library, I\u2019d get the same graphic novels (I would just look at the pictures). I am now a college student about to transfer to a university soon and I feel a little embarrassed of my reading skills. Books are SO great and have so many benefits. On top of my poor reading skills, I also have a terrible attention span (TikTok and reels have fried my brain cells). Reading is genuinely just hard for me. Enough rambling though! I have decided to ask you all. What are some book recommendations? I am interested in sci-fi, romance, action/war, history, and mystery/crime. Something life changing! Something that will make me want to keep reading!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CiaranSoCute\"> /u/CiaranSoCute </a> <br/> <span>",

When the war begins about 500 pages in I was thinking &quot;wait, how did a failed painter learn military strategy?&quot; Kershaw answers the question in one sentence (&quot;he read some stuff in his free time&quot;) and then goes back to WW2 fun facts.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for a biography that is actually a biography. How did he learn stuff, when did the antisemitism kick in, what did he read, who where his friends etc. A description of the person which lets the war take the back seat. Does this book exist?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/saunaswimmer34\"> /u/saunaswimmer34 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggesti",

And I really want to get back into it. But I don\u2019t know where to start. I used to read a lot of fantasy books like the famous five, Mallory towers, Harry Potter, a series of unfortunate events. Those were my favourite books I read and the ones that stuck with me the most. Basically if you were me what book would you pick to ease back into reading? Also do I buy books or just use a library?

Some say <em>Crucial Conversations</em> is like tactical communication training, super actionable and great for work conflicts. Others say <em>Nonviolent Communication</em> is more of a spiritual rewiring that teaches you how to listen for what people <em>need</em> rather than what they <em>say</em>. And <em>How to Know a Person</em> sounds more philosophical, about actually seeing people instead of analyzing them.</p> <p>I want to pick the one that gives the biggest real-world impact. Not",
