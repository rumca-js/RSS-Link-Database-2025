We played about 8-9 scenarios, I believe in easy mode, 3 melee and 1 range, and I played Static.</p> <p>First, for combat, the board is very crowded, we are more or less stay there and roll dice dueling monster in front of us, move only happen after few monster get defeated even then we block ourselves a lot of the time.</p> <p>Then the tile effect is invisible, we basically needs to remember what tile effect there is during the game play. There is also many modifiers in each scenario make it hard to track.</p> <p>For the character Static, I did inner peace and bear style build.

My issue is that the group is a bit awkward and I don\u2019t really gel with some of the people. </p> <p>For example, one guy is just super competitive. He studies every game extensively, plays dozens of games online before we meet up, and just demolishes everyone and takes it so seriously. I get it, but it just changes the vibe of the group. </p> <p>Another guy is just so awkward and never says anything outside of the game. Like, you can\u2019t have a conversation with him. I tell myself that maybe he has social anxiety, so I try to be understanding, but it just adds to the awkwardness.</p> <p>Some of the other players are hit or miss. Sometimes they don\u2019t even respond to the invite, and I know that if I never reach out to them I will never hear from them again. </p> <p>Two of the players i get along with just fine and we have a good time, but",

I think the whole cube proliferation mechanic is one the funnest, most replayable mechanics in any boardgame. </p> <p>Recently, however, I heard on the Board Game Barrage podcast, one of the hosts, Neilan, talk about the latest Pandemic game, Fate of the Fellowship, saying that while he enjoyed the game, he felt the pandemic system has become a bit dated and that some more recent cooperative games have streamlined much of what Pandemic does right. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t provide any examples so maybe you can help me with that! </p> <p>Do you agree with his take? What are some cooperative games of similar weight to Pandemic that, in your opinion, simplify board management without sacrificing puzzle solving ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/magomusico\"> /u/magomusico <",
