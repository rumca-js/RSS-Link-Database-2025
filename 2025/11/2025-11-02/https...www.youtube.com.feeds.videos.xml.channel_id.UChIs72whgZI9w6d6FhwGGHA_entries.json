This review looks at the Hyte X50 and X50 Air cases, which take some risks on design but manage to do so while keeping thermal performance overall competitive. In this review, we test the Hyte X50 and X50 Air for thermals, acoustics, build quality, cable management, radiator and fan compatibility, drive support, and more. Testing includes frequency spectrum benchmarks of the \"acoustic glass\" panels, Schlieren photography of the louvered vents and mesh side panel, and thermal benchmarks for CPUs and GPUs.\n\nThe best way to support our work is through our store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/\nGrab a PC Building Anti-Static Modmat! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/large-modmat-gn15-anniversary\nOr consider one of our copper-plated stainless steel mule mugs with thermal conductivity on it! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-copper-plated-stainless-steel-mule-mug-thermal-conductivit",
