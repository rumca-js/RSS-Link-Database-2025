For now it only supports the RV32I specification but supports peripherals for UART and Screen Rendering. It also has the ability to log the instructions executed into a binary file to be compared with the execution log of RTL. The maximum speed of the Emulator is 200MI/s and 40MI/s with logging enabled. It has helped me tremendously to find bugs inside the execution of my CPU for very big programs.<br/> Along with tha",
