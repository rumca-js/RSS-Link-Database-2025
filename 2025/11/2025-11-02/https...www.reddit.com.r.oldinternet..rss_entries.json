        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is probably going to be a long, long shot but I can remember playing on this website back in the day (probably late 90s/early 2000s) There&#39;s only two distinct games I can remember playing. One of which was this monster battling game where you could build your own monster. You picked a head, body, and tail I believe. I distinctly remember them having an Xenomorph alien head that I&#39;m pretty sure you needed to spend actual money to get.</p> <p>The other game was like a turn/text based RPG of sorts where you were exploring a dungeon. </p> <p>Sorry I know that is not much to work with but I know it existed I just cannot for the life of me remember what it was called. Hopefully this can trigger someone else who remembers the same thing.</p> <p>Thank you. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/bowtokingbowser\"> /u/bowtokingbowser </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oldinternet/comme",
