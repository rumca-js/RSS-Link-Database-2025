Today&#39;s paper is titled &#39;ChatGPT in Systematic Investing -- Enhancing Risk-Adjusted Returns with LLMs&#39; by Authors: Nikolas Anic, </p> <pre><code> Andrea Barbon, Ralf Seiz, Carlo Zarattini. </code></pre> <p>This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can improve cross-sectional momentum strategies by extracting predictive signals from firm-specific news. We combine daily U.S. equity returns for S&amp;P 500 constituents with high-frequency news data and use prompt-engineered queries to ChatGPT that inform the model when a stock is about to enter a momentum portfolio. The LLM evaluates whether recent news supports a continuation of past returns, producing scores that condition both stock...</p> <p>You can catch the full breakdown here: <a href=\"https://www.thepromptindex.com/unique-title-news-to-numbers-how",
