It said: \"The United States condemns the reported mass atrocities committed by the Rapid Support Forces in El Fasher, North Darfur.\"  The US is gravely concerned about the safety of civilians within the city and those fleeing to neighbouring areas.  The RSF must stop engaging in retribution and ethnic violence; the tragedy in El Geneina must not be repeated.  The US will continue working with partners to find a peaceful path forward. There isn't a viable military solution, and external military support only prolongs the conflict.\n\nJustin Lynch, the managing director of Conflict Insights Group and co-author of 'Sudan\u2019s Unfinished Democracy,' joins Al Jazeera\u2019s live from Nairobi.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.",
