        "description": "Japan has long harvested a shrub called mitsumata for its money supply. But when mitsumata started dying out, Japan frantically searched for alternatives to make yen.\n\nIt found a lifeline in the foothills of the Himalayas. A low-value crop called called argeli grew abundant and was the perfect replacement for mitsumata.\nArgeli was worth very little, often the only option for farmers who\u2019d lost their crops to wild animals. When the Japanese arrived, they turned the once low-value argeli into a cash crop.\n\nNow, one of Asia\u2019s poorest countries is growing the money for one of Asia\u2019s richest nations. And the influx of cash brought industry and investment to Nepal\u2019s small villages.\n\nBut while Japan loves its physical yen now, what will happen to Nepal\u2019s new big business if the country goes cashless like the rest of Asia?\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:54 - Why Japan Chose Nepal\n01:52 - Japan Trains Nepalese Farmers\n03:34 - Nepalese Farmers\u2019 Earnings\n03:57 - Printing Yen\n04:23 - History of Currenc",
