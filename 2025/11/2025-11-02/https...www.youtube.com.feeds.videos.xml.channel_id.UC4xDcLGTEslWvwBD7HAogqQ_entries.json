        "description": "The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum heist is considered among the largest heists in history. On March 18, 1990, two men disguised as police officers entered the Boston museum and stole 13 pieces of art valued at over $500 million, including works by Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Degas. Despite decades of investigation, none of the stolen pieces have been recovered, and the case remains unsolved. The museum still displays empty frames where the missing artworks once hung, a haunting tribute to the theft.",
