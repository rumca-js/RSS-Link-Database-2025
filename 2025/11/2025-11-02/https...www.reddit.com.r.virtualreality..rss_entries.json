The smoothness, the settings, the enviroments, ability to make apps bigger or smaller or move them, its just better.

It was fun, but the novelty quickly wore off and it ended up gathering dust.</p> <p>Recently I bought a gaming PC (couldn&#39;t justify spending that much money on 5090, so got a 5080 instead) and started trying some UEVR and Luke Ross mods. And then I stumbled upon Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod. And oh boy. I played that game before in flat, but damn, this is a whole new level. Honestly felt like (and still feeling like after 60 hours of doing side missions and just walking around) a kid exeriencing video games for the first time. Pretty much made me regret not getting that 5090 lol. </p> <p>I play with Ray Tracing and most of the settings on high, with DLSS quality and have a stable 72 fps on 3012x3012 resolution (using PICO Connect wired, as I need to jailbreak it to get ",

Any game where you are &quot;walking&quot; in video and &quot;standing or sitting&quot; there in real life we kind of get sick.. or dizzy a little.. so we had to stop playing those types of games. My friend and I played Unlimited Bowling and Pinball FX VR. We could play the pinball as long as we wanted, but the part where you walk around and down the steps to get to a pinball machine is no good for us.</p> <p>I played around with the headset for a long time last night.

The headstrap is broken and I have to hold it together with string to keep the tension. The VR Wave prescription lenses don&#39;t fit properly and keep falling out not to mention the actual prescription is old and not as sharp as it once was.</p> <p>But most importantly, I&#39;ve been getting a stutter now that makes things mostly unplayable. After a lot of troubleshooting, it appears to be related to updating the nvidia drivers. I&#39;m on Windows 10. Before updating the drivers, which were 12 months out of date, everything was fine in VR. But I need the new drivers for other games that have been crashing due to not having the drivers up to date.</p> <p>Anyway, I&#39;ve more or less accepted the fact that my good old G2 has finally become obsolete. It&#39;s time to look at new options. But holy cow the new options are expensive!</p> ",
