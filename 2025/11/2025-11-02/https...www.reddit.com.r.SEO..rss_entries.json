When an Australian user clicks on a product page on the international site, they are redirected to the Australian site\u2019s homepage, rather than the corresponding product page. Based on Microsoft Clarity data, most of these users drop off immediately.</p> <p>I need a solution that allows users to go directly from the international product page to the <strong>matching product page on the Australian site</strong>, without merging or deleting the two websites.
