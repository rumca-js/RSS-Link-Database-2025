It&#39;s a pretty ridiculous question now that I&#39;m typing it out.</p> <p>I have GRUB set up as my bootloader, and the bios boot sequence using the CachyOS drive. To get this working I had to set the operating system in &#39;Secure Boot&#39; to &#39;Other OS&#39; - otherwise when trying to boot it would spit out an &#39;unauthorized changes on the firmware, operating system or UEFI drivers&#39; error, and just boot Win11.</p> <p>However with secure boot set to &#39;Other OS&#39; BF6 won&#39;t run in Win11 as it thinks secure boot is disabled - thanks javelin anti cheat, or I guess people who cheat in online games?</p> <p>Everything else seems to work really well, and I&#39;m hoping that to play battlefield won&#39;t require bios changes every time?!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submi",

What I want to achieve is: when I press one of the thumb mouse buttons (button 4), I want it to be registered as a keyboard key (CTRL) instead.</p> <p>Why do I want this? I like to play MMO&#39;s with my modifier keys (shift/ctrl/alt) on my mouse thumb buttons. So I can press mouse button 4 + 1, instead of ctrl + 1. I have tiny hands, and big hand stretches are not comfortable for me.</p> <p>On windows, this solution was simple: Open the Logitech gaming hub, select the specific app, assign the keyboard key to the mouse button and you where done. </p> <p>I haven&#39;t found an easy solution yet in Linux, CachyOS btw.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Like any decent laptop, I have Windows 11 Pro and games run reasonably well, but I only have 16GB of RAM and the system alone uses 9-10GB just starting up! I&#39;ve disabled all startup programs, but the RAM usage hasn&#39;t decreased. This is detrimental to gaming because the system quickly becomes overloaded, and even in demanding games, games crash or the frame rate drops drastically when the graphics card isn&#39;t even at 60%. I was thinking of installing Steam OS as a secondary system exclusively for gaming and using Windows 11 for everything else, but is that viable? Is it even possible?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Poker_808\"> /u/Poker_808 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1om7uej/is_it_possible_to_install_steam_os_on_a_laptop/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1om7uej/is_it_possible_to_install_s",
