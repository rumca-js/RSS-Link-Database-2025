Fantasy is my favourite genre and has been for years but I find it really hard to hone in on a new book/series that I&#39;m excited about. I feel like there is so much out there now which doesn&#39;t suit me so I&#39;m hoping to discover some hidden gems outside of the typical (over hyped) booktok faves and turning to you all for recommendations!</p> <p>What I like: - politics but not overly heavy - any setting but haven&#39;t quite gelled with most urban fantasy so far - medium-fast paced &amp; engagement plot - good, solid world building (but easy enough to digest) - unique magic system </p> <p>What I don&#39;t like - too much romance that doesn&#39;t add to the plot - Overly simplistic world/characters </p> <p>Some of my faves/books I&#39;ve enjoyed recently - Mistborn series - Farseer trilogy (but I read this a long time ago so might need something a bit lighter!)

I guess he wants a High Fantasy World (as experience with ERAGON). It shouldnt be too brutal (since he is 10) but neither too childish (I would say he reads a bit &quot;above his age). He already has MURTAGH, but he wants a whole series. I read Fantasy in my youth (Ice&amp;Fire, Farseer, Dragonbone Chair), but I assume those books are not yet for him.

Fantasy series with romance subplot with male MC or dual pov, it must be slow burn, male must be lower class/status/birth than love interest, no love triangles. Love tropes like peasant and princes, soldier and queen bla bla you know what I mean. Love if let\u2019s say \u201cthey can\u2019t be together\u201d because of their class differences but eventually they end up together. \u201cHappy ending\u201d is a must, not necessarily like fairytale ending but let\u2019s say generally happy. Please make it be in the vane of classic fantasy mostly and its subgenres, no paranormal/vampires etc. I also love sci-fi/military if someone can make a suggestion. Also I am sucker for historical fiction if you can recommend with same stipulations. Some books that I enjoyed are Riyria relevatins, Black company, Powder mage and The thousand names series, Staff and the sword, The summoner ( even though I hate ya), Benjamin Ashwood saga, The ca",

White Court Vampires are Butchers Version of the classical succubi inccubi tropes, so far, so fair, these are facinating tropes and you can do a lot with them for great storytelling. But what does Butcher do with them?</p> <p>Well, first he gives us the species itself-supernatural beeings which have supernaturaly attractive model bodys and possess some kind of psychic field which makes people to be attracted to them. Or rather, it forces people to be attracted to them since when a vampire weaponises this effect it is almost impossible for their victims to resist. And i chose the word victim here delibertaly since no matter who they are, no matter what kind of personal philosophys or boundarys or arrangements or realaishons",

But other than this my other experience with fantasy is the Fairy Oak trilogy when i was 11\u2026 I\u2019m full of recommendations on tiktok and instagram about fantasy books and sagas that all seem very dull to me. I understand this is a difficult question but i need someone to recommend me something w this characteristics: heavy trauma, politcal critique, good worldbuilding, philosophical discussion or underlying philosophical questions, characters that i can empathize with deeply (bonus point if they are queer and their story is compelling and not only related to their identity) and overall a gloomy atmosphere. If anyone has a recommendation of a book like this\u2026 pls comment!!!</p> <p>P.S. I have Babel in my shelf and it\u2019s waiting for me though ",

It&#39;s inspired by books such as Redwall, but with a darker, more grounded tone. Something of a grimlight with no &#39;magic&#39; (at least not yet); it has a mystical/mythical feel to it. Characters are feline, with a single-POV narrative, and there&#39;s a strong focus on atmosphere, tension, and layered worldbuilding. I don&#39;t normally write romance, but there&#39;s room for some of that in future books.</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for people who enjoy collaborative writing, to form a 2-3 person team of equal and committed co-authors. We&#39;d be shaping story, characters, and lore together largely via discovery writing. The goal is to approach this professionally, but enjoyably: being accountable, on the same page regarding overall vision, aiming for tradpub while assuming self-pub, etc.. IP ownership and (assumed unlikely) proceeds would be equal split.",

I was 15 at the time when my Mother passed away from a rare lung cancer variant known as Exon 20. She never smoked once in her life, she was fit, healthy, just a wonderful woman who did so much for the people around her. Since my Autism and ADHD diagnosis, she had been advocating for neurodivergent kids and battling with the Australian education system, she was a fighter. She made it on live television, and brought me on there too ! Anyway, everyone has their struggles, and as you could imagine losing a mother at such a young age would tear at one\u2019s soul. </p> <p>I fell severely behind on studies, social life, exercise, health. Then one day, my friend recommended that I should get into reading, even just for a while, to cope. Having played The Witcher 3 video games, I decided to buy all of Andrzej Sapkowski",
