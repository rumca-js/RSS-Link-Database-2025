I work with numbers and so my personal life also has lots of data calculations, and sheets or excel are crucial parts of my workflow. I know I could self host a solution, but really wanted a secure cloud system.</p> <p>Insert cryptpad. It almost seemed too good to be true. It&#39;s a bit slow, and the UI is awful, but it works!!! Except....it uses Only Office, which I have avoided (in favor of Libre Suite) due to Russian ties. (Not interested in starting a political war, just personal preference here).</p> <p>Is cryptpad in the web just running cloud version of Only Office, meaning the same code base as the OO installation versions?</p> <p>What are the privacy repercussions of this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/GeoSabreX\"> /u/GeoSabreX </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1o",

What I mainly used was Google Search, and it worked well in the areas I mostly searched. Additionally, it provided free translation from English to Korean, and many websites allowed easy account creation by linking with a Google account. Although I heard that Google shares a lot of my data, I considered it a benefit because the Google service was good.</p> <p>However, there was an incident that changed this thinking, and that was Google&#39;s AI Overviews. Ever since its launch, I have been really annoyed. This is because I use Google for <strong>searching</strong>, not for getting answers from an AI. If I want an answer from an AI, I would go to the ChatGPT site or the Gemini site. I wish search engines would just stick to searching. But every time I searched, Google fixed AI answers to the very top with high frequency.</p> <p>So, I searched for a way to turn off Google&#3",

The important one is google imo and i recommend shizuku and canta, you can get both on fdroid. You need to enable developr options and sink it up to wireless debugging. If shikuku isnt working it&#39;s you not your phone, the instructions arent exactly clear as day but keep trying and you will get it. Once shikuku is set up link canta to shizuku. Once your done set the filter and search google and play services and delete everything that anything doesn&#39;t say unsafe. As for samsung services you have to be more selective or you can brick your device so i recommend using braves leo ai or fire fox and venice ai. copy any package names your unsure about into there and if it doesnt have a description brave/venice will tell what that package does.
