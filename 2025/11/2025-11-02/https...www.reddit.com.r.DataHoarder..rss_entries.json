I have seen (and made myself) some 3D printed adapters for single 120 mm fan to 1-3 drives, but was hoping for something with little more strength than some poliethylene or PLA... and not everyone has access to 3D printer, despite the general popularity of the tech. With spacing for ventilation and mounting this should allow for 12 full height (so HE-filled) drives, with access to air, and given most mounts are usually well attached to the case itself, it would be far from flimsy.</p> <p>My reasoning is many modern cases don&#39;t have any proper drive mounting options, except for 1-3 HDDs hidden behind motherboard tray, but almost all of them include radiator mounts. Yes, I know, it&#39;s not as convenient as trayless bays, but with that you could take any modern $50 case and turn it into usable one, instead of hunting for some unicorn-class case EOLed in 2009, or ",
