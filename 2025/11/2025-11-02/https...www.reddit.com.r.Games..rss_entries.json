With most of the ground work done, our small team is hard at work crafting two immersive SP campaigns that we&#39;ll launch with, adding a third one a few months later. </p> <p>Set on 22nd-century Mars, the game follows the epic struggle of ideologies battling for supremacy over the red planet and the future of humanity. With base building, army management, resource systems, compelling campaigns, and strong, distinctive factions, our game delivers the pure RTS experience, enhanced with modern looks and thoughtful innovations. No gimmicks, just the timeless strategy you expect. </p> <p>You can check out our Steam Page here (there&#39;s a <strong>Gameplay Trailer</strong> there together with some screenshots): <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3973160/Crimson_Freedom/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/3973160/Crimson_Freedom/</a> </p>",
