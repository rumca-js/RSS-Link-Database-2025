As far as a I can tell because I\u2019m not meeting the min 10 day seed time rule. </p> <p>I had noticed that while I can download at several MB/s, my total seeding speed over the last ten days was usually more like 25 kb/s. So it tries but is not seeding well.</p> <p>I\u2019m behind Mulvad via gluetun, so can\u2019t port forward.</p> <p>Any advice how to fix this?
