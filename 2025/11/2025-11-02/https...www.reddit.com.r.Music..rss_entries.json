Might be a remaster?</p> <p>I don&#39;t remember it being more than 5 songs</p> <p>I think it might have had some female vocals?</p> <p>I&#39;m assuming its house or an adjacent genre, Dad was listening to artists like the prodigy, netsky, Falco, and I can&#39;t remember any others..</p> <p>I&#39;m reaaallly interested in finding this, I think it might help me discover more thinking about my past!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit",

I was listening to her new release and for whatever reason this album took longer than her others to click for me but I got there.</p> <p>As I sat in stupefied appreciation today I was thinking about her discography and how each release left me feeling. I decided it would be interesting more as an exercise to try and pick a Top 5. A top 3 would&#39;ve been fine but there&#39;s no way I could sleep at night without giving flowers to some of my favorites. This list of course is on a &quot;so far&quot; basis. There&#39;s always room to listen and appreciate further!</p> <ol> <li>Middle Cyclone(2008) - This takes the top slot for me simply for play count plus it&#39;s an easy, breezy listen full of great tracks, lyrics, and themes any Case fan can melt in to. Maybe it doesn&#39;t have as many GREAT songs as some of her other albums do but it&#39;s very strong all the way through.</li> <li>Fox Confessor Brings the Flood(2006) ",
