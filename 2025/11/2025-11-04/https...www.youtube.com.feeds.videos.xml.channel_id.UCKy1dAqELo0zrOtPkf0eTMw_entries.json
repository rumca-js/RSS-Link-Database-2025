        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nNintendo has raised its hardware forecast as the Switch 2 crosses the 10 million units sold mark. The Switch 2 continues its run as the biggest console launch ever, surpassing the Switch 1 (4.7 million units) and PlayStation 5 (7.8 million units) in their respective first six month milestones. Nintendo now expects to move 19 million units by the end of March 2026. In other Nintendo news, the U.S. Patent Office is going to reexamine a patent awarded to Nintendo regarding the 'summon character and let it fight' Pok\u00e9mon patent. This could potentially undermine Nintendo's argument in its lawsuit against Palworld developer Pocketpair. And finally, Microsoft's Game Pass Wave 1 offerings for November have been revealed, and as expected Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 leads the charge.\n\n#NintendoSwitch2 #Gaming #IGN",

With Prey and Predator: Killer of Killers getting released on Hulu only, it's great having the Predators back on the big screen. It\u2019s a pretty wild shift in perspective for the franchise, as well but one that our reviewer thinks Trachtenberg, Elle Fanning and company can pull off.",

His heart aching for those he left behind, Amarendra Baahubali finds himself at the center of an ancient cosmic war between devas and asuras. \n\nAs he navigates through the 14 realms of existence, he forges an unlikely alliance, confronts divine forces beyond mortal comprehension, and fights to restore balance to the cosmos. Ramya Krishna reprises her role from the live-action films as well, voicing Sivagami once again.\n\nThis two-part animated epic is directed by award-winning filmmaker Ishan Shukla, produced by S.S. Rajamouli, Shobu Yarlagadda, and Prasad Devineni, and with music by Oscar-winner MM Keeravaani.\n\n#IGN #Movies",
