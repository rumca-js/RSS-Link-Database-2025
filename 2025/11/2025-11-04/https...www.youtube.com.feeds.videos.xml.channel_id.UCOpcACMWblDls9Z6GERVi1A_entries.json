It\u2019s a good show if you like grounded, mature themes, like when is it ok to shoot your dad or chainsaw a gorilla? James Gunn and John Cena have a good thing going here, it\u2019s a shame Warner Bros is about to be gutted and sold for parts again\u2026 \n\nVoice Narration: Jon Bailey the EPIC VOICE GUY (@epicvoiceguy on all socials)\nTitle Design: Robert Holtby\nWritten by: Spencer Gilbert and Lon Harris\nProduced by: Spencer Gilbert\nEdited by: Kevin Williamsen\nPost-Production Manager: Emin Bassavand\nManager, Video Operations: Tiffany Tse\nPost-Production Specialist: Rebecca Castaneda\nVP Content: Max Dionne\n\n#honesttrailers #entertainment #parody #trailer",
