You can now get the full App Store experience right in\nyour browser, with dedicated pages for the iPhone, iPad, Mac,\nVision, Watch, and TV app libraries.</p>\n\n<p>Previously, Apple\u2019s \u201capps.apple.com\u201d domain simply redirected you\nto a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/app-store/\">generic page</a> about the App Store on Apple\u2019s website.\nNow, it takes you to a full-fledged version of the App Store you\ncan browse on your computer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This new website is nice, but it\u2019s not the \u201cfull\u201d App Store experience, insofar as you can\u2019t buy or download apps from it. It\u2019s more like a full website <em>mirror</em> of the App Store than a web version of the App Store.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Apple Launches New Web Interface for the App Store\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/04/app-store-n",

        "description": "<p>John Voorhees, writing at MacStories:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With iOS 26, Apple placed two big buttons onscreen when an alarm\nwent off. One was for stop and the other snooze. That wasn\u2019t a big\ndeal for many of the alarms you set throughout the day, but when\nyou\u2019re waking up in the morning blurry-eyed, two big buttons\nstacked on top of each other weren\u2019t ideal. For a lot of users, it\nwas a toss-up whether stabbing at their iPhone through a morning\nhaze would stop their alarm or snooze it.</p>\n\n<p>With iOS and iPadOS 26.1, the \u201cStop\u201d button for an alarm set in\nthe system Clock app now requires a slide to stop gesture, which\nechoes the Slide to Unlock gesture of the original iPhone. The\nmore deliberate gesture is a good move on Apple\u2019s part. I can\u2019t\nimagine someone tapping and sliding their finger to stop an alarm\nby accident.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a clever little change. I enjoy that it harks back to the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=955\">original iPhone\u2019s slide-to-",
