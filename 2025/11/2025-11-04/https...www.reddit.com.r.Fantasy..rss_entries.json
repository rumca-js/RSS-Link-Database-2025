Sometimes I lay awake in terror that I might.</p> <p>It is very hard to sum up this series. Now I tell people it is Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets The Wire and that manages to get the closest with the shortest amount of words possible. Add a dash (or more) of metaphysics and its even closer. So maybe Buffy meets The Wire meets The Leftovers? (You will find that my comp titles are almost always TV shows.
