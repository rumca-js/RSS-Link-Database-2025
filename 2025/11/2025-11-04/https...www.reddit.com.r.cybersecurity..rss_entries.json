Using a \u201cSIM farm,\u201d he promised things like frozen interest, debt write-offs, and energy grants. When people replied, they were called by fake agents from a company called \u201cThe Debt Relief Team,\u201d which didn\u2019t exist.</p> <p>The ICO says Chand disguised his identity, used unregistered numbers, and showed blatant disregard for the law. His messages alone generated over 19,000 complaints. Cases like this highlight how even small, automated \u201cmicro-spammers\u201d can prey on vulnerable people, causing real stress and harm.</p> <p>The takeaway: SMS marketing is legal only with clear consent. If you get a spam text, forward it to 7726 in the UK. And remember, hiding who you are or targeting financially vulnerable people isn\u2019t just unethical, it\u2019s illegal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/medi",

We&#39;ve surveyed 200+ SMBs and found:<br/> - 61% experienced attacks in 2024<br/> - 78% fear an incident could shut them down<br/> - Only 14% have any security plan<br/> - Enterprise tools cost $50K+/year (they can&#39;t afford it) </p> <p>So we&#39;re thinking about building an MVP with:<br/> 1. Phishing detection (real-time + explainable)<br/> 2. Brand monitoring (typosquats + takedowns)<br/> 3. Simple dashboard (not alert overload) </p> <p>Quick Questions:<br/> 1. Does this match what SMBs actually need?<br/> 2. What would MUST-HAVE vs nice-to-have?<br/> 3. What stops SMBs from adopting security tools?<br/> 4. Are we missing something obvious?<br/> 5. What existing solutions compete here? </p> <p>Not promoting anything - just want honest feedback before we build for 6 months.
