She\u2019s recently started showing signs of dementia. I drop in and visit her once a week, but it\u2019s been increasingly difficult to have long conversations with her. Last weekend, she asked me to read her some of the short stories she had written a few years ago (they were very sweet stories about her growing up) and she was really focused while I was reading. Her mood was much better after too. I\u2019d like to read to her again in the weekend when I go back to visit her and was looking for some recommendations (I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be interested in any of the sci-fi I\u2019m currently reading). For context, she\u2019s has an objectively interesting life: born in London to Russian parents, evacuated during the blitz to live in New York, married three times and has been living here in Sweden since the 1980\u2019s.

I want a nice story with hot sex scenes that will really get me going. I\u2019ve only gotten that from pure erotica before (men and women, women and women, all of it is fine), but I like the story too. I\u2019m reading outlander but there\u2019s not many sex scenes.

Bonus points if they\u2019re not based on Greek mythology or East Asian cultures (only because I see these most often, and I want to try finding some lesser known books!

I was proven totally wrong when I asked about it, which has been super cool. But... at the same time, most of the MCs are white. Right now I&#39;m wondering, are there any male led fantasy/sci-fi stories that have a straight-male mc? Maybe this sounds odly specific, but there&#39;s plenty of white led stories with a straight mc. I&#39;m a straight Black guy, and I&#39;m finding it increasingly hard to read about a straight Black guy as I&#39;ve gotten older. I don&#39;t have anything against people who have different tastes or anything, but gosh, it feels a bit hard to find one that fits mine. I know they&#39;re out there - I just can&#39;t find anything of quality. So yeah. </p> <p>Split povs with an fmc and middle grade doesn&#39;t count. YA or above plz.

I used to only read during my commute to work to stop myself from endlessly scrolling on my phone during the one and a half hour train rides. During which I mostly read soviet sci-fi (my first book was Roadside Picnic since I am a huge Stalker fan) and just kind of went from there to Solaris and then We. And at some point the Cyberiad. After that, because it was on offer in my local library, I read Orwell&#39;s 1984 and Animal Farm. </p> <p>That was all during my work commute.<br/> Then recently I came across a decent Kindle Paperwhite for ten bucks on Kleinanzeigen (German craigslist) and have gone a little crazy. I downloaded a bunch of books based on what is popular but I must admit, I struggle to get far into most of them as they just don&#39;t tickle me the same way the previously mentioned books have.</p> <p>The first and only book I finished on the Kindle",

I would love to read a story about a fmc that maybe has powers but her parents/ guardians are also trying to navigate that fact. The fmc could either be their daughter by blood, adoption, etc. it could also be two parents/ guardians or a single parent/ guardian as well. I\u2019d also love to see more of the parents/ guardian being involved in the story helping their daughter. Btw it could also just be one parent that looks the opposite of the fmc or both.

Percy Jackson, Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Divergent, the Maze Runner, etc.. Now, I am trying to get back into reading but struggle with attention span and not knowing what kind of books I like. I just finished the Fourth Wing series and I absolutely fell in love and want something similar. I like that the characters are a bit older, closer to my age so that they are more relatable. I also like the spice level and that the romance was not the entire focus of the plot. I love the fantasy world that feels original and that doesn&#39;t feel like a generic version of a different book. I need another book that I cannot put down, because once I put it down I won&#39;t be able to pick it back up.</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Efficient_Bag_4059\"> /u/Ef",

You get the basics, if it was fantasy or dystopian id read it. </p> <p>However, now I struggle to find books to read. Ive started on the witcher book series, currently finishing blood of elves, and want something either similar to this fantasy style or a more dystopian book. I only got into this from the Netflix show, and I just can\u2019t help imagine how many good fantasy books there must be out there if I didnt know of the witcher before. </p> <p>Im not against reading large series of books.
