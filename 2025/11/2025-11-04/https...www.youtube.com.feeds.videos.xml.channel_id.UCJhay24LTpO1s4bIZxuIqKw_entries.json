In this talk, Gareth Lloyd explores the evolution of C++ from C++11 to C++23, highlighting features that make it a powerful, expressive, and ergonomic language for contemporary software development. Whether you are a seasoned developer or learning C++ for the first time, this session shows how modern C++ enables concise, type-safe, and efficient coding.\n\nLearn about key features that differentiate modern C++:\n\n- Strong typing and user-defined literals for safer and clearer code\n- Ergonomic date and time handling with C++ chrono, zone_time, and formatting\n- Compile-time programming with constexpr and consteval for faster and more predictable performance\n- Operator overloading and domain-specific syntax for readable, expressive code\n- Templates, class template argument deduction, and initializer lis",
