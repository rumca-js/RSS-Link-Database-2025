What if you just kept shrinking?\n\nBy the time you\u2019re smaller than an ant, you could safely jump off a chair \u2013 air resistance lets you glide down. But bad news, your voice is so high that no human can hear you anymore! Plus, insects are MONSTERS!\n\nNow, smaller! Cells are huge next to you!\n\nGoing smaller\u2026Now you\u2019re being BOMBARDED by air molecules\n\nYou go INSIDE AN ATOM and you find\u2026there\u2019s a surprising amount of empty space here!\n\nIf you go small enough and SOMEHOW keep the same mass\u2026 whoops, sorry\u2026 \n\nIf you believe there should be more fun, optimistic science and tech stories, subscribe.\n\n#shorts #shrinking #science #smaller #quantum",
