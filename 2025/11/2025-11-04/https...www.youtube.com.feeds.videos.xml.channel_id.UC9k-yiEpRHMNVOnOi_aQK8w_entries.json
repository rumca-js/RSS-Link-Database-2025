Police thought it was an accident, but investigators say when Waterman woke up from the coma, he told them it was not an accident. He said his girlfriend, Leigha Mumby, tried to kill him. Waterman died after eight months of battling to stay alive. Mumby was arrested. She has pleaded not guilty to vehicular manslaughter.",
