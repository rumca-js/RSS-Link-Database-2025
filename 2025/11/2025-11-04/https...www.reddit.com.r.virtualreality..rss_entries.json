Any flat 2d movie, or even picture is instantly 3D, no pre-processing needed. I tried it on a few youtube streaming videos, local movie files, and even some photos and was floored by how good the 3d effect is and I dont see anyone talking about it.</p> <p>If you want to try it out, here are some pointers. The webste instructs you to view the 3d content by having you create a server to stream to your web browser in your vr headset. At least for me, this was super laggy and the image quality wasnt great. What works better for me is skip the server. Instead you can display a 3d window localy. I use virtual desktop to create a second virtual monitor, drag the 3d window there and maximize it to full screen, and then set the view mode to 3d for that window in virtual desktop.</p> <p>",

I see that the sub suggests to use RTX 4090 as bare minimum for Cyberpunk 2077 with Luke Ross mod. But I am curious as to what&#39;s the state of the game with a 3090. Is it playable? What&#39;s the FPS? Any hacks or tricks to get a smoother performance?</p> <p>It has been my dream since a few years to play Cyberpunk on VR and any helpful suggestions would be appreciated. </p> <p>I have a Quest 3 with a BoboVR headstrap.</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kaushikqr\"> /u/kaushikqr </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1onvcmh/cyberpunk_2077_vr_on_an_rtx_3090/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1onvcmh/cyberpunk_2077_vr_on_an_rtx_3090/\">[comments]</a></span>",
