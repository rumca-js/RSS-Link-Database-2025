        "description": "CEOs on LinkedIn are officially losing it \u2014 like full-on meltdown mode. One says to charge your kids $1,200 in rent to \u201cteach responsibility.\u201d Another says remote work is \u201cdepressing,\u201d and then admits he just needs friends. We\u2019ve even got CEOs taking \u201cfriendship sabbaticals\u201d to focus on\u2026 working more.\n\nIn this sequel to my last video, we dive into the chaos of corporate leadership \u2014 where every humblebrag is a cry for help and every \u201cmotivational\u201d post sounds like a cry typed from the golf course. From guilt-tripping employees into the office to pretending layoffs are \u201cnew beginnings,\u201d it\u2019s the same LinkedIn circus \u2014 just with fancier suits.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered how CEOs keep finding new ways to look relatable online \u2014 welcome to LinkedIn. You\u2019re gonna love it here.\n\n#CEOcringe #LinkedInLunatics #JoshuaFluke #CorporateCringe #antiwork \n\nNeed a resume / cover letter? \u27a1\ufe0f https://joshuafluke.store\n\u2022 \ud83d\udd0d Resume Reviews\n\u2022 \u270d\ufe0f Custom Resumes\n\u2022 \ud83c\udf93 Courses: Hacking the Resume & Interview\n\u2022 \ud83d\udcde ",
