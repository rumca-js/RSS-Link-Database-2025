For the last two years, I\u2019ve been learning a curriculum developed by the government called &quot;Computer Engineering&quot; (it\u2019s a technical education). Initially, the curriculum had 11 subjects, but by the time I came around, it was reduced to 9 subjects. In 9th grade, I studied subjects like Mathematics, Science, English, Nepali, Optional Maths, Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS), C Programming, Fundamentals of Computer Applications, and Fundamentals of Electronics Systems. In 10th grade, I focused on subjects like Data Structures &amp; OOP Concepts (using C++), Computer Hardware, Electronics Repair &amp; Maintenance, Database Management Systems, Digital Design &amp; Microprocessors, along with other compulsory subjects.</p> <p>Now, in 11th grade, I\u2019m studying Computer Science, and I\u2019ve learned quite a bit along the way: HTML5, CSS3, JS, PHP, C, C++, Python, ",
