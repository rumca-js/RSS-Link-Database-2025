In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model\u2019s KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer.

Because AI isn\u2019t a replacement for creativity, it\u2019s an amplifier for it. It doesn\u2019t take your voice, it multiplies it.</p> <h1>The Ego and the Algorithm</h1> <p>We live in an era where visibility feels like validation. Every post, every caption, every photo is a small act of self-preservation in an attention economy. We want to be seen, to be remembered, to matter. Yet, the same platforms that gave us a voice are now training the very systems we fear might replace us. Every upload is data. Every story is signal.
