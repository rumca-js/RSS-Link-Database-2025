Independent studios eSolu and Team Mojo Games are adding another game to the subgenre with Odds Chronicles.</p><p>Odds Chronicles combines grid-based combat, a roguelite run structure, and dice mechanics to create its overall package. Each roll of the dice will give your team different resources, including attributes like strength and magic.</p><p>Dice-based roguelites and roguelikes, including standouts like Dicey Dungeons, have been around for some time, but new takes on rolling the dice are welcome. Bringing dice mechanics into a turn-based grid tactics game is a nice way to build off the SOCOM-like percentages that decide whether or not you'll land your attacks.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/odds-chronicle-rolls-luck-and-strategy-into-a-tabletop-inspired-roguelite/1100-6535923/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2",

        "description": "<p>Nintendo released its latest quarterly earnings report today for the six-month period that ended on September 30, revealing a number of new details about the health of the company's business, including updated sales figures for the Switch and Switch 2. The original Switch has now sold 154.01 million units since it launched in 2017, and that's fairly close to the PS2's lifetime record of 160 million.</p><p>Will the Switch be able to catch the PS2? Probably not, says one analyst. Even so, the Switch is about to pass the Nintendo DS (154.02 million units sold) to become Nintendo's best-selling platform ever. It needs just 10,000 more sales to match the DS. This has no doubt already happened, as Nintendo's numbers run through September 30, and that's already more than a month ago. However, this won't be official until Nintendo releases its next earnings report in February 2026 or sooner if the company opts to make an announcement outside of its scheduled earnings releases.</p><p>Daniel",

The roughly 70-second video features the bounty hunter's gunship in aerial combat and a pretty slick motorcycle move by Samus that's an homage to <a href=\"https://x.com/GameSpot/status/1726305588693389790\">the Akira slide</a>.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Metroid Prime 4 trailer--seen below--also highlights a variety of locales on the mysterious planet. Samus finds herself in a lush jungle, outside a spiky black building that would look at home in The Matrix, and what we can only assume is the obligatory lava area at one point. The bounty hunter also scans a new enemy mechanoid called a psy-bot soldier as well as fights the boss Aberax (previously highlighted during <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/videos/metroid-prime-4-beyond-17-minutes-of-official-gameplay-nintendo-switch-2/2300-6465874/\">a Nintendo Treehouse stream</a>).</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The <a h",

One of the harder quests you'll get assigned after your first few are complete is called Off the Radar, and this requires you to locate Field Depots in Arc Raiders.</p><p>To make matters even more difficult, though, the quest actually tries to unintentionally throw you off with the way it describes a Field Depot.
