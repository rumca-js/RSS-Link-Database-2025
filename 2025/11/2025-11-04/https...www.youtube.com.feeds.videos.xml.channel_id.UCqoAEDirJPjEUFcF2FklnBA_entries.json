Bill Nye takes the host\u2019s chair alongside Chuck Nice to tackle one of the most urgent issues facing our future in space with Casey Dreier, Chief of Space Policy at @planetarysociety  who\u2019s been tracking and analyzing NASA\u2019s funding for years. \n\nWhy are we cutting NASA\u2019s budget in half, right when we need it most? What\u2019s the difference between human spaceflight and scientific exploration? Bill and Casey trace NASA\u2019s mission back to its origins in 1958, exploring how Earth observation became one of its most vital roles. What happens to climate research when we stop monitoring our planet?\n\nWhat do space cuts mean for everyday life? With less than half of a percent of the federal budget going to NASA, are we really \u201csaving\u201d money or just shrinki",
