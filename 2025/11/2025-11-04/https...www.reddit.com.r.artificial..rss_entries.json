The line between real and fake online is getting blurry real fast. AI stuff is everyhwere now and honestly most platforms aren\u2019t prepared. I saw a Worldcoin <a href=\"https://world.org/\">Orb</a> in person a few weeks ago and ended up trying it. You scan your eye (sounds weird but it\u2019s rlly not) and it gives you a World ID that proves you\u2019re human without giving up your name or anything like that. It doesn\u2019t store your data, just creates a code that stays on your phone.</p> <p>I actually think this kind of thing makes sense. For the internet in general. Like how else are we gonna deal with bots pretending to be people? Captchas don\u2019t work anymore and no one wants to KYC for everything.I haven\u2019t seen any apps really integrting World ID yet but I feel like it\u2019s coming. It\u2019s probably the type of infra we\u2019ll only notice once it\u2019s everywhere.</p> <p>Curious what&#39;s ur take on this.</",

Basically, it&#39;s how articles are being structured so that AI models (like ChatGPT) can understand them better, not just for traditional search engines. Makes them more &#39;machine-legible&#39;.</p> <p>It&#39;s pretty wild how much thought is going into this. The article mentioned using <a href=\"http://schema.org/\">Schema.org</a> (think Article, FAQPage, HowTo schemas) in JSON-LD format. This isn&#39;t just for old-school SEO anymore; it makes content machine-readable so AI can interpret, prioritize, categorize, and even present it accurately.</p> <p>One of the more interesting things was about how good metadata (accurate, complete, consistent) directly impacts AI&#39;s performance. There was a case study where a sentiment analysis model had 0.50 accur",
