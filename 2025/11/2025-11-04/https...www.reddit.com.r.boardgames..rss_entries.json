Obviously they have said that it doesn&#39;t reflect a change in quality, but it does potentially reflect a change in their overall pricing structure and the sheer inflated cost of the product. The fact that they can reduce the price by $100 by, reportedly, subsidizing the costs with their own money seems to show that they significantly inflated the price beyond what it could have gone for.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Arcshot\"> /u/Arcshot </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oomb1p/terra_mystica_on_gamefound_reduces_costs_by_100/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oomb1p/terra_mystica_on",

What were the most talked-about games you remember from the last few years? They don&#39;t necessarily have to be the best or most highly rated; it&#39;s enough that you remember them, have read about them often, or they&#39;re on your wish list. Any genre is fine too!

And NGL I did not start off strong, I was searching online for some basic party card games we usually would play with friend who had the games, Cards Against Humanities, Uno, etc. and saw some cheap ones online since I could not find it in any physical stores around my area so I had to resort to online. I thought I would give it a try and bought some.</p> <p>The quality is okay, the box is in mint condition but I immediately saw how you could tell they were knock-offs. When I purchased it, I may have an idea that they were knock-offs because of how cheap they were compared to its original price, but I also thought maybe they weren&#39;t and so I gave it a shot even though I was having doubts. </p> <p>Now th",
