German football is characterised by exchanges of punches, with the ball moving back and forth and plenty of chances on both sides; and Bayern are in the penalty area more often than any other team. Because Kane is confident and precise in front of goal and uses his height and heading ability to his advantage from corners and free-kicks, he scores like nowhere else.</p><p>The statistics are fantastic, with his scoring rate in the Bundesliga more than one-and-a-half times better than in the Premier League and for the national team. He has scored more goals (74) than he has played games (72) in the Bundesliga, significantly surpassing Gerd M\u00fcller\u2019s record (0.85).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com",

Mohamed Elyounoussi, formerly of Southampton and Celtic, has probably been the Danish club\u2019s most dangerous player this season, topping their scoring and assists charts. Jordan Larsson, son of Henrik Larsson, is hugely improved this year and recently earned a recall to the Sweden squad. But perhaps the biggest surprise will be the name of Youssoufa Moukoko, the former Borussia Dortmund wonderkid who was rated as perhaps the biggest prospect in world football a few years ago.</p><p>The hype around Moukoko in 2020 was astonishing, even before he made his Dortmund debut. As a 14-year-old in 2018-19, the Cameroon-born forward scored a record 50 league goals for the German side\u2019s und",
