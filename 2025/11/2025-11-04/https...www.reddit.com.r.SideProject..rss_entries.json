Thanks to an intuitive dashboard, anyone can interact with any API like a chatbot, using natural language. It&#39;s even possible to view JSON response formats directly in your own language, without writing a single line of code or using cURL or JSON requests. Regarding data privacy, each user retains complete control over their history and can permanently delete it at any time. So far, I&#39;ve had 80 visitors and 4 accounts created on my SaaS.

So,I built this website last weekend. The concept of the website is pretty simple. You create a new chat with the AI chatbot and you begin debating. However, I added some features that would make the website a bit more interesting like an ELO system, time limits, AI tone, etc. I&#39;m still new to building products",
