I recently tried to set up an account on a review website and when I did it linked my account to a previous review. The review was not made by me, it was a very negative review about an ex employer (personally) that I had a lot of respect for (still do). The review was made without an account, but my email address was associated with it (it seems in the past you didn&#39;t need an account to leave a review, just an email address, and could tick a box to not be contacted). My email address is my name. The review was posted years ago when I was still working there. There were some issues and the employer was sorting them out (part of the reason for my respect).</p> <p>I have a pretty good idea of a couple of people who might have done this, but it was years ago. I was able to delete the review because I set up an account. Now I&#39;m anxious if this has been done anywhere else. How can I find out if m",
