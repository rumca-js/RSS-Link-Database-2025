        "description": "Learn about cryptography in this beginner's course. You'll learn essential techniques like hashing (SHA-256) for verifying file integrity, symmetric encryption (AES), and asymmetric encryption (RSA) using public and private keys.  The practical focus of the tutorial involves building a fully functional command-line cryptography tool in Python.  Upon completion, you'll have a complete practical toolkit and the skills to safeguard data, secure passwords, and deter tampering.\n\nThis course was developed by Thanishkka. She is part of Hack Club. Hack Club is a global non-profit organization that creates a community for high school students interested in coding and making things with technology.\n\nHack Club is free and any teenager can join.
