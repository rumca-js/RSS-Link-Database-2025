I&#39;ve found other websites that say &quot;____ game! Free download!&quot; but I don&#39;t trust them cause they&#39;re not on the megathread or are just hella sketchy. I really wanna play this game to try and relive my childhood but I&#39;m scared to download from anything I don&#39;t trust.

Previously I\u2019ve been using Kodi + a skin, premiumize/real debrid and addons like FEN or Umbrella. I make a build, get it all setup then copy it to my other devices around the house. It\u2019s worked good and can see all latest movies/shows, click one and it finds a stream and plays it. I\u2019m not a fan of how slow Kodi can load and operate, as well as tracking what you\u2019re watching (trakt addons hit or miss). </p> <p>I recently built a new server with Unraid and I\u2019m looking for the closest thing possible to my previous setup. I want to be able to stream AND download movies/shows/anime. Ideally only download if it\u2019s a great film and want to keep it. Is there any type of streaming setup like this for Jellyfin, or even plex\u2026 or any other software that\u2019s better to use? Currently have the ARR stack but minimal configs. Any recommendations appreciated , Thanks! </p> <",

The majority of Mythbusters episodes are not available on Discovery Plus, and I don&#39;t have a Blu-Ray/DVD player, so I turned to ahem piracy, and holy crap. 2x speed on my phone or cast to my TV is decent to great quality and no lag or buffering even if I&#39;m on the road/flying.

With music streaming, we may have different plattforms as well, but the content isn&#39;t exklusive for like 99% of it. Why did it develop this way? I can easily see a world where the biggest labels/rights holders (Universal, Sony, Warner) have their own exklusive music streaming platforms. </p> <p>I believe it&#39;s for this reason why music piracy seems so much smaller by comparison, as music streaming is way more convenient. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jefi__\"> /u/Jefi__ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1oo1ub5/why_is_the_music_streaming_landscape_so_different/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <",
