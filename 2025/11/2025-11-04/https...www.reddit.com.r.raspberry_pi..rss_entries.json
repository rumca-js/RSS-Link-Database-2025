While looking up how to resolve this I tried holding shift during boot and shorting pins 5 and 6 together, but neither worked as it still failed to boot. I eventually booted from another drive and figured out how to manually change config.txt to remove the overclock settings. After doing this though it now always ignores overclock settings and the setting for pcie gen 3 in config.txt. Ive tried multiple boot drives and even a fresh installation of raspberry pi os, but it still ignores the performance related options in config.txt on all of them. After this I tried flashing the bootloader using rpi-imager and a spare sd card, but even after successfully reflashing it still ignores those options. When I enable rtc trickle charging in config.txt it works fine. The options it ignores are: &#39;&#39;&#39; dtparam=arm_freq=2800 dt",
