Sometime this year, eMeet quietly fixed this, and you can now buy a \u201ctraditional\u201d version of the webcam at Amazon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Webcams simply have become progressively better over time, but <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2606808/emeets-brand-new-4k-webcam-had-me-swearing-in-admiration.html\">the quality of the eMeet Piko+ was revelatory</a>. It\u2019s an odd little dual-lens 4K camera that performed especially well in the low light cast by a display, with decent performance in fuller, more natural light. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>My only problem with it at the time I reviewed it, was that only a tripod option was available.

But if you\u2019re going to get a docking station for a productivity laptop, you should pay a little up for one that\u2019s properly future-proof with the latest standards and lots of connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One of the best options right now is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DTSZC5Y7/\">this Anker Prime DL7400 with 14 ports</a> that\u2019s currently 25% off on Amazon</strong>, bringing its price down from its original $300 to a much more affordable $225. That might seem pricey, but it\u2019s well worth it for all the potential it\u2019ll unlock in your laptop.</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"cta_btn_heading cta_btn_heading_center-aligned\"></span><div class=\"cta wp-block wp-block-button cta__btn_center-aligned\"><a class=\"cta__btn\" h",
