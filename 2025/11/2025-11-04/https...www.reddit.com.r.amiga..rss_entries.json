Then I purchased a cable to connect to a PC for data transfer. The cable had two male 25pin connectors and I mistakenly connected the Amiga Serial port to the PC Parallel port. I am so angry at myself for such an ignorant mistake. </p> <p>The Amiga didn&#39;t care for the connection and seemed to reboot. Now it will POST, ask for the Kickstart disk, Read the Kickstart disk, then the screen goes grey to white and the drive light comes on then nothing. It does not show the Workbench request. So it never fully boots. It does not get to the point of asking for the Workbench disk.</p> <p>I am thinking I toasted a chip by connecting those two incompatible ports together.
