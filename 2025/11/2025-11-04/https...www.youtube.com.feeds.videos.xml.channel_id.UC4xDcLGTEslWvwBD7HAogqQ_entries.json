        "description": "The SL-1 reactor event took place on January 3, 1961, at a remote testing facility in Idaho. During maintenance, a critical error caused a sudden release of energy, leading to a powerful mechanical reaction inside the reactor. Three personnel were affected, and the site required a complex cleanup due to high contamination levels. One individual was found in an unusual position above the reactor, highlighting the force of the incident.",
