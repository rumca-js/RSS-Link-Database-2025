If I can&#39;t complete the download for a certain NZB, using a single provider, is there a way I can check whether those articles are also missing on a different provider/backbone, without having access to those other providers? i.e. a service or method to determine whether another provider will indeed complete. I&#39;m definitely willing to subscribe to whatever provider will have it available, but obviously I&#39;d like to know before subscribing. Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/roseyplane\"> /u/roseyplane </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1oo13g9/checking_if_dl_can_complete_elsewhere/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1oo13g9/checking_if_dl_can_complete_elsewhere/\">[comments]</a></span>",
