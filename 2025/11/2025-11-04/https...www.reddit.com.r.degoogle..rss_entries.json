I actually used to work in internet marketing, way back before Google was even a thing. Eventually became head of paid search at our company, spending literal millions on ads for our clients, getting invited to the European HQ in Dublin for fancy shindigs, using every Google tool I could get my hands on. </p> <p>I left the job though, became so sick of capitalism and making the internet an objectively worse place that I couldn&#39;t be a part of it any more. Now I&#39;m trying to get away from Google and other tech giants/monopolies as much as possible. Today starts my migration of a couple of things to Proton. I&#39;ll probably grab their Unlimited deal, it seems decent.</p> <p>I&#39;ve also already left Spotify and Netflix and gone back to just using my own media on a Plex server running off a Raspberry Pi.

Microg for Revanced works well.</p> <p>I know this is possible because every modded apk basically works because GSM check has been removed. I wonder if there&#39;s a way to modify the app yourself. I&#39;ve tried Lucky Patcher but it never worked.
