Yes, you <em>will </em>come to treat your robot vacuum like a member of the family, and no, you <em>cannot </em>escape the fact that there will always be one light that doesn't turn on even though there's simply no reason it won't. These are just the facts.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Beyond that, the only thing we know for sure about the smart home is that it's tricky to get right. You have to navigate a tangle of standards and ecosystems, optimize your control systems, and design a lot of seemingly basic features yourself. The industry seems to be on a path to a much better place! But we're not there yet.</p>\n<ifram",
