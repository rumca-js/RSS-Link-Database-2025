Centred on a comparison between renting games from a store in the past and having access to games on Games Pass today.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/i-cannot-work-out-what-this-terrible-new-xbox-game-pass-advert-is-trying-to-say-but-i-know-microsoft-has-once-again-missed-the-point\">Read more</a></p>",
