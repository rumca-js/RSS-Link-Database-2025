If you need a little breathing room, today you can grab <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-Nintendo-Switch-Smartphones-Shooting-TPPMSDX1TIA2V3003/dp/B0C65CMZK7?th=1\">a 1TB TeamGroup MicroSD card for just $62.99</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a 110MB/s speed rating for data read, this card should max out the Steam Deck\u2019s MicroSD card slot, allowing for maximum performance for anything stored on it.
