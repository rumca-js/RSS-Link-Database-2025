A while ago I simplified my setup to route nearly all public requests from the VPS to a single VM running Nginx Proxy Manager and then have it route to the correct address. This setup has been working flawlessly and fast. My network has a pfSense box that serves as the DNS server for the local IP addresses. I&#39;m thinking of getting rid of the routing VM and sending the VPS traffic to pfSense with a proxy installed (haproxy is the most plausible I assume). But, I have a lot of domains to route, and am always adding more. I am looking for a way to more-or-less automatically route to the correct local IP based on the incoming domain name since any DNS request should pull in the local IP and the traffic should end up at the correct address. I believe haproxy requires specific backends for every destination? Is there a better way to pass the traffic on? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --",
