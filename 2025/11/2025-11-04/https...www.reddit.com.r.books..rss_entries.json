Maybe it not being an ending persay, not wrapping things up neatly, was part of the point of the book thematically. But as a reader I was disappointed that there wasn&#39;t a bit more, I don&#39;t know, closure? I really wanted Richard and Cynthia to get together - yes maybe that&#39;s cliche and maybe again part of the point of the book is that the man and woman he meets in his adventure don&#39;t always have to get together. In a way I guess it was realistic - good even - that she also got a fresh start, new lease of life, just like Richard did, just not with him. Either way I guess I kind of wanted them together regardless; thought they were good for each other.</p> <p>I also felt like things got l",

For me it was very obvious that this whole &quot;affair&quot; was not one, it was more likely SA? He was 15 and got &quot;seduced&quot; by his 42 year old neighbor. Phrasing it as an affair just plays it down. In my opinion this is the whole premise of the depressed tone of the book, because Istvan is obviously traumatized? Every other intimate relation he has with a woman is reflecting the one he had with his neighbor: They are older, married and from his point of view somehow ugly. I wouldn&#39;t say, that this is just his type of woman, I rather think that the experience he made with 15 marked him.</p> <p>Aside from that I felt really uncomfortable reading the intimate scenes with his neighbor.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I read A LOT of dark books, but very rarely do they actually shake me. I just read Big Sur by Jack Keuroac. Having done a lot of drugs and alcohol in the past, and having loved so many people in serious active addiction, it spoke to me on such a personal level. It took awhile to get into\u2014maybe 50 or so pages. But once I started to understand his writing style, I was hooked. It was such an honest, realistic, raw portrayal of life in addiction. And Jack was so tender and sensitive; I just wanted to give him a hug.</p> <p>After finishing the book, I was so affected by it that I tried to find other people discussing it. But pretty much everyone criticized it! Is it that the average person doesn\u2019t have intense, personal experience with the subject matter? Am I just dumb for liking it? Lmaoo no but I would love to hear from other people who were moved by this book, or any others by him!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",
