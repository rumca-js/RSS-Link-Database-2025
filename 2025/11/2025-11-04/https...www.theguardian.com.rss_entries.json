South Africa were ahead of the game in maximising the impact of replacement forwards off the bench and the sight of all that fresh beef rumbling on to the field early in the second half was certainly arresting. As the Springboks have proved repeatedly, it works a treat if you possess the requisite strength in depth.</p><p>As with all good ideas, however, other people love to copy them. And so we have a modern-day arms race. Everyone now has, or aspires to, their own Bomb Squad. Around the 45th-50th minute in virtually any game there will be an army of stunt doubles preparing to replace the players who started the game. And if a coach can field fewer than three specialist backline reserves in order to bolster further his forward resources, happy days.</p> <a href=\"https://www",

Louise, the young woman at the centre of this beguiling film, is a mirage of a character; introduced in fragments, we first hear her lilting lamentations against a darkened screen. This is followed by closeups of a yellow notebook, in which her fears and desires overflow on every page, as they are read out by a mysterious, unseen man.</p><p>When Louise finally materialises on screen, her everyday existence unfurls over deceptively mundane episodes. Through these sequences, Pagliai builds a fascinating tension between the stillness of the compositions and Louise\u2019s agitated psyche.
