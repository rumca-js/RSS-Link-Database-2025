When the clusters were dissolved, fibril growth was almost entirely suppressed. This reveals a promising new strategy: stop the precursors, stop the disease.",

        "description": "A new floating droplet electricity generator is redefining how rain can be harvested as a clean power source by using water itself as both structural support and an electrode. This nature-integrated design dramatically reduces weight and cost compared to traditional solid-based generators while still producing high-voltage outputs from each falling drop. It remains stable in harsh natural conditions, scales to large functional devices, and has the potential to power sensors, off-grid electronics, and distributed energy systems on lakes and coastal waters.",

        "description": "Scientists identified a small molecule that interrupts a harmful protein pair linked to diabetic inflammation and tissue damage. The compound helped wounds heal faster and reduced organ stress in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes models. Unlike typical treatments, it works by blocking damaging signals rather than lowering sugar levels. The results point to a new direction for treating diabetes complications.",

Peaceful, prosperous eras produced more elaborate and numerous burial sites, while wartime periods saw far fewer. Tomb clusters also tended to form in fertile, humid regions that supported thriving settlements. The findings lay groundwork for better preservation and protection.",
