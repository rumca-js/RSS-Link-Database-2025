For example, I like the Xbox Gaming overlay, but it can be very glitchy. On some games it just doesn&#39;t work, other games it works but doesn&#39;t disable the game input, etc. Also why can&#39;t I connect to Bluetooth (headphones) using it? Besides that, I have pretty frequent glitches, like Windows UI elements stuck on the screen or my controller randomly disconnecting.</p> <p>It seems pretty obvious that Windows was never intended to be used like this, so there&#39;s issues. On the other hand, Bazzite mentions that it can be used on TV-based setups like what I have. If I can operate everything with a controller through a front-end, that would be perfect. What I have ",

Now the board has 8gb ram, I figure if I added 16gb more, up to a total of 24gb ram, it should last long enough in that state that I really wouldn&#39;t need to upgrade RAM again until maybe I get a new board. That won&#39;t happen for like a decade, so is it worth it? What do you think. I use emulators and the such, and was considering making it a Steam box, but Intel hardware dose not seem to want to cooperate. Unless I have lost my mind, windoze seems like the only option for it. Please don&#39;t say Bazzite, it ran borderline borked. Won&#39;t do much but desktop with Holo. Cannot find an emulator that has a wine/proton layer to install windows 98 games. What am I going to do with this thing? I want to make a killer old school gaming box that still uses Debian, but it has to kick ass and party with Intel hardware. Am I doomed to the nightmarish windoze 10, I installed windoze 11 on it and lost ",
