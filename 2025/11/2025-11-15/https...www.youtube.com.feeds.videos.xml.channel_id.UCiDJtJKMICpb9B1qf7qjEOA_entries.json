With newfound reference photos of the massive filming miniature use in the 1989 Batman film, we're able to see upgrades made to this model to make it even more accurate than its larger-scale predecessor. We're impressed by the quality of this prototype--just look at the details in the cockpit! \n\nOur review of the 1/6 scale Jazzinc Batwing: https://youtu.be/U2avwjqxa34\nThe original Batwing model restored: https://youtu.be/0STyxqVXaXI\n\nShot by Josh Self and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube",
