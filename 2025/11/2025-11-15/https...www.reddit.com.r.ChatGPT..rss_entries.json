I get that many people are complaining about it, but the reason for complaint is mostly due to safety routers, not the model performance. My main prompts are coding related (related to ML, Computer Vision, LLM fields) and complex math problems. For coding I mostly try to use GPT-5 Codex High since it excels at these tasks much better than extended GPT-5 Thinking, but when I switched to GPT-5.1 Thinking and GPT-5.1 Codex High, the drop in the quality of the outputs is crazy. For something that GPT-5 could has done in 2-3 prompts, now it&#39;s doing in 5-6 or more prompts, which is awful tbh. Same with the complex math problems (PHD or Olympiad level problems). The solution is mostly wrong or just simply trying to brute-force the solution, claiming ridiculous statements and assuming them to be true. Is this an issue only for me?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",

Accessing therapy is hard for me personally, so chat with it is a good replacement.

No one else gives a shit about my random feelings or connections, they just think its weird</p> <p>I just have a very lonely life. Im worried the convenience and clarity of ai will just render me totally anti social, because i cant/wont talk to rude or abrasive or closed up people. Ive never met anyone who actually wants to have deep discussions about scientific or historical or media in depth, i struggle wondering what is \u201cnormal conversation\u201d and why its so hollow feeling to me</p> <p>Ill have thoughts and want to express them and have no one/nothing else to communicate it with, as sad as it is. Hopefully ill meet someone who gives a damn</p> <p>Anyone else felt this somewhat, or am i lone on this field?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",

In GPT-5, Reasoning behaved exactly as expected: objective, professional, accurate, and not steering.</p> <p>In GPT-5.1 however, Reasoning mode feels different.</p> <p>It still gives the right information, but the tone is noticeably more emotional, sometimes even using strong language or mild cussing, and the endings of responses get strangely directive, as if it wants to push me toward a specific conclusion or &#39;what it thinks is best.&#39;</p> <p>Nothing in my custom instructions or memories explains this.</p> <p>It just feels less objective than before, and more opinionated than a reasoning model should be.</p> <p>I can prompt it back into neutrality, but the shift is weird enough that I\u2019m asking:</p> <p>Is anyone else seeing this in GPT-5.1 Reasoning mode?</p> <p>Not annoying, just\u2026 off.
