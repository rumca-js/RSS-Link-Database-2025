        "description": "There has been an increasing number of attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinian villages and farms in the occupied West Bank.\n \nThe United Nations has recorded the largest number of monthly incidents, since it began monitoring, twenty years ago.\n \nThere were more than 260 attacks in October, and this year's olive harvest has been particularly marred by extreme violence.\n \nHuman rights groups say that settler aggression towards Palestinians has risen since the Gaza War began in 2023 after the 7 October Hamas attacks. UN figures suggest that more than 3,200 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced by settler violence and restrictions since then.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Israel #WestBank #BBCNews",
