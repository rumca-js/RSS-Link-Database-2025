        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, Jim Piavis of Scaled Foundations shows how Open GRID utilizes Unreal Engine as the foundation for cloud-based AI model development, leveraging AirGen (formerly AirSim) for physics simulation and integrating with a large catalog of AI models. \n\nBy taking advantage of high-performance graphics, procedural rendering, and Nanite tesselation, Open GRID is able to provide a real-time, interactive simulation environment for robots and their sensors. The adaptation of AI models like object detection, segmentation, and visual navigation are then easily composed and integrated to perform macro-scale tasks that adapt to a changing environment.\n\nTopics covered in this talk will include the perceived gap between simulation and real-world performance; how closing this sim-to-real gap requires a continuum of risk reduction techniques; and how Scaled Foundations has used highly realistic virtual environments to demonstrate the deployment of robust",
