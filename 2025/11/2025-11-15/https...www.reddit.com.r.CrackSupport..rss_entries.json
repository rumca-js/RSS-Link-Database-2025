And I&#39;ve only recently got this problem. First i experienced this with Dishonored 2. Then far cry 3. And after that i decided to do a factory reset on my laptop. Even after that it started crashing and freezing again. This time even with other games like far cry 5 which didn&#39;t even launch. It only showed the splash screen and closed itself.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ninja-style69\"> /u/Ninja-style69 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1oy4vjs/fitgirl_repacks_problem/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1oy4vjs/fitgirl_repacks_problem/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Because of that, in-game we have the same default &quot;Player&quot; username and the same profile pic. I host a Hamachi server and he joins in. Yesterday, when I loaded the save like I always do, it spawned me in his body in his position with his inventory. The game recognizes us as one player to the point I can use the character customizer to change his look for him.</p> <p>Is there any way to give ourselves unique game names and skip the whole Tyler Durden experience?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/das_me_daveed\"> /u/das_me_daveed </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1oxliwa/how_to_change_online_fix_profile_name/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1oxliwa/how_to_change_online_fix_profile_name/\">[comments]</a></span>",
