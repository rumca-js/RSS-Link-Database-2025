        "description": "As a new entry in the franchise, a successor to everything that came before and really just another great puzzler for those who loved Tetris Effect, Lumines Arise Review comes highly recommended. By the end of Journey, there's this message of ascending beyond and embracing the light of hope. \n\nLike Tetris Effect, Lumines Arise appeals to a deeper state of mind \u2013 one that appreciates the beauty of its sights and sounds, even after getting crushed for the millionth time in Survival.",

        "description": "Where Winds Meet has a staggering amount to play through for the global launch, and considering how much content has been added to the Chinese version since its release last year, there's even more to come. Where Winds Meet may initially seem like your average open-world action-adventure title with more than its share of ridiculousness. \n\nBut underneath its veneer is a true understanding of the Wuxia genre, letting you become a part of its world rather than a tourist passing through.",

        "description": "You would think it's pointless to complain about a Call of Duty title because a large contingent of players will pick it up anyway. However, Microsoft's decision to make new titles available day one on Game Pass has allegedly led to massive losses. Look no further than last year's Black Ops 6, which reportedly lost $300 million in sales. This seemingly led to the restructuring of Game Pass prices and restricting its release to the Ultimate and PC tiers.\n\nWith even higher stakes to account for, it's insane that this is the campaign that Black Ops 7 ultimately delivers. It feels like an elaborate joke, or a collective resignation of creativity \u2013 simply toss in everything but the kitchen sink and hope for the best. If so, props to Raven Software and Treyarch for creating what very well may be the worst Call of Duty campaign yet.",
