I\u2019m the \u201cmale role model\u201d in his life so it\u2019s been an incredible routine we\u2019ve gotten into - we\u2019ve gotten very close during that time but recently have hit a wall in terms of what games to play. </p> <p>In the past he got us really into rust, madden, sea of thieves, Minecraft, RS6, GTA V, gears reloaded, Fortnite and forza horizons. </p> <p>We\u2019ve tried fall guys and skate recently but neither stuck. He\u2019s also resistant to PVE or co-op story games so I\u2019m at a loss. I can tell it bothers him that we\u2019ve struggled to find a game so I\u2019ll take any ideas, especially for competitive shooters. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lonetraveler206\"> /u/lonetraveler206 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1oy53nj/game_recommendations_for_me_and_my_nephew/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/",
