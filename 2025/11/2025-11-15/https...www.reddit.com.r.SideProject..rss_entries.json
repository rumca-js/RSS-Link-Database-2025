I\u2019m trying to build a few side projects this year to see if any of them can grow enough for me to eventually leave my 9\u20135. </p> <p>My second project is StartFast, a curated directory of useful SaaS, AI, creator, and productivity tools for builders.</p> <p>I built it because I kept running into the same problem while working on new ideas: there are thousands of tools out there, but very few places that actually curate the good ones.

I\u2019m expecting a newborn later this year, and my goal is to create enough financial breathing room to spend more time at home.

Basically you just look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you&#39;re essentially exploiting this to your advantage. </p> <p>For example, SoFi Invest will pay you $75 to create an account and deposit $25. You deposit the money, get paid the $75 bonus through an offer platform, then profit +$50 in about 3-4 minutes. That&#39;s how arbitrage works. Competition drives these offers higher as companies outbid each other for signups, creating more opportunities like this. </p> <p>This probably won&#39;t make you rich but it&#39;s an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me cover expenses.

I recently lanched my website <a href=\"http://www.languageswithsol.com\">www.languageswithsol.com</a> and I am struggling to get clients. I really believe in this project and in my products. I create printables for kids learning languages, in English, Spanish and Italian. There are recipes, fun activities and more :) Any advice on what I can do to get it running? I have an instagram as well, where I try to post more educational stuff for parents and also some ads. I advertise on pinterest too, I think I got my first sell from there. But other than that I am stuck, nothing else seems to be working. I don&#39;t have loads of time to network, but I know I should try that too in various communities. I am a full time student and I am struggling to make ends meet right now. Thanks!

I started using Neo recently just to test whether an AI centered browser could help me stay organized between research, planning, and writing tasks. Shockingly it gave me a clearer flow and kept me from losing track of scattered ideas. For anyone juggling a side project while handling a day job or studies, what tools have actually made a noticeable difference for you?

Basically you just look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you&#39;re essentially exploiting this to your advantage.</p> <p>For example, SoFi Plus will pay you $30 to subscribe to their service, which only costs $10 for the month. You subscribe, get paid the $30 bonus through an offer platform, then profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes. That&#39;s how arbitrage works. Competition drives these offers higher as companies outbid each other for signups, creating more opportunities like this.</p> <p>This probably won&#39;t make you rich but it&#39;s an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me cover expenses.
