I do have vs 2022 installed with all the plugins installed. So, I found a dll on unknown cheats where you have aimbot and all that stuff. it comes in a dll so I figured I needed and injector, so I got xenos and launched xenos 64. I selected rustclient.exe and made sure I had a eac bypasser( I needed to replace the folder easyanticheat). I am playing on tirify cracked launcher. When I started Injecting I got this message saying failed to inject image , error code 0xC0000022. I had no succes of fixing this with chatgpt, and this is my last resort. heres the link for the cheat: <a href=\"https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/rust/721202-rust-internal-dumper.html\">https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/rust/721202-rust-internal-dumper.html</a> and please provide me with some free actual working cheats if you guys can. I also have 0 experience in coding, and i aint cheating",
