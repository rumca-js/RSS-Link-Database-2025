Recently, a law was passed in Italy that, theoretically, should block access to all websites for anyone under 18 years old. The problem is that they&#39;ve made it mandatory to provide your ID to access these websites. That&#39;s fine, except that in Italy, with other authentication methods, data was already ending up in places it shouldn&#39;t have been. So, I&#39;m asking you, who surely know more about cybersecurity than a high school student. Is this law fair in a country where such precarious security conditions exist?</p> <p>Sorry if this is an inappropriate question and sorry for poor language.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dxvi_P\"> /u/Dxvi_P </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1oy2n1z/new_law_in_italy_about_18_site/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",

This crew (including 25 identified people) is responsible for a large portion of the fake SMS messages (smishing) that we all get, including the fake messages from the US Post Office claiming they need more information to deliver a package or the rash of fake Toll Payments we all got. More importantly, this crew was also well known for faking Google Pay and Apple Pay payments. They transferred victim payment information to new cell phones, where they then created a new pay instance that other vendors then accepted. This is huge! Kudos to Google and all the other people involved. Multi-national arrests like this take the coordinated action of dozens and dozens of people and dozens of lawyers. It\u2019s an expensive, tricky endeavor to pull",
