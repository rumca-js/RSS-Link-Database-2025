I am flying to a remote part of western Alaska on the shores of the Bering Sea where I will be camping alone in bear country, hiking, beach combing, searching for shed caribou antlers and hunting for dead walrus ivory. \n\nOutdoor Boys on FACEBOOK\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TeamOutdoorBoys\n\nOutdoor Boys on INSTAGRAM\n@outdoorboyschannel\n\nBUY OUTDOOR BOYS T-SHIRTS\n http://shop.spreadshirt.com/catsandcarp/",
