It&#39;s an RSS feed builder that generates from webpages, email folders, and REST API calls. Just recently, I hit <strong>200 stars on GitHub</strong> - to celebrate the occasion, I completely redesigned the UI with the help of my friend Claude, and I&#39;ve deployed it to the TrueNAS community catalog! Seeing as how I don&#39;t have a team of quality engineers, I am hopeful that maybe this community can help me out with some testing to make sure I didn&#39;t break anything! I&#39;m hosting the application for a little while with an open port just for you all. I appreciate all of the love and support I&#39;ve gotten from this subreddit very much. I hope that Mkfd continues to serve all those who choose to use it and the many more that come to discover it!</p> <p><a href=\"http://tbarani.tplin",
