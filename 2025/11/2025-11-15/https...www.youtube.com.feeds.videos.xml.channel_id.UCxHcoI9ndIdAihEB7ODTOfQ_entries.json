        "description": "Tricky hated being called Trip-Hop. Formerly of Bristol Sound progenitors Massive Attack, he with his medicated rasp and the cool indifference of partner Martina Topley-Bird shifted what British hip-hop could sound like. Dark, claustrophobic, paranoid and set upon a foundation of soul, downtempo hip hop and dub reggae. These experiments with genre as well as gender sparked comparisons to, and later kudos from, David Bowie. But after an essential, pivotal debut spawned from history of trauma, addiction and a deep well of melancholy, his sound was snatched from him and made safe for radio. This is New British Canon and this is the story of Maxinquaye.\n\n#tricky  #bristolmusic  #musicdocumentary \n\nFact-checking by Chad Van Wagner.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:58 The Early Days Of The Tricky Kid\n07:30 Aftermath & Martina Topley-Bird\n14:25 The Creation of Maxinquaye\n23:53 The Relase of Maxinquaye\n28:08 The Everything After of Tricky\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nLu",
