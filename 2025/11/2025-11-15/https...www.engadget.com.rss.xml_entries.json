A single organizer manages the group and decides who\u2019s invited, what\u2019s shared and how payments are handled. Once someone joins, they can access shared Apple services like Music, TV+, iCloud+, Fitness+ or Arcade, along with any compatible third-party apps that support Family Sharing.</p>\n<p>Setting it up only takes a few minutes, but understanding how it works makes it far easier to manage long-term. Whether you\u2019re adding a new partner, a roommate or creating an Apple ID for a child, the process is similar across iPhone, iPad and Mac, and each person keeps their own private account within the shared ecosystem.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><h2 id=\"jump-link-getting-started-with-family-sharing\">Getting star",
