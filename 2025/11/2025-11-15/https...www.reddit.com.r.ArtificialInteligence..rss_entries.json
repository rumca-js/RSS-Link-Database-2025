As part of the methodology, I am running a brief survey of users who interact with AI tools or follow AI related communities. I appreciate the time of anyone who decides to participate and ask that responses be given in good faith to keep the data usable.</p> <p>The survey has fifteen questions answered on a scale from completely disagree to completely agree. It does not collect names, email addresses, or account information. The only demographic items are broad age ranges and general occupation categories such as student, employed, retired, or not currently working. Individual responses cannot be traced back to any participant.</p> <p>The purpose of the survey is to understand how people who engage with AI perceive issues such as authorship, responsibility, fairness, and cult",

When it comes to software development or any other relevant field we will have a lot of noise. Especially when debugging something. If a system breaks or something goes wrong we need to find the root cause. The process of debugging something is a lot harder than making something up. For that you need the understanding of the product and where it could have failed. You have to ask few relevant individual s,look at tons of logs, codes etc. May be it could be related to something that happened 2 years ago. The problem is LLM can&#39;t hold all this data which would be well out of its context window.</p> <p>Take an example of a bug that calculates something wrong.

While we&#39;ve been beat in the head with how much tech companies like Samsung Google and Apple try to emphasize AI more than the new products that they try to announce to the point where it makes said new products more boring and samey than anything worthwhile, I&#39;ve seen a lot of the entertaining things that are thought up by people that use something like Sora, I&#39;ve seen YouTube channels make great use of it even when using existing materials. And I&#39;ve listened to a lot of AI covers that not only gave new life to existing songs, but also made some BETTER than the original recordings that they are based off of, by reimagining them in different genres from different time periods. Basically YouTube, has been one place that&#39;s shown that AI can be used by people for good",
