The order Trump signed excludes the goods from \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff rates, which start at 10% and go as high as 50%. However, the order doesn\u2019t exempt the goods entirely from tariffs. Many of the commodities that will no longer face \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs have seen some of the biggest price increases since Trump took office, in part because of tariffs he imposed and a lack of sufficient domestic supply.\n\nCNN's Fredricka Whitfield speaks with journalist and author of \"The Rick Report\" Rick Newman, and CNN correspondent Rafael Romo reports from a food giveaway event in Atlanta.  #CNN #News",
