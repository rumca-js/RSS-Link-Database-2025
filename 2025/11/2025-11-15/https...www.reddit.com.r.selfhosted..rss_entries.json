Currently I&#39;ve set up Duplicati but it is doing only file level backup and.. this will most likely to corrupt a database at some point in time. But what is the alternative? - Setting up each container to dump the database locally on daily basis? But there is no out of the box way to monitor it to know if it succeeded - Writing some scripted logic for backup job to dump the db? Adding new services already is so effort consuming it sucks a most fun of it - Centralized databases for all services? Kinda kills the container idea here. - Something else?</p> <p>What to do? Is there a way/tool that I can just point at a docker and it will run for each container/stack, shut it down, copy to archive and restart it that is also easy to manage? Is there some magic way/tool that will ensure perfect database consistency from file backups?</p> <",

I got years ago a Raspberry Pi 3B to play around and thought to give it a try to build some self hosted stuff, and started to learn linux and docker. I built a plex server on the mounted local drive and worked for some time, but as time goes on it&#39;s getting REALLY slow.</p> <p>I&#39;m thinking of leaving the 3B for some playing around and buying a NAS or something similar, but I don&#39;t know what works fine for horizontal scaling (when more and more movies are added, keeping the streaming stable).</p> <p>Thoughts on UGREEN NASync DXP2800?
