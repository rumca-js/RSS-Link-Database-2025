There are a few games I\u2019d like to download that are no longer available, or were never released on PC at all \u2014 such as some of the old Need for Speed games or older PlayStation exclusives like God of War.</p> <p>I\u2019d also like to download games I\u2019ve already purchased on my consoles without having to buy them again. I know there\u2019s a mega thread about this and I have gone through it, but I\u2019m finding it a bit daunting and complicated since this is my first time doing anything like this. I\u2019m also worried about accidentally downloading something unsafe.</p> <p>Could someone please recommend a website or method that\u2019s user-friendly for someone like me who doesn\u2019t really understand this stuff yet?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Okay this might be weird but I couldn&#39;t think of a better subreddit to put it on. Some shows, as you all know, never get physical releases. Shows like, for instance, season 4 of X-Men Evolution. Some of these shows also had little flash games on their website. A good example for this would be... I don&#39;t know... X-Men Evolution. So my question is, if someone wanted to put the fourth season of a show on DVDs and add a special feature to play aforementioned flash games (probably only on PC, since it would be a nightmare to play them with a DVD remote) would this be possible? Could someone put together a DVD set with these flash games on it and have it all... work? Again, this is sort of stretching the subreddit a bit, but I&#39;m not sure where else it could go. Any help or idea would be super appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ShinGenRev\"> /u/ShinGenRev </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht",
