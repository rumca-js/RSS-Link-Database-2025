Cool idea, moved on . Except the next day I kept catching a similar flicker in the corner of my eye. I thought it was just lack of sleep or a reflection from my window but it kept happening in different places. In the kitchen , on the bus, in the stairwell of my building. Always the same quick glint, gone before I could turn my head . The weird part is that every time it happened I felt that same tiny pul l in my stomach that the book described like the world is trying to get your attention . I know it\u2019s just my brain blending fiction with real life but it made me wonder if anyone else has ever had a book linger so strongly that you start noticing things that fit its magic system almost too well .</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",

The Return of the King felt like a storm I had to walk straight into. It was dark and grim in the beginning, just like you all warned me, and there were moments where I genuinely felt like I had to push myself through it. But I\u2019m so glad I did. And as I mentioned in a previous review, I prefer Aragorn to Thorin as a king and this book absolutely confirmed that for me. The man radiates strength without the ego. I also walked away from this one with a new respect and love for Pippin and Merry. They were definitely more than I expected, not just the comedy duo anymore, but real heroes in their own right. And I might get hate for this one, but as much as I love Frodo, I think Sam is the real hero of this tale. I might get kicked out or Middle Earth for that, but oh well. Sam was loyal, determined, faithful to the point of breaking,and he never left",
