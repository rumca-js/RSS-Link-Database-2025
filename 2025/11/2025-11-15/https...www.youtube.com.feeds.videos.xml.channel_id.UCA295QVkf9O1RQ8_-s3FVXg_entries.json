But what\u2019s wild is that Beijing was once in the exact same position, even worse in 2013, and still managed to clean up its air in under a decade. This video breaks down why Delhi\u2019s pollution is so catastrophic from its geographical bowl and winter inversion to vehicles, dust, construction, and crop burning  and then shows how Beijing executed one of the world\u2019s most successful clean-air turnarounds. If Beijing could fix it with similar geography, tougher pollution, and the same excuses\u2026 why can\u2019t we? Let\u2019s understand the science, the politics, the money, and the accountability needed to actually save millions of Indian lives.\n\n\ud83d\udcccFollow us on Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/aevytvdaily/\n\ud83d\udccc",
