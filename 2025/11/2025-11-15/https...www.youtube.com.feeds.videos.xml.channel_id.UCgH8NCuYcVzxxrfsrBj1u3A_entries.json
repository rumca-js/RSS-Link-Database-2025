        "description": "\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f To see Justin Hawkins Rides Again LIVE across the UK, visit: \nhttps://www.aegpresents.co.uk/event/justin-hawkins-rides-again/\n\nDavid Coverdale has announced his retirement. The man was an inspiration to me growing up in Suffolk and something else entirely to my mother. Anyway, to me, he is the Roger Moore of lead vocalists and a true Legend. This is a longer episode than usual, but there's lots to talk about including one of my favourite Whitesnake tracks, \"Fool For Your Loving\" - the original version from Ready an' Willing.\n\nTo come and see The Darkness on tour in the USA and Canada, you can find details here:  https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n#reaction #davidcoverdale  #whitesnake",
