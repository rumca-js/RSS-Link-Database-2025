It opens with a flashback, as Carol and her partner Helen (Miriam Shor) are on a dream vacation at an ice hotel in Norway, and all she can do is complain about how cold it is. When Carol sees a stunning aurora borealis, her only thought is \"it looks like a screensaver.\" But that cynicism might also be her superpower as she prepares to solve the hive-mind apocalypse that has descended on Earth.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Welcome! <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/815745/pluribus-review-apple-tv\">The two-episode premiere of <em",

I wanted a small, portable, and semi-powerful machine that could easily sit beneath my living room TV and occasionally move over to my desk to play games or even use for work. My dream was to find something as easy to use as the Steam Deck, which has become my primary gaming device due to its simplicity and massive catalog of PC games.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just two days later, I walked into Valve's headquarters and was introduced to the new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announceme",
