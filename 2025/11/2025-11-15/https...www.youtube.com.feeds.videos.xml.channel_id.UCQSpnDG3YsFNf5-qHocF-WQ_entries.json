It works by capturing the raw movement data from high-performance gaming mice, which given enough DPI sensitivity and polling rate, can be used to calculate the sound vibrations and resulting audio. Although it sounds scary, you'll see that it does require specific conditions, so it's probably not something you need to worry about, but it's still interesting.\n\nLinks Mentioned:\n\u2022 Paper URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13581\n\u2022 Proof of concept video: https://youtu.be/CY7Z37Ul8aQ\n\n\u25bc Time Stamps: \u25bc\n0:00 - Intro\n0:40 - The Technique & How It Works\n2:07 - What Mice Would It Work On?\n3:18 - The Biggest Limitation\n4:38 - A Excellent and Good Thing\n6:04 - Should You Be Concerned?\n7:16 - The Proof of Concept\n8:24 - Why Higher Polling Rates are Better\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac",
