I\u2019ve been testing ChatGPT 5.1 since it was released, and it literally surprised me! </p> <p>It has a great personality and behaves like a real assistant: efficient and very competent! </p> <p>I like the fact that now it is confident in its ideas and doesn\u2019t just change its stance to please me! Finally, it really helps me make the right decisions, instead of flattering me like version 5.0 used to! </p> <p>Moreover, it\u2019s much more performant! Very long chats are handled very well! It stays clear-headed and attentive even when a chat has more than 50/60 bot messages (so 100/120 messages in total). </p> <p>Kudos to OpenAI, and I hope they continue in this direction! </p> <p>What do you think?

It seems ChatGPT 5.1 thinking (high) has gotten better than 5 on the <a href=\"http://artificialanalysis.ai\">artificialanalysis.ai</a> index (it was top in reasoning benchmarks) and worse on SimpleBench. </p> <p>Apparently, it guesses how much &quot;reasoning tokens&quot; it should spend conservatively based on how difficult it thinks the prompt is, even in &quot;Extended thinking&quot; mode, but when it decides it should spend a lot, it spends A LOT of time reasoning (10-15 mins).</p> <p>After spending some time testing it vs 5 thinking, I like to keep using 5. Because 5.1&#39;s frequent guess that &quot;this question is easy and doesn&#39;t require effort&quot; most of the time leads to lower quality and less helpful (as in, better answers were available, but it didn&#39;t bother to look for it like GPT 5) answers.
