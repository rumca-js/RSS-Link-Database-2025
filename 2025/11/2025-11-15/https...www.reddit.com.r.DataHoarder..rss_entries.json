My drive was manufactured in 2011. Drives pretty much always seem to have a date of manufacture on them, as do HDDs and CD-ROM drives. If not, most electronics can be dated from date codes on ICs and PCBs. </p> <p>But I&#39;ve noticed LTO tapes themselves don&#39;t seem to have any date code. This is commensurate with most of the VHS, audio, DV etc tapes which I&#39;ve used over the years.

You can also get Hewlett Packard Enterprise (green rectangle logo) ones which will be much more recent. I&#39;ve seen Quantum brand tapes for sale whic",
