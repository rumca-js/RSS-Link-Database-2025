        "description": "We all compare ourselves to other people\u2014our friends, coworkers, strangers on the internet\u2014and most of the time, it makes us feel like shit. But why do we keep doing it? In this episode of Solved, we dig into the uncomfortable truth behind social comparison, how it quietly ruins our self-worth, and why most of what we envy in others is a projection of our own insecurity.\n\nWe also get into the brutal paradox of success, the toxic loop of chasing status, and how the constant measurement of our lives against others is one of the dumbest things we do as a species. If you\u2019ve ever felt not good enough, or like you\u2019re falling behind, this one\u2019s for you.\n\nWe also put together a free companion guide for this episode with all the takeaways, references, and tools to help you get your sh*t together once and for all.
