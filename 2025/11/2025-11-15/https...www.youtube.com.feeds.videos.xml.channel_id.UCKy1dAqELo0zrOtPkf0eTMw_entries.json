        "description": "Which of the hundreds of incredible Nintendo games are the best? Well, here at IGN, we\u2019ve teamed up with our friends at @nintendolife  to try and answer that question. What follows is the 100 best Nintendo games of all time, based on a combination of each site\u2019s expert opinions.\n\nAs for what qualifies to make our list? Well, the vast majority you'll see here were either developed and/or published by Nintendo itself. But there's also room for some others, those games that are synonymous with Nintendo consoles or at least a period of timed exclusivity on one of its many home devices and handhelds. For example, GTA Chinatown Wars sits at 99 despite being developed by Rockstar and arriving later on the PSP, because it had a whole nine months of being on the Nintendo DS first and was designed with the DS' stylus and second screen in mind.\n\nFrom iconic Nintendo in-house series such as Super Mario, Metroid, and The Legend of Zelda, to third-party heroes who have made their home on everything",
