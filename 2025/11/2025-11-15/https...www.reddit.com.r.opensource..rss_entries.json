        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi everyone, I have less than one year of experience and currently work as a web developer. Recently, I was assigned to implement an algorithm that I found quite challenging (I won\u2019t go into specifics, as it might reveal my identity). To figure it out, I looked into a library\u2019s open source code and initially copied parts of it. While doing that, I noticed the library was licensed under MIT, which led me to research software licensing, something I wasn\u2019t fully aware of before. After learning more, I decided not to copy the code directly. Instead, I used the idea behind the algorithm and wrote my own implementation in a different programming language, with a different structure. Now I\u2019m unsure about the ethics and legal implications. If I re-implemented the same logic but with my own code and design, do I still need to include the MIT license for my work, or is this okay to use without attribution?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
