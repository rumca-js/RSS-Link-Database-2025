As you may know, there\u2019s a cheaper version that\u2019s mechanically identical but uses tokens instead of miniatures. Still, I\u2019ve seen how those flashy elements help less-experienced players get into the \u201cmood\u201d of the game. Everyone wants to be the Navigator just to spin the helm, and the Kraken figure genuinely creates some memorable moments. The same thing happens with Azul: everyone loves handling the tiles\u2014I highly doubt it would feel the same with cardboard chips.</p> <p>I wanted to ask the community if you share this feeling.

I only saw it when it was the last few hours of the campaign and I had never played it but saw how well it\u2019s ranked and that it had a digital component as part of the kickstarter so I jumped in.

I like figuring out how to take advantage of each God\u2019s ability and exploring all the different combinations of opposing cards. What are some other games that let you do this? It can be anything, not just abstract games. And especially if they\u2019re lesser-known games :) </p> <p>EDIT: some games I have and I love are: - Spirit Island - Root - the game of thrones LCG </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gristbun\"> /u/Gristbun </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oxtmic/santorinis_asymmetric_powers_what_other_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oxtmic/santorinis_asymmetric_powers_what_other_games/\">[comments]</a></span>",
