I was watching someone stream the game last night and I got reminded of how annoying that section is. </p> <p>Not only did the streamer give up eventually, but there was some input lag as well.

We&#39;d put their birthdays in there and see what it said for their compatibility. We called it Beanie Connection. It was very serious. We kept a notebook keeping track of who could be dating, should be dating, just friends, maybe friends. We&#39;d go back and see if the thing was just giving us random text every time. Memory serves that it did, but I can&#39;t exactly remember. There were mortal enemies who couldn&#39;t go back in the under bed storage box on the same side of the bin. It would have caused chaos.

She has a Switch 1 (not sure if OLED) at home but nothing at my house, I share custody. The gaming industry is in a weird spot to me at this time so I was thinking of bringing the old school into her life.</p> <p>I&#39;m debating on a buying an Analogue Pocket for her if they come back in stock before Christmas. My area has a few stores that buy and sell old games so I&#39;d have no issues finding cartridges.</p> <p>Also...could someone explain an EverDrive to me? Does that come preloaded with games? I&#39;ve been meaning to jump into this hobby myself for the better part of a decade...but I&#39;ve been busy with work and stuff. You know how it is.</p> <p>Any thoughts or recommendations would be super helpful. I want to get her something awesome this year without being sucked into this &quot;you will own nothing&quot; phase of gaming. I don&#39;t want her growing up",

Maybe not pure retro games but old enough, like ps1, ps2 and original xbox games. And also - I have tried looking around for answers to my questions in beforehand but I have not quite been able to find an answer.</p> <p>Now I know emulators exist and I can grasp them well enough to make it work and look good but here is the catch. Im most certainly not alone in this, but starting that heavy xbox of mine, holding the controller I had when I played xbox just FEELS. I love it. So ideally I would like to preserve that feel. But the image is trash playing on my oled tv. I do not have a CRT and I think I would like to avoid it due to practical reasons if possible. With emulators I can maintain a good image quality but, and call me silly if you want, I don&#39;t get the same feeling.</p> <p>This has lead me onto a journey of discovery - hardware video scalers, or what",

If I did a paper round all month, I would be able to buy 1 game, so free games was a big deal to uscurious school kids.</p> <p>Anyways I traded a new game with someone for a couple of used blank discs. I got home, peeled the sketchy label off the top disk and replaced with a new one. Then the second disc was different, it was a printed label that someone has peeled a strip off, a half assed removal attempt.</p> <p>It read Archer McLean&#39;s 3D Poo. It stopped me in my tracks, I read it again and wondered... I kept the disc at the very back of my disc box, never putting this confusing sounding disc in my Amiga.</p> <p>Years later I randomly found out it was supposed to be 3D Pool.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Huminerals\"> /u/Huminerals </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/c",

The Sega Genesis came out in 1988, when everyone else was playing on 8-bit systems or even Atari consoles. In 1991, they released the Mega CD, for games that obviously had CD support\u2014in 1991!!! When the entire market was still running on cartridges. It wasn&#39;t until 1995 that the CD format started to become widespread. Then came the 32X in an attempt to advance the 32-bit generation, and to top it all off, in 1998 they launched a 128-bit console, the same year Ocarina of Time was released, and Sonic Adventure was running right next to it.</p> <p>In short, I think it&#39;s an interesting perspective on how Sega left the console market. And another thing, not to mention the entire arcade industry with groundbreaking games like Out Run in ",
