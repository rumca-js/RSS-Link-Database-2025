        "description": "Recruiters on LinkedIn are crashing out hard. One minute they're begging candidates to respond, the next they're snapping keyboards because someone took another job. In this video, we break down the most unhinged recruiter posts: the mixed messages, the contradictory \u201crules,\u201d the ghosting excuses, and the never-ending list of things candidates apparently do wrong.\n\nWhether you answer the phone, don\u2019t answer, follow up, don\u2019t follow up, send your resume, or dare to have a birthday party\u2014recruiters will find a reason to melt down. We're exposing the chaos, hypocrisy, and comedy of modern recruiting culture.\n\nHow\u2019s your experience been with recruiters? Drop it in the comments.\n\nNeed a resume / cover letter? \u27a1\ufe0f https://joshuafluke.store\n\u2022 \ud83d\udd0d Resume Reviews\n\u2022 \u270d\ufe0f Custom Resumes\n\u2022 \ud83c\udf93 Courses: Hacking the Resume & Interview\n\u2022 \ud83d\udcde 1-on-1 Consults\n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/Joshuafluke\n\u2764\ufe0f Support: https://www.patreon.com/joshuafluke\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@joshua_fluke\n\ud83d\udcf8 IG:",
