A really good example of this is Rezkin from The Kings Dark Tidings series. He&#39;s overpowered but doesn&#39;t make dumb jokes and takes things seriously. Tons of books with overpowered characters have slapstick humor or some other ridiculous personality. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like some of those too, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m looking for here. I don&#39;t mind the genre so if it&#39;s an Isekai or litrpg that&#39;s fine. I just want something that can get dark and the mood isn&#39;t broken by some dumb fart joke. Side note- a good series with overpowered mc that does not get a lot of love is The Sorcerer&#39;s Path Series by Brock E Deskins. Takes a few books but he gets nuts. Stuff like that is my guilty pleasure.

It was called something like \u201cthe placebo effect\u201d and the protagonist is medical test subject, she calls herself a professional Guinea pig. She has friends that also are \u201cprofessional Guinea pigs\u201d and her boyfriend is sick with cancer (I think?) and so she starts to abuse the trials (more than she already was) so she could give him a vacation before he dies but she ends up getting really sick I think?? There\u2019s lots of ouroboros imagery. </p> <p>I would like to reread it or even FIND IT but all my searches have come up empty. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Littlesuccubi\"> /u/Littlesuccubi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1oxfa8z/kind_of_a_tip_of_my_tongue_medical_test_subject/\">[l",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Title is pretty much self explanatory! I&#39;ve been thinking about the science/biology behind realistic vampirism/werewolfism, and would love to find some books that portray them as people, rather than straight up horrific monsters with no humanity, or as objects of desire if you catch my drift. Romance could still be part of the storyline of course, but I&#39;m just not really interested in anything that places emphasis on them being sexy. I watched Interview With A Vampire a bit ago, and really liked it, and am planning to read it now that most of the details from the movie have faded from memory (so I&#39;m not comparing them too closely to each other, since there&#39;s bound to be differences).
