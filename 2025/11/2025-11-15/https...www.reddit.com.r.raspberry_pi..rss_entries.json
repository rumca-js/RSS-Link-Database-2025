Your browser doesn&#39;t care which network it&#39;s on - the address stays consistent.</p> <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p> <ul> <li>First boot: Pi creates &quot;StuffedAnimalWAP&quot; access point automatically</li> <li>Connect to it, visit <a href=\"https://stuffedanimalwar.local/setup\">https://stuffedanimalwar.local/setup</a> in your browser</li> <li>Enter your home WiFi credentials</li> <li>Pi reboots, connects to h",
