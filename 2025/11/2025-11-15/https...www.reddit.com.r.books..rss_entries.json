It&#39;s recommended to me by a friend, and the minute I picked it up I couldn&#39;t put it down.</p> <p>Reasons of Recommendation:</p> <p>1) Trevor really knows how to tell a story. Sometimes hilarious, sometimes suspenseful.</p> <p>2) He manages to integrate reflection of racism and apathaid into his personal stories. It&#39;s not just about him, it&#39;s about the people being colonized. And some of his reflections are quite deep. Like he talked about how the places&#39; names changed after the colonizers came, how native lanagaugaes are no longer taught in schools and are replaced by English, how the colonized struggle to break the cycle of low-end jobs without education yet failed to do so, how that would lead to increasing crimes. </p> <p>I gotta say, I used to love Out of Africa, now I have to view it from a different angel.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su",

Specifically, why would the letters seem to be made of dripping ink a page or two at a time, without provocation, throughout a book published in 2021 that I bought new a few weeks ago? Sometimes on subsequent pages. On affected pages this renders the small print in footnotes and the index almost illegible. The book is &lt;em&gt;Land&lt;/em&gt; by Simon Winchester, published by Harper Collins. I bought the print version because I thought it would be a good addition to our personal library, but this isn\u2019t collection-worthy. Maybe the hardback would be better.

It was dark and grim in the beginning, just like you all warned me, and there were moments where I genuinely felt like I had to push myself through it. But I\u2019m so glad I did. And as I mentioned in a previous review, I prefer Aragorn to Thorin as a king and this book absolutely confirmed that for me. The man radiates strength without the ego. I also walked away from this one with a new respect and love for Pippin and Merry. They were definitely more than I expected, not just the comedy duo anymore, but real heroes in their own right. And I might get hate for this one, but as much as I love Frodo, I think Sam is the real hero of this tale. I might get kicked out or Middle Earth for that, but oh well.

Waiting for him to respond to his ex wife about this whole ordeal. And then...I mean, God damn. When the second to last chapter hit, I could have never predicted such a horrid turn of events despite the fact that it was right in front of me the whole time. It puts the entire novel in a new light. The way she said &quot;Celia would end up in your custody&quot; but what she really meant was that Celia died too. I mean...Jesus Christ, I can&#39;t think of a more brutal ending It justifies all of the callousness throughout Like you have to wonder, as you read it, how this woman can be so seemingly nonchalant about her son killing all of these people but then you realize that she isn&#39;t nonchala",

The constant theme of both of these seem intertwined and would love to hear others thoughts on this. </p></li> <li><p>Monica&#39;s revenge on Ember and her professor seemed unnecessary. Felt that she should have approached him with her concerns on data and privacy instead of reacting like she did. </p></li> <li><p>I was confused how the grandma was able to reforge after her first time with Toru. Did she stab herself with his pencil beforehand? </p></li> <li><p>Why do you think the author chose to only have women in the family obtain this power? Do women handle stories and information and words differently then men? </p></li> <li><p>Monica seems more affected by her father leaving then her mother. Why is this the case? </p></",
