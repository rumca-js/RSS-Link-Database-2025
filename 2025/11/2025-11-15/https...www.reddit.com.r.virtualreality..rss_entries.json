However, possibly the biggest obstacle still holding the market back is the lack of software that is compelling enough to convince people to regularly put their VR headset on.</p> <p>Up to now, developing VR games has been a large hassle compared to developing flatscreen games. None of the headsets in the market have been generally accepted by VR devs as being suitable to wear while working on code. This means that devs need to take off their headsets while writing code, and then put it back on whenever they test the code. Code testing happens very often so repeating the process of putting on and off the headset really starts to add up the annoyance levels.</p> <p>On top of that, if you use wireless mode with the Quest 3, as an example, then you have to deal with either the headset turning off and disconnecting the wireless connection, or you deal with the battery drain",

That&#39;s very crucial to me. Everything else is awesome. I know I can rebind the very far out reach D-Pad to replace it but I&#39;d prefer not having to use it for VR gaming. I understand that one of the big points of this VR headset is to be able to play screen-mode games in VR but i personally prefer just using an actual screen with my keyboard and mouse. I hope theres atleast third party accesories that have different controller layouts similar to the oculus ones.

However, I&#39;ve now read several times that the quality is much better with the Quest 3. The Quest 3 is actually a bit over budget, though. Do you think a Quest 3S would be a good alternative? I mean, since the headset is used without a PC, the Quest 3 wouldn&#39;t be able to reach its full potential in terms of resolution anyways, right? </p> <p>My mother will only use the glasses occasionally and, as I said, not for gaming.</p> <p>I look forward to hearing your opinions :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Apprehensive-Form-23\"> /u/Apprehensive-Form-23 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1oxyv1l/me",

I play Cyberpunk77, Hogwarts Legacy and Dragon Quest 11 with VR mods which make those games so much more enjoyable. But the companies dont care. </p> <p>Reason seems to be that VR is still a small market and not worth any attention for those bigger companies. Maybe this is true.</p> <p>But concerning VR headsets there are many investors. We see a lot of new devices and those cost a lot of money for development. So we see an increasing number of headsets and here nobody talks about the small market for VR.</p> <p>To make a new headset is complicated, to patch a flatscreen game to work in VR is often kind of simple. For Dragon Quest 11 I just use the UEVR profile without any tweaks. </p> <p>Why do the developers spend money on new hardware like headsets but not on software like games? I dont understand that.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"htt",
