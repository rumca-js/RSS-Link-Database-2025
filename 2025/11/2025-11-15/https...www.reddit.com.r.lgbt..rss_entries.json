Nothing wild, nothing dramatic - we were literally just holding hands in the hallway like two perfectly harmless cinnamon rolls. And then\u2026 boom. Teachers swoop in like we were summoning demons in the middle of math class.</p> <p>They told us we <em>can\u2019t</em> hold hands because it\u2019s \u201cinappropriate,\u201d and apparently the younger students \u201cshouldn\u2019t see that.\u201d<br/> Which, honestly, feels like a very polite way of saying, \u201cNo gay stuff in public, thanks.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile straight couples at school cling to each other like they\u2019re reenacting a low-budget telenovela and nobody bats an eye.</p> <p>I\u2019m torn between wanting to fight it, wanting to laugh at how ridiculous it is, and wanting to crawl into a locker until high school ends.</p> <p>Has anyone dealt with something like this?<",

I&#39;ve been having sexual thoughts about guys I&#39;ve seen online and in-person quite a lot. I have come to the conclusion that i am bisexual as i still prefer women as partners but can still see others guys as hot. But the big thing that&#39;s been bugging me is that no matter how long I think about it, the concept of gay sex (blowjobs, anal, etc.) just repulses me. I&#39;m fine with all types of foreplay or non-penetrative acts but get immediately get disgusted when i think about the actual sex part of it. I find absolutely nothing attractive about a guys asshole or most other things i see people say are &quot;hot&quot;. This has been troubling as its gotten to the point where I hesitate to consider myself bisexual in any way as i hate almost every aspect about other men (outside certain things such as their penis or their legs for some reason). This isn&#39;t even a gay-sex only thing either.",
