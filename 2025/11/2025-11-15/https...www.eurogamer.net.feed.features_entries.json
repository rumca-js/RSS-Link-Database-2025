He's credited with creating and popularising the battle royale genre, initially experimenting with it in an <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arma-3\">Arma 3</a> mod, then building it into zombie game <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/h1z1\">H1Z1</a>, before making the extraordinarily successful multiplayer shooter <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds\">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> - or PUBG as we know it now. Big ideas are irresistible to Brendan Greene, and few ideas come bigger than the one he currently has, to remake the internet.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/did-you-know-brendan-playerunknown-greene-the-creator-of-pubg-wants-to-remake-the-internet\">Read more</a></p>",
