The most recent book to pull me in like they used to was \u201cProject Hail Mary\u201d by Andy Weir. I\u2019m not a sci-fi fan, but the story idea, the humor, the sad parts, and the characters (especially their development and relationship to each other) made it one of the best I\u2019ve ever read. </p> <p>In the past, I\u2019ve loved the \u201cPractical Magic\u201d series by Alice Hoffman, \u201cThe Vampire Chronicles\u201d and \u201cThe Mayfair Saga\u201d by Anne Rice, \u201cWhat Dreams May Come\u201d by Richard Matheson, just name a few. </p> <p>I can\u2019t figure out what it is about a book that draws me in, but so many times I\u2019ll use the \u201cIf you liked\u2026\u201d websites or trying another book from an author who I\u2019ve enjoyed before, but to no avail. </p> <p>If you think based on all that, you have any recommendations, I\u2019d love to see them.

I am not a reader though , but I guess perhaps I could start somewhere my book reading journey and perhaps these books are the ones. I have plans of reading more books like the whole Harry Potter series , Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series , Chronicles of a Arnika Series , Diary of a Wimpy Kid Series.

Hardly anyone talks about how advanced and powerful those kingdoms once were Mali, Songhai, Benin, Great Zimbabwe, and more. I want to know the real truth, not the version shaped by colonials.
