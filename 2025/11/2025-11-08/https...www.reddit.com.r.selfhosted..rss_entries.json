I don&#39;t really want to create duplicates of images from the existing backups - support multiple users with a straightforward web interface usable by non techy people - ideally allow access to be shared, eg adding users and giving selective shared access. - something like shared albums where people can upload. Eg if you had an event with other people, it&#39;d be good to have a shared image folder where people can view and add their stuff</p> <p>Any suggestions of what will or won&#39;t support some of these use cases?
