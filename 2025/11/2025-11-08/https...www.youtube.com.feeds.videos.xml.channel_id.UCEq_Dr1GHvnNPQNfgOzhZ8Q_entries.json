        "description": "Clark Kent, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are called into Perry White's office at the Daily Planet to be fired. However, Clark has a revelation involving Superman that might just save their jobs! And it all has to do with the most unexpected reveal in all of comic book history. Watch as the solidjj channel finally tackles the lowest hanging fruit second only to anything related to Aquaman ever. \n\n10% Gamer Supps (Code: SOLID) \u25bc\nhttps://gamersupps.gg/SOLID\n\nLois Lane voiced by @mothballsva \n\nTwitch: https://twitch.tv/solidjj\nPodcast: @JoeSchmoesPodcast \n\nSecond channel:\u200b\u2060 @Solidusjj \nPatreon: https://patreon.com/solidjj\n\nNote: There is NO GENERATIVE AI ART used in this video. The footage you see is pulled from the 1988 Superman cartoon which has been sloppily upscaled by me. I also very sloppily had to draw over some frames since for some reason Superman never has his \"glasses off moment\" so I'm sorry if that looks kinda bizarre. But again, no AI art is in these nor will it ever be. Please",
