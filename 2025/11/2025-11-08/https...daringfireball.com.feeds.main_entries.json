So we just have to improve our own stuff. And a major\npart of that will be adopting AI ourselves.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Despite all this the basic approach of the original Techmeme\nalgorithm remains the same, he said. \u201cWhat are the most linked\nblog posts and news articles from this set of blogs? And once they\nreach a certain threshold, they\u2019re featured on the site,\u201d he said.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there\u2019s a lesson here for the rest of the media world. I and\nevery writer and mid level editor I know has stories about design\nchanges to publications that made us groan. They seemed more in\nservice of a new editor or design chief marking their territory\nlike a dog or cat, than in service of actually making their\npublication easier to read.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unsurprising",
