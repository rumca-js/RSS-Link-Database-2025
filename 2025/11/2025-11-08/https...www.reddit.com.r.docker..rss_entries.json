However, any other app that I install, works only on the server. Besides immich, nothing can be accessed anywhere. What am I doing wrong? Please tell me what additional details are required at my end to solve this? To test, I installed pertained on docker. Still, unable to access apps installed via portainer as well anywhere on local network. As you can imagine, this makes the whole self-hosting no fun. Chatgpt checks also did not help. Hoping to get some help here.
