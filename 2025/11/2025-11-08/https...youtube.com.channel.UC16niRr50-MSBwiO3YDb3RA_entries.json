        "description": "Sudan's ambassador to the US has called for concrete steps against countries that back the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), following widespread reports of atrocities carried out by its fighters in the city of el-Fasher.\n\nThe RSF denies those reports.\n\nThe RSF has agreed to a proposal from the US for a humanitarian ceasefire, the group said on Thursday. Sudan's military-led government has not yet responded.\n \nThe two sides have been embroiled in a civil war that has killed at least 150,000 people and forced 12 million others from their homes since it erupted in April 2023. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Sudan #BBCNews",
