Recently, my friends managed to find a website that&#39;s hidden under a school website (has the same main link, I don&#39;t remember what it completely was but it went something like BlahblahSchool.n et, and the hidden link just added /Schooltools to the end of it. On it you can literally play PC games like hollow knight, balatro, and others, but there&#39;s also no multiplayer games. If it gets around to too many people, I think go guardian will automatically block it, because it just detects it? its done that was many other game websites I&#39;ve played on before.</p> <p>My question is, is there ANYWAY i can bypass go guardian on my Chromebook, I have a pre",
