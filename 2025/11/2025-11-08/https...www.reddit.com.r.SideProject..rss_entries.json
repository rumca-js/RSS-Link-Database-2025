Would love feedback from this community since you all know the pain of shipping features into the void.</p> <p><strong>The problem I was solving:</strong></p> <p>I run a small SaaS with ~2,000 users. Every time I shipped a feature, I&#39;d:</p> <ul> <li>Send an email (12-18% open rate)</li> <li>Update the changelog page (literally 23 visits last month)</li> <li>Post on Twitter (my users aren&#39;t there)</li> </ul> <p>Two months later: support tickets asking for features I already built.</p> <p>I calculated I spent about good time building features that 85% of users didn&#39;t know existed. That hurt.</p> <p><strong>What I built:</strong></p> <p>ChangeTiny is a vanilla JS widget that drops into any web app and shows product updates in-app. Think of it like a &quot;What&#39;s New&quot; button with an unread count.</p> <ul> <li>User sees badge (e.g., &quot;What&#39;s New (3)",

I build <a href=\"https://mimichat.space\">Mimichat</a>, a new kind of chatting app where your messages come to life through 3D avatars. Instead of plain text, you type a message and your avatar actually speaks it out loud with emotion and animation making conversations more fun, expressive, and personal.</p> <p>It&#39;s still early, We just crossed our first 100 users, all through organic testing and word-of-mouth! but seeing people use it for jokes, emotional chats, and even random fun convos has been incredible.</p> <p>My next goal is to reach 1k users this week, help me.</p> <p>Also would love your feedback or ideas on what would make something like this even better.

The content isn\u2019t enough \u2014 marketing and personal branding are the real game. 2. Trust matters \u2014 even if the course is good, people buy from someone they feel is credible. 3. Small tweaks make a huge difference \u2014 changing copy, creating a quick intro video, and personalizing a few lessons really boosted engagement.</p> <p>I\u2019m documenting everything step-by-step as I go. I\u2019d love to share lessons and insights with anyone who\u2019s thinking about starting something similar.</p> <p>If anyone wants to follow along or chat about these experiments in a small, focused group, I\u2019ve set up a D",

I couldn&#39;t risk uploading sensitive files.</p> <p>My rule is simple: Your data never leaves your device. 100% Client-Side Processing. Zero uploads, zero ads, zero accounts, zero paid features, zero BS. </p> <p>So far my MVP is:</p> <p>PDFs (4 tools): Merge, Split, Compress, Rotate.</p> <p>JSON/YAML Formatter &amp; Base64 Encoder: Safe tools for sensitive code.</p> <p>EXIF Stripper: Privacy cleaning for photos.</p> <p>Text Deduplicator.</p> <p>More to come...</p> <p>The entire project is open source on GitHub. I encourage you to check the Network tab, you will see no file uploads.</p> <p>What private tool should I build next?</p> <p>Thanks for checking it out!</p> <p><a href=\"http://simpletoolki",

It\u2019s a simple initiative to help teams modernize their old applications built on ASP.NET Web Forms, MVC, AngularJS, or SQL Server, and move them to modern .NET Core, Angular, and PostgreSQL platforms.</p> <p>I started this because I\u2019ve seen many teams struggle to move away from outdated frameworks. Full rewrites are slow and risky, so BRCodeWorks focuses on fast and clean migrations instead.</p> <hr/> <p>Recent migration example: We migrated a Tour Management System from Web Forms to ASP.NET Core MVC 8.0.

We recognized the need for scene reading partners whether it was at odd hours, or just the lack of availability. We really focused on honing down on the emotional tones and speech tendencies to create a script reading partner that really understands the script and delivers a more human like experience for our users.<br/> We&#39;re currently in our initial stage of just trying to promote our app and get initial users. I would love to hear how you have gone about this problem! And would love to receive any general feedback as well. Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/jaybee-7\"> /u/jaybee-7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1orbiq7/my_team_and_i_built_a_tool_to_gap_a_need_that/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject",
