I read two other fantasy works in Spanish before this; \u00c1ngelica Gorodischer\u2019s Kalpa Imperial which was very good but had my head buzzing. </p> <p>The other one was Mem\u00f3rias de Idh\u00fan by Laura Gallegos Garcia. The central romance was problematic as I could never tell if the heroine was going for the good boy or the bad boy. She ends up having a child with both of them. </p> <p>Bodoc\u2019s books are better than both. She creates a wonderful pre-Columbian fantasy world and people\u2019s it with unforgettable characters.

But they aren&#39;t popular. Aren&#39;t mainstream like a lot of fantasy. But like... why?<br/> I get that most comics are action-focused and that&#39;s usually not that great in a book. But like... take Reacher and his penchant for solving crime and beating up bad guys, slap a mask on him and he&#39;s basically Batman. Take Harry Dresden and print a DC logo on the cover and you&#39;ve got Constantine. Put Geralt of Rivia in a little bit of spandex and a leather jacket and you&#39;ve got Blade.</p> <p>There are countless Fantasy books about people learning to use their powers and fighting corrupt regimes and shit.

I loved the first book, liked the second one, then the third one was a struggle, and I\u2019m currently stuck at the 4th with not intent to continue. What I liked about the first two books was that we were mostly told the story from the pov of a single character, Rand, whom we meet from the very start of the series. But then, more characters are introduced and while Rand remains the most central protagonist in his universe, he becomes more and more absent from the narrative. The other issue that I\u2019ve encountered in my reading was the forced romances. I don\u2019t mind protagonists having love interests, but I don\u2019t need hundreds of pages to remind me that the character is attractive enough that every princess in the kingdom has a thing for him. And it seems like this gets worse with each book. So, what I am looking for would be something like epic, he",
