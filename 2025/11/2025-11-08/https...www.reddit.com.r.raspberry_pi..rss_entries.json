I am building a smart home with the home assistant.</p> <p>I have bought (a) Raspberry Pi 5 8gb, (b) its official case with a fan, and (c) official 27W adapter.</p> <p>I have been told that I should go for a SSD instead of a micro-sd card. Can you guys suggest what all do I need for this? From what I gathered, I&#39;ll either need a m2 hat or a NVMe base card. Which of the both is better?</p> <p>Lastly which SSD to pair with your suggestion between base card and hat.</p> <p>Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/General_Molasses_995\"> /u/General_Molasses_995 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1orliyq/ssd_suggestion_for_pi_5/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1orliyq/ssd_suggestion_for_pi_5/\"",
