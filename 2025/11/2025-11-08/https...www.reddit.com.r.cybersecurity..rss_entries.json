I already have my Net+, Sec+ and the ISC2 CC certs as well. I wanted to know if there are student discounts or training access to things like Jira, Share Point, or any other relevant tools that would look good on a resume. </p> <p>Also, any tips on resume boosting certs or something? I have been practicing on AWS and building labs with Antisyphon training tutorials so I&#39;ve been contemplating working on the AWS foundations cert and I have a premium THM account so I&#39;ve also been thinking about doing the SAL1 at some point. Are these things reasonable to do or am I just wasting time and doing too much? Thank you guys so much for your honest responses and time. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lazbum91\"> /u/Lazbum91 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments",

After spending a few hours digging deeper, I discovered platforms like <a href=\"https://www.godbolt.org/\">Compiler Explorer</a> and <a href=\"http://dogbolt.org\"><strong>dogbolt.org</strong></a>, which made things clearer. I also found <a href=\"http://crackmes.one\"><strong>crackmes.one</strong></a> \u2014 a great resource for practice, tho",
