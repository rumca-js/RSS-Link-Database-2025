Mostly conversations about the portrayal of Frankenstein\u2018s monster and how it seems so different in Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s portrayal than any other cinematic portrayal before. I\u2019m seeing a lot of talk from people saying the movie is very theatrical and out of this world, but still faithful to its source material. I haven\u2019t seen the movie yet, but one aspect that I hope it retains from the source material is grief. I never see anybody talking about Mary Shelley\u2019s grief and how it inspired so much of her book, but to me Frankenstein IS a book of grief and all the different hideous forms it can take. </p> <p>I\u2019ve read Frankenstein a few times. The first time I read it I didn\u2019t really know anything about Mary Shelley or her life. My take away was that it is a book questioning the very nature of humanity. What makes us human?
