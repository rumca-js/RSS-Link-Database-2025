In my opinion, it is a flawed masterpiece and I am amazed with the Costume Designs, Set Designs, and The Special Effects. With the Special Effects, apparently, Coppola hired a visual effects teams, but when they told him what they wanted for practical effects was impossible, Coppola disagreed and fired them and replaced them with his son Roman Coppola, As a result, all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of optical or computer-generated effects, instead using con-set and in-camera methods. I kind have respect Coppola for that, given how the special effects played out</p> <p>With the performances, Gary Oldman is great as Dracula, a power monster, but a tragic figure who longs to reunite with his lost love. I know Keanu Reeves get a lot of flack for his accent, and yes",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This movie completely shocked me. I went in expecting a banal and abstract movie about Paul Mescal and his daughter. Throughout most of the movie, I was struggling to understand the purpose; it felt like it was just some family vacation. As the movie progressed, I started to understand the plot and what was actually happening. </p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Calum (Paul Mescal)&#39;s clear depression and despair was so artfully captured through Sophie&#39;s childlike eyes. As an adult, she is in a haze, a blurry haze of partying, etc. but the truth of what happened still weighs on her. The implication of his suicide really hit me hard. </span></p> <p>As someone who has gone through what Sophie had gone through, I relate so hard. </p> <p><span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">My father too took his own life when I was 13. It feels exactly like that; life feels like a blurry haze sometimes, and I yearn and seek, and beg for understanding...I don&#39;t know",
