But when every day is a fight for survival \u2013 a fight to find water and bread \u2013 safety becomes a secondary element in their lives.\n\nThey have no choice \u2013 they drink contaminated water. There is no luxury of avoiding risk. Despite the sheer level of destruction from the war, there is little effort under way to clear out unexploded ordnance or manage environmental contamination.\n\nThat\u2019s not because people in the municipality do not want to do the work. It\u2019s because of a lack of equipment and heavy machinery. Local authorities struggle every day to remove rubble, clear rubbish from destroyed streets, and reopen debris-blocked roads.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s  Hani Mahmoud reports.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X : https://twitter.com/AJEn",
