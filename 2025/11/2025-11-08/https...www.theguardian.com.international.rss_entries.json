It\u2019s the Sergio Reguilon derby! It\u2019s a replay of the last Europa League final! It can\u2019t be as boring as that was!</p><p>Say what you like about Spurs, they are Ruben Amorim\u2019s bogey team (and he has a few of those). They may have won only three home games in the league in the past year, two of them against promoted teams, but the other one was against Amorim\u2019s United (1-0). They have also left Amorim empty-handed in the League Cup (4-3) and that Europa final (another 1-0).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/nov/",
