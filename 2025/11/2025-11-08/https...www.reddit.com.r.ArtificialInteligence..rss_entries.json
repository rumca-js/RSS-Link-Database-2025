Newsom vetoed AB 1064, which would have required AI chatbot operators to prevent systems from encouraging self-harm in minors. His reasoning was that restricting AI access could prevent kids from learning to use the technology safely. The veto came after groups like TechNet ran social media ads warning the bill would harm innovation and cause students to fall behind in school.</p> <p>The lobbying numbers are significant. California Chamber of Commerce spent $11.48 million from January to September, with Meta paying them $3.1 million of that. Meta&#39;s total lobbying spend was $4.13 million. Google hit $2.39 million. The message from these companies was clear: over-regulate and we&#39;ll take our jobs and investments to other states. That threat seems to have worked. California Atty. Gen.

However, experimental variability hinders accurate identification of mechanisms of action (MoA) and compound targets. Existing methods commonly fail to generalize to novel compounds, limiting their utility in exploring uncharted chemical space. To address this, we present a confounder-aware foundation model integrating a causal mechanism within a latent diffusion model, enabling the generation of balanced synthetic datasets for robust biological effect estimation. Trained on over 13 million Cell Painting images and 107 thousand compounds, our model learns robust cellular phenotype representations, mitigating confounder impact. We achieve state-of-the-art MoA and target prediction for both seen (0.66 and 0.65 ROC-A",

You could have easier access to remote doctor visits and get health advice right from your phone or home device.
