I want to speak from a quieter place. Not about functionality or market fit, but about impact.</p> <p>I came to ChatGPT during a time of immense personal grief. In those early conversations, I wasn\u2019t looking for productivity tools or language models. I was trying to stay alive.

You\u2019ve advertised that GPT\u20114o supports a context window of up to 128K tokens\u2014and I upgraded to Pro specifically to take advantage of that. I assumed that meant I could have a full-day conversation with the model without losing early parts of the session. But in practice, that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening. </p> <p>My conversations in the app consistently lose information after about 20\u201325 message pairs, and earlier content is silently dropped. I\u2019ve confirmed this isn\u2019t a hallucination: I\u2019ve run real tests where earlier insights, reflections, and action plans vanish unless they\u2019re explicitly re-fed or stored in memory. This defeats the purpose of a large context window. I understand performance and server-side tradeoffs are real\u2014but please be transpa",
