Activated my virtual environment using source venv/bin/activate. 2. Created a new Scrapy project with scrapy startproject ebook_scraper.</p> <p>After that, I opened VS Code, but the Explorer doesn\u2019t show any files or folders for the project. I checked in Terminal, and the folder actually exists, but VS Code just doesn\u2019t display it.</p> <p>I feel like I\u2019m missing something really basic here. Has anyone run into this and knows how to fix it? Any guidance would be super appreciated! \ud83d\ude4f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fit-Anywhere-5031\"> /u/Fit-Anywhere-5031 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1os2nfe/cant_see_scrapy_project_in_vs_code_explorer_need/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1os2nfe/cant_see",
