Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should buy instead? Or is there a workaround for the quest 3 that I could use to get it to work via cable?

I even had a pair of prescription lenses made for them which was excellent, but the rest of the cons just made the headset cumbersome to setup and use. </p> <p>I especially enjoyed using it for room-scale content and workout content, like intensive beat saber runs, but the tether and picture quality kills it.

I&#39;ll explain the situation: For work reasons I spend 3 evenings a week in hotels and I love spending my 2/3 free hours in the evening playing video games (various genres). For a few months now I&#39;ve been somewhat crazily lugging around a giant bag containing a 32 inch monitor + keyboard and accessories, which I have to assemble on Mondays every week and dismantle on Thursday evenings. As you can understand, it&#39;s not the best, such as practicality, bulk, difficulty in transport, boredom in assembly/disassembly, etc. I&#39;m evaluating a compact alternative and I&#39;m undecided between a VR headset (Mezza 3) or XR glasses (Viture Luma pro). Bear in mind that I&#39;m not particularly interested in VR games, but I&#39;m mostly interested in playing my Steam and Gamepass titles, that I have a powerful gaming laptop and that I will alway",

I bought virtual desktop but the latency is insane cause I don\u2019t have WiFi 6 router. I want to purchase one but the problem is my main router is in my brothers room. What do I do to connect my WiFi 6 router to my main router, a very long Ethernet cord is not an option. Some help would be great thankyou!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/sugarfreejellly\"> /u/sugarfreejellly </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1orevx3/please_help_virtual_desktop_pcvr/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1orevx3/please_help_virtual_desktop_pcvr/\">[comments]</a></span>",
