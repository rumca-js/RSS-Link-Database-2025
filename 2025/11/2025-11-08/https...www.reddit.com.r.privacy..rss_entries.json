I\u2019ve been using a subdomain with slmail.me. At first, emails arrived without problems, including verification codes for logging in.</p> <p>After a few months, though, some services\u2014like Spotify or Nike, stopped sending emails because my domain was getting filtered or marked as spam. This caused real problems: today, for example, I almost lost my Nike account because I couldn\u2019t receive any emails. After insisting with support, I managed to have them change my email to a Proton account I created (generic two letters + numbers), which now works.</p> <p>The downside is that I lose the full benefits of SimpleLogin aliases.
