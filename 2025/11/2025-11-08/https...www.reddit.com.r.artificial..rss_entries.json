The way I see it is we have 2 options, commit to a specific video generation platform (Sora, Veo, Kling, Seedance) or go to an aggregator that gives access to multiple.</p> <p>My main question question is what are the main differences between specific model providers and these aggregators? I&#39;ve been trying tools like SocialSight for AI video generation and the main thing with Sora is that there is no watermark. Also some of their models seem to have fewer restrictions like Seedance.</p> <p>Not 100% sure what the best route is, but having multiple AI video generator models does seem more appealing.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sweet-Ad7440\"> /u/Sweet-Ad7440 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1orqdy5/what_are_the_best",
