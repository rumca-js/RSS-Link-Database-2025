Well first of no matter the age, the quality of a game always depends of it&#39;s intend of design <em>(level structure story ect)</em> and no matter how much anyone points out on how the game has aged it would mostly not hold the quality back by that much of X game.</p> <p>Second older games usually are never outclassed by other games due having a specific flavor to them. <em>(example)</em> Goldeneye. Does the game need quality of life improvements? Sure 60fps would be nice but regardless of age GE like Doom is still a frantic shooter and therefore GE fills a niche and will not be outclassed by later FPS games <em>(PE is beter but GE has a minimalistic appeal to it).</em></p> <p>I am of course for quality of life improvements like beter frame-rate and controls sure i never would argue against that, ",

For example:</p> <ul> <li><strong>My friend (remote):</strong> Controls the D-pad/movement.</li> <li><strong>Me (host):</strong> Controls the action buttons (A, B, jump, shoot, etc.).</li> </ul> <p>We want the game to see our two separate gamepads as one single input for Player 1.</p> <h1>Our Current Setup &amp; Problem</h1> <p>We are using <strong>Retrobat</strong> as our frontend for all our emulation. For the remote connection, we&#39;re using <strong>Parsec</strong>.</p> <p>The good news is that the Parsec connection is perfect.
