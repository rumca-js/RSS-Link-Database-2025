New modeling suggests that slow leakage of elements from Earth\u2019s core into the mantle prevented the planet from developing strong chemical layers after its primordial magma-ocean era.",

Many of these locations release pollutants that may affect nearby communities, yet mid-supply-chain sites have rarely been studied.
