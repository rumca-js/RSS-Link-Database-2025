I have a custom login system for both library members and librarians that works just fine. However, I used Django&#39;s logout package &#39;auth_views.LogoutView&#39; to create the logout system for library members in the <a href=\"http://urls.py\">urls.py</a> file (the one inside app not the backend). I have also researched whether I can use a built-in package to log out users who have their own custom login system. The internet said it was fine. However, when I run my program, I keep getting a 405 error. Fyi, there is not file disrupting this logout system as I have not built a custom logout system.
