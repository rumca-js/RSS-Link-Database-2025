It works fine for 2/3 shots then it stutters on the next; I also noticed very noticeable stutters after each kill.</p> <p>I\u2019ve pretty much tried everything I can think of- tweaking in game settings, different proton compatibility layers, launch commands, resolution settings in both desktop and gaming mode etc.</p> <p>Has anyone ran into a similar issue or is this just common with older cods? I know they are quite dated and weren\u2019t made with modern technology/mouse and keyboard in mind but I find it odd that I\u2019ve only faces this issue with this game when I\u2019ve played plenty off older (10+yo) games.</p> <p>Any advice is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m new to Linux. I used the CachyOS distro for a short time and didn&#39;t encounter any problems with Geometry Dash on it. However, on Zorin OS, I&#39;m experiencing significant lag when playing the game.<br/> For context, I&#39;m using an RTX 3080 GPU, 32 GB of RAM, and an Intel 13th generation processor; a 240 Hz monitor unlocked to 360 FPS in-game.<br/> I am using the Nvidia 580.95.05 driver.</p> <p>I installed Geometry Dash via Steam and ran it with GE-Proton 10.25, Proton Experimental, and Proton Hotfix, but I always encounter the same issues.<br/> I haven&#39;t been able to identify the cause of this very significant lag (the game seems to be running at 30-45 FPS instead of 360, even though it detects that it is running at 360 FPS).</p> <p>Can you give me some possible solutions that I could try? Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Seirazula\"> /u/S",

I power off and unplug it, safely press the power button without electricity and rebooted it and then, like a miracle, everything was just fine \u2026 What we are learning from this story?

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>GUYS!!! (Sorry for caps) I had this issue on Arch that when I tried to install/update proton-cachyos from AUR, it took ages (about 40 mins) to compile (with 100% cpu usage). On the other hand, manually downloading the package from CachyOS repo and installing it was ineffective as I never knew if I had the newest version. At some point I got so annoyed with this that I decided to create a solution\u2026 and here it is!!! The package adds <code>proton-update</code> to PATH which automatically installs the newest version of proton-cachyos without any annoying compiling when run. REMEMBER TO RUN IT WITH SUDO Install it with <code>paru -S proton-cachyos-updater</code> or <code>yay -S proton-cachyos-updater</code> or any other way.</p> <p>There is one question tho\u2026 Will u use it?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/poll/1p1p4s3\">View Poll</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Royal_Vermicelli8904\"> /u/Royal",

I was going to just get a Vive as I found some good deals and it&#39;s verified to work with SteamVR on Linux (I know it&#39;s outdated and low res, not a dealbreaker for me). </p> <p>However, the Vive Cosmos actually looks like a reasonably attractive product as well, and I can find it cheaper in some cases than the first gen Vive. However, I&#39;ve found basically zero mentions of it on any Linux VR guides or resources. I know that probably means the compatibility isn&#39;t there, but usually I can at least expect to see a note explicitly stating something <em>doesn&#39;t</em> work. Has anyone here gotten it working/tried to do so?
