Then it got patched and I ran into other bugs later on. Then I put it on a shelf for years and when I picked it back up OSes and drivers had advanced to the point entirely new bugs came to light. Then I tried again years later with some sort of community patch and I could advance a little more, but then some audio problem came up that crashed the game always at the same spot. </p> <p>Farthest I ever got was after the first (?) missile turret section, where you&#39;re firing at ships/vehicles and dudes across a chasm between two buildings. You&#39;re supposed to enter some corridor or conduit to get to the other side of the chasm, if memory serves, and that&#39;s where the audio crash got me.<",

It was a regular 8-bit Famicom-style console that I got for my birthday. Back then, I didn&#39;t even know the original names of the games and just played whatever was on the cartridge with a hundred games, even though there were way fewer than that because half of them were repeats. I remember sitting for hours over the cartridges, trying to figure out why some games just wouldn&#39;t start and why the console only worked if I blew into the connector. And the strangest thing is that it really helped. Sometimes I think that it was this console that made me such a fan of video games. Now I have access to many modern systems, but those simple evenings in front of the TV remain special. It&#39;s interesting to remember where you started. What was your first console, and do you still have it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",
