As well as the literature teacher just being completely disinterested in the subject or interested herself but unable to make us interested and thus being boring. </p> <p>This caused me to despise reading for a very long time. There was a moment where I only read comics and just almost physically couldn&#39;t read any of the classic literature. </p> <p>It took a few very specific and quite modernly written books to get me back into reading and for me to finally understand the wonders of this medium. </p> <p>Did something like this ever happen to you? </p> </div><!--",

Thomas Paine is one of the founding fathers of the United States and his writings were entirely about the political circumstances during the birth of the nation and the bright optimism that the release from monarchy brought about in the minds of Americans and European Republicans.</p> <p>These are remarkably enjoyable to read. As a participant in many Reddit debates it is a joy to see Paine dunk on the Imperial British government, and the American Tories who apathetically hoped for a British victory in Common Sense.</p> <p>Paine is very verbose by today&#39;s standards. He doesn&#39;t always seem to be able to arrive at his point as soon as I would like, but rather carves away at it like a sculptor at a great block of stone. He makes religious appeals, cites historical events, and rather than demonizing his opposition he mocks them. His logic is informal but endearing. He quotes his opposition then spins their state",

I couldn&#39;t bring myself to be intreasted in the story or characters and not a fan of multi pov especially when one pov is weaker than other because i always end up skipping or skimming through it just to get to the other character&#39;s pov</p> <p>I truly enjoyed the the will of the Many and just realised recently by accident that the 2nd book in the series just got released</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/casp",

I like to read in the dark in bed so &quot;dark mode&quot; (that way my dog will go to sleep!) on my ereader and I feel like book lights always end up too bright. It&#39;s also so much easier in the tub, another place I like to read. Has anyone gone back to physical books after being an ereader user for a while? How has it gone for you? Any tips on adding some convenience for physical book reading to replace the features you missed? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/booksontrails\"> /u/booksontrails </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1p1rit0/physical_books/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1p1rit0/physical_books/\">[comments]</a></span>",
