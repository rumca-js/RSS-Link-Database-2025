He&#39;s currently reading All Things Shining by Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Dorrance Kelly and is really enjoying it. He likes philosophy and science fiction a lot, especially when they merge like in The Sparrow. He also likes mythology and fantasy, but not in a ACOTAR way, more a Circe way.

I\u2019m trying to get back into reading but it\u2019s hard to make it a habit even when I\u2019m invested in the story. So recommend me the books you couldn\u2019t stop reading! As long as it\u2019s not super corny or cliche-y. My past favorites include dune, chaos walking, dragonflight, their eyes were watching god, and hamlet (even though it\u2019s a play). I don\u2019t really like wartime books, but historical is okay. Also please nothing with gratuitous violence against women or children! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/iovoko\"> /u/iovoko </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p1u10b/suggest_me_a_book_i_wont_be_able_to_put_down/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p1u10b/suggest_me_a_book_i",
