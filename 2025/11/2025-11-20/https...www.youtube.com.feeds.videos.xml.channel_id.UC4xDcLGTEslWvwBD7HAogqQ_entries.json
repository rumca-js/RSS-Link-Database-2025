        "description": "Kangchenjunga, the world\u2019s third-highest mountain, is also one of its deadliest. Towering at 8,586 meters, this Himalayan giant is shrouded in avalanches, brutal weather, and treacherous terrain. With one of the highest fatality rates among the 8,000-meter peaks, many climbers who attempt its summit never return.\n\n#Kangchenjunga #DeadliestMountains #DeathZone #ExtremeClimbing #SurvivalStory #YouTubeShorts #MustWatch #MountainDisasters",

        "description": "The final stretch of Mount Everest, from Camp 4 to the summit, is known as the \"Death Zone\" for a reason. These are the brutal realities climbers face above 8,000 meters: oxygen starved air, unpredictable weather, sheer drops, and the haunting presence of those who never made it back. This last leg is considered one of the most dangerous journeys on Earth, and what it takes to survive the ultimate ascent.",
