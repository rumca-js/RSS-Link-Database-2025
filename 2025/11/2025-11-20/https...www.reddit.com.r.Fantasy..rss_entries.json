It mocks and deconstructs superhero tropes taking them to a dark conclusion. The author of The Boys comics isn&#39;t a fan of conventional superhero stories. It&#39;s also extremely dark and violent.</p> <p>Based on a comic series, Invincible is a superhero show.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Last month I picked up a random fantasy paperback from the library because I liked the dragon on the cover and needed a distraction. I expected comfort food reading, some quests and banter. Instead I got this strangely intimate story about a burned out court mage who keeps casting tiny everyday spells while quietly convincing himself he is fine. Every time he patched a roof tile or cooled someone\u2019s tea instead of facing his real problems I felt my stomach drop, because it was uncomfortably close to the way I treat my own life and job. There was no chosen one, no prophecy, just a man slowly running out of ways to avoid his own grief while the magic around him started misfiring. I had to put the book down twice, not because it was bad but because it felt like being called out by a wizard. Have you ever had a fantasy novel hit you so personally that it almost felt uncanny, and which book was it</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

But when I moved on to the consensus best book of the series (<em>Wild Seed</em>), it was depressing enough to send me straight into a reading slump.
