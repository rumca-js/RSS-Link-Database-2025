At convention panels, Galante is known for using screens and decoys rather than addressing the audience himself. In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQVdR8mJrds\">NoClip documentary</a> chronicling the success of Vampire Survivors, Galante opted to have a Muppets-esque puppet resembling the game's iconic vampire mascot made so he wouldn't have to appear on camera himself.

Today, the RPG changes from \"D+D-like\" to simply \"D+D,\" as Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked, in partnership with Wizards of the Coast, launches on PS5, PC, and VR platforms.</p><p>Battlemarked lets up to four players join together in one of two campaigns set in the Forgotten Realms, with each player choosing between six classes: Bard, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, and Sorcerer. Persistent character progression will allow players to level up and set ability points as they see fit, and those characters will not reset once the campaign has ended, so players can choose them as much as they like.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEU74DKkvDA\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\">          <iframe src=\"https://ww",

This data runs January 5, 2025 through November 1, 2025. Of note, the list ranks games by dollar sales, not unit sales.</p><p>The biggest takeaway for the new October data is that Battlefield 6 is crushing it in the US. After just a few weeks on sale, it became the No. 1 best-selling game of the year in the US. The game had the highest single-month US physical and digital full-game dollar sales total in three years. Not since 2022's Call of Duty: Warfare II was there a game that generated more full-game dollar sales in a month. </p><p>\"Battlefield 6 launched as the best-selling game in franchise history, with its October 2025 volume surpassing the lifetime sales total of the previous record holder, ",
