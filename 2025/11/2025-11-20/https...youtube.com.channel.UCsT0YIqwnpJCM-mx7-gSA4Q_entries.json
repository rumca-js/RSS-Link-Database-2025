        "description": "Kanning's talk aims to challenge how we view and approach emergency room overuse, particularly in pediatric care. Through her research and experience as a pre-med student deeply involved in public health policy and emergency medicine, she has seen firsthand how non-emergent visits to the ER create an overwhelming burden on healthcare systems. Families often rush to the ER for issues like mild fevers, colds, or minor injuries\u2014cases that could be handled by primary care or at home with the right knowledge.\n\nBut what if we inverted the way we think about these visits? Instead of seeing them as a drain on resources, we can view them as missed educational opportunities. The concept of inversion is all about flipping perspectives, and her vision is to show how shifting our approach from reactive to proactive healthcare can transform how patients and families engage with medical systems. Imagine if families had the tools and education to understand when to seek emergency care and when altern",

But this transformation is about more than machines\u2014it\u2019s about trust, ethics, equity, and access. How do we build digital tools that enhance, rather than replace, human compassion?

        "description": "Not every innovation begins with billion-dollar ideas in high-tech labs. Sometimes it starts with something as ordinary as a roll of tape - or as profound as a moment in the ICU.\n\nIn this talk, medical students from Graz share two stories - one simple, one tragic- to show that innovation isn\u2019t about the size of a problem, but the courage to act on it. That spirit led them to found MIOSIS, a space where students turn ideas into solutions that matter.\n\nBecause real innovation begins the moment someone decides, this can\u2019t stay the way it is. MIOSIS (Medical Innovations of Students in Styria) is where bold ideas to shape the future of healthcare emerge - not from textbooks, but from collaboration, curiosity and courage.\nFounded at the Medical University of Graz, MIOSIS connects students from diverse fields to share knowledge, exchange perspectives and co-create solutions that address pressing issues in medicine and care.In open, supportive environments, members are encouraged to grow, cha",

        "description": "What happens to your brain when you consume the news - and why does it sometimes leave you feeling anxious, overwhelmed or powerless?\n \nBBC journalist, presenter, and podcast host Hannah Gelbart explores the neuroscience of news consumption. She explains how scientists have discovered that distressing headlines and graphic images trigger our brain\u2019s fight-or-flight response, with events happening thousands of kilometres away sparking real fear in our minds and bodies.\n  \nBut research shows our brains are also drawn to bad news. We\u2019re wired to seek out danger, novelty and answers. That\u2019s why doomscrolling feels so addictive. Studies show we notice, remember and respond more strongly to negative news than to positive. It\u2019s a survival mechanism with unintended consequences in the digital age.\n \nAnd what can journalists learn from this?\n \nHannah talks about her experience of developing a new format for young people who may avoid traditional news but still want to be informed. \u2018What in the",

        "description": "The talk discusses why our minds often misread tomorrow. We tend to imagine a single \u201cfuture\u201d and forget that there are many possible futures. We misunderstand probabilities, mistake randomness for patterns, and fall victim to false certainty or needless panic. In moments of crisis, our coping mechanisms make us postpone critical decisions that determine our future. Hype can blind us to the difference between true hope and wishful thinking.\nDrawing on insights from critical futurism, behavioral economics, statistics, psychology, and cognitive sciences, this talk exposes how biases obscure our vision of what may lie ahead. It offers practical strategies to spot mental traps, expand our thinking, and approach the future with clearer vision, greater confidence, and a sense of agency.\n\nKey takeaway:\nWe can\u2019t predict the future\u2014but by spotting mental traps, we can think and ACT about it more wisely, creatively, and courageously.

It equips individuals to navigate relationships with respect, awareness, and kindness.\n\nThe future is now, and it\u2019s informed, inclusive, and safer for all.

In this honest and powerful TEDx talk, Kathy Houston reveals how living by society's rules and expectations can silence your truth--until one life-changing moment forces you to wake up. Her journey from conformity to authenticity as a Late- in-life Lesbian challenges all of us to examine the stories we tell, the masks we wear, and the courage it takes to finally live in alignment with who we really are. Kathy Is the Run Your Life Coach. Her motto: Don't Let Life Run You.  She identifies as Lesbian and she/her.  She specialises in increasing your mental fitness to improve health and wellness, and relationships for mature women of power in and out of the LGBTQ+ community.\nShe knows first hand how hard it can be to live fully as yourself. When she began to embrace herself and accept herself for who she really was, a weight was lifted and joy filled her life.\n\nShe ended a marriage of 35 years",
