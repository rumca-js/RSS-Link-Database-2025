        "description": "STALKER 2 has had its fair share of troubles when it was launched last year. But GSC's stellar effort at remedying the situation has made the game something that's quite distinct from its early build, with features and fixes making life in The Zone feel very different indeed. But are these additions enough? \n\nDoes the experience finally do justice to the franchise and live up to its high standards? Join us as we take a look at what's been up with a survival shooter that's earned quite the fan following over the last year, and how its latest updates have given it the potential to offer an experience that has evolved over the course of the year.",

        "description": "After much waiting yesterday, I have some terrible news. On the 27th anniversary of Half-Life, Valve's first game and a first-person shooter classic that served as the foundation for the company as we know it, Half-Life 3 was not confirmed.\n\nBut \u2013 and stay with me here \u2013 Half-Life 3 could still be happening.\n\nYou might be confused, and that's understandable given the year thus far. But Half-Life 3, the sequel that Valve never really confirmed it was working on? Half-Life 3, which had rumors galore for the better part of a decade and then faded from existence? Half-Life 3, which many developers apparently tried to create at the studio, but it got shut down every single time.",
