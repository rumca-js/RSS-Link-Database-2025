        "description": "In How to Plan Your Life, a six-hour course, Dr. Jordan Peterson explores the principles of personal development, meaningful living, and psychological transformation. He examines the interplay between order and chaos, the role of boundaries and vision-setting, and how instincts and motivations shape identity. Through psychological insights, Biblical narratives, and practical strategies, the course emphasizes personal responsibility, the pursuit of meaning, and the power of individual choices. Dr. Peterson concludes by highlighting how self-reflection, courageous action, and truthful living drive transformation and shape both personal and societal growth.\n\nBlack Friday sale (up to $200 off) now. \nSee more at http://www.petersonacademy.com and make sure to subscribe to \u202a@PetersonAcademy for more uploaded lectures!",
