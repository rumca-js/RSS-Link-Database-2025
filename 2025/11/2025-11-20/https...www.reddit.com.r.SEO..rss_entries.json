AI search (or AEO, or GEO, or whatever you want to call it) has caught my attention recently. I started wondering... why aren&#39;t books cited in AI search results?</p> <p>We know books were used in training the major LLMs, but all sources cited seem to be online content, media, journalism, or online research papers.</p> <p>The history of publishing vs. SEO is pretty interesting... tl;dr the Authors Guild sued Google for digitizing books, lost, but sucked up 8 years of time and energy in the process. Google originally wanted snippets of books to be cited in search results, but they basically gave it up. </p> <p>But now I&#39;m wondering if AI search results would be BETTER if they cited books, and if books would be more prominent/discoverable if they were. </p> <p>Just thinking out loud here. Would love your perspectives. Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",
