Maybe it&#39;ll help someone in a similar situation.</p> <p>I&#39;m obsessive with board games and can&#39;t stop myself from playing them over and over again. I have over 100 games on BGA that I&#39;m 300+ Elo. I have almost 20 games where I&#39;m 500 Elo. I am not world class in any games but I&#39;m very good when compared to people in normal board game groups.</p> <p>I have been regularly going to 3 board game meetups and I win every game I play (if it requires a decent amount of skill). I once had a stretch where I won 57 games in a row (I track my plays on BGG). I&#39;m socially awkward and anxious. I didn&#39;t realize how unfun this was making things for people. I started to realize people were avoiding me. Occasionally I&#39;d hear comments about me trying so hard to be good at every game.

I love space themed games and the concept of exploring other planets and launching probes is very appealing to me. However, some of what I&#39;ve heard from friends and others has not been positive. No one that I know owns it because from playing it with some of their other friends, they claim while the theming is really cool the gameplay is very lackluster and doesn&#39;t have a lot of replayability. I see though that is very highly rated on BGG, but maybe this is because its relatively new? Or maybe my friends just have bad taste haha. For reference, some of my favorite games are terraforming mars, dune imperium, and clank! I&#39;d also be playing at the 3 player count.

Spaces that players land determine who fights each other and what arena they fight in. Players who lose battles get punished in some way (haven\u2019t exactly figured out how I want to punish them yet).</p> <p>I want to be able to host room/server that people can join from their phone and roll each turn while I screen share the board to the TV as doing a physical board would be tough considering these tournaments tend to bring in anywhere between 15-35 people. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
