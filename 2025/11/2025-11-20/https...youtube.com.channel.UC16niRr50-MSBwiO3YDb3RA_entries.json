        "description": "Maritime authorities are reporting a growing network of Russian \"shadow\" ships sailing without a valid national flag.\n \nSome of these ships are even suspected of undersea sabotage, illicit drone launches or \"spoofing\" their location data.\n \nThat is a troubling trend, says senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI, Michelle Wiese Bockmann, who adds that if there is an accident, \"good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost\".\n \nDriven by record sanctions on Russian energy and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.\n \nSea-born energy exports continue to generate billions for Russia, as the Kremlin wages war in Ukraine. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Russia #BBCNews",

        "description": "What do kids want to know about the war in Ukraine? On this special Q&A edition of Ukrainecast, we\u2019re teaming up with Newsround (the BBC's children's news programme) to find out. To mark World Children\u2019s Day, we took a panel of BBC experts to Hammersmith Academy, a secondary school in London, to respond to questions from a live audience.\n\nVictoria Derbyshire and Vitaly Shevchenko are joined on this episode by Newsround presenter Ricky Boleto, and Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse. Why did the war start? Are there really any safe places in Ukraine? And who is working towards making peace? They answer all that, and we hear from some of those Ukrainian children who have been forced to start a new life in the UK.\n\nIf young listeners found any parts of this episode upsetting, you can find advice and support on the Newsround website: https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Ukraine #Russia #B",
