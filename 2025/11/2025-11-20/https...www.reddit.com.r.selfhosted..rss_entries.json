The Pis run some services bare metal like PiHole, Plex, Wireguard VPN server, Dokku to host some Ruby on Rails applications I&#39;ve built and exposed to the internet via cloudflare tunnels, etc. (I&#39;m very much inspired by the folks in this sub - I&#39;d like to learn more and eventually build a beefy server that can instead run virtualized versioned of these services and eventually build my own rack).</p> <p>I&#39;ve been thinking about security cameras for my house for a while now but we just recently had our second child a few weeks ago and haven&#39;t had much time to read up on it or try to figure it out on my own.

It uses curl to read from <code>/var/run/docker.sock</code>, has no timers and keeps a constant read on the socket.
