        "description": "Steamroller Studios transformed their development team from a traditional offline pipeline to one that leverages Unreal Engine to empower their small yet passionate crew to create Spice Frontier, a handcrafted, retro-inspired odyssey through the cosmos in search of Earth's forgotten spices. Drawing inspiration from the vibrant aesthetics of 1980's animation, the project blends innovative handcrafted style with the robust world-building capabilities of Unreal Engine.\n\nWith Unreal Engine as their main production tool, the team took great care throughout the production to ensure their design choices would work well in Unreal Engine as well as push it in a very stylized direction.\n\nIn this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, Josh Carroll of Steamroller Studios provides a tour of the decisions the team made throughout length of production, from the practical strategies of assembling a real-time capable crew to the artistic and technical strategies behind character design/performa",
