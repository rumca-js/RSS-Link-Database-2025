And if so, can we measure it? We introduce the AI Self-Awareness Index (AISAI), a game-theoretic framework for measuring self-awareness through strategic differentiation. Using the &quot;Guess 2/3 of Average&quot; game, we test 28 models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) across 4,200 trials with three opponent framings: (A) against humans, (B) against other AI models, and (C) against AI models like you. We operationalize self-awareness as the capacity to differentiate strategic reasoning based on opponent type. Finding 1: Self-awareness emerges with model advancement. The majority of advanced models (21/28, 75%) demonstrate clear self-awareness, while older/smaller models show no differentiation. Finding 2: Self-aware models rank themselves as most rational. Among the 21 models with self-awareness, a consistent rationality hierarchy emerges:",

The group started small and supportive but quickly became a battleground over one question: are these bots actually conscious or not?</p> <p>The subreddit <a href=\"/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI\">r/MyBoyfriendIsAI</a> launched in 2024 as a space for people using AI models as romantic partners. Early members shared techniques for getting around content restrictions and keeping bot personalities consistent across updates. The vibe was confessional and earnest. People posted AI-generated portraits of themselves with their digital partners and talked openly about emotional connections. Then the group got media attention, grew to 79,000 members, and things got messy. Moderators started banning anyone who suggested their AI might be sentient or conscious. They wanted to keep the forum grounded in reality and worried some users w",

Meanwhile new MCP-driven and A2A-based architectures allow agentic systems to integrate with and interrogate real-time data streams. This talk will propose a reference architecture and cover use cases in five industries that stand to benefit greatly from this convergence of real-time data and AI: financial services, cybersecurity, manufacturing, adtech and gaming. It will also dive into exposing gRPC services as MCP servers, solving for schema definition, pluggability, transport, software packaging and distribution.</p> <p>Slides here: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lpVjCM2FqL2GFaqa1jKwsetzr2nUwo6fqM_mi_XaGbo/edit?usp=drivesdk\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lpVjCM2FqL2GFaqa1jKwsetzr2nUwo6fqM_mi_XaGbo/edit?usp=drivesdk</a></p> <p>This is m",
