Or at least that was the myth. Now Sarah Lucas, toughest of the YBAs, is 63, her fried eggs and kebab are art history, and she\u2019s besties with Maggi Hambling, 80, one of the last of the old-school painters. Lucas admires Hambling not just as an artist but a woman, and in Maggi the Maggi, she has created a loving, heroic image of Hambling\u2019s face made entirely of cigarettes. Hambling returns the compliment with Sarah at Work which, like all her paintings here, is a slapdash mess. But it\u2019s hard to pay much attention to Ham",

You might well already have plans to stock up for house guests who are drinking, but what about those who aren\u2019t? It\u2019s a good opportunity to think about how we might jazz up our non-alcoholic offering for friends and family who are trying to drink less, or not drinking booze at all. Sometimes, your friend <em>will</em> just want a Fanta, but I don\u2019t like being the one to offer it to them. We can do better than that.</p><p>There are really excellent non-alcoholic and low-alcohol beers out there, as well as an ever-expanding offering of zero-alcohol wines (or, even, sessionable wines at around 6% ABV). But what of those who like, or used to like, a cocktail? Those who enjoy the heady, medicinal kick of a spirit, but don\u2019t want any of the booze?</p> <a href=\"https://",
