        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe newly revamped Steam Machine has been the talk of the industry since its reveal last week. Unfortunately we don't know the price just yet, but Linus Sebastian over at Tech Tips doesn't think it'll be cheap. Sebastian recalled a conversation in which Valve acknowledged it won't be sold at a 'console price,' i.e., around $500. We here at IGN think it'll sell for\u2014on the low end\u2014$700-800. In other news, Battlefield 6 had a strong debut month, coming in at number one in game sales. Its closest competitor, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, just dropped this month, so it remains to be seem who wins the holidays. And finally, Silent Hill 2 Remake is now available for Xbox Series X after being shadow dropped with a nice 50% discount.\n\n#SteamMachine #Gaming #IGN",
