Even rumors you heard from others. Things such as hacking, stalking, catfishing, etc. that caused you to question your safety. Go into as much detail as you can or want to. Not sure how often this sub is used anymore, but I would greatly appreciate stories and/or input on such things.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LeAnneWest0044\"> /u/LeAnneWest0044 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oldinternet/comments/1p1s4li/bad_experiences/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oldinternet/comments/1p1s4li/bad_experiences/\">[comments]</a></span>",
