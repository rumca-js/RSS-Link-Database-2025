The main thing that sets it apart is the sync system - you can share tracking with your partner in real-time without creating accounts or signing up for anything.</p> <p><strong>Why I built it:</strong> I was constantly texting my wife &quot;when did you last feed her?&quot; and &quot;which side?&quot; We tried a few apps but they either wanted us to create accounts, had annoying paywalls, or made sharing data way too complicated. I wanted something that just worked, especially at 3 AM when your brain isn&#39;t functioning.</p> <p><strong>Key features:</strong></p> <p><strong>Multi-device sync without accounts</strong> - You generate a sync key, share it with your partner, and boom - you&#39;re both tracking ",
