        "description": "After UNANIMOUSLY passing the House, the Mental Health in Aviation Act has just DROPPED IN THE SENATE! I am so incredibly proud of our team at the Pilot Mental Health Campaign for the grassroots activism that is making real change. \n\nThis bill was introduced by Senators John Hoeven (R-ND) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and has 8 additional cosponsors evenly split on each side of the aisle. \n\nThere are some improvements in the Senate bill from the House version: \n-Increases funding from $13.74 million to $15 million for recruiting aeromedical examiners, providing additional mental health training, and clearing the backlog of special issuance requests.\n-Sets stricter reporting timelines for the FAA Administrator to report to Congress on implementation of ARC recommendations and other mental health policy improvements.\n-Clarifies and specifies that the public information campaign must be comprehensive and seek to end the stigma regarding mental health and mental health treatment in aviation.",
