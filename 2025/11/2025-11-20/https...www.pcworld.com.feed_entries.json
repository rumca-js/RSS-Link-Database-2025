Thanks to them, once ponderous boot times now border on instantaneous, programs and games are far more responsive, and the frustratingly long waits to load large files are largely a thing of a past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So\u2026 if you\u2019re not yet using an SSD, what are you waiting for? If you already have an older SSD, you might consider upgrading it for the even headier performance offered by cutting-edge PCIe 4.0 and 5.0 designs. If your PC sports those technologies, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, a premium drive may not deliver any more real-world performance than a bargain drive.
