I&#39;ve never read anything with prose like that and it&#39;s made it hard to read anything else - I read The Long Walk and the straightforwardness of it was just so jarring and boring in comparison. I enjoyed TLW! But I&#39;d really like to read something else <em>that</em> beautifully written. A Clockwork Orange is the first thing to come close because of the excitement of decoding what Alex&#39;s slang meant, and the worldbuilding and imagery was really beautiful. I&#39;m aware that both books deal with darker topics but I&#39;m not specifically looking for that, it&#39;s more about the craft. If I look up &#39;books like Lolita/A Clockwork Orange&#39; I only get books with the same subject matter, which isn&#39;t really the pull for me.

I say this because I find it odd that I have the grammar of an elementary or middle schooler. When it comes to subjects like chemistry, biology, cooking, math, etc. I excel at them. But other subjects like English and reading I&#39;m &quot;meh&quot; at. I want a book that I can handle. For example I love the Percy Jackson series, Harry Potter (couldn&#39;t finish the last one because the romance got too annoying for me), Zombie Season, and the Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s series. My mom suggested challenging myself with something like Stephen King (whom I don&#39;t like because I heard there&#39;s a part in his &#39;IT&#39; novel that has..... a questionable part and I was like &quot;ew no&quot;. I also tend to switch from hobbies really fast and the smallest thing can either get me engaged or completely ruin the fun for me. Does anyone have any suggestions? Also, I&#39;m sorry",

However, overall I am looking for recommendations for books (prefer series, if possible) that have the same allure and mystery from Wednesday (Netflix). Something with mystery, murder, and relationships, whether platonic or romantic, that are strengthened through the chaos. Plot lines you truly don\u2019t see coming are also desired.
