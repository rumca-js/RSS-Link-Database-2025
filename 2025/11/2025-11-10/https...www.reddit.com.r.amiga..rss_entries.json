It\u2019s where Sierra\u2019s storytelling magic truly came alive \u2014 a mix of fairy-tale wonder, eerie mystery, and emotional heart that still feels timeless. Rosella\u2019s journey to save her father isn\u2019t just another quest; it\u2019s a glimpse into an era when every pixel felt alive and every mistake meant a new story to tell. Reliving it now is like opening a dusty storybook that somehow still knows your name. Come join me as we step back into 1988 and rediscover the beauty, danger, and charm of Daventry all over again.</p> <p>\u201cBefore Lara Croft, there was Princess Rosella \u2014 and she\u2019s tougher than you remember.\u201d</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Westraat1\"> /u/Westraat1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://youtube.com/live/CNxLOChitb8?feature=share\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a",
