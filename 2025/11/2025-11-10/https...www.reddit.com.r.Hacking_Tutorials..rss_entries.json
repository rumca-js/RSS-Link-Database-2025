I want to recover a previous tik tok account of mine, I don&#39;t remember the password and I was stupid and used a fake email for it. I want to get back into the account because it&#39;s set on private and I wanted to grab media from it. Is there any sort of way to at least see the account unprivated. I&#39;ve read ways using json and other things but I&#39;m unsure and wanted someone to point me in the correct direction.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PrettyCherub\"> /u/PrettyCherub </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ot0q87/tik_tok_account/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1ot0q87/tik_tok_account/\">[comments]</a></span>",
