Sidiki Ch\u00e9rif and Prosper Peter have shown that it should have been the only choice.</p><p>The season started with a win for Angers, but it was a win that brought more fear than hope. Esteban Lepaul scored the only goal of the game as they<em> </em>beat Paris FC. The Frenchman had been a revelation in the second half of last season, as his nine goals ensured safety for Ligue 1\u2019s second lowest scorers. But Rennes were circling and he was gone by the end of August.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/10/angers-money-sign-strikers-youth-players-sidiki-cherif-goals-prosper-peter-ligue-1\"",

But there is a simple reason why some people enjoy those sensations</p><p>The first thing to understand about eating spicy food is that it really isn\u2019t a matter of taste. Capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum plants that are a key ingredient in anything you\u2019d think of as \u201cspicy\u201d, evolved as an irritant to stop mammals from chewing and destroying plant seeds. It acts on the nervous system directly through receptors in the tongue, throat and skin \u2013 no taste buds required \u2013 and, in theory, tells our bodies that the thing we\u2019ve just ingested is something to get rid of as soon as possible. The obvious question, then, is: why do some of us like the sensation so much?</p><p>To start to understand that, it\u2019s helpful to know a bit more about what\u2019s going on in the body. \u201cThink of an engineering brief where we have to detect irritants in a system and clear t",
