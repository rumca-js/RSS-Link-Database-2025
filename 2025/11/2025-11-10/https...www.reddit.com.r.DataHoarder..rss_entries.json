Honestly, not every tool can handle files that are 5+ hours. Some browser extensions would just crash, and a few online converters wouldn\u2019t give me decent audio quality.</p> <p>After testing a few, I ended up using <a href=\"http://Covmp3.com\"><strong>Covmp3.com</strong></a> . It handled videos up to 10 hours for me (apparently it can do up to 14 hours). Super simple no installs, no weird commands, just works in the browser. MP3 and MP4 both worked great, and the quality stayed solid the whole way through. </p> <p>On top of that, it also supports other platforms like <strong>Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok</strong> I tried a few videos from these, and it worked smoothly. Compared to stuff like yt-dlp, this was way easier for quick long-video conversions..</p> <p>Overall, it was a nice reminder that not all YouTube-to-MP3/MP4 tool",
