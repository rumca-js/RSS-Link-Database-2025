I am kind of obsessed with Fred Saberhagen&#39;s books of swords, and I was thinking how cool would it be to run this as a role playing game? And, if I did so, how cool would it be to have tokens made like the emblems in the hilts of his swords? And then I could hand those to the player who had that sword at the time. </p> <p>How can I make these, make them cool, and not have them be too expensive. I have no idea what they could be made out of. I saw some custom metal sites, but those were all $22 each for singles and I&#39;d need 12. Ouch. I was thinking I could get them 3d printed out of plastic of some kind but I don&#39;t know the first thing about getting that done.</p> <p>Have you made any kind of fantasy tokens for a role playing game, a book, or just for fun to put on your shelf? Do you know of a website who does this kind of thing on the cheap and won&#39;t rip me off?",

I do not think I have aphantasia before someone inevitably comments that, I daydream and visualize quite often (sometimes with intentional effort, sometimes not). I struggle with connecting/getting attached to the characters or storylines of pretty much any book I\u2019ve read within the past 5-6 years because it honestly feels like a chore to pick up a book and force myself to pay attention/imagine anything. Nothing really \u201cflows\u201d or \u201ccomes naturally\u201d for me whilst reading.

This is a story of Daedalus, who has died, recounting his tribulations in the underworld as he tries to reunite with Icarus, and reminiscing on the decisions he made in life that lead Icarus&#39; death, mostly involving the construction of the labyrinth. I thought this novella was very good, structurally interesting, and a nice way to explore a couple of themes. My only slight dissatisfaction would be with the length- but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a flaw in the execution, as I often find myself equally dissatisfied for that reason with other novellas people love, like <strong>Empress of Salt and Fortune</strong> or <strong>Penric&#39;s Demon</strong>. </p> <p>The novella is narrated by Daedalus, to Icarus.

Is there anyone who happens to have a copy of &quot;Magician: Master&quot; who could help me fill in what&#39;s missing on page 319 and 320 from the original story?

The only details I remember are the main character is a male, he goes on some kind of quest and one of his traveling companions is a great swordsman, a foreigner, I keep thinking the name was Sala or something similar. I think at some point he stopped traveling with the MC, and came back towards the end as almost an antagonist. The only other character I remember was one of the villains was also some kind of legendary swordsman, and I think the series ended with him and Sala dueling. </p> <p>I know it isn&#39;t much to go on, and I probably won&#39;t get much, but if it sounds familiar, I&#39;d appreciate any help you can give.
