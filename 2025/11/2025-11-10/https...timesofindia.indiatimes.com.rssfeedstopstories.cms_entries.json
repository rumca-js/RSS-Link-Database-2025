        "description": "What many overlook is that exercise does more than burn calories, says Dr. London - it fortifies your heart, muscles and bones, and lowers the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart attacks and diabetes. Consistent physical activity makes your body more efficient at using oxygen, tampers down inflammation, and revs up metabolism, all of which help slow aging. It also gives your brain a boost, sharpening memory and focus, and helping prevent cognitive decline",

New research reveals these microscopic particles linger in dust and become airborne, exacerbating respiratory issues for allergy and asthma sufferers. Effective pest control dramatically reduces these harmful substances, proving that eliminating cockroaches directly improves your home's air.",
