After the splash screen, a small black window appears, and if I leave it for about half an hour, the game finally starts. The problem is that every loading screen takes around half an hour. Other than that, once I\u2019m in-game, everything runs perfectly until the next loading screen.</p> <p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p> <p>I\u2019m on Ubuntu x11 with the NVIDIA 580 driver and using Steam Proton, testing different versions including Proton SE.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Storrox\"> /u/Storrox </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1otild5/ac_odyssey_has_around_30_minutes_of_loading/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1otild5/ac_odyssey_has_around_30_minutes_of_loa",

Have had (do have) numerous Linux systems at home. But gaming was always tricky. I do a LOT of gaming and that time is often playing games with one or more of my children (range of ages from 12 to 30 lol). Trying to get x y or z game working used to be a right pain in the wotsit.</p> <p>I had used Wine many years ago (even back in 2004 when Gentoo was king :D) but in recent years, the push from Gabe Newell to get Proton running almost all steam games and the launch of the Steam Deck has pushed things to a whole new level.</p> <p>So, here I am, sat on my favourite operating system GNU/Linux (Debian 13 specifically) with Minecraft, Terraria, PEAK, GTA IV, DBD, Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and Elden Ring. Basically every game I&#39;ve tried. Working flawlessly, in fact BG3 and Elden Ring seem to be working better.</p> <p>I have no advert",
