Instead it locked me in full screen, and a very loud beep sound starting playing, windows recovery menu and a password box saying I was locked out and needed the password. The first thing I did was kill the internet source and then force a shutdown on my laptop, when I rebooted, there was nothing unusual and it started up normally</p> <p>Now I know this is probably a fake aggressive virus popup because the recovery menu can&#39;t just pop up so fast like a blue screen can. But I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m in the clear and don&#39;t have to worry that I was hacked. I killed the internet connection about 10 seconds after It happened and I signed into my email, nothing wrong</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Middle-Literature913\"> /u/Middle-Literature913 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments",
