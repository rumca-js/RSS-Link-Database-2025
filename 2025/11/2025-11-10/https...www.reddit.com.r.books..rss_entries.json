I looked the author up on Wikipedia and learned Lonesome Dove was third chronologically in a series a of four. The 2d novel published, Streets of Laredo, was conceived as a screenplay first and is last chronologically.</p> <p>Other reddit posts show that Lonesome Dove is the Juggernaut and should be read first and the other novels are of lesser stature and while they do what a novel is supposed to do its just not as good. Thankfully my library card and libby are covered by my taxes and I now only have a time cost if I want to read these these. If I really want to save time I can do Lonesome Dove and then Streets of Laredo and then circle back around too the &#39;prequels&#39;s</p> <p>----</p> <p>There are some stories that do alright chr",

It\u2019s almost like a weight lifted off my shoulders when Catherine finally died, her whole spirit always had a dark shadow over the story, just looming in the background which I think is a testament to how wonderful Steinbeck is able to write and flesh out his characters. </p> <p>I was in tears when Cal first realized he didn\u2019t want to keep being mean. He struggled so hard to walk the line of being good and winning the approval of his father, then often succumbing to his meanness then starting all over again. Steinbeck all the while showing there is a choice to be made and you can still choose to be good. Charles never understood that it seems, but Cal did. Lee was such a delight of a character and really tied the whole story together. I almost wish Sam Hamilton didn\u2019t die so early",

I think the average reader (by which I mean preferences for writing style/characters/plot/etc, not average skill) is most likely to think book 1 <em>Annihilation</em> is the best of the bunch, probably by a fair margin. I think that&#39;s probably also my opinion as well, book 1 was phenomenal for my tastes, but I want to expand upon my perspective as somebody who was entranced by the rest of the series as well.</p> <p><em>Absolution</em> is almost 100% a prequel. I say almost 100% because due to the perspective of Saul the lighthouse keeper that we got in book 3 <em>Acceptance</em>, about 1/3 of <em>Absolution</em> occurs after all of Saul&#39;s POV in that boo",
