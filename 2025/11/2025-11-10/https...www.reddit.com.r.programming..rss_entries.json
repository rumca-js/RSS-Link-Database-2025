I\u2019ve tried Fiverr, but there hasn\u2019t been much interest at all, and I\u2019m not sure how to promote my services on social media.</p> <p>I currently have a Discord bot project with a dashboard and some paid features. It was doing quite well for a while, and although usage has recently dropped, it still brings in a bit of income. That project happened because I was in the right place at the right time and found someone who needed exactly what I was offering.

Supports Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, Java, C++, C, Rust, and Go.</p> <p>**Codebase Dependency Graphs**: Analyzes and visualizes module dependencies across your entire project with color-coded file categories. Currently supports TypeScript/JavaScript.</p> <p>Everything runs locally - your code never leaves your machine (except optional AI labels). The dependency visualization adapts to your VS Code theme and uses high-contrast colors for better readability.</p> <p>Would love feedback from the community!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Difficult_Prize_7548\"> /u/Difficult_Prize_7548 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://github.com/DucPhamNgoc08/CodeVisualizer\">[l",
