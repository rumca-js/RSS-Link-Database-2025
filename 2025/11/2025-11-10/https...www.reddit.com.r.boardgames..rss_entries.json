It has cute artwork, excellent production and in terms of gameplay it has worker placement and tableau building. Then last year, Wondrous Creatures came out, a game with similar characteristics. Both have a good score at BGG (8.0 for Everdell and 8.1 for WC). Personally, I must say I prefer Everdell&#39;s artwork but in terms of gameplay, I want to hear your opinions. Something I keep hearing is how WC improves on Everdell and it&#39;s the better game in general because of the mechanical changes. Some even went as far as saying that it&#39;s the &quot;Everdell killer&quot;.

This year is a more strat focused year, we are primarily 3 players, Me, wife, and teen daughter who kicks our butt very regularly. I was looking at Forrest Shuffle. It feels wingspan like where its about card draw and what strat you can do with what you are given. Anyone play, have thoughts, I read somewhere there is a successor of sorts but i cant remember the name.
