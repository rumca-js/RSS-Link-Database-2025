He&#39;s recently been playing old arcade games, so I was thinking I would get him a package of games for switch. He was born in 1970 so I imagine he would like games from the 80s / early 90s the most. Im looking for a package of popular games that he probably already played in the 80s.</p> <p>Is there a game collection anyone recommends? I saw that the switch online subscription comes with some old games for $20/year. Is that the best option or is there a better collection out there? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/alexalex3x\"> /u/alexalex3x </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1otsiny/retro_game_pack_to_gift_for_switch_1/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1otsiny/retro_game_pack_to_gift_for_switch_1/\">[comments]</a></span>",

My goal is to create a gaming room like a gaming museum with every single console from 3rd generation and with the top games of each of theses consoles. So far I mostly spend my budget on consoles and controllers and i dont think i ll be building big libraries any time soon... As for the games i only have big libraries for the consoles i had as a kid, for the rest i have a random game i bought because it was cheap so i could test the consoles i bought. For starters I want to buy 3-4 games for each console MAX. I want to buy the best games but also games that aged well because not everyone have nostalgia for theses games and I want my kids or whoever plays on them other than me to have as much fun as possible.

You drove on a highway and if you sped by police, a chase would ensue. I&#39;m pretty sure there was a rear view mirror you could see them, but you know, memory! I definitely remember that you could only push on button at a time, so if space was gas and arrows were turn, you had to release one before pressing the other.
