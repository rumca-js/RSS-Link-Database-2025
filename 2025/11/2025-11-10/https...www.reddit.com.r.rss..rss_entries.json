My CEO or CTO would take these away, react on them or write opinion pieces about (on LinkedIn/Substack).</p> <p>The project is to feed them new articles from a moderate pool of websites (stuff like techcrunch or cfodive or AWS blogs) when they come out, and on specific topics (I have about 500 keywords we care about).</p> <p>The best output would be into an RSS feed that I can pull into Clay where I&#39;ll prioritise and prep excerpts, stats and stuff so that CEO/CTO have a constant drip of articles to use for posts.</p> <p>A simple Google Alert to RSS doesn&#39;t seem to work as it&#39;s not letting me input multiple keywords or even control what websites to look",
