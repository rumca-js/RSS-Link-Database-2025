Not only do they allow you to stay anonymous, but they can help safeguard your data and keep intrusive trackers at bay. Plus, they allow you to get around region blocks on streaming services and avoid ISP throttling. However, you usually have to pay for a VPN subscription and adding an extra monthly expense might not be an option. That\u2019s where a free VPN can come in handy, providing you with much needed security for no cost at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I advise that you opt for a premium VPN, such as those in our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/406870/best-vpn-services-2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best VPNs</a>, I understand that sometimes ",
