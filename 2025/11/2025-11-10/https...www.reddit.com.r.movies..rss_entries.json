He is filled with opinions on all sorts of film (meanwhile he\u2019s not always receptive to opinions about his films). He also speaks as though he is God (which he isn\u2019t).

The insanity, the anxiety, the constant events that keep piling up on top of each other, the sense of darkness of 2020 etc.</p> <p>The commentary of corporations and having the movie end on the shot of the data center is perfection. The way that the characters were all in their own world of hatred and division while at the end, it basically shows how the mega rich get what they want at the end of the day anyway.

To me, it juggles postmodern existentialism, individualist modernism, and (somewhat subversively) traditional morality in a clever way. It starts out as existential because the chameleon character starts out with no identity and has to create one based on the situation he finds himself in. (Obviously, he&#39;s a chameleon.) But, importantly, he also has an internal idea of the story he&#39;d like to tell based on his imagination, which defines his lonely fish tank existence, and seemingly inspired by cinema (he fancies himself as an actor).

I quickly realized besides the talking, joking gargoyles this felt like the most mature Disney movie I have ever seen. Some of the primary themes of the movie being institutional oppression, religious versus government power, lust, and duty. Felt like a PG-13 movie and if reworked, could\u2019ve been rated R. Frollo came off to me as one of the most nuanced and interesting villains in all of Disney.

So here it is\u2026 </p> <p>Alice and Uncas are two of the most interesting characters in cinema to me, they are each so compelling and intriguing. And the love story of Alice and Uncas is one of the most powerful, beautiful, and captivating love stories of all time. Ok I\u2019ll say it\u2026 THE most, in my personal opinion. But what is so amazing about it is, it was given barely any time and they were given barely any dialog! But they didn\u2019t even need it\u2026 The fact that they are two of the most compelling characters and one of the most haunting and captivating love stories while also being the most neglected characters and love story, is absolutely incredible! To the actors Jodhi May as Alice and Eric Schweig as Uncus, the depth and level of acting that went into accomplishing this is so great I wouldn\u2019t know where to b",

Was it possibly a reshoot because the moving of the stone &quot;door&quot; looks less than impressive...but they hadn&#39;t reshot by the time the trailer needed to be out?</p> <p>Also - and I know the trailer is pretty low quality - the trailer makes it seem like the face of the tall statue is clear the moment the stone is pulled away...but in the final version, it is more played as a reveal when the ligh",

Unfortunately, he quickly deteriorates into a horrible living death, and Miriam seeks a new companion. She soon sets her sights on Sarah (Susan Sarandon), a lovely young scientist, who quickly falls under Miriam&#39;s spell. However, Sarah doesn&#39;t warm up to the concept of vampirism easily, leading to conflict with Miriam. I really enjoyed the film it\u2019s a very weird erotic horror film, it\u2019s a vampire film but a very different take on vampires were it\u2019s not your lead vampire preying on their victim sinking their fangs into them and drinking their blood. David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve\u2019s characters slash their victims with an Egyptian pendant and then dispose their victims bodies in an incinerator. The look of the film screams 80s by the white lighting, the hairstyles. Dav",
