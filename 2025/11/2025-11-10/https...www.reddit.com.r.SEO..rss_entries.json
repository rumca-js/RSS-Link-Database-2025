On my end everything looks perfect on both on Mapsquest itself and SEO. But she sent a screenshot confirming she&#39;s still seeing a wrong description beneath the company&#39;s name when she googles it. Since she doesn&#39;t use any listing platform and I believe her business got on Mapsquest without she even knowing how, I have tried contacting them directly but didn&#39;t get a response. Today I tried to reclaim ownership of the business as they advise you to do on the website, but I found out they redirect you to Yext and you need to pay to update that info. That seemed a bit weird to me so I looked into posts about Yext here and many people complained about it. Do you guys know any other way to solve this issue? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.red",

Until now, I have built basic backlinks through free and easily available platforms such as profile submissions, image sharing, social bookmarking, and blog posts.</p> <p>Now, I am planning to take my link-building strategy to a higher level by earning backlinks from high-authority websites like The Times of India, Cambridge, Forbes, and other reputable platforms. I assume the prices would be quite high if I want to earn backlinks from such sites. While checking on AIO, I found that many high-authority sites are listed with backlink options priced max USD 100.</p> <p>My main question is how to approach or contact high-authority sites for backlinks since directly asking for link placement is not that easy.
