Transitioning from a helpdesk role into this position has been quite exciting, especially since I have a background in cybersecurity from my bachelor\u2019s degree. Having the chance to finally pursue something cybersecurity related feels like a blessing but it doesn\u2019t feel quite right yet.</p> <p>Maybe it\u2019s because the role is new at the company and I don\u2019t really have any \u201cimportant\u201d tasks right now, or maybe vulnerability management just isn\u2019t for me. We don\u2019t even have a vulnerability scanner yet. Currently, I\u2019m reading CTI alerts and matching CVEs to our company\u2019s infrastructure day by day.</p> <p>I really enjoy working in cybersecurity, but I\u2019m more of a \u201csit in the dark and get things done\u201d kind of person than someone who likes being in meetings and discussing what needs to be patched.</p> <p>What\u2019s your experience with vuln",

It&#39;s the goddamn alert fatigue.</p> <p>That constant pressure of sifting through thousands of false positives, terrified you&#39;re gonna miss the one real threat. Staring at the SIEM until your eyes bleed.</p> <p>We&#39;re so busy defending the network, we forget we&#39;re not built for 100% uptime. The job just eats away at you.</p> <p>It&#39;s a lot.</p> <p>Anyway, someone shared this site with me. It&#39;s just an anonymous place to vent. No sign-up, no bullshit. Figured someone here might need it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.secure.com/confessional\">https://www.secure.com/confessional</a></p> <p>Not a fix, but maybe it helps to just get it off your chest.
