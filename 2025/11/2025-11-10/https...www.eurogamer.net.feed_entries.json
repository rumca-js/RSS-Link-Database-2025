You see, I treated myself to a Seasalt coat that cost about five times what I'd wanted to spend. It's wonderful in the winter - like wearing a yeti hug - and yet I rarely wear it. The problem with this glorious coat is that it's not something to throw on if it's 15 degrees out with a slightly ominous grey sky, as I'd melt, so I instead opt for a lightweight rain mac. For most months of the year this coat is thrown under my bed, a slumbering king waiting to be summoned. And yet, as we edge further into November, it's still under there.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-series-xs-at-five-years-old-at-this-point-is-there-anything-else-left-to-say\">Read more</a></p>",
