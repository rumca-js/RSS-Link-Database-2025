        "description": "Mysteria Ecclesiae is the final DLC for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and offers a smaller, more personal adventure for Henry. Set in Sedletz Monastery, the DLC\u2019s story revolves around investigating the outbreak of a mysterious disease around the building, affecting various characters.\n\nUnlike previous DLCs, Mysteria Ecclesiae focuses on investigation and social interaction with minimal combat. While it introduces new characters, and a captivating story, it doesn't bring any new gameplay mechanics. The DLC also has a major drawback in how isolated it feels from the world of the base game, both in terms of the zone itself, as well as the story. \n\nDespite this, it is still a polished and enjoyable DLC for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.",

        "description": "Kirby Air RIders is quite an exciting addition to the Switch 2's ranks. It carries not only the weight of its titular characters' immense popularity in modern gaming, but must also live up to the legacy of Kirby Air Ride, the GameCube title that inspired it. \n\nBandai Namco and Nintendo seem poised for a win with this one, bringing excellent additions to its core experience that are sure to feel familiar to fans of the original game, but also fresh to newcomers looking to dip their toes in the Kirby universe. If you're thinking about picking this one up, join us and take a look at some of the most important things it has to offer when it releases later this month.",
