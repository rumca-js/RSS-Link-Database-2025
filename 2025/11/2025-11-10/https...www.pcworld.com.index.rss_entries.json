But hear me out: if you don\u2019t <em>need</em> on-the-go portability, then you can get a fantastic daily driver machine for pretty darn cheap. What you need is a teeny-tiny mini PC. Trust me on this!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Right now, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F6CSNVVH/\">Amazon is selling the Beelink SER5 mini PC for just $279</a> with this Prime-exclusive deal.</strong> But don\u2019t let that \u201cexclusivity\u201d deter you! You can still score this low price simply by <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime/\">signing up for a 30-day free trial of Prime</a>, granting access to all kinds of deals like this one\u2014and this mini PC is an excellent one that\u2019s totally worth it at this price.</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"cta_btn",
