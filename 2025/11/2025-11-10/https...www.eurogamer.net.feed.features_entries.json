        "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/ps-portal_DYaa1Nk.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Last week, Sony announced that the PS Portal - a &pound;200 device traditionally sold as 'a PS5 peripheral' rather than a standalone, game-ready device - would be getting <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/you-no-longer-need-a-ps5-to-play-astro-bot-and-other-ps5-exclusives\">its biggest update</a> since its 2023 launch. After being in beta for a year, the PS Portal can now stream games directly from PlayStation servers, meaning you can play PlayStation 5 games (or any viable game from your library or the PS Plus Premium collection) directly to the Portal. Suddenly, the machine isn't just a PS5 peripheral, it's a little juggernaut in and of itself.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/as-playstation-bosses-celebrate-ps-portal-usage-figures-i-can-finally-say-the-weird-little-ps5-peripheral-justifies-its-existence\">Read more</a></p>",

        "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/silent-hill-f-header.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>When it comes to video games, I'm what you might call a one-and-done kind of guy. With a few rare exceptions (hi FromSoftware, and only then if five years have passed since my last playthrough), I never really feel the urge for a replay, no matter how fun I had the first time around. So it probably won't come as much of a surprise to hear the idea of New Game Plus - where you're pretty much compelled to dive back in <em>straight away</em> if you don't want to lose all that vital muscle memory - has never really appealed. Why do it again, when I could be doing something <em>new</em>? But finally it's happened; my forty year no-New-Game-Plus streak has been broken - all thanks to the clever narrative machinations of the excellent <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f\">Silent Hill f</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-is-the-first-game-",

If you don't know the drill already, this is the Weekly Digest, in which we recap the highlights you might have missed over the last seven busy days on Eurogamer - now shifted to Monday morning to give you something to peruse while your brain slowly cranks back into working gear after the weekend. This time around, Chris wonders if there's any danger <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357\">GTA 6</a> might feel old hat by the time it eventually arrives following its latest delay; Ed investigates the billion dollar live-service question; Tom ponders Microsoft's rubbish new Xbox Game Pass advert; Alex revisits Lionhead's slighty forgotten classic The Movies as it turns 20, and a whole lot more. For the week's full recap, read on!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/terrible-adverts-live-service-",
