        "description": "Anno 117: Pax Romana\u00a0reviewed by Leana Hafer on PC, also available on Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nAnno 117: Pax Romana is a gorgeous antique city-builder that sucked me in for dozens of hours as I planned out my next district or simply watched the bustle along my aqueduct-accented boulevards. I think this series and I were always destined to hit it off, but we kept missing each other or meeting up at the wrong times. I really get Anno now, and I could hardly be more enthused. The fantastic, deep trade system with a side of exciting naval combat really seals the deal. I could take or leave the campaign, but I still don't think I've run out of things to do in the highly customizable endless mode. It may not quite be fit for a triumph, but it is certainly worthy of a standing ovation.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

Howard also teased a possible shadowdrop, like what Bethesda did with The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered (although several detailed leaks leading up to the drop spoiled some of the surprise). In other news, Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto spoke about his minimal involvement with the Super Mario franchise, but is hoping he'll still be around for the series' 50th anniversary in 2035. And finally, Predator: Badlands has hit the ground running, reaching a franchise high opening weekend box office, and that's considering the two Alien vs Predator spinoffs.\n\n#ElderScrolls6 #Gaming #IGN",
