        "description": "In her TEDxTufts talk, speaker Sarah Lotsoff weaves her personal experience with facts about fentanyl, drug education, harm reduction, and societal attitudes towards each in an effort to address lingering misconceptions and spread awareness about the dangers of accidental fentanyl poisoning. She shares how the sudden loss of her brother motivated her to get involved in harm reduction work on her campus, and urges her audience of college students to educate themselves on the risks associated with substance use because of fentanyl, as well as the ways they can protect themselves and their friends, should they choose to use substances. Through this talk, she hopes to dismantle the \u201cnot me\u201d mentality surrounding overdose and encourage others to carry Narcan and use fentanyl test strips in order to prevent future accidental fentanyl poisonings. \n\nSarah is a senior at Tufts, majoring in Philosophy and minoring in Italian. She is the head writer for The Institute Sketch Comedy group on campu",

It introduces the concept of Narrative Intelligence, our natural ability to understand and empathize when we see someone\u2019s full story and challenges us to apply it in real life. By asking, \u201cWhat chapter of their life am I seeing?\u201d we can transform judgement into compassion and learn to view others as evolving stories rather than finished outcomes. Ritanshi, a Class 10 student, is a vibrant spirit bursting with curiosity, and creativity. A passionate dancer and painter, she believes art is not just something you create, it\u2019s something you live. She finds beauty in movement, colours, and stories, and when she is not creating, she is lost in the pages of a book or the frames of a movie. At just 15, she brings warmth, laughter, and imagination into everything she does from school projects to baking treats that taste like joy.  She is a true extrovert with an old soul endle",

        "description": "We graduate with degrees but often lack what real life demands.\nIn this candid and humorous talk, Rohan Mathur uses the high-stakes world of Formula 1 racing as a metaphor for the journey after graduation. Just as F1 drivers must qualify through Q1, Q2, and Q3 before racing, graduates must navigate uncharted territory - from telling your boss they're wrong without getting fired, to understanding what your partner really means when they say \"I'm fine.\"\nDrawing from personal failures and hard-won lessons, Rohan shares five essential mindsets: cultivating a growth mindset, finding your purpose, avoiding comparison traps, embracing abundance, and learning timeless wisdom from the Bhagavad Gita. But most importantly, he delivers a powerful call to action: you are the driver of your own learning, and it's time to take the wheel.\nWhether you're fresh out of university or years into your career, this talk will inspire you to stop improvising and start preparing for your own Race to Q1.

        "description": "In this inspiring and forward looking talk, Vinayak Kharche explores how digital transformation is not just about adopting new technologies, it is about reimagining how we think, work, and lead.\nHe invites us to imagine a world where every decision is powered by real-time data, Humans and machines communicate seamlessly, the future is simulated before it is actually built. This vision is made possible through Digital Twins, which mirror physical assets and enable intelligent feedback loops. Drawing from his experience in the oil and gas industry, Vinayak emphasizes that data is the new oil, a strategic asset that drives smarter decisions and operational excellence.\nBut transformation is not easy.
