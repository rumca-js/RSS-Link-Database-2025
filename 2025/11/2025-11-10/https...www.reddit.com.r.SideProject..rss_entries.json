So, if you own a site you can easily use tracking tools like SiteStats or SimpleAnalytics to see how much traffic came from Reddit, but what if you&#39;re recommending sites you don&#39;t own? Eg, Reddit gives the OP the number of impressions, and everyone can see the downvotes and upvotes and comments. But for example, lets say if you were to recommend a video game and link to its Steam page, wouldn&#39;t you want to know how many people clicked through to the link?</p> <p>What it does (hasn&#39;t been built yet but here me out)</p> <ul> <li><p>It&#39;s essentially a <em>URL lengthener</em>: the full URL can be seen, but it has a short URL behind it that allows for tracking.

They fail because the founder sees things only from their viewpoint, not the user\u2019s.</p> <p>You created it to address a problem you experienced. But your users don\u2019t care about your issues; they care about their own moments of feeling stuck.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the change that made a difference for me:</p> <p>Don\u2019t sell the product. Sell the moment that makes the product needed.</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>Don\u2019t say, \u201cAI tool that generates posts.\u201d</p> <p>Say, \u201cFor when your mind goes blank and your content calendar is empty.\u201d</p> <p>That simple change turns features into understanding, and understanding connects with people faster than features ever will.</p> <p>Here are three quick rules I apply to every project:</p> <p>Find the \u201coh-shit\u201d moment\u2014when users realize they need help. </p> <p>Describe that moment better than they can.</p> <p>Then show your tool as the natural next step.</p> <p>If you do",

If you are not familiar with how these sites work, 1 SC equals $1, so you are getting $200 for just $100.</p> <p>The only condition is that you need to play through the 200 SC once before withdrawing. This is a 1x rollover requirement, meaning you must wager at least 200 SC before you can cash out.</p> <p>This is really easy to do. Just select the &quot;Plinko&quot; game, set your bet to the minimum (0.10 SC), use LOW Risk with 16 rows, choose 10 balls per play, and go through 200 plays to meet the requirement while retaining roughly 90% or more of your bonus. Most people keep around 96%. In simple terms, you can withdraw around $195 to your bank after spending $100 (about $95 profit in under 10 minutes).</p> <p>\u27a1\ufe0f <strong>The sign up link to farm this promotion is here:</strong> <a href=\"https://tracker.gemified.io/r/8gAMYu7DruEN/68cc30a42c36d1428856200f\"><strong>G",
