We extend this framework to address continual learning through the lens of cosmic acceleration, propose the emergence of information singularities analogous to black holes, and demonstrate how inference parameters create a computational multiverse.

Today&#39;s paper is titled &quot;Associative Poisoning to Generative Machine Learning&quot; by Mathias Lundteigen Mohus, Jingyue Li, and Zhirong Yang.</p> <p>This paper explores a novel data poisoning technique termed &quot;associative poisoning,&quot; which allows attackers to manipulate statistical associations between specific feature pairs in generative models without needing control over the training process. This method stands out because it selectively alters fine-grained features while preserving the overall quality of the generated data. The authors provide a mathematical formulation of the attack and empirically validate its effectiveness on state-of-the-art generative models.</p> <h3>Key Findings:</h3> <ol> <li><p><strong>Targeted Statistical Manipulation:</s",
