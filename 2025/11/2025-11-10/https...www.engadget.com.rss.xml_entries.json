At the same time, the company has also been giving a fair bit of attention to Amazon Music, adding things like Alexa+ integration and AI-powered playlists. And as of today, Amazon is rolling out a new community-focused feature called Fan Groups. As the name suggests, Fan Groups are a way for users to connect around different musical interests \u2014&nbsp;and what makes this more fun to me is that these aren\u2019t limited to Amazon-curated groups. </p><p>Once Fan Groups fully rolls out, anyone will be able to create a public group in Amazon Music based around a genre, region, time period or anything else you want to focus the group on. Right now, Fan Groups are only available in Canada during a a beta period, but they\u2019ll come to other countries (including the US) early next year. Amazon has had testers building out some Fan Groups in the meantime so that testers don\u2019t walk into a ghost",
