An edition of Panorama, broadcast a week before the 2024 US election, spliced together clips of a Trump speech made on 6 January 2021. The spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: 'We\u2019re going to walk down to the Capitol and I\u2019ll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.'
