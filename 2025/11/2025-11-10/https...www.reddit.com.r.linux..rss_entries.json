And although donations exist, they are inefficient. With open source foundations such as the Mozilla Foundation or the Python Software Foundation being offered or actually taking investments from private companies or other bodies, often with strings attached, open source is running the risk of losing its independence and ultimately its openness. So what can we do?</p> <p>Let me ask you another question: Why choose GitHub over Codeberg? Why choose Microsoft Office over OnlyOffice? W",

There have been mutliple incidents where my colleagues have missed a character here and there which led to catastrophic situations (deletion of entire application directory, system reboots). As of now what is do is use python on the command logs of my PAM tool..but that is a headache and also a reactive approach. I wish to implement a proactive approach.

This seems odd (or outdated) to me, since nvidia&#39;s drivers have a drm kernel module and the kernel module was open-sourced a while back. Is this still current? I&#39;m currently reading up on the linux graphic stack.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MrObsidy\"> /u/MrObsidy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1oszply/nvidia_libdrm_support/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/l",
