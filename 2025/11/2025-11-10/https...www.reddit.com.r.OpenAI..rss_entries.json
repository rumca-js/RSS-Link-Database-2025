The AI quietly summarizes long pages, keeps research sessions tidy, and somehow makes multitasking feel effortless. What I like most is that it doesn\u2019t feel like a chatbot bolted onto a browser \u2014 it feels built-in and intentional.</p> <p>It\u2019s strange how subtle the impact is, but it\u2019s made me more efficient without even trying.

By implementing three enhancements\u2014EMA normalization, safety coupling, and interpretive logging\u2014we reduced hallucination-adjacent behaviors by 56% and increased response stability by 68%.
