There was a point where I felt like I needed a break from how harrowing so much of her sexual trauma was from her own life before she even MET Epstein. But then I read the passage that spoke directly to the reader and reminded me that she had to relive those memories every day for the rest of her life. It told me to take a break when I needed to but to please finish the book and I made sure I did.

Maybe DOT scrubbed the files for him. Who knows anymore. It is the same pattern every time. First deny, then distract, then pretend he was for transparency all along.</p> <p>The public is sick of the games. If the files are clean, release them.
