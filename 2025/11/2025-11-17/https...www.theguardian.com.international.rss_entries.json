In 2023-24 the very same musical ran for a year on Broadway, won four Tony awards and was hailed by the critics. Fortunately a live performance of that Maria Friedman production was filmed and I would urge you to catch it when it\u2019s released in cinemas next month.</p><p>I say \u201cthe very same musical\u201d but that is not strictly accurate.

He achieved the feat as he led the Buffalo Bills (7-3) to victory over Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6-4).

The Bills benched struggling receiver Keon Coleman in a bid to spark their passing game, and each of Allen\u2019s three touchdown passes went for 25 yards or more.
