Accept the data mining. * Want to participate in modern online life? Accept that your personal info becomes part of someone\u2019s \u201cengagement strategy.\u201d It feels like opting out isn\u2019t realistic anymore unless you plan on living totally offline.

This morning I was searching for information about this disease for the first time ever via google search and perplexity (both on my iPhone), and then tonight while watching Netflix on my roommate\u2019s account I got an ad for a medication for this disease. I\u2019ve never searched the disease before, never spoken to anyone about it, it\u2019s not communicable, and it\u2019s a relatively rare disease that I\u2019ve never seen ads for before. Do we think it\u2019s purely coincidental? Probabilistic? or tracking? Because I really don\u2019t want my medical searches being used for ads and I thought I was being smart about my data privacy choices. I guess I should use duck duck go, but if I turn off search history tracking how would google keep track? is it just at the IP level? do ISPs share traffic data with advertisers? I\u2019m so confused</p> <",
