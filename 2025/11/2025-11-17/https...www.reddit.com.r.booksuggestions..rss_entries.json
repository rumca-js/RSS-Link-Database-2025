I&#39;m writing a low fantasy novel and would like to use a number of different cultural myths as it takes place in modern Canada, which is a melting pot of different cultures.</p> <p>I&#39;m relatively well-versed in Greek myths and know a little bit of Norse, but what I&#39;m really looking for is an A-Z guide that would give me a good starting point in a variety of mythologies, especially relating to Indigenous and larger immigrant populations such as East Indian, Phillipino, Chinese, and African. It&#39;s okay if it&#39;s a bit brief in its entries - the important thing to me is it covers a lot of ground as I can always look up more info online once I have a starting point.</p> <p>So far I&#39;ve checked out a number of other threads, Goodreads reviews, etc. including docwatson42&#39;s megathread and am seeing mostly Greek and Norse mythology book recs.</p> <p>Thanks for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; su",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey guys new to the group. I am looking for some recommendations on some medieval fantasy romance books. I am looking for stuff with a male main character and perspective. I struggle to read and get into books with a female lead because I am male and I have a difficult time connecting with the character and thought process. I would prefer a male author as I like the writing style more but I am open to female authors as well. I would also be open to books that are less medieval fantasy such as things with vampires, magic, or even the mafia genre. Any recommendations you guys have would be great!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/RoninMandalore\"> /u/RoninMandalore </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ozozvk/iso/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ozozvk/iso/\">[comments]</a></span>",

But then movies became much more accessible and cheaper than books (at least where I live), so I stopped considering books as an option.</p> <p>I love sci-fi, especially steampunk, cyberpunk, biopunk, or apocalyptic genres, but watching movies in those genres often disappoints me.

Any recommendations?</p> <p>I\u2019ve searched other posts and most of them recommend <em>The Hunger Games</em>, <em>The Maze Runner</em>, and <em>Divergent</em>, which don\u2019t really pique my interest, probably because of the political subplots.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"http",
