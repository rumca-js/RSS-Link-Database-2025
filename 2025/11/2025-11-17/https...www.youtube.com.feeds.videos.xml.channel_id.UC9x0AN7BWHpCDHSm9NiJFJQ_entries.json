        "description": "Start your free ThreatLocker trial (no credit card required): https://www.threatlocker.com/networkchuck \n\nAt DEF CON, I met a dark web researcher who built \u201cRobin\u201d, an AI-powered Tor scraper that finds the real parts of the dark web faster than anything else. The dark web is notoriously unreliable; it\u2019s slow, full of honeypots, and constantly changing. But Robin uses AI and Docker to automate OSINT, analyze sites, and export real intelligence. In this video I\u2019ll show you how to set it up yourself, and teach you techniques to safely investigate the Dark Web.\n\n\n\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25Join the NetworkChuck Academy!
