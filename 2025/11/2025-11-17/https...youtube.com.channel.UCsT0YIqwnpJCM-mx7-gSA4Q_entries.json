Driven by curiosity, she pulls back the theatre curtain to catch a glimpse of the forbidden \u2014 a gesture that would define her path as an actress, exploring what happens beyond the stage.\n\nShe invites us to view theatre as a mirror of existence \u2014 a space where light and shadow, the visible and the hidden, coexist. Blending personal anecdotes with philosophical and quantum physics insights, she unveils art as an encounter \u2014 a phenomenon that only comes to life when experienced and shared.\n\nHer talk becomes a celebration of presence and human connection. Because, as Antonia reminds us, every performance \u2014 like every life \u2014 is unique, fleeting and unrepeatable. Antonia Zegers is one of the most renowned Chilean actresses of her generation. She has had an extensive career in film, television, and theater. She has become a prominent figure in ",

Trapped in a peat bog during a scientific expedition, he discovered a hidden world of mosses, lichens and tiny insects that showed him the beauty in small things.\nIn this poetic and profound talk, Rozzi shares how that near-death experience inspired his biocultural ethic of cohabitation \u2014 an invitation to view plants, animals and ecosystems not as resources, but as our fellow inhabitants of this planet.\nHe urges us to care for the invisible, to learn from nature and to remember that sharing our habitat, like sharing bread, is the first step to sustaining life in all its diversity. Ricardo Rozzi is a Chilean ecologist and philosopher, professor at the University of Magallanes and the University of North Texas.

Yet it was death itself that taught him the most profound life lessons.\nIn this moving and candid talk, Cristi\u00e1n revisits the pivotal moments that shaped his transformation: the loss of his grandmother during his childhood, a stroke that forced him to pause, and his wife Javiera\u2019s terminal illness. Each encounter with death led him to realise that living fully does not mean avoiding death, but walking alongside it.\nWith compassion and humanity, he invites us to change the question, to stop asking 'Why is this happening to me?' and to start seeing that 'Everything that happens \u2014 even death \u2014 happens for us.' He is a prominent plastic and reconstructive surgeon with experience in both the public and private healthcare sectors.

From the printing press to electricity and the internet, every technological revolution has been met with resistance and uncertainty. Today, with the rise of artificial intelligence, that same fear has returned \u2014 the fear of being replaced or losing control.\nThrough what he terms the 'Paradox of Transformation', \u00c1ngel reflects on our duality: we are the creators of progress, yet we often fear its consequences. He inspires us to move from anxiety to action and from being spectators to becoming architects of the future. Because when we change the question, we stop fearing tomorrow and start shaping it. With more than 25 years of experience in technology and innovation, \u00c1ngel Izurieta has led transformation projects in Chile and Latin America.\nHe has spearheaded the implementation of cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence, blockchain, and robotic process automation (RPA), achievi",

Above all, she calls for the establishment of an Ibero-American network of women oyster farmers to honour pioneers such as Laurencia de Solminihac.\n\nShe is a vocal advocate for food sovereignty and coastal heritage. She works to make coastal communities visible, valued and resilient. Meyling Tang has found a bridge to transform realities in gastronomy.

In this fascinating talk, physicist Paulina Assmann takes us from childhood memories to the frontiers of quantum physics and digital security. She reveals a striking truth: many of the 'locks' we trust to protect our data are as fragile as that childhood diary.\n\nWith clarity and passion, Assmann shows us how randomness \u2014 the ability for something to happen unpredictably \u2014 underpins modern digital security. Quantum physics now provides a source of pure randomness that can create the most secure digital locks ever built.\n\nBeyond technology, this talk invites us to view uncertainty as a creative and protective force. In a world where predictability breeds vulnerability, embracing randomness \u2014 in science and in life \u2014 may be the key to a freer, safer and more humane future.

As a psychotherapist, parent, and long-time emotional anchor for friends, colleagues, and family, she once believed her constant helpfulness was a sign of compassion and strength. But beneath the surface, she began to notice something more hidden\u2014and more human.\n\nDrawing from personal experience and professional insight, she reveals how serial fixing often masks an avoidance of uncomfortable emotions: our own and the emotions of those we care about. What looks like kindness is sometimes a subtle attempt to control, to create peace, or to maintain relevance, all while neglecting personal boundaries and internal needs.\n\nIn this talk, she shares how recognizing these patterns helped her reconnect to herself, reclaim her energy, and stop confusing over-functioning with love.

He argues that the most meaningful architecture often emerges not from rigid control but from embracing uncertainty and allowing environments to evolve through real human behavior. By sharing examples of projects where unexpected interactions led to richer spatial experiences, he highlights the value of flexibility, experimentation, and openness in contemporary practice. His message invites the audience to view unpredictability not as a flaw but as a source of creativity, vitality, and deeper architectural insight.

By tracing the history of psychology from introspection to behaviorism to modern neuroscience, it reveals how fragmented our understanding of mind and body has become. The talk invites audiences to imagine a more integrated perspective, one that reconnects mental life with movement, environment, and the whole human experience. Dr. Kyle J.

She explains that architecture becomes meaningful when it engages all the senses\u2014movement, touch, scale, and perception\u2014rather than relying solely on visual aesthetics. By examining how people physically and emotionally inhabit spaces, she highlights the importance of designing environments that respond to bodily experience and human presence.

        "description": "In his talk on aligning phenomenology with the challenge of responsiveness in architecture, Sam Givrad explores how understanding human perception and lived experience can guide more meaningful approaches to restoring and designing spaces. He explains that phenomenology helps uncover the emotional, sensory, and cultural layers that give architecture its depth, while responsiveness demands that buildings adapt intelligently to contemporary needs. By bridging these two perspectives, he shows how restoration can become a thoughtful dialogue between memory and modernity. His message encourages architects to design and preserve spaces that are not only functional, but also deeply resonant with the ways people feel, move, and experience place.

        "description": "In his talk Responsive Architecture, architect Reza Habibzadeh explores how buildings can move beyond static forms to become dynamic systems that truly engage with their users and environment. He emphasizes that responsive architecture is rooted in listening\u2014listening to climate, context, culture, and the evolving needs of people. Through examples of adaptable spaces and human-centered design strategies, he illustrates how architecture can react intelligently to change, enhancing both functionality and well-being. His message encourages designers and communities to see buildings not as fixed objects, but as living frameworks capable of learning, adjusting, and meaningfully responding.

In this TEDx talk, he shares the moment a student asked him how school today compares to when that student\u2019s dad was in his class and how that question pushed him to rethink everything from technology to testing.

I currently serve in the Science Department Chair, and have taught Biology I, AP Environmental Science, AP Biology and Anatomy over the course of my career. No other subject has the potential to spark the imagination or stimulate one's intellectual curiosity like the sciences.
