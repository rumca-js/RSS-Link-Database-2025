In 2000 when Hilton was 19, she was apparently spotted by Maxwell at a party during fashion week in New York. Now, Hilton says she has no recollection of that night. However, Hilton and Maxwell did cross paths: a photograph from that party shows them together with Donald Trump. On Sunday night, Trump announced that the Epstein files should be released.",
