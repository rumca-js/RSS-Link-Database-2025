        "description": "The fun in Black Ops 7 is fueled by well-designed maps and futuristic themes.\n\nCall of Duty fatigue has been building up for some time. We've reached over two decades of yearly CoD releases, and this year delivers a second consecutive year of Black Ops. Going back-to-back with Black Ops 7 feels risky, but Treyarch clearly listened to community feedback and delivered several changes to prevent this year from an overly familiar feel. Treyarch brings a futuristic era, improved omnimovement, and strong map design with Black Ops 7, which greatly enhances the experience from last year. Black Ops 7 multiplayer is still adrenaline-fueled fun, but this year gives you new tech to play with and more room to breathe.\n\nCredits: S.E. Doster, Ben Janca, Erick Tay\n\n#cod #blops7 #callofduty #blackops",
