Now i&#39;m just going to say this and please forgive me, but please understand this is my opinion, im sorry you BOTW and TOTK fans but after the 3DS i gave up on Zelda. I remembered when Zelda was an epic mash of DND/Tolkein and awesome villains and battles, not just beautiful looking environments and good sounding voice acting. I have the same mixed feelings with Pokemon, which is why i prefer playing romhacks instead of any of the newer games. Its not that i hate the switch games, its just they feel like nostalgia bait than an actual game, especially with the price of the switch and switch 2 where they upgraded the price... Its not worth it, anyway what do you think about this new movie?</p> <p>Because if its another nostalgia bait trash like they did with Rings of Power, The Matrix Resurrections, Indiana Jones Dial of Destiny, and especially Rings ",

An ancient skyscraper to most characters is just a tower. AI projections are described as ghosts, and it took me probably far too long to realise that Severian is frequently describing aliens, spacecrafts and robots on his journey, just using rudimentary terms for them because he doesn&#39;t know what they are. And these books still feel very much like fantasy, with a little sci-fi flavour. </p> <p>Does anyone else like this trope of lost technology and what else in the same vein would you recommend? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Dooberjay\"> /u/Doober",

I would like some more recommendations of books with similar vibes. </p> <p>This relationship style I like is when the girl is viewed as weak by herself but to everyone else she is strong and powerful but with a quiet/understated power. She is often paired with a guy who is powerful in someway (prince/general) that often means they have to go out of their to get the girl. Often the guy is in a predicament which requires the girl to save them. Usually there is also a lot of saving the girl too. Like a lot more but I like the switch of the guy needing help. </p> <p>I quite enjoy the yearning between the pair. I also don&#39;t mind love triangles but not from the girl. The girl is usually set on who she likes but two guys might be both interested. I am not a fan of reading sex scenes. So not a fan of books with that in it. </p> <p>Ca",

Frankly, I have not been having a great 2025 and a lot of things in our world are very scary right now. Reading always helped me, especially fantasy, and being able to spend some time in a fantasical world sounds like the exact thing I need right now. </p> <p>The thing is, Ive not been finding something that has hooked me that much recently, and so many series are so so long and really intimadting to start.</p> <p>Specifically I am looking for a great world that you can really get immersed in. One, where you can lose yourself in the pages and really imagine it in your head. Obviously Im happy if the story is excellent, but just having a fun time existing in the world is enough for me. Bonus points if its just a single book or shorter series.</p> <p>Would lovd to know why people fell in love with the settings from the books",
