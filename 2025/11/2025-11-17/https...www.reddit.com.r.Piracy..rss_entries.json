Since my family owns a radio it means that they have a shit ton of old equipment that can be used to make a server with a couple of TB of storage. My family knows the work of maintaining a server and have agreed to the limitation I&#39;ve said to them (things like needing to upgrade storage in the future, needing to find specific site to track and discover shows).</p> <p>Is building a Jellyfin server worth it?
