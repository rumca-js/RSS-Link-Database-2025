Its kinetic combat system is engaging for the entire 10-hour campaign, and the alternate Deadpool variants with genuinely funny unique dialogue make replaying levels feel worthwhile rather than like padding. As the default Deadpool, however, Neil Patrick Harris\u2019s performance delivers exactly what you'd hope for, and the reality show framing enhances the overall story rather than feeling gimmicky. If you\u2019re up for dark, low-brow comedy and fourth-wall-breaking meta-humor, then this is easily the most complete and entertaining superhero VR experience since Batman: Arkham Shadow. Just make sure you're playing on Quest 3 to get the most out of its vibrant visuals.",
