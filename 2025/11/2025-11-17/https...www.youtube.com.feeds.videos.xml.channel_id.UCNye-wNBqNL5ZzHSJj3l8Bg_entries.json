They also say they won't disarm.\nThe factions have condemned a US-drafted resolution that will be tabled at the UN Security Council later on Monday. \nHamas spokesman Hazem Qassem has told Al Jazeera it would mean replacing Israeli occupation with another form of foreign guardianship.  \nInstead, he's calling for a resolution that reinforces the ceasefire and includes the deployment of UN peacekeeper",

Each year, families gather beneath the groves to pick olives, press oil, and celebrate a connection to the land that spans generations.

With tens of thousands relying on olives for their livelihoods, each loss carries economic and emotional weight.\u00a0This episode examines the harvest as a means of\u00a0livelihood, a celebration, and a form of\u00a0resistance.\n\nPresenter: Stefanie Dekker\n\nGuests:\nSami Huraini - Palestinian activist\nSarah Sharif - Palestinian-American food blogger\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X : https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\nDownload AJE M",
