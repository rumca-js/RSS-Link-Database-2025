        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, we explore how stylization is all about creating a distinctive visual style that expresses your project's atmosphere and uniqueness while still feeling like a real environment. \n\nThis talk is about pushing the limits of stylization in Unreal Engine without compromising aesthetics or art direction, helping to realize your vision while retaining control of your project's look. \n\nThe session covers look development and the latest animation features to help creators think outside the realistic box to get the best results from Unreal Engine. The focus is on technical direction for tools in Unreal Engine to generate stylized looks and animation, such as material development and iteration, and the use of Sequencer.\n\nLearn more about animation in Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com/uses/animation\n\n#Animation, #Sequencer, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestOrlando",

        "description": "The AI boom is fueled by two things: computing power and data. Real-world data can be costly and time-consuming to collect, creating a bottleneck in the process. Synthetic data can alleviate this bottleneck by providing scalable diverse datasets with perfect annotations and labels. \n\nUnreal Engine, using only native tools and features, can produce synthetic visual data for virtually any use case. Synthetic data is currently being used for computer vision applications at companies like Boeing, Tesla, Microsoft, and Apple to train models for a fraction of the cost of manually collecting it. Synthetic data also allows for edge cases that would be too costly or dangerous to enact in the real world. \n\nTo aid in this endeavor, Boeing created custom tools in Unreal Engine using Editor Utility Widgets, enabling data scientists with very little knowledge of Unreal Engine to customize and generate their own data sets.\n\nIn this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, Taylor Loper of The Bo",
