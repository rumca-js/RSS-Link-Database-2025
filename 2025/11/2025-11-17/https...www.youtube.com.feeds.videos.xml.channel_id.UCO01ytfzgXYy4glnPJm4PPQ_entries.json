        "description": "Today on The Matt Walsh Show, I was attacked by both sides of the aisle over the weekend. What did I say this time that caused such outrage? We will discuss. Also, Portland leftists found a new and unique way to protest outside of an ICE facility. MTG goes on CNN to apologize for her rhetoric. What is she doing? And, Vice releases a new, feminist, whiny article about \"mankeeping\". There is a bigger point that needs to be discussed about this \"mankeeping\" and we will get into it today.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:27 Opening\n02:31 - 34:16 \"America Only\" Should Not Be Controversial, So Why Is It?\n36:53 - 40:14 ICE Protesters In Portland Dance Around In Neon Leotards\n40:15 - 55:10 Marjorie Taylor Greene Apologizes On CNN For Her \"Toxic\" Rhetoric\n58:19 - 1:11:45 The Term \"Mankeeping\" Is Canceled\n\nEp.1692\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://x.com/MattWalshShow/status/1989058627907539316?s=20\nhttps://x.com/chrisjollyhale/status/1989098285001502915?s=20\nhttps://x.com/ethan1saacson/status/1989060218748301521?s=20",
