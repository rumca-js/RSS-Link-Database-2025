I tried to educate her on the difference between sex and gender,the things trans people have to deal with and I let her know how important that issue is to me especially given that I am a lesbian and I have friends and a sibling who is trans. She didn\u2019t really change her opinion and continued to say how trans women aren\u2019t \u201creal women\u201d and trans men aren\u2019t \u201creal men\u201d and even said that my brother is \u201cnot a real man\u201d\u2026. it really irritated me so I got off the phone shortly after.
