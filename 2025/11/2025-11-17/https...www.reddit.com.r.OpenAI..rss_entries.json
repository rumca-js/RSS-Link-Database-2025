Right after posting this, I was immediately hit with a suspension. I have no idea why or how long the ban lasts. Did I miss something major? Has OpenAI&#39;s policy become this strict? Is a general, context-management question about AI now prohibited? Has anyone else experienced something similar recently? Thanks in advance for any comments or information.
