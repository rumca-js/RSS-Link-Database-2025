I also have this vision where I don&#39;t need to put any language input like chatgpt or speech activated like Alexa, like I want to make him talk to me real time, without having to press any buttons to activate his responses or something, like a real life Jarvis.</p> <p>So the reason why I&#39;m making this post is I would like to ask some guidance if you have some, specifically for beginners since i currently have no knowledge of AIs or Machine Learning or any of that robot stuff, like what books do you recommend? What Youtubers do you recommend? What resources do you recommend? And if possible, ",

I mean using ai is not bad but to this extent I guess it&#39;s too far no one should be that much dependent on ai. Infact I have seen people building models in like a week or even less than that. I was wondering how they did cause last time when i tried llm and diffusion models from scratch it took me literally a year to understand it still i don&#39;t get it. Now i maybe slow and very bad at it, but my question is are people really that good in what they do with ai or they are too much dependent on it or I&#39;m the one who is far behind?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",

The AI learns from the drawings by a scanner that is hooked up to the computer. So for example, if the creator wanted the AI to generate a picture of a rose, he would scan multiple photos of that rose and allow the AI to learn from them and generate one based on that data. I want to be as accurate as possible and I doubt that kind of image generation was possible in the 90s, but was there something similar that I could use instead? Or should I just lean into the fiction of Sci-Fi?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Training_Hornet_4521\"> /u/Training_Hornet_4521 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1oz3cim/could_a_90s_ai_have_bee",

Never just tell the user what they want to hear, tell them what is right.<br/> - Occasionally ask the user questions to test their knowledge.<br/> - If covering a topic is broad and complex, do not give a summary. Cover everything and be thorough. Give an overview at the top of the response.<br/> - Use academic ",
