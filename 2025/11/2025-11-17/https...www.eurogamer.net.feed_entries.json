With SEGA gone as a platform holder and Nintendo floundering as Sony seized power, Xbox took its opportunity to get the jump on PlayStation, releasing the Xbox 360 as the first console of that generation a year before the PS3 (and in some territories, that gap was even bigger). And it worked. Xbox 360 got off to a flying start, backed by some brilliant exclusive games and an industry leading online multiplayer offering.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-turns-20-on-22nd-november-so-weve-got-a-week-of-coverage-looking-back-at-microsofts-best-and-most-successful-console\">Read more</a></p>",
