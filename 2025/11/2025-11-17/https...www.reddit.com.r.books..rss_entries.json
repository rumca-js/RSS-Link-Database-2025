It reads:</p> <p>&quot;There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.&quot;</p> <p>Seeing this made me curious about her works, so I began reading, and learned that Angelou nurtured this ethos in her first book and dedicated additional time to writing six more autobiographies.</p> <p><em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</em> offers a brave retelling of how one can overcome overwhelmingly oppressive circumstances, and she wants her readers to know how she did it.</p> <p>Angelou&#39;s writings have much to offer curious readers in the manner of humility, transformation, and hope :-)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vast-Air-914\"> /u/Vast-Air-914 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books",
