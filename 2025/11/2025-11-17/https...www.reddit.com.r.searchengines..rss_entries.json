When looking for a search engine that doesn&#39;t just give me the same results, no predictive algorithm or learning to suggest certain things, all I found were other search engines that prioritized smaller sites instead of popular sites.</p> <p>That&#39;s not what I&#39;m looking for. I wanted to know if the kind of search engine that searches purely off what you type even exists anymore?</p> <p>Okay, technically I know they do in some places. Like the Wayback Machine. It doesn&#39;t have an algorithm at all. You just type something and it provides based off that. But the Wayback Machine is an archive, not necessarily a daily use search engine to surf the entirety of the Internet. Just what&#39;s been archived of it.</p> <p>So does anyone know of one that exists?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Viambulance\"> /u/Viambulance </a> <br/> <span><a hr",
