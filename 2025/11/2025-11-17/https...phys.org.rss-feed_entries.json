In most flowering plants, geraniol biosynthesis occurs in plastids and relies on precursors from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway.",

Developing such systems could offer new design principles for advanced functional materials capable of flexibly adapting to environmental changes, much like biological systems.",
