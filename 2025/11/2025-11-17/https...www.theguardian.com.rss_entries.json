The punchy anchovy and garlic butter does all the hard work, and gives the impression of more effort than was actually exerted. But what to serve it with, I hear you ask? Well, it wouldn\u2019t be out of place with creamy mashed potato, buttery polenta or a salad.

However, Liverpool\u2019s defence held firm and the Reds levelled in the 33rd minute and held out until half-time. The Chelsea manager, Sonia Bompastor, introduced further attacking options in the second half, including Lauren James and Aggie Beever-Jones, but a solid defensive display from Liverpool ensured Chelsea were unable to find a winner as the hosts earned their second point of the season. Although the result did mean Chelsea set a record of 34 successive unbeaten WSL games, clearly all is not well with the defending champions. Last season they had 27 points after nine games and led the way, this campaign they have eight fewer and are three points behind Manchester City. <strong>R\u00e9shma Rao</strong></p><p><em>Match report: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/",

        "description": "<p>There are modest benefits to exercising on an empty stomach, but it\u2019s more important to burn more energy than you\u2019re consuming</p><p>\u2018There\u2019s an element of truth to that,\u201d says Javier Gonzalez, a professor of nutrition and metabolism at the University of Bath. \u201cWhen we exercise, we\u2019re always burning a mix of fuels \u2013 mainly carbohydrates and fat. If you\u2019ve fasted overnight, you\u2019ll generally burn a bit more fat and less carbohydrate than if you\u2019d eaten breakfast, especially one high in carbs.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean fasted workouts are better for weight loss.</p><p>\u201cWe can only store a small amount of carbohydrate as glycogen in our muscles and liver. Any extra energy \u2013 from carbs, fat or protein \u2013 eventually gets stored as body fat. So to lose fat, you need to be in an energy deficit: burning more energy than you consume. If you\u2019re not, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re fasted or fed \u2013 your body balances things out over time,\u201d says Gonzalez.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/li",
