I was looking at a HTOP/IOTOP-type docker system, with CLI. But I am a rather forgetful person, so this is a tad too advanced for my continoued daily use.

Hopefully with a local push-notification reminder if an occurrence is happening.</p> <p>I&#39;m always connected to my home via VPN, so if there is a good Docker app that supports some sort of push notification to my Android phone whenever an alert is prominent, that would really be the best for me.

The caveat is that the workflow cannot involve first storing the photos in the Files or Photos or 3rd party syncing app on the phone. I considered just a basic file share web ui but I believe they typically need the files to live in the Files or Photos app to be selected for upload. Since it must be done directly from the source app to the server (no other apps in between) the share sheet seems like the best way.
