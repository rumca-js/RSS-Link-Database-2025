        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I\u2019m running into a lot of issues building a retro arcade machine. The one I\u2019m working on now is the lack of audio. I\u2019m using a CRT tv as the display with a RP5 as the brains. I soldered on a header for composite video output and got that running like a charm. Well, now no audio. I purchased a usb to RCA cable (maybe my problem?) and plugged it in and any time I go to edit audio settings, I just get the message \u201cOn-board audio disabled or not present\u201d </p> <p>I figured that I wouldn\u2019t have onboard audio anymore but it looks like it\u2019s also not seeing that there is usb audio. </p> <p>What should I be doing next?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/KennyFreeman3\"> /u/KennyFreeman3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1oz95cj/retropie_has_no_audio_through_usb/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1oz95cj/retropie_has_n",
