My main gaming PC (on Windows 11) chose to completely die last week, and I just ordered an all-AMD build with the intent to switch to Linux primarily. However there will be a few games that just won&#39;t be viable in Linux because of anti-cheat, so I&#39;m going to maintain a separate m.2 drive with a small Windows 11 install on it for the few games that I can&#39;t easily do in Linux.</p> <p>My question: is there any kind of elegant tool for managing dual-booting in this scenario? My last experience with dual-booting OS&#39;s for gaming purposes was back in the Intel Macbook Pro days when I had a Windows 7 install for gaming, and managing it at the time was super easy (in terms of getting it set up, easily choosing which OS to boot into when turning on the PC, etc.).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https:",

Now Idk if that&#39;s considered to be washed out because although bright areas are bright to where the color is in fact getting washy, shadow/dark areas are nice and dark and everything pops, same in dark scenes, everything&#39;s real dark but blue lights and magic and stuff like that looks absolutely gorgeous. </p> <p>I had a funny experiment last night where I booted the game in HDR, then disabled HDR in plasma, then in the game kept HDR turned on. Every single detail looked amazing, bright scenes and dark scenes and it was just great. So that makes me think maybe gamescope and plasma are doubling the HDR space so to speak. </p> <p>I don&#39;t have pics atm but can get some if needed. I&#39;ve got an Rx 7",

So I decided to return to linux (last time I dallied linux was 2011). I had heard that Linux had made huge strides since then and expected a easier transition so I was thinking this would be a breeze. </p> <p>I primarily use my personal PC to monitor my homelab and play games, beyond the general PC use anyway. I run a pfSense, a small Pi cluster, an Unraid machine, and a Proxmox (HomeAssisstant and some VMs) with trueNAS (Unraid primary, trueNAS is the backup). All this to say, I&#39;m in linux all the time. Admittedly, I&#39;m not as capable as I should be with all linux distros/variants, but I&#39;m in the terminal often. I know my way around.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried four distros now (Mint, Arch, Bazzite, and Omarchy) and no matter what I tried I couldn&#39;t get any Steam games to work on any dist",
