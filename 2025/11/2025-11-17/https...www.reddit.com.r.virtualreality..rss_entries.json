I want to have a board on which I can write different formulas, so that somewhere in space funny notes, a timer, two displays, maybe all sorts of things like a web browser, movies, chess, etc. Sometimes I would also like to play games. How sense idea do you think it is? I once had quest 2, but the resolution did not allow me to read anything, otherwise I did not observe any problems with long-term use. My face is a little sweaty. Do you think it will suit me and does anyone have such experience? I&#39;ll take a used helmet. I&#39;m considering now either Apple Vision Pro 1500$ or Quest3 400$. Is it possible to use Quest3 as a workhorse? Maybe new Valve VR?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/FR0GG1D\"> /u/FR0GG1D </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

I am looking to make a purchase over the Thanksgiving/black Friday timeframe. I noticed there is a 100 dollars off the PFD, but you can already get 50 off all the time with a coupon code, so it&#39;s really only a 50 dollar savings. Does anyone know if some better deals will come out during the actual black Friday timeframe? This doesn&#39;t make me feel compelled to buy the PFD immediately or miss out on an extra 50 bucks off. And I doubt the Galaxy XR will have a sale right after releasing, if it did, it probably means it&#39;s not selling well.</p> <p>I&#39;m having such a hard time deciding between these two headsets. My main thing holding me back from getting the PFD is everyone talks about needing to 3d print a new facial interface to make it comfortable, and I know nothing about that, I don&#39;t want a project. I stumbled upon this video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/cYxkWnX",

However I noticed the current leadership driving windows into a system of less control. Telemetry/adds/subscriptions. Shuttering of WMR, removal of VR support from Minecraft. Then add the 30% profit margin chase and we see closure of studios removed content and increases in subscription fees. Over the last few years I&#39;ve been watching Linux and thought nuh its not there yet, especially in the VR space. Now we look at the gabecube and frame. Not an MS Window to be seen. Proton and FEX have the possibility to make the choice of OS feasible.

Steam Deck is priced very competitively. Battery Life? Sure, the Steam Deck has twice the TDP but cutting down the battery life in half doesn&#39;t seem like that bad of a trade off? Besides the battery strap can probably be upgraded. Perhaps its cooling? Steam Deck is notoriously loud. It would be annoying to have that on your face so they would probably have to design quite a beefy cooling solution? Or does it have something to do with camera proccessing?

This sounds very exciting, until I remember that a lot of people say the same thing about Quest 3 with a good AP and Virtual Desktop. I love Virtual Desktop, but it&#39;s nowhere near display port. Compression artifacts are still pretty noticeable and you have to sacrifice on latency to get the best image quality.</p> <p>As I understand, some eye-tracked headsets can utilize the foveated streaming right <em>now</em>. I&#39;m curious, in a head-to-head comparison, Virtual Desktop @ 500mbps vs Foveated streaming, how big is the difference? I&#39;m messed around with Steam Link and it definitely feels a lot snappier than Virtual Desktop, but image quality leaves a lot to be desired.</p> <p>",

How about the Meta Quest 3S instead? I read that having a lower resolution per lenses is better for my GPU because it requires less VRAM reducing the risk of issues.</p>",
