Call of Duty fatigue has been building up for some time. We've reached over two decades of yearly CoD releases, and this year delivers a second consecutive year of Black Ops. Going back-to-back with Black Ops 7 feels risky, but Treyarch clearly listened to community feedback and delivered several changes to prevent this year from an overly familiar feel. Treyarch brings a futuristic era, improved omnimovement, and strong map desi",

Some are vital survival tools, aiding your injuries or keeping your tummy full to keep you climbing for longer. Others can jeopardize an entire expedition in an instant. Depending on who you're playing with, the latter can be dangerous--there's always that one player who won't hesitate to create a TikTok-worthy moment.</p><p>Here's the trick with items in Peak: While the game tells you its name, it doesn't actually explain what an item does. Some are easy enough to guess from looks alone, but more often than not, you should be wary of using something to avoid being penalized or affecting the run by accident. Don't fret, though--if you're wondering what things like the <strong>book of bones</strong> or the <strong>shroomberries</strong> do, the list below includes <strong>every item in Peak and what they do</strong>, so you can have a helpful page at hand to dispel doubts in the group ",

Part of the challenge in maintaining that longevity is the game\u2019s older foundation--it launched before the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. That dated architecture limits what EA can do and makes it easy to crave a fresh experience every now and then. Ten years is a long time to stick with a single world, no matter how often it\u2019s updated.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Fortunately, plenty of games capture the same sense of creativity, chaos, and character-driven storytelling. Some take the life sim genre in entirely new directions, while others stick closer to the formula but experiment with fresh ideas. Whether you want a completely new experience or something to complement your Sims 4 playthrough, there\u2019s plenty to explore with this list of the best games like The Sims.</p><p> </p></p><br/>  ",

Regardless, a US Congressman has weighed in on the Black Ops 7 debate and called for extensive AI regulations.</p><p>California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna--who has previously <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/\">accused Roblox of not doing enough</a> to protect children who use it--reposted a message about the Ghibli-like Calling Cards and wrote, \"We need regulations that p",

As Arc Raiders was breaking its own concurrent player record, <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/\">Black Ops 7</a>'s launch weekend saw lower than usual player counts for a Call of Duty Steam launch, suggesting the competition may be impacting CoD's success on Steam.</p><p>Black Ops 7, the latest mainline Call of Duty game, hit a launch weekend peak of 100,332 players on Steam, less than a quarter of Arc Raiders' weekend high. Of course the two numbers aren't directly comparable--Arc Raiders is only available on Steam and the Epic Games Store for PC, while Black Ops 7 can also be purchased through Battle.net or the Microsoft Store, and is playable on <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-black-ops-7-and-five-more-day-on",
