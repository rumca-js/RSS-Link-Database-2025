The blast shockwave appeared olive-shaped\u2014not spherical\u2014revealing surprising asymmetry in the explosion. Recorded with the FORS2 instrument, the data shows the shock-breakout phase in unprecedented detail. The discovery challenges existing models and offers new clues into how massive stars die and how their final moments unfold.",

        "description": "Samsung is reportedly preparing to launch its first tri-folding phone, the Galaxy Z TriFold, on December 5. The device may feature a 10-inch main display, a 6.5-inch cover screen, and an expected price of about $3,000 (roughly Rs. 2,66,00). US firmware testing for model SM-F968U1 has reportedly begun, suggesting the launch is close. The phone folds twice, may use a Snapdragon chip, and is expected to offer a \u201cportable PC\u201d experience. Leaks also hint at a 5,437mAh battery, a 200-megapixel camera, and very slim panels.",
