It\u2019s basically a cyberpunk laptop. A \u201cwriterdeck,\u201d then, is a similar concept but only for writing text.

That is more than half off its regular $1,800 price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The G950 is 49 inches of OLED goodness, with a 5120\u00d71440 resolution (that\u2019s two 1440p monitors side by side) and an impressive 240Hz refresh rate.

The figure freezes midstride, the image pixelates, and before you can make out a face, the camera goes dark.

It\u2019s your Wi-Fi. Outdoor security cameras push the limits of your home network more than any other device. Their signals must punch through walls, windows, and sometimes half the expanse of your yard just to stay connected. Add interference from neighboring routers or even a nearby microwave (yours or your neighbors\u2019), and that live view can turn into a slideshow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is you don\u2019t need to tear down walls or replace all your gear.
