It still didnt work</p> <p>I guess it is probably due to this <a href=\"https://fritz.com/en/pages/fritz-os\">Update</a> but i couldnt find any more precise information.</p> <p>Has anyone got an Idea how i could bypass those new Protection Mechanisms and deceive the Network into thinking im this other device?</p> <p>thx : )</p",
