        "description": "SUPPORT THE AI DYSTOPIA REPORT SERIES: https://store.gamersnexus.net/ai-dystopia\nMemory prices have skyrocketed over the last several months. RAM price increases are for a number of reasons, including AI server demand chewing through supply, previous oversupply leading to a draw-down in manufacturing (which has now caught-up), and probably also RAM companies being a-holes. We'll explore why RAM prices have gone up, the impact to NAND (Flash Memory, or non-volatile memory), the impending impact to GPU VRAM prices, and how there's nothing any of us can do -- but we can at least collect price data and make decisions on purchasing.\n\nWatch our \"WTF is Going On\" video about the circular AI economy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3JfOxx6Hh4\n\nLearn about the special backer tiers with bonus videos and digital content: https://store.gamersnexus.net/ai-dystopia\nOr grab our new \"RETRO I/O\" Coaster Packs! https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/gn-drink-retro-io-coaster-pack-4-custom-3d-coasters-",
