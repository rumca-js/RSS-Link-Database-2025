        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently bought myself a SATA to USB converter so I could do stuff on some HDD drive from my old laptop. I quickly realized I could just use it as an external drive since the adapter works fine and the drive itself has 1TB which is pretty solid. Additionally internal SATA HDDs seem to be way cheaper than some external ones. I thought instead of buying external drives I could just buy internal ones for way cheaper while still having lots of storage. But i&#39;m just not sure if there any downsides. I&#39;ve heard somewhere how internal drives can use a lot of power going above the USB &quot;safe&quot; limit (as some drives require up to 12V) but no idea if this true since at the end of the day &quot;external&quot; drives are just internal ones in a case with a SATA or IDE to USB bridge. Thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/defaultlinuxuser\"> /u/defaultlinuxuser </a> <br/> <span><a h",

I have been backing up all my data, and for the past week or so have been focused mostly on backing up my large DVD collection with MakeMKV. I have been backing up blurays too, but I don&#39;t have very many of those. I plan on streaming them over my local network eventually, but I am currently focused on preservation instead of use cases.</p> <p>Anyways, I am already running into storage limitations with just 8 TB and am considering what my options are. I was considering buying a DAS to create a 2nd storage pool on my PC, but I really would prefer to keep everything on one storage pool. What other options do I have? Any and all advice is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/patermortis\"> /u/p",

The motherboard I am using didn&#39;t come with a lot of sata ports and I am using a Jonsbo N1 case. I got a LSI SAS3008 9300-8I but I heard they need airflow to stay cool which the system sort of lacks due to its compact nature so I plan on taking it out. I can probably change cases later but I was wondering if there was a Sata PCI-E that I could use instead and was wondering if people had recommendations. I also wasn&#39;t sure if they run cooler because I only need 5 sata ports to run all the drives I plan on running (currently) and with the case airflow is pretty bad.

Through owning a camera that shoots 10-bit 4K DCI and a flourishing radarr/sonarr setup I&#39;m now at 500GB left. </p> <p>What is the most efficient way to get more storage? I think I can&#39;t just add more drives without losing efficiency (?) so I have to reshard every drive. Do I get 8 TB? 12 TB? Both options are putting me at just about 800\u20ac just for drives which kind of does not feel great haha. Should I start over somehow and have more bays? Maybe I could just transcode everything I have to AV1/HEVC somehow? </p> <p>I really don&#39;t know what to do.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/3nt3_\"> /u/3nt3_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1oz4ktq/what_now/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/com",
