The main idea is that both you and your opponent have hive/base which you need to defend and to destroy the opponent\u2019s hive. There are three different types of pieces: bugs, trees and torches, each player has one torch while the number of trees and bugs can be changed before starting a match (like building a deck). Bugs have a number of hit points, attack power and movement and a certain movement path (for example: grubs/maggots can move one space forward, like a pawn). There are two ways to destroy the opponent\u2019s hive, the first one is to destroy it by having bugs eat it or burning it down with a torch. After a torch has been placed down it can\u2019t be moved and it must be placed on your half of the board, any adjancent trees catch fire and spread the fire and any adjancent bugs burn and get destroyed. Some trees and bugs have special abilities (for example: Cherry trees can push back",

Takes about 5-20 minutes per day, depending on if we understand the puzzle, but overall its a lot of fun! For the most part when we finish the puzzle, we open a Pokemon pack, so 24 packs in total. We only purchase packs once a year, and its for this occasion. I know that Pokemon doesn&#39;t relate to this at all lol, but its kinda fun to get a &quot;reward&quot;. We also purchase a chocolate advent calendar that we open alongside it (truth be told I think its Halloween candy that the company didn&#39;t end up selling just repackages it for this lol). Just wondering if anyone else is doing something similar?</p> <p>Perhaps looking for inspiration here too...</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AlexRescueDotCom\"> /u/AlexRescueDotCom </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgame",

Thorgal is a favorite theme for a me and my friends as we have been reading the comic series for years. And when we saw the upcoming board game adaptation, we definitely had to have it.</p> <p>Opening the box, so many cards and so many many cards not only to feast your eyes but to give more depth and story to the game. And an amazing book map that unfolds and brings you the world of Throgal to your table. Beautiful miniatures of the comic heroes and heroines that immerge you even more to the theme. A ton of tokens and amazingly satisfying wooden tokens resources plus some pretty cool dice. Pretty cool dual player boards that come together part by part to give you a unique mechanic of characters\u2019 asymmetry.</p> <p>Reading the rules, well not only the rules but the story book also (suggest not to read it though because I almost had a spoiler for the first adventure).",

Honestly, it feels like it\u2019s breathed a bit of new life into a game I already loved but hadn&#39;t played in quite a while.</p> <p>Got me wondering: what are your favourite examples of expansions that arrived years after release and genuinely revitalised the game for you? Not just a small module or promo, but something that made you pull a game off the shelf again and see it in a new light.</p> <p>Curious to hear what others reckon.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TabletopGains\"> /u/TabletopGains </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments",
