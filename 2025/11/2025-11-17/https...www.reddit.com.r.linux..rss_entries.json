So I have no idea how it all started, but I just found myself diving into Linux content every single day for quite a while now, and I&#39;m kind of confused (a lot), so I decided to turn to you for advice, seeing as you&#39;re clearly more experienced as I am. </p> <p>I decided to play around a bit with some distros (so far, Deepin 25 and Ubuntu), and after fixing a few issues (because for some reason my internet speed was severely capped before I changed a value I have no recollection of what&#39;s called by now), I was only met with the problem of not being able to run some applications, really. Browser worked better than in windows, discord had no problems at all, but I missed Minecraft the way I&#39;ve always been using it for, the original applications like epic games launcher. I was kind of sad Ubuntu 25.10 didn&#39;t even allow me to boot any game on steam, but I just can&#39;t stop looking up distros, admi",

I knew I was never going back after the first 3 weeks. Did some minor customizing and was happy. I learned the terminal. I learned the basic commands. I learned some not so basic commands. I set up a keyboard centric work flow. I set up binds, hot keys etc. Did a small bit of ricing. I got used to learning how to fix shit myself. And im not going to lie, it was great. I have never had a more stable desktop experience. Some of you told me that I should try other distros, but I was happy. I was content. And I ignored those that told me I would be back...looking for trouble...</p> <p>Over the last 2 weeks, I have been tossing and turning during sleep. I have been hearing voices.
