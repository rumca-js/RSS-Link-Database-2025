According to Sony, an additional 3.9 million PS5 consoles were sold in the last quarter, bringing its lifetime total to 84.2 million consoles sold since the system launched in 2020. That puts the PS5 into a virtual dead heat with its predecessor, PlayStation 4, at the same point in its life cycle.</p><p>The complete breakdown of Sony's latest fiscal quarter is <a href=\"https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/\">now online</a>, and its sales chart shows the remarkably similar trajectory of the PS4 and PS5 sales. However, Sony noted that it only projects 15 million additional PS5 console sales during its current fiscal year, which runs through March 31, 2025. If so, that would potentially allow PS4 to retain its crown as Sony's second best-selling console, because it sold 17.8 million systems at that point in its life.</p><p>Regardless, Sony CFO Lin Tao suggested that the PS5 m",
