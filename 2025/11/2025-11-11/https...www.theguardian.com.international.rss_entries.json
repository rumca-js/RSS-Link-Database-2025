I am growing a baby I will meet, hold and raise. But I have also carried a baby I never got to meet. For 13 weeks, my body held her. It nurtured her, protected her, grew her placenta, still believing she was safe. And in a way, she was. My husband told me then: \u201cShe only ever knew love and warmth\u201d, and that has never left me.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/12/pregnancy-after-loss-has-shown-me-that-love-doesnt-end-it-just-changes-shape\">Continue reading...</a>",
