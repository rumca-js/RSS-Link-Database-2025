        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, I am on the newest debian 13.1, system up to date, and having an issue with a docker container of jellyfin. After restarting the machine, the container doesn&#39;t start and throws this error:</p> <pre><code>level=error msg=&quot;failed to start container&quot; container=8e5e1b325328a2fca396ab3fa66da70bc4372b395d5cc9ee7f7af5bee294a8e8 error=&quot;failed to create task for container: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: error mounting \\&quot;/mnt/media\\&quot; to rootfs at \\&quot;/media\\&quot;: mount src=/mnt/media, dst=/media, dstFd=/proc/thread-self/fd/33, flags=MS_BIND|MS_REC: no such device&quot; </code></pre> <p>It&#39;s probably worth pointing out that /mnt/media is a CIFS share, perhaps that may have something to do it. However when I check, media is mounted properly. I also had this issue in debian 13, but not in debian 12.11. Any help? T",
