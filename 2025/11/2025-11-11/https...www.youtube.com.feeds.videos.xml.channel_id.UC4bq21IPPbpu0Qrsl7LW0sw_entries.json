        "description": "Big Tech doesn\u2019t want to count its own pollution.\n\nThe Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the global rulebook for corporate carbon reporting is under attack.\n\nWhy? Because companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are lobbying to change how emissions are counted.\n\nRight now, they offset dirty nighttime power by buying \u201cclean energy credits\u201d from the daytime.\nIn other words: burn coal at midnight, brag about solar at noon.\n\nNew rules would force hourly tracking of energy use, no more creative accounting for data centers running 24/7.\n\n\ud83d\udc49Hear the full breakdown on The Slidebean Stand-Up; streaming now on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and all major podcast platforms.",
