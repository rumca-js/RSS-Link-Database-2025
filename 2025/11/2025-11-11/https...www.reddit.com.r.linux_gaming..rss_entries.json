But what i have noticed is that when i record the focused monitor, i get way higher fps then i does if i record focused window, The fps difference is actually quite big considering that its minecraft as my fps drops by like 50-60%, Now the biggest thing that ive noticed between both recordings is that the monitor recording generally gave artifacting and ghosting issues after rendering in TEKNOS blur but the clips recorded using focused window mode gave no such issue and infact were clean. So i just wanted to ask that whats really going on and is there any way to like attain focused window level quality with focused monitor mode.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Economy_Amoeba9370\"> /u/Economy_Amoeba9370 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1oufaoe/gpu_screen_re",

Is that still the case? I <em>mostly</em> play single player games. Usually smaller closer to indie then AAA type games. </p> <p>My main experience with Linux is via steamdeck so I\u2019ve used protondb a bit before but I think it\u2019s mostly for steam deck?</p> <p>What district do you recommend? I was considering either ubuntu or mint as I\u2019ve heard that\u2019s the most user friendly ones?</p> <p>Any tips appreciated thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NotBashB\"> /u/NotBashB </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ou5qpd/switching_to_linux/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ou5qpd/switching_to_linux/\">[comments]</a></span>",
