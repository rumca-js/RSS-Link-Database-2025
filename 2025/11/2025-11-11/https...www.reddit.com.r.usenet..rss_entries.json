I noticed several of my uploads today didn&#39;t seem to spread across usenet , other uploader I know noticed the same thing. The result was fresh nzb&#39;s fail to complete when downloaded. I tested several fresh nzb&#39;s from multiple indexers and most failed.</p> <p>The good news is that the same nzb will complete if you returned to it an hour or two later. This was also confirmed by several people.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Turnover20\"> /u/Fantastic-Turnover20 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ouoq9r/seems_like_new_uploads_are_not_spreading/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ouoq9r/seems_like_new_uploads_are_not_spreading/\">[comments]</a></span>",
