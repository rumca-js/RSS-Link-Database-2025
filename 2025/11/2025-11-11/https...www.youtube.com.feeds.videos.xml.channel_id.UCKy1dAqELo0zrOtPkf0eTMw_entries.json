Writing under the psuedonym Richard Bachman in the early 80s, the king of horror churned out a terrifyingly prescient bit of science fiction about an authoritarian regime keeping the masses entertained with a gladiatorial game show called The Running Man. While Glen Powell and Edgar Wright run right along side the book, Arnold's campy 1987 version was wildly different. So get your one-liners ready, because it's time to ask What's the Difference?\n\n#IGN #Movies",

        "description": "Battlefield REDSEC reviewed by Charlie Wacholz on PC, also available on Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nAfter catching a few wins across all three of its main queues, Battlefield REDSEC\u2019s slow-rolling storm just hasn\u2019t done much to keep me wanting more aside from introducing a few interesting missions here and there. It\u2019s enjoyable, sure, but its adaptation doesn\u2019t mesh well with the pace and epic scale that makes Battlefield 6\u2019s regular multiplayer so much fun. But where REDSEC\u2019s battle royale only dilutes that formula, the Gauntlet mode that lives alongside it instead boils down and concentrates the best stuff from both Battlefield and battle royales at large into one of the coolest game modes I\u2019ve seen from a military shooter in a long time. I hope EA and DICE plan on fleshing it out as part of their Battlefield 6 roadmap, because while I may not be interested in playing more of the battle royale mode, I am certainly interested in more Gauntlet.",
