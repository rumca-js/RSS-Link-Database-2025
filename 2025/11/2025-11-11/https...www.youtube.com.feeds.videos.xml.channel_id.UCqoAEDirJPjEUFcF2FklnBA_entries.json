        "description": "What happens when physics meets the big questions of philosophy? Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice sit down with Elise Crull, philosopher of physics at CUNY and author of The Einstein Paradox, to explore physics, philosophy, and how thought experiments shape real science. \n\nWhy did 20th-century physicists like Einstein, Schr\u00f6dinger, and Bohr disagree about what quantum mechanics even means? Why did Einstein insist that physics needed deeper explanations, and how did philosophical thinking guide his breakthroughs? Was he really doing physics\u2014or philosophy? And what does it mean to \u201cdo\u201d science when the evidence runs thin?\n\nFrom Newton\u2019s Principia to quantum entanglement, we explore how physics and philosophy were once deeply intertwined\u2014and why that relationship matters now more than ever. Why did physics and philosophy split in the first place? What do we lose when science becomes only experimental and utilitarian?  Is there still room in modern physics for \u201cwhy\u201d questi",
