So recently I&#39;ve been trying to play some modded skyrimVR with my quest 3 using virtual desktop however, I would always experience these short but notable lag spikes where the latency would get really high for some reason according to the Virtual desktop performace graph. Attempting to fix this, I looked online for advice and managed to separate the wifi 6E band from my router so that I would be the only one using it and purchased a new reliable cat 6A ethernet cable(might have been overkill but I wanted to be sure it wasnt a bandwidth problem) except, after setting everything up these lag spikes still occur and I dont know what to do at this point so if you are knowledgeable in this suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p>If you are curious my pc specs are: CPU: intel core i9-12900H GPU: RTX 3070 TI Laptop RAM: 16 GB DDR5 4800 SSD: SAMSUNG 2 TB 980 PRO I a",

I installed SteamVR beta, got the beta APK for Steam Link and loaded it up on the headset. It launches, and it works for a virtual desktop. But it will not launch titles in VR.

I can play Elite Dangerous, Walking Dead Saints and Sinners 1 &amp; 2, and other random games. But its a coin toss on when I buy a new vr game, if it will run or not. I&#39;ve got Skydance&#39;s Behemoth recently, and when I start it through my head set, through steamvr, it says i don&#39;t have a headset. Other games will act like they&#39;re starting, then take me back to steamvr home. I&#39;ve had this problem since I was using the Quest 2. Most of what I&#39;ve found online tells me to set open xr to steam or quest link. Neither way fixes my problem. Others have said to delete open xr. Thing is, when I search for open xr on my apps list, it&#39;s not there. If any one has any answer it would be very much appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shagstone420\"> /u/shagstone420 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",
