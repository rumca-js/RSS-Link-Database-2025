        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Why every single distro&#39;s graphical installer suck so much? It&#39;s incredible, either they do stuff you haven&#39;t asked or don&#39;t let you configure your own system the way you want. A while ago I installed Fedora and have been using it, I really love this distro and is probably the one I will use for the rest of my life, but that Anaconda installer is just TERRIBLE, it doesn&#39;t let me configure my own partition schemes the way I think it&#39;s optimal! I had to create one more partition and unencrypt my /boot, which was a huge drawback to me, and it&#39;s the only reason I&#39;m considering moving back to Arch... The Debian installer is also horrible and it doesn&#39;t let you do shit if you want to configure your own partitions yourself...</p> <p>Look, I know graphical installers are important for beginners and stuff, but PLEASE at least provide a reliable way of installing via terminal.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",

Started the journey with Pi OS, moved to Ubuntu on the Pi 5, fell in love with Linux and the culture, installed Ubuntu on my back up laptop, then moved to Fedora KDE, then moved my main laptop to Fedora KDE. In total it&#39;s about a year of being in this ecosystem and I&#39;m fully locked in. I enjoy the tinkering, if there&#39;s a problem I don&#39;t roll over I WILL solve it. I wanted rolling release over stable as it is, if something is going to break I&#39;d rather have it do it now than way down the road with something like Debian.
