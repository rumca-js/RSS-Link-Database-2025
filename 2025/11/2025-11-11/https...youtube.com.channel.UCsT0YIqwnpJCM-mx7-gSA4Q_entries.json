        "description": "What if everything we think we know about motivation is exactly backwards? In her talk, Dr. Betsy Blackard shares a new perspective on children\u2019s responses to challenges, and offers a fresh idea for how to support them in tapping into their intrinsic motivation. You may just find that you walk away with a new perspective on your own motivation as well! \n\nDr. Betsy Blackard is an expert in how kids work. She has worked closely with children for more than 20 years and has a PhD in Positive Developmental Psychology. Her research focused on the parent-child relationship, including including how parents\u2019 beliefs and behavior impact their children. Her company, Language of Listening\u00ae, provides simple, practical tools that really work to help parents get new results for everyday challenges. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
