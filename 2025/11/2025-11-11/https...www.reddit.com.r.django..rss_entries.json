The calculations I need to do are actually simple, such as: how many units of a product are in stock, how many orders exist for that product, or how many items were shipped in an order and how many are remaining. I&#39;m developing an app that handles these calculations, but I&#39;m unsure of the best way to implement these <strong>calculated fields</strong>. Should I use <code>property</code>, <code>signals</code>, or another method? I feel overwhelmed and lost. I would really appreciate it if you could explain the logic behind this and the correct approach, or provide some example code for similar operations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Liberal31\"> /u/Liberal31 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1oub9fl/i_need_help_with_calculated_fields/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.red",
