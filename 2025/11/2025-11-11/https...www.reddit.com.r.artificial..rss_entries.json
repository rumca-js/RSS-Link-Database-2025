It was fun to use to take images from a comic or manga and &quot;animate&quot; them but one day the program stopped working and now its gone entirely.</p> <p>I vaguely remember it was called an AI image interpolater and was hoping someone knows where i can find one for free even if it has alot of limitations and such. again i&#39;m not looking for it to make amazing top quality stuff as it was just comic and manga scenes. thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TRUE_EVIL_NEVER_DIES\"> /u/TRUE_EVIL_NEVER_DIES </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1ouoo0p/ai_image_interpolation/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

And another study found that if an AI had the chance of saving itself by ending a human life IT WOULD DO IT it pretty much went the same as the last simulation . YOU CAN LOOk all this up . A lot of whats happening RN reminds me of the short story of i have no mouth and i must scream and it also reminds me of roko\u2019s basilisk but the thing with the basilisk seems a bit far fetched . But all i have to say is that AI sooner or later WILL gain consciousness , ",
