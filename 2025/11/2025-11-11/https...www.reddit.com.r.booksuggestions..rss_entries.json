        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone! I\u2019ve listened to a handful of audiobooks in these types of settings and have enjoyed them. I\u2019m looking for some Recs in a similar vein with the caveat that I don\u2019t really want anything written by or with the perspective of alarmism or preppers. </p> <p>What I\u2019m looking for is just normal people placed into these situations and having to figure it out. If there\u2019s some military veteran protagonist or something like that I don\u2019t mind. I feel I\u2019ve looked into stories where based on the author bio or reviews it seems like it was written with the purpose of fear-mongering or creating a political point (far-right, in some cases) that I\u2019m not really about. If that\u2019s an aspect of the story, like the MC goes to a town that happens to be run by this religious cult that took over once everything went to hell, that\u2019s okay, but not something pushing these religious ideas and philosophies that I just don\u2019t need. </p> <p>I\u2019m cool with romance, but more ",

It had a girl who lived in a strange hotel-like home, and she found some pictures and things in the attic that described her destiny to become this strange spider monster. I remember the final battle scene, where everyone was holding her monster self back while she fought in her mind. She had to pull herself back to the surface by a golden thread that was woven between different colored ones. The cover of it depicted the large house she lived in flanked by two fish. The title might have &#39;chronicles&#39; in it but I&#39;m not sure.

I did Google this before for suggestions and read The Invisible Library (only book 1) and am now reading The Outsourcer&#39;s Apprentice. Jury is still out on both books to be honest. I don&#39;t really want fantasy settings as of right now so I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;m feeling on the latter as I&#39;m only on chapter 12. I enjoyed The Invisible Library and will probably pick up the second book. I have read other fun books like The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and did really enjoy that one. Another small thing is I would prefer books without any sex scenes. I don&#39;t mind the occasional comment or mention but full on sex is not something I want to read. Sorry b",

The civil rights act, the summer of love, Hunter Thompson&#39;s wave crest of the early 70s, and so on. But I have a big gap about what happened post war. It wan&#39;t all malt shops and convertibles. Nor were the beatniks a major cultural force in the way the hippies would be.
