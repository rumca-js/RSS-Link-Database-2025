The pollution and frustrations of travel were too much for me to take. However, I had been told that the North East of India was completely different. Therefore, I headed up towards mysterious Assam to see for myself how life was progressing there. This journey reminded me once again that India is a polluted country, but filled with the nicest and funniest people who will go out of their way to help you. Jai Bhole Ki!\nI was joined on this trip by @BackpackerBen ,who will be releasing his own video series from India, so please check them out. Trust me, you'll find them funny!",
