Some questions I have:</p> <ul> <li>What features are most useful in a niche search engine?</li> <li>How would you expect results and filtering to work?</li> <li>Any ideas for improving the overall user experience?</li> </ul> <p>I can share a link to a simple demo in the comments for anyone interested.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepy-Ad7844\"> /u/Creepy-Ad7844 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1ouav7f/would_a_search_engine_like_this_be_useful/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1ouav7f/would_a_search_engine_like_this_be_usefu",
