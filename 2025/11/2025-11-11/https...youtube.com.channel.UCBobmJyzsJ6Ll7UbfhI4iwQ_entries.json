Watch Dimension Studio reveal how to take a filmmaker-first approach to producing animated films. \n\nPresented by Raoul Cacciamani, the session details Dimension\u2019s unique approach to animating in Unreal Engine and how it removes the barriers seen in more traditional linear animation processes. \n\nThrough practical examples, Raoul explores how the studio\u2019s real-time workflows hugely reduce long review processes and enable filmmakers to \u2018fail faster\u2019 by empowering them to experiment much more than in a traditional animation workflow. \n\nYou\u2019ll find out how Dimension is using its real-time animation workflow on several projects, most notably on the development of its latest original IP animated feature \u2018Gone, Bananas\u2019.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#Animation, #Key",
