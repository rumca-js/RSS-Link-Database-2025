Now, working with AI means using it as an intelligent partner that helps you do your job better automating repetitive tasks, offering insights, and amplifying your creativity. But working for AI happens when it starts to dictate your actions, limit your autonomy, or take over decision-making processes that should involve human judgment. It\u2019s essential to create clear boundaries being transparent about AI\u2019s capabilities, giving workers control over how AI is used, and ensuring that AI remains a tool rather than a boss. When does AI stop being a helpful assistant and start becoming a control mechanism? How do we maintain human oversight and creativity in this evolving landscape?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Forward-Skirt-5710\"> /u/Forward-Skirt-5710 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Ar",

Today&#39;s paper is titled &quot;RAG-targeted Adversarial Attack on LLM-based Threat Detection and Mitigation Framework&quot; by Seif Ikbarieh, Kshitiz Aryal, and Maanak Gupta.</p> <p>This paper investigates the vulnerabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-based intrusion detection and mitigation systems in the context of the rapidly growing Internet of Things (IoT). As IoT devices proliferate, they introduce significant security challenges, and leveraging AI for threat detection has become crucial. However, the authors highlight that integrating LLMs into cybersecurity frameworks may inadvertently increase their attack surface, introducing new forms of adversarial risks such as data poisoning and prompt injection",

What I said was China has very good AI technology. They have many AI researchers, in fact 50% of the world\u2019s AI researchers are in China. And they develop very good AI technology. In fact, the most popular AI models in the world today, open-source models, are from China. So, they are moving very, very fast. The United States has to continue to move incredibly fast. And otherwise, otherwise \u2013 the world is very competitive, so we have to run fast.\u201d </p> <h1>Nvidia #China #ai #United States</h1> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/000HMY\"> /u/000HMY </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1otvlhr/50_worlds_ai_researchers_in_china/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligen",
