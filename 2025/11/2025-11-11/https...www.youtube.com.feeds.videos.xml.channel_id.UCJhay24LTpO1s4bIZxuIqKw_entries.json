A NEW C Compiler for ANY platform - Liam Wilson - ACCU York\n---\n\nIn this talk, Liam Wilson presents cjsawk, a groundbreaking self-hosted compiler that operates on a unique dialect simultaneously valid in C, JavaScript, and AWK. By leveraging this multi-language subset, cjsawk enables developers to ship a C compiler in source form that can be built across multiple platforms, including Linux, Node.js, web browsers, and AWK interpreters. \n\ncjsawk addresses the common challenge of inconsistent C compiler availability on different systems. Even if a traditional C compiler is installed, there\u2019s no guarantee of reproducible builds across machines. With cjsawk, the compiler itself is a cross-platform, self-hosted solution that can rebuild itself bit-identically, ensuring reliable and deterministic compilation.\n\nThis talk covers the implementation details of cjsawk, including its recursive descent parser, tokenizer, macro a",
