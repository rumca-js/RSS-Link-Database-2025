Renewed optimism around US crypto regulation and signs of whale accumulation have bolstered market sentiment. Ethereum traded slightly lower at $3,580 (roughly Rs. 3.1 lakh), while altcoins showed mixed movement. Analysts say improving liquidity and investor confidence could sustain Bitcoin\u2019s base through mid-November.",
