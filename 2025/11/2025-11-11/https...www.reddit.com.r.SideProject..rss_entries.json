The idea came from my own battle with overanalyzing everything and realising reflection, when guided properly, can actually build resilience instead of anxiety.</p> <p>So far, we\u2019ve had:</p> <ul> <li>7,400+ impressions on the App Store</li> <li>148 downloads</li> <li>First few paid users (a total of $18 in proceeds - small, but the first time strangers paid for something I built)</li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s surreal seeing real people download something that existed only as an idea a few months ago.</p> <p>Next goal: improve onboarding + retention and hit 500 installs.</p> <p>If anyone\u2019s gone through the early stage of turning small traction into consistent growth, I\u2019d love to hear what worked for you.</p> <p>If you want to see it: [<a hr",

So it will be a chrome extension and it will say you if someone hasn\u2019t replied to you or you didn\u2019t reply someone in timespans like 1 day 3 day or 1 week. It will basically remind you. Would you personally use it? What could be better? Would you use it if it wasn\u2019t free after checking like 20 or more emails and how much would you actually pay for it? Or is there one that already exists? I couldn\u2019t find one and the one that I found was complexer than what my idea is.

This one stood out to me the most, given the fundamental way people want to interact with the internet has changed since the rise of LLMs (for me certainly, I just want the answer, instantly, I don&#39;t want to read through reams of text). </p></li> </ol> <p>So I built Patter, to help B2B websites convert more visitors automatically. It\u2019s a no-code AI chatbot builder that answers product questions, qualifies leads, and books meetings 24/7. It integrates with tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, Meta and Google, and teams are already seeing up to 30% more conversions through their websites.</p> <p>Interested to know if the above stats ring true for anyone else, and how ",
