        "description": "In this conversation, Cristiano opens up about Qualcomm\u2019s evolution beyond smartphones. From building AI-powered PCs with multi-day battery life to partnering with Meta on the Ray-Ban smart glasses that merge the digital and physical world. He breaks down why mobile and PC are converging into a single computing ecosystem, how gaming will be transformed by AI, and why the next wave of connected devices will emerge from markets like India, not Silicon Valley.\n\nCristiano also shares Qualcomm\u2019s next big bet: disrupting the data center with energy-efficient AI inference chips, and bringing intelligence to cars, glasses, and everything in between. From autonomous driving and AI copilots to redefining how humans interact with technology, this is a rare look into the mind of the man rearchitecting the future of computing.\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:15 - Gaming Evolution & AI Integration\n07:07 - Meta Ray-Ban & Smart Glasses Future\n12:34 - Data Center Plans & AI Inference\n14:54 - Connected Cars &",
