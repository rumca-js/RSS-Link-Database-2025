Whether you're building from scratch, renovating, or just moving in, a little bit of work on lighting, security, and energy management can go a long way.

And if you pick the wrong first gadget or tie yourself down to the wrong ecosystem, you might be in trouble.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/vergecast\">this episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>, David finds himself in precisely this situation.

Even in its very first public debut in 2010, the iPad was mostly just an iPhone with a larger screen, and Apple CEO Steve Jobs believed that was enough. Remember the way Jobs sat down on an easy chair to read his iPad, scrolling and panning his way through <em>The New York Times</em>'<em> </em>website? He was certain that the way you looked at the larger screen, the way you held it, the way you touched it, would all change your relationship with your device. All because it was bigger.</p>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When the iPad Pro came along five years later - it went on sale <a href=\"https",
