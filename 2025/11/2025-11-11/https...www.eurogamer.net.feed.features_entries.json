(Hence Sony naming it 'State of Play Japan'.) This makes it perfect for any RPG fans out there and, having written that, I really hope there's at least one RPG or else I'm going to look a little bit silly&hellip;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-november-2025-everything-announced\">Read more</a></p>",

Dispatch is enjoying a real moment in the sun. This is the superhero workplace comedy made by a bunch of former Telltale devs that's being released in retro-cool episodic instalments each week. The series ends this week - Wednesday is the big finale - but Dispatch can already be considered a success. It's sold more than 1 million copies and amassed more than 22,000 Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam, which is a response usually reserved for the top-performing games.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-is-brilliant-which-is-great-news-for-critical-role-fans\">Read more</a></p>",

How in this high-stakes PvP environment people are coming together and helping each other out rather than shooting each other in the face and / or body. The reason why remains a mystery: why are Arc Raiders players so keen to lend a helping hand, and so frustrated when others decide to shoot them for their own benefit?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist\">Read more</a></p>",
