That\u2019s especially the case if you\u2019re enjoying your media with friends or family. The problem is that laptop speakers just often don\u2019t have great sound; they can sound muffled, tinny, and/or lack audio fidelity. What you need instead is a good pair of PC speakers to get the best sound from your media files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, you don\u2019t need to buy a complete 7.1 surround sound system to feel satisfied. For less than $100, you can find some affordable PC speakers that provide quality audio. It\u2019s true that at this price point you will need to make a few compromises, but the best budget computer speakers can still offer a quality listening experience while saving you money, and that\u2019s what we call a win-win.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block-product",
