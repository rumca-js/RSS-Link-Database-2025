So I did a lot of research and I discovered a project named SheLLM.

I&#39;ve added Discord alerts, customized the logging, added scripts to retrieve the true IP of &quot;attackers&quot; and so on... </p> <p>I know some of you were interested in this kind of setup, so I&#39;ve documented everything on GitHub.

I am relatively early career (graduated less than 6 years ago).

I\u2019m currently studying Cybersecurity for my bachelor\u2019s. This just became a new major and has some small issues. I\u2019m overall not doing great right now academically and don\u2019t know if I need a change. I was looking at the 2 Year College near me and they offer Cybersecurity Digital Forensics AAS, Which is what I want to pursue. I know that AAS\u2019s don\u2019t contribute to being able to get a 4 year diploma though. My credits that I have already earned would be able to fully transfer over into that program leaving me with less than a year left of school. I am also currently studying Network+ and A+ and hope to secure my certs soon. I\u2019m just looking for any options, suggestions or advice to help me. Thank you so much! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Plastic-Tart-8262\"> /u/Plastic-Tart-8262 </a> <br/> <span><a href",

I\u2019ve been working in security operations and engineering roles for a few years and plan to pursue OSCP and BSCP certifications in the next couple of years.</p> <p>I don\u2019t currently have a bachelor\u2019s degree, but I have the option to enroll in a BTech in Forensic Investigation: Digital Forensics &amp; Cybersecurity, which I could complete in 2 years while working. The tuition can be covered by my employer, but I\u2019d have to sign a contract to stay with the company for 2 years if I go this route.</p> <p>My main goal is to advance my career, earn more, and reach reputable positions in cybersecurity. Given my experience and certifications, do I <em>really</em> need a bachelor\u2019s degree, or would it make more sense to continue focu",
