The result of all that R&amp;D? A\ncrossbody sock. It\u2019s as if someone raided a warehouse of iPod\nSocks, stretched them out and fashioned them up.</p>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwVymejFMpw\">Steve Jobs introduced the originals</a>, he called them a\n\u201crevolutionary new product for iPod \u2026 socks\u201d. Clearly enjoying\nhimself, he joked that case makers were making more money than\nApple did on the iPod, and so Apple thought it\u2019d offer something\ntoo. \u201cAnd our design team came up with socks,\u201d he said.

For example, I rely on audio software from <a href=\"https://www.rogueamoeba.com/\">Rogue Amoeba</a> for recording both The Talk Show and Dithering, but <a href=\"https://www.rogueamoeba.com/support/knowledgebase/?showArticle=Troubleshooting-MacOS-26-Tahoe\">there were bugs in MacOS 26.0.0 and 26.0.1</a> that could have resulted in lost audio. Those bugs have been fixed as of MacOS 26.1, so I\u2019ve upgraded the Mac I use for podcasting. But I only did that over this weekend. But my main MacBook Pro is still running MacOS 15 Sequoia\u2009\u2014\u2009not because of any compatibility issues, but simply because I think the Tahoe user interface is goofy looking. I\u2019ll probably bite the bullet and upgrade when 26.2 comes out next month, but for now, I\u2019m luxuriating with a MacOS UI with <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/07/tahoes-terrib",
