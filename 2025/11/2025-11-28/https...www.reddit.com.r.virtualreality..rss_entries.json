Pretty much what i wanted in my new vr headset lens. I am a big oled guy... Might be worth it for $1250. Comfort not as good as quest 3 with 3rd party strap but not terrible for me. $1250 is not cheap but a laptop, tv, phone price. It can do those tasks just not as good and an isolated experience.</p> <p>I am contemplating buy the galaxy xr for $1250 before tax or $1349 after tax (30% off but this might be the price of this headset in a few month like how samsung always discount products &amp; I didn&#39;t include the $250 price of the controllers which make it $1500 before tax).
