Luckily with this song I was having so much fun with it that it came through pretty easily.</p> <p>For me, my motives are using music to heal, the sweet dopamine promise of stage time, as well as creating commitments to the people I care about (and fulfilling them).</p> <p>If you&#39;re out here producing I would love to hear what keeps y&#39;all going!
