        "description": "In this episode, Sarah and Anthony unpack one of the most surprising political moments of the year - when New York\u2019s incoming mayor Zohran Mamdani met Donald Trump in the Oval Office. After weeks of insulting each other during the mayoral campaign, Republicans and Democrats are still reacting to what turned out to be a very amicable and friendly meeting.\n\nTrump has promised to help Mamdani make New York City a success, and \u201cgreat again\u201d, but what does this actually mean, and will the US president do it? We also look at how Mamdani will be navigating the wider politics of being a mayor, particularly with midterm elections in 2026. In New York state, can Mamdani persuade his Democratic governor to put up taxes for the wealthiest? And how will he balance maintaining good relations with both Trump and Demoratic socialists in New York?\n\nMeanwhile, with Trump\u2019s ally Elise Stefanik running for governor, how will the Republican campaign deal with the president\u2019s new attitude towards Mamdani?\n",
