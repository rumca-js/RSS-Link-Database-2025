And during that vacancy... a bunch of spiders decided to make my backyard bunker their home.  Should we evict the invaders? Or should we burn it all with fire? \n\nToday we are going to connect my rainwater collection system to the bunker. That way - I can use my 3,000 gallons of stored rain water to water our garden, or survive an apocalypse. Whichever comes first. \n\nWatch the Complete Backyard Bunker series HERE: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0vZL9uwyfOE6Of8qi5dtIFgdSt1hlOZm\n\n0:00 - The Invasion\n0:50 - Rolling in the Tanks\n3:11 - LARQ Water Filtration Bottle\n4:36 - Down in the Trenches \n5:33 - Venturing Into their LAIR\n7:54 - Building the Manifold\n9:29 - LET IT RAIN \n11:27 - Taste Test",
