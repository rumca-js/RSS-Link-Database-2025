        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone, We are building something big: Unicoder, an Al-powered IDE that is redefining how developers write and understand code. Our goal is to build the future of coding. Unicoder integrates multiple advanced LLMs and offers an intelligent development experience where Al does not just suggest code; it understands your project, collaborates with you, and helps you build faster. What Unicoder does: Auto-completes and explains code intelligently. Helps debug and refactor entire files using natural language. Understands context across multiple files, not just one Allows Al-driven file creation, documentation, and code reviews. Integrates seamlessly with your workflow, making it feel like having an Al teammate beside you We have already completed about 70 percent of the development, and now we are looking for frontend and backend developers to help bring Unicoder to its full potential. We are still in the early phase, so instead of salaries right now",

But mostly I want to hear if you resonate with what I call :the API knowledge problem.</p> <p>If you work with APIs, you know this situation:</p> <p>You start with your API requests in Postman or Insomnia. Then someone creates documentation in Notion or Confluence.</p> <p>The context and discussions happen in Slack, Teams or in Jira tickets. Examples get thrown into README files.</p> <p>And the actual code lives in Git, disconnected from the above....</p> <p>So all the API knowledge ends up scattered across:</p> <p>*Postman/Insomnia/another client for requests</p> <p>*Notion/Confluence for docs Slack/Jira etc. for context and discussions</p> <p>*README files for examples</p> <p>*Git for code (but not for API metadata)</p> <p>Thats all great until something changes (and it always does).</p> <p>A parameter is renamed, an endpoint is updated, or a field is adde",
