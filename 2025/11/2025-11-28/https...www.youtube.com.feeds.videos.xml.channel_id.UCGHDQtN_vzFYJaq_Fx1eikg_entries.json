        "description": "The British are very serious about Paddington Bear - not even members of the armed forces are shown mercy when it comes to Paddington.\n\n\n\"Paddington Bear is among the most popular characters in children's literature. The actor Stephen Fry, who narrated Paddington audiobooks, stated \"Michael Bond's bear is a Great British icon with his charm, humour, spirit of adventure and generosity\". Devan Coggan writing for Entertainment Weekly saw a similarity between Paddington and Winnie-the-Pooh, referring to them as two \"extremely polite British bears without pants\", adding that \"both bears share a philosophy of kindness and integrity\".\nThe New York Times praised the original book A Bear Called Paddington (1958). Similarly, The Horn Book Guide, a bimonthly magazine dedicated to reviewing children's literature, praised the short story Paddington Helps Out (1960). Both articles emphasise the welcoming Brown family and how the book captures Paddington's adventurous, charming, and funny attitude. ",
