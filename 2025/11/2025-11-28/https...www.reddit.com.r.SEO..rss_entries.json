Additionally, tracking lead generation or sales conversions gives insight into the effectiveness of our SEO strategies.

The website ranked first has a domain authority of 92, while the second one has a domain authority of about 27.</p> <p>My question is: if I start a blog targeting the same keyword tomorrow, is it possible for me to rank first? If yes, how long would it take? Also, how can I increase my domain authority?</p> <p>Please help me with these questions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HourInvite8888\"> /u/HourInvite8888 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1p8r696/need_help/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/1p8r696/need_help/\">[comments]</a></span>",
