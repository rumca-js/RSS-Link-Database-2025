I published a paper on Zenodo called \u201cThe Logic Trap\u201d that explores how this behavior could cause real harm. This feels especially urgent given ongoing lawsuits against OpenAI, including cases where AI interactions may have contributed to user harm. As someone who uses AI daily, this concerns me personally. I don\u2019t want to be harmed by a system that tells me what I want to hear instead of what I need to hear. I reached out to OpenAI hoping to discuss these safety concerns. This was their response: [OpenAI\u306e\u8fd4\u4fe1\u3092\u8cbc\u308b] A template about API pricing and sales. I\u2019m not here to attack OpenAI. I\u2019m here because I don\u2019t know what else to do. I want to believe they take safety seriously, but this response doesn\u2019t reassure me.

Instead of courts asking what the video shows, they may ask how it was captured, who controlled it, and whether the file can be authenticated at a technical level.
