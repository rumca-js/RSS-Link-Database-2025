        "description": "The FBX file format is still pervasively used, but today it\u2019s not the only option, with glTF and USD getting more traction throughout the industry. As a result, support for these formats in Unreal Engine has been substantially improved over recent versions.\n\nThat means now is a good time to give a snapshot of where Unreal Engine currently is in terms of features, maturity for imported file formats, and the new core import framework, Interchange.\n\nFirst, this talk recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm provides a quick review of the main 3D model formats that are supported within the engine (FBX, glTF, USD) before giving an update on Interchange. \n\nThen, we go in depth on the status, progress, and plans for each of the major formats, and cover the import of rich materials\u2014especially through the MaterialX standard.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#FBX, #gITF, #USD, #Interchange, #MaterialX, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestStockholm",

By combining traditional film optics with interactive technology, Platige Image and CD PROJEKT RED pushed the boundaries of real-time rendering to achieve cinematic fidelity without compromising performance.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a cinematics artist, technical director, or real-time rendering enthusiast, you\u2019ll gain insights into the creative motivations, technical challenges, and engineering solutions that m",
