That's according to Sudan Doctors Network.  Survivors described door-to-door killings of unarmed civilians, sexual violence, and summary executions. Thousands however made it to safety- many to neighbouring Chad. Among them is 16-year-old Munzil Nasruddin, who recounts how he escaped the violence.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\n Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n#Sudan #AlFasher #RSF #SudanWar #SudanConflict #Darfur #SudanCrisis #Chad #SudanRefugees #MassKillings #HumanRights #WarCrimes #SudanNews #AlJazeeraEnglish",
