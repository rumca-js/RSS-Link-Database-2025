These products are also compatible with a huge number of <em>other</em> smart home ecosystems. Cas\u00e9ta and Cas\u00e9ta Diva dimmers, switches, and other devices work with everything from Apple\u2019s HomeKit to Sonos multi-room audio systems. That makes it easy to overlook the fact that they\u2019re not Matter certified (this despite Lutron\u2019s having a seat on Connectivity Standards Alliance\u2019s board of directors).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We rarely see Cas\u00e9ta and Cas\u00e9ta Diva products go on sale, but Amazon has knocked 15- to 20 percent off a passel of dimmers and starter kits that include Lutron\u2019s Smart Hub. You\u2019ll find both the OG Cas\u00e9ta and the newer-style Cas\u00e9ta Diva form factors here. Homeowners who already have the required Cas\u00e9ta Smart Hub will find some add-on deals as well.</p>\n\n\n",

I love it so much that I\u2019ve sat down every year since 2016 to write up my findings\u2014and over the last nine years, I combo-chained well enough to help others save hundreds on their 1080p and 1440p builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y\u2019all.

You can still find good deals\u2014but getting them to coalesce into a single computer will be extremely hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For select gamers, hope still is out there for now. I think these results paint a clear picture of where we\u2019re at and what we can expect for 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquo",
