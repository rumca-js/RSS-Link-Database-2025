        "description": "As American shoppers buy less packaged foods, Big Food has leaned on a familiar excuse: It\u2019s the economy, stupid. True, inflation has forced some families to trade down to cheaper store brands, and stagnant wages have squeezed household budgets.\n\nThat explanation misses a crucial shift: middle- and high-income Americans are still splurging, just not on legacy labels. Their dollars are flowing to niche names with more cultural cachet, from fancy new protein bars to chewier candy.\n\n#Goodles #Chomp #WSJ",
