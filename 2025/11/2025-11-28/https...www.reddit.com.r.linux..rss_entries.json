It&#39;s original OS is Windows Vista and features 2gb of memory, a 160GB HDD, and the normal Intel Celeron processor. It says it&#39;s rated for 2.2 GHZ, which from my knowledge is better than most devices that run Windows 7, although my knowledge goes as far as Bringus Studios and LTT, plus some of my own screwing around. It&#39;s dead, and I&#39;m getting these specs from a little sticker on the interior of the laptop. So I need a charger. I know I can just Google them, but online stores, even Amazon, can be iffy so if anyone has a link to one to help lessen my digging that&#39;d be appreciated. Thank you, and if you&#39;re interested in seeing where this goes, because it&#39;ll go somewhere, then I might make more posts. Okay, bye!</p> <p>(Edit: The OS needs to be 64 bit, because I want the newest stuff, or as new as I can get.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",
