Games often take time to grow on us, especially ones with lengthy narratives. \n\nBut there are some lengthy games out there that establish all of its finest qualities right in the first hour of gameplay. Whether it\u2019s a cinematic opener, a clever gameplay tutorial, or a bold narrative swing that defines everything that follows.",

        "description": "Netmarble Neo said this is separate from Solo Leveling: Arise. This one costs $40, which might as well be a king's ransom for what's on offer. However, they're otherwise the same game. The same combat, the same presentation issues, the same characters \u2013 it even has the same Destiny-style hub.\n\nRegardless of whether you enjoy the flashy combat or witnessing certain scenes fully animated, Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive is just too repetitive, soulless and grindy to really warrant much of your appreciation.",
