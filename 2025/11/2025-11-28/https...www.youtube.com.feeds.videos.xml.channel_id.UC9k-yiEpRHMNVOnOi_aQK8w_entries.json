        "description": "Just in time for the holidays, two dogs left for dead and several other lucky pups get a new start at life thanks to pilots volunteering their time. After being discovered, Butter and Scotch were taken to the Chesterfield County Animal Services in South Carolina. The organization reached out to Pilots to the Rescue for help, and the non-profit volunteered to fly and drive to pick them and 38 other animals up so they wouldn't be euthanized.
