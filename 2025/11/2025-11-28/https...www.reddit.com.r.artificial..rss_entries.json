I found this sub while researching which AI might be best for helping me think through ideas and provide insights into my writing, so I&#39;m sorry if this question has been asked recently. I don\u2019t know that much about all the different models available and it\u2019s hard for me to choose which one might be best for me when there seems to be many options. </p> <p>What, in your opinion, is the best AI for someone looking for a collaborative research AI &quot;partner&quot; to bounce ideas off of? I do not use AI to write, but will sometimes ask ChatGPT for insight into essay drafts or journal entries that feel like they&#39;re developing a still-premature idea. I appreciate AI&#39;s ability to discern themes, patterns, subtext, and layers of meaning I can&#39;t notice on my own, and to suggest different directions I could take with each idea. I like to ask it to suggest other articles/essays written on similar topics.</p> <p>I don&#39;t trust ChatGP",

As AI systems replace both physical and cognitive labor, companies are economically incentivized to automate at the fastest possible pace. In our current capitalist framework, firms that retain human workers for moral reasons will be outcompeted by those that prioritize efficiency, accelerating widespread job displacement. At the same time, national economic growth is becoming heavily dependent on a small number of AI and semiconductor giants\u2014such as NVIDIA and the major cloud providers\u2014concentrating wealth and influence in ways that weaken broader economic participation. This creates a feedback loop where economic power translates into political influence, shaping regulation and public policy around the interests of the AI sector rather than the public.
