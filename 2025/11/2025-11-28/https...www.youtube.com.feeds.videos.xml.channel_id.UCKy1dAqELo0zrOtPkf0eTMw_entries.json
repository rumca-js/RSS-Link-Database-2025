See what makes this animal loving scrappy fighter from Madagascar so interesting in this early look and starter guide going over her stances, best moves, punishes, and more. As always thanks to Bandai Namco for this opportunity and especially to esports manager Alex Julio for walking me through the character.",

With time, and its mod browser, I sincerely hope PMR can be fashioned into something that can fill the void left by the long-delisted Project CARS 2, but it's an entirely mediocre single-player racing experience for now. It may have positioned itself as the heir to the Project CARS 2 kingdom, but it is simply not a better racer than its 2017 ancestor.\"",
