The thing is that if I can&#39;t manage it(the IP reputation, Google delivaribility, etc) it will cost me at most a few bucks in the &quot;rent&quot; and and maybe a few more for a new domain if I manage to get on a denylist(not sure if that is done for whole domains).</p> <p>With that out of the way let&#39;s get to the question itself.

No complex guides for optimizations? No constant nagware to load up mail, calendar, etc stacks? </p> <p>I know the lone dev has had some drama in the past, but this is great. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/con_work\"> /u/con_work </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1p906eb/just_picked_up_filerun_after_running_nextcloud/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1p906eb/just_picked_up_filerun_after_running_nextcloud/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The address bar/UI takes up valuable screen space. 2. They don&#39;t always auto-launch reliably after a device reboot. 3. Keeping the screen &quot;Always On&quot; often requires extra apps or hacks.</p> <p>I looked at existing &quot;Kiosk&quot; solutions, but many were either paid subscriptions, overly complex, or required cloud accounts.
