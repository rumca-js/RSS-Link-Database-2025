This western is set in the 1850s, a gritty era of cattle rustlers, blood vendettas and murders with pitchforks. In rural Oregon, the brutal Van Ness family are threatening smallholders as they expand their territory. Will the locals join forces to protect their homesteads? Lena Headey stars as sad-eyed Irish emigre Fiona Nolan, a woman who cannot bear children but has gathered a band of orphans around her. Looming menacingly over her is Constance Van Ness (Gillian Anderson), an amusingly one-note villain. Pure hokum but it rattles along entertainingly",

We have always relied on communication to do this. And thousands of years before we had written language, and possibly before even complex spoken language, we used pictures.</p><p>This makes sense: as children, we learn to read facial expressions, body language and images long before we learn to read words.

If constellations were humanity\u2019s first attempt to understand the universe, then they were also our first illustrated stories. Humans are and have always been a story-driven species, and we tell these stories in myriad ways.</p> <",
