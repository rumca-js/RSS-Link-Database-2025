I use EndeavourOS on Hyprland. My framework desktop is mainboard-only, and I use a Corsair 450w SFX psu. It has 37A to the 32A on 12v Framework recommends. I also use a pretty chonky fan (Silent Wings 4 Pro). </p> <p>Through a lot of observation, I found out in which exact scenario it happens, and it&#39;s as follows:</p> <hr/> <h4>When it happens:</h4> <p>SPECIFICALLY, when I play a game that has some sort of scene where there are a lot of very quick FPS dips due to CPU processing, it may crash on one of these dips!

If I want to use FSR4 in a game, do I need to set <code>PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE=1</code> as a launch option even for games that already have native FSR4 support (like Borderlands 4, Monster Hunter Wilds, etc.)? Or is this only needed for older titles without built-in FSR4?</li> <li>Where can I find an official list or documentation of Proton environment variables and launch commands? I only know a few of them. Most games work fine without any tweaks, but for some titles I need specific launch options, and I only see people mentioning them on ProtonDB. Is there a proper source where all commands are documented and explained?</li> </ol> <p>I\u2019ve been using CachyOS for a few months now and I\u2019m very happy with it overall, but this part with the Proton commands is still confusing to me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href",

I\u2019m deciding between a couple of distributions, including Nobara, Bazzite, and Cachyos. I use my PC daily for Steam gaming, emulators (Switch, PS2, PS3, etc.), hosting LAN parties using Zerotier, and streaming with OBS. I\u2019m also learning to use Godot. My GPU is an AMD 6700XT and my CPU is an AMD Ryzen 5 5500. My question is whether this operating system will meet my current needs and how easy it is to use for someone who has never used Linux. If you have any recommendations for other distros that I didn&#39;t mention, I&#39;d gladly accept them. Thank you very much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Like_a_Dodo\"> /u/Like_a_Dodo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1p8knem/help_me_choose_new_os/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comment",
