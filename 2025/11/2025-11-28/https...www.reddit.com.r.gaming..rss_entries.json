I was playing it and she wanted to watch but we ended up playing for a while and spotting things together. She got hooked so we kept playing until we finished the story.

Any games where you start with very little and have to gather resources and craft to build your house/base/settlement. However I dont really want it to be super complicated. I&#39;ve tried to play Stellaris, but all the menus and everything, it gets super complicated and I dont really know what I&#39;m doing. Also something that&#39;s a little bit forgiving, at least in the beginning. Ive tried Don&#39;t starve as well, but I always struggle so much in the beginning because I feel like I&#39;m just trying to survive each day and can&#39;t get ahead to be able to expand anything. </p> <p>Any suggestions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hattie29\"> /u/hattie29 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1p8zvmb/looking_for_new_game_to_play/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a h",
