The robots, arriving in December, feature autonomous battery-swapping for extended operation. The US$37 million contract reflects Beijing\u2019s ambition to dominate global robotics and AI. The trial complements China\u2019s broader push to introduce robots into public services, from police patrol units to pollution-monitoring machines.",
