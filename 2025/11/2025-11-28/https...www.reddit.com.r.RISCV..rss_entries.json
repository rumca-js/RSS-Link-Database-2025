As in do the board peripherals like USB, GPU etc as well as features like hardware video decode/encode work well? 2) The GPU (Imagination BXE-4-32) - Does it have any problems and is the driver good? (this question stems from the fact that Imagination&#39;s GPU drivers for its other GPUs like the BXE-8-256 found on androids are not great) 3) Can I use the board purely headlessly in general (I can get an hdmi and monitor for just the initial setup but then on I would want it to be headless mostly for me to use it over ssh ",

Boot time was long (almost 160s) so i decided to make some spring cleanup and maybe slim down image a little. I&#39;ve started with dist-upgrade which hung on installing linux-firmware. I thought that it&#39;s fairly big compressed archive so IO will suffer as well as overall load. I left it running, having all the time control over UART.</p> <p>The next morning i noticed lack of progress, &quot;ethernet&quot; link broken, so naturally i&#39;ve pushed RESET. And nothing. I&#39;ve burnt other image onto \u00b5SD - opensuse but at this point MQ was dead already.</p> <p>Earlier without SD card MQ booted to FEL mode - now even this m",
