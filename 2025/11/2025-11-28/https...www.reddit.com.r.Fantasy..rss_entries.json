When an author puts real effort into a harvest night or moon festival, with specific food, little games, weird traditions, I start feeling this tiny ache like I actually want to be there. Meanwhile in real life I just think about travel schedules and who is going to argue about the dessert. Some series do this so well that the holiday almost becomes a character. In my head I can smell the street food, feel the cold air, hear that one slightly cursed song everyone is sick of but still sings. It makes the world feel lived in and also strangely comforting. I catch myself planning what I would wear or which stall I would visit first, like I am a background extra in that story. I am curious if anyone else feels this. Are there specific fantasy festivals or in world holidays that live rent free in your brain and feel more cozy than the actual events ",

Super quiet, nothing touristy, just old stone houses and a forest that looked like it was hiding stories older than anyone around. There was an old man who sat near the edge of the forest every day. Nobody knew his name, they just called him &quot;the keeper&quot;. He never talked, just carved weird wooden symbols. They didn&#39;t look like runes from fantasy books, more like something older and more instinctive, like shapes you&#39;d find scratched inside caves.<br/> One morning I woke up earlier than usual and saw him standing at our door.

I memorised maps, knew every minor character, wrote terrible fanfic in a school notebook. At some point in my twenties I decided I had outgrown it. The prose felt clunky, some tropes annoyed me and I moved on to darker, more complex books. If someone mentioned that series I would roll my eyes and say it was important for me once but now I was into more serious fantasy.</p> <p>Last month I picked up the first book again just to skim a scene for nostalgia and ended up reading half of it in two days. It is not magically better written than before. The flaws are still there. What changed was the way I read it. I no longer expect it to be everything at once. It does not need to be grim or clever or perfectly progressive. It just needs to be what it is good at. Cozy travel scenes. Over the top speeches. A magic system that makes no real sense but feels fun on the page.",

I\u2019ve been playing a lot of Mage: The Ascension lately thanks to my partner, and it\u2019s really got me in the mood for some wizard-centric storytelling. I\u2019m looking for some new titles to scratch that itch, if possible. I\u2019d like the book/series to have:</p> <ul> <li>A mage protagonist/deuteragonist or at least have mages be relevant to the plot.</li> <li>A well-crafted magic systems and thought-out worldbuilding.</li> <li>I prefer my fantasy to be on the more serious and grim side of things, but \u201cgrimdark\u201d is not a requirement as long as I can avoid anything too whimsical.</li> </ul> <p>I\u2019ve read quite a few series already. I\u2019m familiar with all of Bakker\u2019s work, and characters like Achamian are what made me join my partner\u2019s Mage game to begin with. Any suggestions are appreciated!

Dangerous not in terms of power but being strategical and patient. </p> <p>Then I realized this was pretty similar hell the exact thing to one of my favorite indie works : <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">The Echoes Saga</span> and because I was dumb to read the blurbs for the next books : <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Lands of the Firstborn</span></p> <p>Are there any series like that?
