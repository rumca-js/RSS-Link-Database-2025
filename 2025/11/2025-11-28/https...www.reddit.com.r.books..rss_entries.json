It is not a sad moment. It is just a small truth that hits you in a quiet way.</p> <p>I felt this in The Alchemist when the book talked about people who stop listening to their own heart because life gets heavy. It felt simple but real.</p> <p>I felt it again in The Kite Runner when a small moment showed how guilt can stay with you even when you try to move forward. It was not loud. It was just honest.</p> <p>These moments stay with you because they feel like someone finally said a thought you could not put into words.</p> <p>I think every reader has one moment like this.
