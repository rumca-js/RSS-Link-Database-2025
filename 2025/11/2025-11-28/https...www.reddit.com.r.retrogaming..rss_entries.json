There&#39;s a fan translation available so it can be played via emulation. I don&#39;t understand why this was never released outside of Japan because it&#39;s actually pretty enjoyable. The dialogue reminds me of the 1994 Spider-Man animated series. Another bonus if played via emulation - there&#39;s a cheat code available that will allow you to turn the stage time limits off. The time limit is actually the biggest flaw of the game, in my opinion, because it forces you to rush through stages and makes some boss fights almost impossible. I&#39;ve played this game several times already and I&#39;m in the mood of a bit of 16-bit web-swinging this weekend.</p> <p>What about you guys?

How much did it cost to rent consoles/games at Blockbuster?</p> <p>I grew up in the 90s, and one of my core memories is going to Blockbuster with my parents. The moment we walked in, I\u2019d bolt straight to the video game section. I\u2019d stare at the Game Boys, Pok\u00e9mon games, N64s, all those beautiful consoles and cartridges behind the glass.</p> <p>But\u2026 my parents never rented me one. They\u2019d always say it was \u201ctoo expensive\u201d or that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t work on our TV\u201d (liars, obviously).</p> <p>Now I\u2019m curious: how much did it actually cost to rent a console or video game back then?</p> <p>D",
