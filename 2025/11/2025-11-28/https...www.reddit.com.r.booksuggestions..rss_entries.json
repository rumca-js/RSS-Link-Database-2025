He also declared he won\u2019t read anymore books written by women because they are \u201ctoo gossipy.\u201d He said this in a room filled with his four daughters and numerous granddaughters. We want to prank him by getting him books by female authors that aren\u2019t obviously female (so either gender neutral names or initials). Obviously, he could figure it out if he reads the \u201cAbout the Author\u201d section but we doubt he will do that. He enjoys non-fiction, especially American history, as well as thrillers like the books by Robert Ludlum. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cornflower_Bumblebee\"> /u/Cornflower_Bumblebee </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p99joe/female_authors_with_gender_neutral_names/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comment",

Now I&#39;m quite a bit older and want to find books geared toward adults with similar elements. Ideally these books would be sci-fi/fantasy, but that&#39;s not a hard requirement. </p> <p>The most important thing is the level of detail the book goes into about survival. If the main character is hunting, I want to see how they capture and kill the animal, how they clean it, how they cook it and/or store excess meat, how they use the bones and hide...

The pages weren&#39;t full of of text but rather spread out like a poem and each page kind of ended in a way where I could put the book down whenever I needed too. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions similar to this book, and yes I looked into the author but that book was the only one she wrote in this style, to my knowledge at least.

He\u2019s always read age appropriate stuff and in the last year or two he has wanted to read darker stuff and is leaving behind the total ninja cat and Roald Dahl style books. He\u2019s read sine the age of 10/11: Harry Potter books Darren Shan (all of the age appropriate books) Animorphs Dragon ball z manga Dragon ball super manga </p> <p>Does anyone have any recommendations for anything else he can read? Preferably available on kindle. Does anyone know if the everworld series is appropriate? I only read animorphs as a child so I don\u2019t know what the other series is like.

Apollo had a crush on her, he offered her the gift of foresight, i.e. seeing the future. She liked the gift, she was fascinated, but she rejected Apollo&#39;s love, and that made him angry. He therefore cursed her: she still got the gift, but nobody would believe her. Later she foresaw Troy being sieged and destroyed by the Greeks, she tried to warn the city, but of course, nobody listens, and her prophecy did come to pass. I&#39;d really love to read a book or watch a movie with this theme, just replace Cassandra with a conspiracy theorist/truth teller/whistle blower and throw in a bit of romance, pairing the Cassandra with a love interest who does heed the warning. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Resident-West-5213\"> ",
