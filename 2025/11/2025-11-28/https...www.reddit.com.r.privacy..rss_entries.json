That fingerprint is stable enough that they could track individual phones even when MAC address randomization was on.</p> <p>In their real world tests, 40 to 47 percent of devices in public spaces were uniquely identifiable. They even demoed following a volunteer\u2019s phone as they moved in and out of their home, using hardware that costs under 200 USD.</p> <p>They also note that on some Apple devices, turning off Bluetooth from the quick settings does not actually stop all beacons. The only sure way to go fully dark is to power the phone off.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",
