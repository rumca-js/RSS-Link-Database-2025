When I realized that exceptions are capable of reducing binaries sizes, it felt like the only thing standing in the way of its adoption was its performance concerns. I couldn't let it go. I wanted to see how far the algorithm could be pushed. In 2024, I set out to just that: making C++ exceptions blazingly fast for embedded platforms. A year later, I've achieved a +90% performance improvement for ARM microcontrollers. \n \nThis talk takes you behind the scenes of this journey. I'll share the complete roadmap\u2014from initial benchmarking to optimization\u2014revealing techniques applicable to any performance-critical C++ system. But this isn't just a technical story; it's a testament to the power of community collaboration and how the C++ community summoned this talk. Even if you've sworn off exceptions forever, this talk still delivers value. It's a course in perform",
