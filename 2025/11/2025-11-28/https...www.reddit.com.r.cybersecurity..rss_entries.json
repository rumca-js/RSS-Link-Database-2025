For those with experience in Red Team infrastructure or offensive DevOps, what tools and skills should I realistically prioritize, what\u2019s commonly used in real-world engagements versus nice-to-have, and what learning resources (labs, courses, documentation, or projects) would you recommend for getting hands-on practice?

It\u2019s not perfect, but it helps me spot the security issues and misconfigurations early so I can focus my manual effort where it actually matters.</p> <p>Lately, I\u2019ve also been trying out ZeroThreat. ai alongside my usual tools. I wasn\u2019t expecting much at first, but it\u2019s been pretty solid in terms of giving me a cleaner baseline.
