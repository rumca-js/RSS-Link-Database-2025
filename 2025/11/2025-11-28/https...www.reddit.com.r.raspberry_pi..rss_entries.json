He loves tech and STEM and already codes in C#/Unity. From my research, I want a starter kit that includes sensors and GPIO expansion so he can experiment with electronics and small projects. I don\u2019t have much experience with Raspberry Pi myself. So I\u2019m hoping others can share which kits worked best for kids his age, and what the first projects looked like.
