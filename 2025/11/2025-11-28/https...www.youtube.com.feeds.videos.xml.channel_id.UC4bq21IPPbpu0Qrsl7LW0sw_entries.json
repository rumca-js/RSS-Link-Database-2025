Amazon and Microsoft are racing to build their own mega sites too.\n\nAnd even the biggest chip deals aren\u2019t guaranteed: Nvidia says the rumored $100B partnership with OpenAI is far from confirmed.\n\n\ud83d\udc49Hear the full breakdown on The Slidebean Stand-Up; streaming now on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and all major podcast platforms.",
