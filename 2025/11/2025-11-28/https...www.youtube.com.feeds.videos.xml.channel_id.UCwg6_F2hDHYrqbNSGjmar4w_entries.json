Long-legged, flame-colored, and always alone but never lonely, it looks the part of a dog from hell. It looks like a fox, walks like a deer, and, of course, howls like a\u2026 banshee from your worst nightmare. This isn't the furry version of slenderman, it's a very real canid. This is the maned wolf.\n\nCheck out our friends at\nOn\u00e7afari: https://www.instagram.com/oncafari/\nEndangered Wolf Center: endangeredwolfcenter.org / https://www.youtube.com/@EndangeredWolfCenter\nSmithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conse",
