Kirk looks at himself as boring, unattractive, and not worthy of being loved because he&#39;s been bullied and broken down to that point. He doesn&#39;t realize that Molly knows he has faults but she wants him anyway. </p> <p>This movie and movies released around this time like Celeste and Jesse Forever are the comedies I re",

He just let&#39;s the bully destroy their lives by being themselves. If you haven&#39;t seen it yet, I highly recommend it.
