        "description": "A new poll reveals that nearly half of Britons believe illegal migration exceeds legal, despite data showing only seven percent enter the UK through irregular routes. \nThis widespread misconception highlights the influence of sensationalist language and imagery in shaping public opinion on migration. \nIn Cumbria, concerns over irregular migration persist, even as overall numbers decline and arrivals by small boats comprise just two percent of the total. \nExperts argue that the gap between perception and reality demands clearer government communication about migration trends. \nMisleading narratives, propelled by certain media outlets, have led to divisive rhetoric and policy decisions. As fears grow across the UK, addressing these distortions becomes increasingly critical\u2014not just for informed debate, but for the nation\u2019s political and social stability. \n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Charlie Angela reports from Cumbria, in northwest England.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow ",
