At the same time, early Galaxy S27 Ultra details indicate Samsung has cancelled plans to adopt a larger 1/1.1-inch 200-megapixel sensor, reportedly due to cost concerns, and will continue using a 1/1.3-inch unit. This contrasts with Sony and OmniVision\u2019s newly launched 200-megapixel sensors, which are set to appear in upcoming flagship phones from Chinese brands.",
