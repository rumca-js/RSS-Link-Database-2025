As far as I am aware, this is the first game ever released (at least in the last 10 years) that will prevent you from even changing your resolution if it detects certain things about your PC it doesn&#39;t like. Thus, I want to use W32dasm or hex editing to disable the VRAM check, which is perfectly legal to do and has nothing to do with piracy.</p> <p>No matter how I frame this to chat GPT, it insists it cannot help me. I&#39;m tired of this nanny bullshit. I&#39;m canceling my open AI pro account. I just can&#39;t take the nannying anymore. Chat GPT wants to behave like it&#39;s your mother and not an AI assistant.
