Turns out the movie wasn&#39;t really about this, well a tiny bit of it is, but the movie is very much a political thriller of extremes and how America becomes enraptured by a Far-Right movement called the Change, initiated by a widely successful book written by the Phoebe Dynevor book. </p> <p>While the film does start as a family thriller where Lane&#39;s matriarch clearly resents Dynevor&#39;s character for being a fascist loon, the movie then grows from that as the world becomes a Handmaid&#39;s Tale kind of place.

And of course there are times where if the source material has multiple installments anyway, that makes sense (Harry Potter, Hunger Games, etc). However, some films are just lightning in a bottle, and expansion just seems... off. Straight away, two examples spring to my mind: </p> <p><strong>Die Hard</strong>. Sure, Die Harder, Vengeance and Live Free or Die Hard are good, but there&#39;s no topping the first one. </p> <p><strong>Home Alone</strong>. I might get some flak for this, but Home Alone as a franchise just goes off the rails. A second one that is a beat-for-beat clone of the first, the third one introduces a kid with NO connection to the MacCalisters, and the fourth just repeats the first again by pretending an entirely different kid is Kevin?

Jingle All The Way is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies and I always thought Jake Lloyd was excellent in it. My family has watched that movie every Christmas season since it released. Of course the pairing of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad is amazing, and there absolutely should have been more movies with them paired together. And Phil Hartman as the slimy Ted was inspired casting. </p> <p>Let\u2019s show some love to Jake Lloyd! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/joyfuljake2\"> /u/joyfuljake2 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p87xa2/jingle_all_the_way/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p87xa2/jingle_all_the_way/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I get a similar feeling from The Accidental Tourist and Lost in Translation. It\u2019s not as good as it those, but it satisfies a desire I\u2019m looking for. </p> <p>I love the characters and find their relationships very real. I guess it helps that it takes place in hotels, airports, and bars: all interstitial places, to tell a story about a man living an interstitial existence. </p> <p>Clooney, Farmiga, and Kendrick are so perfectly cast. I just enjoy watching them interact.</p> <p>I hadn\u2019t thought about this movie for quite awhile but this rewatch was so enjoyable. I really like Juno and Young Adult, too, but that\u2019s it for this director.
