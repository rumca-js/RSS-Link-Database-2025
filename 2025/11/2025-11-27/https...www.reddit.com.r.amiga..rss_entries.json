CLICK zero it goes.</p> <p>You have been warned: you will from now on notice, that almost each time a new note/sample is started, there will be a nice little click. Most noteably if you do not use percussion. Clickedyclickclickclick, all over the place.

Maybe a cave. Not continued scrolling. \u2022 Main character casts spells / shoots magic. \u2022 When firing the spell, a whispered voice sample plays, sounding like \u201cshodhya\u201d (or something close). Definitely digitized speech, not chip audio. \u2022 Felt like a European-developed title. \u2022 Fantasy-themed.</p> <p>Not these: Lionheart, Risky Woods, Wiz \u2019n\u2019 Liz, Flink, Magic Pockets, Spellbound Dizzy.</p> <p>Any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd_Stock2075\"> /u/Odd_Stock2075 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1p8bdzk/what_was_that_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/amig",
