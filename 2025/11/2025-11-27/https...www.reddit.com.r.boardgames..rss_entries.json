The box was only &quot;sealed&quot; by two circular plastic tapes on the sides. </p> <p>I didn&#39;t think too much about it, so I just opened the box.

I asked them with anticipation to pick their favorite heroes and I would have them some decks ready for the day of the session. I personally enjoyed it a lot it and they seemed to have a great time themselves, but as someone that also plays the game solo I perfectly knew that the game gets exponentially longer per each new head involved.</p> <p>What I want to know is how have been your experiences with coop LCGs / ECGs and which ones do you feel that feel better with higher number of players. I love sharing my games and I enjoyed our 4 player sessions of Marvel Champions, but I want to know more about games and your anecdotes.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"",
