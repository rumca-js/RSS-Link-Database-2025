        "description": "90s PCs really did have a fish inside them; a virtual pet called Mopyfish, created by HP in 1996. It wasn\u2019t just a cute desktop companion; it was a marketing tool designed to make you print more documents. Every time you used an HP Mopier to print multiple originals, you earned \u201cMopy points\u201d to buy plants, bubbles and upgrades for your fish.\n\nBy the year 2000, Mopyfish had been downloaded over ten million times, becoming the world\u2019s most popular cyberpet; all because HP wanted to sell more toner.\n\nIf you remember this little orange fish swimming across your Windows desktop, you were part of one of the 90s\u2019 strangest marketing campaigns.\n\n#retro #90scomputing #windows98 #mopyfish #nostalgianerd",
