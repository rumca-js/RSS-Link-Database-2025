Although I don&#39;t have mastery over these topics but I have mid-level understanding over all of them. Recently I have started Django and out of the box it&#39;s started to feel overwhelming. I don&#39;t know what my roadmap should be for django. (I have tried ai generated roadmap for django but it still feels overwhelming). Many of you guys maybe already work with django in the web development field i was hoping i could get some advice from you guys maybe a roadmap as well and also Am i the only one who is overwhelmed with django or is this a common phenomenon for beginners? Thanks in advance.</p> <p>Note: I didn&#39;t have any prior knowledge of programming before starting the journey. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ninzaxx\"> /u/Ninzaxx </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.",
