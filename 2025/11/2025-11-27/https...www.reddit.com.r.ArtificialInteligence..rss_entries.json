It considers AI as a <em>General Purpose Technology</em> (GPT) and argues we need to investigate the power concentration of Big Tech. AI capitalism is characterised by the commodification of data, data extraction and a concentration in hiring of AI talent and compute capacity. This is behind Big Tech\u2019s unstoppable drive for growth, which leads to monopolisation and enclosure under the <em>winner takes all</em> principle. If we consider AI as a GPT\u2014technologies that alter society\u2019s economic and social structures\u2014we need to come up with alternatives in terms of ownership and governance.

Feel free to discuss this and put your arguments.</p> <p>It will create demand for senior roles for sure, but not much plus increase the minimum requirement to get into software development. Senior roles will become the new junior roles. The barrier to entry will become very high. Also, AI won\u2019t create more jobs than it will take. Yes, it will create more administrative and supervisor jobs, AI engineer roles, etc., but they won\u2019t be enough to fill all the jobs it took.</p> <p>The software industry depended on labor work just like the construction industry. There was a lot of repetitive work that had to be done from scratch every time you built software from the ground up. So companies needed junior engineers. This is like the industrialization era for the IT industry, where repetitive work that gave employment to lots of people in factories is now being automated by machines.</p> <p>For example, in an IT company with 1",

My understanding of LLMs, which (let&#39;s be real) are currently the closest thing we have to ASI, is that a fundamental limit of LLMs is that they cannot really generalize or &quot;perform&quot; beyond the underlying dataset they were trained on. And since the dataset is made of human data, by definition, ASI is not possible then.</p> <p>Now, AI researchers still talk about ASI as a given. They all act as if it&#39;s guaranteed we will have ASI in the near future. But why? They undeniably know more than me, so I must be missing something. What am I missing? Surely, the thought process is not just drawing conclusions based on historical AI advancements and concluding we must achieve ASI based on historical trends. Is the hope in automated AI research? Is there proof that this works or can work?</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to understand where these",
