I was wondering if it&#39;s at all feasible to add private servers for games like wow, RuneScape, or Minecraft. It seems like it&#39;s possible but all the information I&#39;ve been able to find is from over a decade ago and was talking about the 02w. I was hoping to find more recent information. All the old forums I scanned said that a much more powerful pi would be needed and the pi 5 is, as far as I&#39;m aware, much more powerful. Have any of you tried this recently? If you did, how did it work out? I plan on only running the private servers on the pi and using the pis wifi the same as I would for iiab. The client would be run by the computer logging in on wifi. I know how to install the server files and I know, for the most part, what their requirements are. I just thought that more information about doing this has to have come out in the last 10 to",
