That's thanks in no small part to Sony and the DualSense controller it introduced alongside the PS5. \n\nWith a feature set that sets it apart from its competition, this versatile device has allowed many talented developers to add flourishes to their games that were otherwise out of reach. \n\nWe've come to look out for such titles, and put together a few of them for you to check out. Just be ready to charge up your controllers more often, as these ones are going to do a number on its battery.

As an unnamed member of the Coast Guard stranded on Fort Oasis after a storm, making your way through the mysterious island is going to have you white knuckled and anticipating a vicious attack from all directions thanks to its well designed levels and nasty enemies. \n\nIt's an experience that works, and works well thanks to intelligent decisions that make it click right from the get go.

Join us as we take a look at what clicks for this one, what doesn't, and help you decide if it's going to be worth your time and money.",
