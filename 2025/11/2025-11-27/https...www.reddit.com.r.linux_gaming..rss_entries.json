It has onboard memory, so I was able to program some common buttons I use before I made the switch, but I like being able to change them around. I know that I&#39;m not going to get per-profile mappings, and I&#39;m alright with that. Digging around, it seems very iffy on whether nor not any certain mouse is &#39;supported&#39;. I&#39;ve currently got the Corsair Scimitar Elite, and I&#39;ve poked around with ckb-next, but that particular mouse isn&#39;t supported yet. Does anybody have any experience with this and can recommend me a replacement mouse? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Kateywumpus\"> /u/Kateywumpus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1p8ddpi/recommended_gaming_mouse_with_multibutton_support/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span",
