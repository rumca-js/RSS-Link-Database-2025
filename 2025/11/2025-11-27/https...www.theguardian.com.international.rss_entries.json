You know where you are at a proper caff</p><p>Early some mornings, when I\u2019m working in London, I go for breakfast with two good friends. So that\u2019s me, a fabric dealer and a psychotherapist. Obviously this sounds like the beginning of a joke, but it\u2019s one for which, at the time of writing, I have no punchline. Soho\u2019s our hunting ground, the hunt in question being for somewhere to have breakfast at 7am. There\u2019s not much open at that time. I mean, it\u2019s not asking for much, is it? Somewhere to sit and eat at what is hardly a punishingly early hour.</p><p>Being gentlemen of a certain age, we also require access to a toilet, which narrows our options still further. What this leaves us with is the grand total of four establishments. Three are fancy restaurants; one isn\u2019t.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2025/nov/27/london-has-plenty-of-posh-breakfast-options-but-give-me-a-greasy-spoon-any",
