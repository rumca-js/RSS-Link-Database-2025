        "description": "We often visit historic sites to learn about the past, but what stories are we really being told? From Southern plantations to Nazi-era sites in Germany, learn from a historian about how remembrance can educate, distort, or erase. The way we present history isn\u2019t neutral: it shapes collective memory, justice, and our future. \n\nAlyssa Talley is a historian, entrepreneur, and avid traveler passionate about how societies remember the past. A recent Master of Arts graduate from the University of Victoria, her research explores memorialization and its evolving meaning across cultures. Through the UVIC I-witness Field School, she engaged in intercultural dialogues on history and remembrance in North America and Europe. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
