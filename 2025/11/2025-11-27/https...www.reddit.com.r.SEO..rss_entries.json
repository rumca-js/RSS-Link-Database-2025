So I work in digital marketing analytics at a junior level for an MNC which has given me the opportunity to crunch a lot numbers for seo, influencer marketing, sem, prg ads etc. </p> <p>However, I did not have a base in digital marketing (engineering grad). To rectify this and to build a portfolio in the process (particularly for seo) I have taken a corsera course and now I am planning to build a website.</p> <p>The website will be about social/geographic history of lesser known spirits across the world. It&#39;s a niche I feel I won&#39;t get bored researching and creating new content about, although I don&#39;t see a lot of traffic on trends for this. I also want to add a page documenting my seo journey aimed at recruiters+ any experiments I do with the site. I also want to get a social influencer element by posting about it in reddit/Twitter.</p> <p>Does this sound like a reasonable portfolio building strategy to demonstrate my seo knowledge",

Initially, all of them were indexed by Google. Then, one day, Google stopped indexing all 5000 pages. I suspect it&#39;s because I used AI to create the articles. Later, I deleted all 5000 pages, leaving only 200 manually created pages, and resubmitted a sitemap for those 200 pages.</p> <p>However, several months later, Google still hasn&#39;t indexed my website. What should I do?
