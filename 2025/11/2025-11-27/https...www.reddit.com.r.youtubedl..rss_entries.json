I was able to download 18 videos that I&#39;m trying to combine. The command runs and creates the file (446MBs, ~30mins) here comes the issue, when I try to play it, the video stops and is stuck at 20seconds. Below is the last bit of the log after about 500 lines of &quot;This may result in incorrect timestamp in the output file&quot; line in the file. I&#39;m sort of stuck and not sure what and where to check, any advice would be greatly appreciated!</p> <pre><code>[vost#0:0/copy @ 000001d83837de80] Non-monotonic DTS; previous: 3969132, current: 1573487; changing to 3969133.
