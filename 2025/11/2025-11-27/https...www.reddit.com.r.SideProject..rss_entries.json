So I built a landing page with a waitlist and shared it with a few personal friends. They shared with their network and 48h later, we had 2k+ waitlisted.

Something that gives you the stories you care about without feeling overwhelmed.</p> <p>In Showcase you choose the categories you love and your For You feed becomes a clean stream of quick stories and trends. The Following feed shows updates from the teams, public figures, athletes, and creators you care about, along with comments from the people you follow so the app feels social without turning messy. You can save stories, follow topics, build a simple profile, and listen to podcasts in the same place.</p> <p>This took countless nights of rebuilding and moments of doubt. Seeing it live today feels surreal. If you want to check it out or share any thoughts with me, I would really appreciate it.</p> <p><a href=\"",
