Everyone who signs up to my giveaway with @bellesaco wins something! https://www.shopbboutique.co/vibe/todayifoundout-yt #bbpartner\n\nThere you are. Sitting on your couch, watching a movie, when suddenly you decide you want popcorn. So you get up and cross the room to the kitchen. But the moment you cross the threshold between the two rooms: bam! you suddenly stop in your tracks. You glance about the kitchen in confusion like Gandalf in the Mines of Moria, unable to remember why you came here in the first place. Your mind is blank, wiped clean.
