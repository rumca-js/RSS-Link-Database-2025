I\u2019m honestly wondering if anyone is experimenting with a more visual approach, like automation that looks at the screen itself, understands what\u2019s there, and interacts with it the way a human would. Not computer vision from 2008, but something modern and usable.<br/> If there\u2019s an OSS project heading in that direction, would love to check it out or even contribute if possible :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EfficiencyWorking484\"> /u/EfficiencyWorking484 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1p8f9oh/is_anyone",
