Our mobile devices are in guest wifi and we are getting soc alerts that IP&#39;S from the guest wifi are scanning for open ports. When we try to investigate further from Cisco Controller we find the MAC Addreses but they are the randomised mac address not the phone mac (from default), so by blocking them the issue persists. Do you think it is a good idea to deploy a Guest Portal? Would it be better? My only concern is that the other colleagues from other departments will shout &quot; oh no i have to login every day&quot;. Have anyone else experienced issue like that? Also Guest Portal solved this problem?
