When I plugged it in it was formatted as ExFat and I ran a speed test using the Blackmagic Speed Test app. It was getting around 240MB/s that way and was practically silent. I think formatted it to APFS and suddenly the speed seemed to decrease (125MB/s) and it was far louder when accessing data/running any tests. Any idea why this may be? Is there a best way to have this formatted? The files I am backing up are mainly for cold storage. I&#39;m a videographer and photographer and this is all backed up storage of files, not the actual editing/working drives. That said, I&#39;d like it to be as optimal as possible.</p> <p>Related: I have an 18TB SanDisk G-Drive Professional and it is formatted as APFS. I am wondering if I&#39;ve made some sort of terrible mistake by doing that after seeing the Seagate performance as ExFat. The G-Drive takes a while to spin up and when it is accessing files the dr",

People cautioned me on my previous post regarding barracuda drives (not rated for 24/7 use).But i have a plan.</p> <p>My current plan is to have all the containers, OS and most used media on a 512 gb ssd and the pair of 4tb mirrored to hold all media files. As there is only me and 1 or 2 other people accessing it and only for a couple hours a day normally I plan to find a way to ensure these drives are &#39;still&#39; as much as possible to maximize life until I can upgrade to better ones. I have an additional external drive for an occasional backup.</p> <p>Now all in: hp 800 g4 16gb ram Intel i5 v8 ($150), 512gb ssd from dead (power port broken) seldom used gaming laptop (free lol), two 4 gb Barracuda drives (2x5",
