But you\u2019ll remember them, and you\u2019ll curse the enemy who cruelly took them from you. Well, either that or you\u2019ll reload an old save in a desperate act of defiance.</p><p>There are a variety of genres here, as permadeath has a way of seeping in where it\u2019s least expected, nipping at your ankles like a plague-ridden rodent. <a href=\"ht",
