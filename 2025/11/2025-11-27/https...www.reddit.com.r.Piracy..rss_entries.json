I usually use DDL but some content I want to download is very rarely and only can be found as torrent.</p> <p>So I never used torrent before because, well I live in Germany.</p> <p>But I want to give it a try and use it as secure as possible.</p> <p>So currently I have Proton VPN service (and real-debrid). My plan is to use a seedbox like Ultra.cc, download the torrents via Ultra.cc, and then use the VPN service to download the file from Ultra.cc.</p> <p>Is that secure?</p> <p>The torrents I want to downlaod are from a forum where you have to register - but the registration is, I think, always open. So not a private tracker. And according to the forum you have to seed, so real-debrid is not an option I think.</p> <p>Thank you :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
