        "description": "One of the most persistent visual giveaways in shows created using in-camera visual effects (ICVFX) is the softness of the background: often a direct result of resolution limits within current render cluster performance constraints. \n\nWith the integration of SMPTE 2110 and tiled inner frustum rendering in UE, we\u2019re finally reaching a breakthrough that directly addresses this challenge.\n\nIn this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, Julia Lou dives into the practical realities of deploying a SMPTE 2110-based render cluster for virtual production, breaking down the architecture, workflows and system design considerations needed to build something both scalable and flexible across different types of productions. \n\nShe also covers the content side\u2014what it takes to author scenes that truly benefit from this setup\u2014drawing from real-world production experience. Finally, there\u2019s a look ahead to what SMPTE 2110 unlocks for the future of ICVFX.\n\nBy the end of this talk, you\u2019ll understand t",

        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, we explore the use of Unreal Engine\u2019s Procedural Content Generation (PCG) framework at runtime in the The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine Tech Demo, first shown at the State of Unreal earlier this year at Unreal Fest Orlando.\n\nThe PCG framework can be used to generate game content dynamically while a game is running, enabling you to create environments on the fly, rather than only at the level design stage.\n\nWatch to discover how offline and runtime PCG were combined to populate a dense and detailed world for The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine Tech Demo.\n\nYou\u2019ll gain an understanding of the fundamental concepts and features in PCG that enable high performance runtime content generation, as well as the skills needed to diagnose issues with runtime setups and dial in setups.\n\nThis session takes a look at the differences between working with PCG in the Unreal Editor versus at runtime; explores how PCG runtime works; and dissects the grass system from T",
