He is a young adult (over 18) and doesn\u2019t read often unless he really gets hooked by a series. His favorites have been The Percy Jackson books (and basically everything else put out by Rick Riordan), The Ranger\u2019s Apprentice Series, and most recently The Witcher series. He loves all the Assassin\u2019s Creed games. I don\u2019t think he would be interested in reading big, thick, long-running series like Wheel of Time or Malazan. So based on that, I think I am looking for books with male protagonists that are action-packed and not too hard to get into or to read.

Not just a backdrop, but something breathing, ancient, almost aware of the people moving through it. The first time I felt that was reading *The Lies of Locke Lamora*. Camorr wasn\u2019t just a city, it was a mood. I could almost smell the canals and the rotting wooden docks. Recently I picked up *The Bone Ships* by RJ Barker and got that same sense again. The sea there isn\u2019t friendly or passive, it feels like it\u2019s watching, waiting. Every wave seems to remember something. That kind of atmosphere makes me fall in love with fantasy all over again. What are some books where the world feels truly alive to you?

I used to love feeling completely lost in how the magic worked. Gandalf shows up, does something wild with a few words in a language I cant pronounce, and then walks away again. I did not know the cost, the rules, the exact limits. I just accepted that he could do some things but not others. Somewhere along the way I started wanting charts. Now I see myself judging a book because the magic system is &quot;not logical enough&quot; or the author didnt list clear constraints. And honestly I am not sure this is making me happier as a reader.</p> <p>A lot of newer fantasy leans hard into the &quot;hard magic&quot; side. Which can be great, I love Sanderson, Mage Errant, all the crunchy stuff where the magic feels like engineering. But sometimes I catch myself reading a scene that is basically a physics lecture with extra glowing runes. The characters stop w",

What I almost never see is a setting where magic is widely available and relatively safe, but large groups of people refuse to use it for cultural, religious or just stubborn personal reasons. Not because of some prophecy, not because it instantly turns you evil, just because they genuinely think it is cheating or wrong or kind of tacky.</p> <p>I would love to read about a city where you can pay a mage to heal your broken arm in ten minutes, yet there is a whole neighborhood that insists on &quot;honest injuries&quot; and regular medicine.

I think City of Brass started a bit slow for me but once we got introduced to the Qahtani family and when Nahri arrived in Daevabad it really picked up for me. </p> <p>A particularly unforgettable scene was in one of the last few chapters in the City of Brass where Alizayd and Ghassan have a long chat before his father tells Ali he\u2019s exiled, knowing it would like result in his death. I think that conversation really teased out each of their characters so well, especially Ghassan\u2019s, and as a reader it felt like such a treat.

I recently read through the Prydain series, and although I found the first book a bit juvenile, I was pleasantly surprised to see the writing gradually get excellent toward the end of the series. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking for my next read, and I&#39;d really like something a bit more grounded and deep, something with a lot of world-building.
