And I am somewhat fine with it. I Just don&#39;t want to have Videos of me somewhere being used for whatever. So I suggested maybe we could host the system ourselves.

Now as I understood if I want to Hook them Up with Frigate they need to support RTSP. Which apparently no solar/battery powered Cameras Support because it would drain too fast.

A normal cache (e.g., Lancache) doesn&#39;t make sense for me here, since I&#39;m the only Steam user in my household and therefore don&#39;t want to download the games and updates twice. Furthermore, the SSD wouldn&#39;t have enough storage space to cache entire games. Therefore, I had the idea of using it only as an update cache.</p> <p>The idea is that my server checks all the games in my Steam library for new updates at night and downloads them. Then, the next day when I start my PC, they are automatically transferred to my PC via LAN. </p> <p>Are there any common solutions for this purpose, or has anyone here already gotten something similar working?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LordiVoldmordi\"> /u/LordiVoldmordi </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
