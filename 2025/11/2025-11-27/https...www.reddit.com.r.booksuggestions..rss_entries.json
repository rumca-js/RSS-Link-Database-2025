On Bookgrammer or Booktok, books with white, heterosexual characters are usually promoted, although with the K-pop and anime boom, more books with Chinese, Korean, Japanese, or Indian characters are appearing. There are also more books with Black protagonists.</p> <p>However, I&#39;ve seen few books with representation from other Asian or Arab countries. I&#39;m intrigued by how they are represented in romance, considering the significant cultural differences with the West, especially regarding religion. This inherently influences how men and women, or people from the LGBTQ+ community, relate to each other.</p> <p>I speak Spanish, so my closest way of accessing these books is through English. Therefore, I prefer books available on Kindle. I&#39;m open to both heterosexual and LGBTQ+ romances!</p> <p>Thank you so much for reading and replying!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Adventurous_Pin_622",

Yet when people ask where they can find books centered on elves most of the few answers they get are &quot;this background race looks like elves&quot; or &quot;there is an elven character with a few lines at the end of this book&quot;.</p> <p>I feel people overexagerate the presence of elves in fantasy books. We get tons of werewolves, vampires and other creatures but when it comes to elves nothing, hell there isn&#39;t even a trilogy or a collection of books centered on them.

I\u2019m not a romance reader, but I love sci-fi, so I thought it would be a fun read. I thought this would be a bit more plot-driven with some smutty parts, but it\u2019s kind of the opposite. I think it\u2019s just not for me, but I would love this kind of quick/pulpy/corny space adventure or alien abduction without so much explicit sex (and maybe more cozy/tame/optimistic\u2014there was a rape scene almost immediately in the book that I found really difficult).

I just finished a book called Behind the Screen: The Silent Battle with Online Gambling, and I honestly didn\u2019t expect it to hit me the way it did.

If you\u2019re into books that explore mental health, addiction, relationship strain, or the whole \u201cquiet battles people fight behind closed doors,\u201d this one really sticks with you.</p> <p>Figured I\u2019d recommend it since I hadn\u2019t heard of it before and it deserves way more attention.

Also read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius last month, it&#39;s quite funny he was literally the most powerful man in the world and he was having mundane problems we all face. Since the book is basically a personal journal it gave me the impression that there was a mind behind it trying so hard to make sense of everything happening to him and he in fact did not have all the answers to his problems figured it out.</p> <p>I thoroughly enjoyed both books and was looking for a suggestion not necessarily aligned with these two but preferrably something that is a tad positive and not so much melancholic like russian literature.

I react pretty dramatically to tragic endings so I\u2019ve been avoiding this movie like crazy. But, especially with the state of my life rn, I finally caved and watched it. Wonderful movie, and in my case, quite relatable but the tragic love hit me like a truck, so now I need something similar but happier. If there\u2019s any books out there, with a western, cowboy type concept and queer with a happy ending, I\u2019d be grateful for a rec!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zaika_ii\"> /u/zaika_ii </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p7o668/book_recs_like_brokeback_mountain/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p7o668/book_recs_like_brokeback_mountain/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Because I went to the publishers webpage through Reddit, it\u2019s not in my browsing history. Although I kept Amazon open, my wife sent me a bunch of links to Holiday lawn decorations that overwrote it, and I can\u2019t seem to find the book in my \u201ckeep browsing for\u201c section. Rufus, Amazon\u2018s useless AI, is useless and of absolutely no help.</p> <p>What I remember is that the book is about a witch and a female demon who have a conflict across the centuries. </p> <p>I asked Rufus to find me books with that description, and it ",
