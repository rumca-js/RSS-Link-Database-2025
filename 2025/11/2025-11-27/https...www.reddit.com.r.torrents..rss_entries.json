        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve finished setting up my k8s torrent with the Prowlarr and I&#39;m wondering how I can improve my setup without adding redundancy to the downloaded files. The biggest problem I see is that the downloads are organized automatically since there are some that I&#39;ve to start manually (mostly books), so I can&#39;t use something in the folder like the Picard to organize all the musics I&#39;ve downloaded without cherry picking the downloaded files to another folder.</p> <p>That said, I could totally write a script to copy all the files based on the file type, but that would basically occupy double of the space that I really need... One solution for that could be symlinking everything, but that can cause other problems like in the Picard case where he would apply the changes to the original file and not the link...</p> <p>How would you approach that problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ele",
