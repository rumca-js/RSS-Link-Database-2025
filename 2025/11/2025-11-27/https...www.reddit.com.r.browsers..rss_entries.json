Some privacy-focused browsers (and guides) suggest spoofing or faking your timezone and screen size to \u201cconfuse\u201d trackers. But I recently learned that doing this might actually make you more trackable rather than less. The logic is that if your timezone or screen size is unusual or \u201cweird,\u201d your browser becomes more unique compared to millions of \u201cnormal\u201d users. Since fingerprinting relies on uniqueness, being an outlier could make you easier to track. So, is it better to: Spoof these values to random or uncommon ones, or Stick with \u201cnormal\u201d and common values to blend in with the crowd? Some privacy browsers (like Tor Browser and Firefox with RFP) seem to take a different approach - either normalizing values across all users (everyone has the same fingerprint) or using very comm",
