However, I\u2019m usually too lazy to keep track of them since searching up the definition and writing them down is time consuming and ruins the flow of the book. So, I was wondering if there\u2019s an app where I can just type the word up and it would immediately define the word and save it in a folder for me so that I can review it later.</p> <p>Or if anyone else has any other ways of keeping track of the vocab please let me know! It\u2019s always a shame to think about how many words I let slide because I was too lazy to write time down. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Professional-Lab-274\"> /u/Professional-Lab-274 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1p0840c/looking_for_an_app_to_keep_track_of_the_vocab_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/",
