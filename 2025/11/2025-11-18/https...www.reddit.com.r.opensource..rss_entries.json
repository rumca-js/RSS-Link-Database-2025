It lets you handle things like templating, loops, conditions, data loading, reusable components, and nested forms \u2014 all without a build step or heavy JavaScript setup. I originally built it to simplify my own workflow for small apps and prototypes, but I figured others who prefer lightweight or no-build approaches might find it useful too. It runs entirely in the browser using native ES modules and custom elements, so there\u2019s no bundler or complex tooling involved. If you enjoy working close to the browser or like experimenting with minimalistic web development, you might find it interesting. Just sharing in case it helps someone or sparks ideas. Cheers!

His drive and motivation is something I have never seen out of anyone I know and it is so inspiring to watch. As his wife (and someone with no computer science background), I am reaching out to this forum to see if anyone would be interested in joining this project. While I don\u2019t know anything about compsci, I am fairly familiar with this software as I have been with him from the creation of this project. It is on GitHub, OpenMarch.com, and has a pretty loyal discord sever. Again, I\u2019m not asking on his behalf, but rather to see if anyone would be interested in investing some time on this (especially compsci musicians!) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/olellsworol7\"> /u/olellsworo",
