But what if awkwardness isn\u2019t a flaw to fix but a window into how we live together? \n\nSean\u2019s guest today is Alexandra Plakias, associate professor of philosophy at Hamilton College and author of Awkwardness: A Theory. They talk about why awkwardness isn\u2019t a personal problem but a social one, how power and privilege shape who gets to be awkward, and why our fear of discomfort often keeps us from saying what really matters.\n\nThis episode originally aired in November of 2024.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: Alexandra Plakias, associate professor of philosophy and author of Awkwardness: A Theory\n\n0:00 Intro\n11:59 It's okay to be uncertain\n14:07 What is the difference between awkward and cringey?\n19:46 What are the most common awkward experiences?\n22:40 Awkwardness and self-deprication\n28:04 What is the role of small talk?\n31:02 Social life rea",

In recent decades, Friendsgiving has emerged as the go-to choice as an additional event or complete alternative to Thanksgiving. \n\nIt can be tough during the holidays with the pressures of trying to get everything just right to present yourself as a well-adjusted adult hosting a Thanksgiving dinner, or to be present with family that may think they know what\u2019s  best for you. Friendsgiving has opened the door to do things a little bit differently. The intention is to have a laid-back, low-pressure (or over-the-top, totally up to the host) potluck-style dinner with friends and other people in your chosen community \u2014 because as cheesy as it sounds, friends are the new family. \n\nFriendsgiving was seemingly plucked from obscurity in the 2010s.
