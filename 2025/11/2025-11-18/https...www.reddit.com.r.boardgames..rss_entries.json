And older cards, especially the starting decks, are seeing some good wear on them.<br/> It&#39;s starting to break some mechanics, like being able to see whether there is a new villain on top of the villain deck (so it cant be a twist or strike) or when revealing cards from the top of your deck where you can sometimes clearly see which set the card is from.</p> <p>To cover up the cards I would need opaque sleeves. But bulk purchases all seem to be transparent. </p> <p>I would need 950 sleeves for the base game+dark city+GotG and buying packs of 100 would be nearly as expensive as just buying a new copy of the game..</p> <p>Are there any good bulk purchases for opaque sleeves?<br/> Iam in Europe, so please only European sellers.</p",

The more I play it, the more I enjoy the differences. 1303 feels like a streamlined redesign with a cleaner flow and a faster pace. The nine round structure gives the whole game a sense of urgency that I really like and the way the characters change things from one play to another keeps it fresh. The Provost is still a bit of a troublemaker and adds a nice layer of interaction without turning the game into something chaotic.</p> <p>It definitely has a lighter feel compared to the original, but it still delivers that satisfying worker placement tension. I didn\u2019t expect to enjoy it this much and now I\u2019m actually excited to finish the insert so I can get both versions to the tab",

I noticed on BGG that Gaia Project is rated better at 2 players than Terra Mystica or age of innovation, but as far as theme goes, we\u2019re both a lot happier with fantasy than sci-fi. I know theme doesn\u2019t matter to a lot of people, but I was just curious about what makes Gaia Project better at 2 players?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mrtofer\"> /u/mrtofer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ozxryk/gaia_project_vs_terra_mystica/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ozxryk/gaia_project_vs_terra_mystica/\">[comments]</a></span>",
