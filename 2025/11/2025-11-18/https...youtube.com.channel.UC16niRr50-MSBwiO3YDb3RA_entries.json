This comes as some analysts expressed fear that stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom bubble burst of the late 1990s.\n\nThey also discussed the environmental cost of powering AI, the potential risks to jobs and whether the UK will benefit from the current boom. BBC economics editor Faisal Islam joins Adam in the studio.\n\nYou can listen to a longer version of the interview with Sundar Pichai here - https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0mh56kj\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews #Google #AI",

The reforms have received tentative support from the opposition but will likely face resistance closer to home, with a number of Labour MPs publicly criticising them.\n\nAdam and Chris break down the politics and director of the Migration Observatory Madeleine Sumption joins Adam to dive deep into the white paper.\n\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.
