My main question is, are the next two books worth a read RIGHT after this one or would it be prudent to leave them for later on?</p> <p>I ask this mainly because I think that this book wrote everything terrifically and tied it up into such a neat little bow. It\u2019s not what I assume to be typical fantasy, in that it has an overall plot or leaves you with a giant question at the end of the first book. I\u2019m not saying this in a disparaging way, again, I loved the book but I have almost no desire to continue with the series anytime soon as not much if anything, besides two points, one minor and one character related were not wrapped up. It\u2019s not left me simply NEEDING to discover what happens but entirely content with what I just read and how good it was.</",

As per the title - I&#39;m seeking reccomendations for books where people have special abilities or powers. But instead of battles of good Vs evil, superheroes, wars etc. I would like stories where the people are just living ordinary lives. Maybe they sometimes use their power for heroics/good of others. But, mostly they would be using them to perhaps make their lives easier/more convenient e.g. we&#39;ve all wanted telekinesis to get that out-of-reach remote control </p> <p>It&#39;s not as compelling, as perhaps a high-stakes plot! However, it would be great to read something where powers/abilities are really thought out and baked into the world building of the book. Where other uses for special abilities are considered the world feels more real in my mind.</p> <p>If this isn&#39;t the right space to post - please let me know.

I have some minor gripes, as with all books..but overall just super enjoyable. I think this books offers so many things that would appeal to a broader audience than most fantasy.</p> <p>If I had to rate this book I would give it a 9.5. If I were rating the series as a whole I would give it a 9. </p> <p>For anyone curious the audio experience was great I loved the narrators. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/StratonOakmonte\"> /u/StratonOakmonte </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1p0jkcg/just_finished_empire_of_the_dawn_the_3rd_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1p0jkcg/just_finished_empire_of_the_dawn_the_3rd_and/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Inclusion of something is separate from being in support of that thing, and it\u2019s wild to me that a lot of people aren\u2019t willing to let that concept exist in fantasy. Just because a character is bad (and really bad in Jorg\u2019s case) doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be well written and intriguing.

There are a number of books on my TBR that I&#39;m unsure I&#39;ll enjoy but I&#39;m hesitant to get rid of books I haven&#39;t tried as it could be a nice surprise.

My usual criteria for an enjoyable read is good prose, slow pacing and character driven books. Usually don&#39;t enjoy books that are plot driven and action heavy.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Basically what the title says. I love works of fantasy featuring a tight-knit group of adventurers all questing together. The group functions as a sort of &quot;found family,&quot; and while they may not be warm towards each other at first, as the plot goes on they become close. Also lots of camping and inn visits are a must. Some examples I&#39;ve liked over the years have been the Fellowship of the Ring, Taran and his friends in the Prydain Chronicles, the twins from Land of Stories, Team Avatar from ATLA, and the group from the 2022 Willow TV series (I&#39;m obsessed with this show and I don&#39;t care what anyone says about it). I also don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s YA or even for kids, I just want more of this kind of story.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Massive-Range-9280\"> /u/Massive-Range-9280 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1p03ohe/looking_for_some_good_b",
