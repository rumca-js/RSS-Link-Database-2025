But Valve already has a living room gaming station! It\u2019s called the Steam Deck and all you need is a dock\u2014you know, just like a Nintendo Switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love my Steam Deck, but I\u2019d never hooked it up to my TV before\u2026 so I bought a dock, gave it a go, and learned a lot. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty easy to turn a Steam Deck into a living room game console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how to do it yourself and what you need to know before you do. There are some definite \u201cgotchas\u201d you need to watch out for!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-listicle-chart\"><div class=\"wp-block-listicle-chart-item listicle-chart-item\">",
