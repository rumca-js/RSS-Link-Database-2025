I&#39;ve known about the Hays code which was enforced from the early thirties to the late sixties and I know that media was a lot more risqu\u00e9 before the Code.</p> <p>However I&#39;m just finding out that the hays code was self imposed and not government imposed. Breaking the code wasn&#39;t illegal but the movie would basically be blacklisted. I also just learned there were a few popular movies that ignored the code like Some Like It Hot and Psycho.</p> <p>What are some successful movies from the time period that ignored the code?</p> <p>(Also, I&#39;m kind of fascinated by how the hays code affected not just Hollywood movies but the general zeitgeist.)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/General_Stranger2633\"> /u/General_Stranger2633 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/",

Her love towards her mother and brother was pure and real. Ivana Baquero did a fantastic job. Her expressions were so spot-on and she captured Ofelia&#39;s emotions in a raw way. The rest of the characters were just as remarkable, I loved Faun&#39;s mysterious personality and the actor&#39;s gestures and body language really brought life to the character (not to mention the amazing makeup and prosthetics).
