I mainly want a book with war and military but still having politics, sort of like game of thrones. I\u2019m fine with fantasy (magic, dragons, etc) or it only being set in another world with no magic etc. I\u2019d also like some romance but it definitely isn\u2019t a requirement. And I\u2018m only 17 and I\u2019m not a freak so please keep spice to a minimum for recommendations.

Personally, i imagine it on that classic american-high-school (college) background. I know this idea is very old, but i would like to read a little comeback of it. also, i usually see it in movies, i haven&#39;t read any books with this thrope.</p> <p>To specify it a bit, I&#39;d really love it if they had a crush on each other, but didn&#39;t know it. The girl would just be so nice she accidentally friendzoned him and she&#39;d fear, that if they get together, she wouldn&#39;t be romantic enough (she has very little experience). The guy would maybe try some moves on her, he&#39;d be very gentle to her and always make an exception for her. You know, a popular, cool guy, sweet just for her.

But the thing i like most are the characters, especially when they&#39;re really over the top, either in appearance or personnality. Examples of this would be JJBA&#39;s characters or even some of the One Piece cast. I&#39;m wondering if there are any novels, even series, with this kind of extravagant cast, with big personalities, that are almost cartoonish? </p> <p>Thank you in advance, looking foward to awesome sauce recs &lt;3 </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zealousideal-Sun8826\"> /u/Zealousideal-Sun8826 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p0bofa/manga_like_novels/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p0bofa/manga_like_novels/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Well it all went thru when I learned they made a miserable check, yet that same curiosity and fascination has always lingered eventually also landing me with an almost equal fascination for philosophy but yet I still remain highly uneducated in both. So I really want to start reading again and figure something Ive always been interested would help.Pleas recommend books of either category that would scratch that itch and even put a big chip on my shoulder with my knew found knowledge haha of course thats a bit of an exaggeration but I have high hopes ill get something that will open up my mind in ways I couldn\u2019t otherwise.

I have read some Tolstoy and Chekhov in English, also Orwell&#39;s short stories (i have read animal farm and 1984 in native language) . I think i have vocabulary problem even tho i watch tv shows such as The Sopranos in English ( with subtitles always) and podcats and videos on YouTube always English.
