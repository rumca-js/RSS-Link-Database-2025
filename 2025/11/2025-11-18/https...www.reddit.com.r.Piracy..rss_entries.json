The other is that I can&#39;t afford the premium VPN&#39;s (obviously why I&#39;m pirating in the first place) and I&#39;ve looked through online discussions and stuff and they say that even the best free VPN isn&#39;t worth it. </p> <p>This is mainly for torrents because I read how important it is but now I&#39;m just gonna consider Direct Downloads.
