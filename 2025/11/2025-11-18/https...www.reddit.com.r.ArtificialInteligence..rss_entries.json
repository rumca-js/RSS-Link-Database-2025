I expected it to do very little, but it ended up finding old images from accounts I barely remember. What stood out to me was not the result but the level of accuracy and speed from something that is accessible to normal users. It made me think about how far feature extraction and similarity search have come in real world applications. We often discuss models in isolation, but seeing a system like FaceSeek work across noisy public data reminded me that practical AI involves many small engineering decisions that never show up in research papers. This is not a promotion. It is just something that made me reflect on how public facing AI systems evolve and what kind of challenges they must solve behind the scenes. I am curious how others here view the gap between academic face recognition research and these large scale consumer implementations.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",

Think something like a watch, earbuds, or a tiny clip that listens to your conversations in real time and gives you guidance on what to say or do based on the situation. It could flag when someone\u2019s statements don\u2019t match earlier info, point out emotional cues you might miss, or help you navigate social, business, and day-to-day interactions without anyone knowing you\u2019re getting help.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t sci-fi either. We already have real-time transcription, tone analysis, stress detection, and contextual AI models. All that\u2019s missing is putting it into an always-on wearable. And with how fast things are moving, it\u2019s basically inevitable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NVDA808\"> /u/NVDA808 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1p01y60/wearable_always_on_ai",
