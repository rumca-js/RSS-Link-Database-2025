I found a git with OPML of tons of sites and thought someone else might enjoy a basic no-frills Android RSS reader. The features are swipe to refresh; when you click on an item, it marks it as read; if you long click it opens in a browser (useful for some sites that don&#39;t load properly). It keeps stories for up to three days, in the read section.</p> <p>Here is the site with tons of OPML:</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/plenaryapp/awesome-rss-feeds?tab=readme-ov-file\">https://github.com/plenaryapp/awesome-rss-feeds?tab=readme-ov-file</a></p> <p>Here is my app, you can view the code or just download the APK. I welcome any comments or suggestions.</p> <p>There are no ads or trackers, and I believe the only permission used is to access web.</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/yossiea-oss/GoodNewsForYou/\">https://github.com/yossiea-oss/GoodNewsForYou/</a",

The app actually renders Reddit content properly:</p> <ul> <li>Animated GIFs and videos play inline</li> <li>Image galleries with swipe navigation</li> <li>Threaded comments with collapsing</li> <li>Cross-posts link back to originals</li> </ul> <p>I built this because I wanted to follow specific subreddits without the algorithmic feed and notifications.
