        "description": "S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl has finally made its way to PS5. After a year of updates and refinements, GSC Game World\u2019s has bought one of last year\u2019s most visually striking shooters to Sony\u2019s console. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it delivers dense environments, atmospheric lighting, and highly detailed assets that showcase the strengths of Epic\u2019s latest tech. \n\nIn this video, we examine how the PS5 version stacks up against its Xbox Series X and PC counterparts, highlighting key visual and performance differences across all three platforms. From foliage density and texture quality to frame-rate stability and load times, we break down individual aspects of the experience to determine whether GSC Game World\u2019s latest port offers a worthwhile experience on PS5.",

        "description": "I wish I could say, \u201cReleased this Friday to incredible sales and extensive criticism, as is tradition,\u201d but this time, it's different. It's not often you reference such things when talking about Call of Duty, of all things, but it fits excruciatingly well with Black Ops 7. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, physical sales are down 61 percent from last year's Black Ops 6 and pale in comparison to Battlefield 6. The Call of Duty app, where all things Call of Duty are primarily accessible, barely scraped by 100,000 peak concurrent players this past weekend on Steam. Compare that to last year's Black Ops 6, which still managed 306,460 players at launch while also being available on Game Pass.",
