Even if I set the channel manually (with iw or using airodump-ng -c), after a few seconds it automatically switches to a different one.</p> <p>What happens is: \u2022 no deauth \u2022 impossible to capture any handshakes \u2022 airodump stays on a different channel than the one I set \u2022 very few packets, sometimes almost none</p> <p>I\u2019ve already tried airmon-ng check kill, setting monitor mode manually, disabling NetworkManager, etc., but nothing changes.</p> <p>Has anyone using this same adapter on a Raspberry Pi 4 managed to get it working properly? Could this be a specific issue with the mt76 driver on ARM? Or is this adapter simply not a good match and I should switch to another one?</p> <p>Thanks to anyone who replies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32",
