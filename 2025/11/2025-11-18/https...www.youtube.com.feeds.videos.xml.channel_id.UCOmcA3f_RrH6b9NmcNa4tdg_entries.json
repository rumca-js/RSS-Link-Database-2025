        "description": "Like past Analogue devices, the $250 Analogue 3D has a clean design that evokes the refinement and sophistication of an Apple product. But in an era where playing N64 games can be done with little hassle via software emulators, the Analogue 3D will appeal to only the most hard-core of retro enthusiasts \u2013 or those that don't want to fiddle with installing apps and hunting down ROMs via dubious websites. \n\nAnalogue's device is a clean, headache-free, competitively priced all-in-one solution. Let\u2019s unbox it and 8BitDo\u2019s 64 bluetooth controller. \ud83c\udfae \n#unboxing #8bitdo #analogue3d #gaming #n64 #retrogaming #analogue",
