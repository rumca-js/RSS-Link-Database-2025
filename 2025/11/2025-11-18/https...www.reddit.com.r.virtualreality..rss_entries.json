I appreciate a fov, in my case 110, but I can&#39;t accept a low resolution and the glare from pancake lens. So, I appreciate the plug&amp;play hmd but I can tinkering without problem, if worht it. So, I thought to buy a steam frame, but the combo pancake/low res/glare stopped me, probabily the only pro will be the immediacy. Howewer, I could buy the super (50 ppd) with big discount (for 8KX) and could be cost around 1350 euro. </p> <p>Which should I buy?

I am also a proponent of VR and how it can be used for rehabilitative purposes, but I worry about the orientation and balance while using a headset. I know it can be pretty trippy at first. Does anyone have any recommendations for systems to look into? Tips for using these systems with an elderly population?</p> <p>Here&#39;s what I am familiar with: We have Nintendo Wii and play Wii bowling at least once a week. They love that. I did some research on MindMotion Go a while back. I like system in particular, but I have yet to check out the price. Also I like the idea of bringing the headset to the person instead of having to get them to a room.

So here&#39;s what I have to elaborate on; I have always loved VR gaming and played it given any opportunity, and with that, I want to finally buy my own and give it a try! My main objectives are gaming and movie watching, so I&#39;ve been told the headset I choose matters a lot.</p> <p>So, for context, I live in a country where VR is financially inviable for A LOT people, and so I am currently considering between saving for an entire year just to get Meta Quest 3, or just getting Quest 2 or 3s early.</p> <p>I know SOME of the differences between the Quest 3, 2 and the Quest 3s. The main one being the lenses. I&#39;ve been told that is the one that matters the most. But how absurd is the difference? I know it is better, but given how expensive 3 is for me (over double the value of 2 or 3s), as a low wage gamer am I gonna care?",

From what I\u2019ve seen, the best options in this category are the Vision Pro, the Galaxy XR, and the Play for Dream. After reading all the negative reviews about the Galaxy XR, I\u2019m now deciding between the Play for Dream and a second-hand Vision Pro. (For context: the Vision Pro isn\u2019t officially supported in my country, so I would have to buy it on eBay, I\u2019m also not really in the Apple ecosystem.) Which of these two is better? Are there any other options?

With all the doom and gloom that seems to hover around vr it\u2019s nice to have a major company create and release a game centered headset. What this tells me is that for several more years we will get support and the vr industry is not dead.
