An innovative entrepreneur examines how industrial wastewater from mines, refineries, power plants, and more holds vast stores of critical minerals and rare earth elements that we need for renewable energy.

He reflects on how shoes narrate personal journeys and significant historical events, inviting listeners to consider the stories their own shoes could tell. A creative thinker from Grade 11 at The Millennium School, Dubai, Pranav draws inspiration in art and reading, where imagination and reflection often meet. Eager to enhance his public speaking and critical thinking skills, he joined TEDx to explore new perspectives and express ideas with impact. In his talk, Pranav begins with a familiar, everyday object that holds deeper meaning\u2014one that silently captures memories and emotions. Through this object, he beautifully embodies the theme \u201cThe Invisible Narrators \u2013 How Everyday Objects Tell Stories of Our Lives.\u201d This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local",
