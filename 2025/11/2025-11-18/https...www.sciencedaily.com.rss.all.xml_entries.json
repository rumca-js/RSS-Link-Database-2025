Participants who took the drug saw reduced gains in fitness, blood vessel function, and glucose control. The interference may stem from how metformin affects mitochondrial activity.",

In mice, it relieved neuropathic pain quickly and didn\u2019t cause the usual movement or memory side effects. Surprisingly, the pain relief didn\u2019t use typical cannabinoid receptors, instead calming abnormal nerve activity more directly. The findings hint at new avenues for treating chronic pain and neurological diseases.",
