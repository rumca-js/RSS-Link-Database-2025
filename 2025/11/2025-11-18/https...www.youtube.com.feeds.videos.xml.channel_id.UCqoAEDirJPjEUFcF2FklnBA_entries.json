        "description": "What would a four-dimensional being see if it looked at us? In this episode, Neil deGrasse Tyson and Chuck Nice answer fan questions covering higher-dimensional surgery, space elevators, alien intelligence, and colliding galaxies. Could spacetime itself be a cosmic crystal? \n\nCould 2D creatures exist, and if so, how would we even know? If 4D beings turned sideways, would we disappear like cartoon characters? We wonder whether we could make 4D surgeons do our operations for us. Could the Trantor Starbridge from Foundation actually work? Neil explains the physics behind a space elevator, how it would reach geostationary orbit, and why the dream faded once rockets got efficient. Chuck wants to know what kind of music you\u2019d play during the world\u2019s longest elevator ride. \n\nIf a superintelligent alien could answer any one question, what would you ask? Neil wonders if the human brain is smart enough to understand the entire universe, or are we just too dumb? Can learning happen without human",
