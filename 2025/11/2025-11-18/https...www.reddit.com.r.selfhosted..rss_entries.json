        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I\u2019ve seen lots of users running Komodo on Gitea, Github or any other repo with Renovate to update docker compose files automatically or through pull requests.</p> <p>Currently I have all my docker stacks running as UI defined files in Komodo. I use Komodos Resource Sync feature to commit all these stacks and updates through the resource .toml file. This works as a charm, except.. how to update this semi-automatic?</p> <p>I\u2019d like to have Renovate or any other tool to notify me of updates for containers, and let me manually approve it to be updated or to create a PR and let me approve it. But, as far as I can find, this only works with docker compose files and not for Komodos own resource sync file.</p> <p>Does anyone know a way to do just that? I don\u2019t want Watchtower or Komodo auto update as I want to control which containers get updated. Or should I switch away to docker compose files in Git and let Komodo use that?</p> </div><!-- SC_",
