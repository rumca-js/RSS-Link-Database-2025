I wish I had a penis, I wish people treated me like a man, I wish people saw me as a man. I\u2019ve been wondering if this is something a lot of women feel, or if I might be trans. Obviously there\u2019s a lot more to being transgender than just wishing I was a man, and a lot of cis people wish they were treated like the other gender for various reasons, I\u2019m simplifying this a lot.
