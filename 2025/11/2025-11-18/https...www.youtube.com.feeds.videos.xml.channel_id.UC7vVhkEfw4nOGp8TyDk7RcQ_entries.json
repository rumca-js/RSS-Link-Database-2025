        "description": "Humanoid robots have long captured our imagination. Interest has skyrocketed along with the perception that robots are getting closer to taking on a wide range of labor-intensive tasks. What is driving this vision is not a preference for the human form but a recognition that humans are generalists\u2014adaptable, quick to learn, and effortlessly retaskable. \n\nThis stands in contrast with decades of industrial automation, which have led to enormous gains in productivity by narrowing the scope of solutions to well-bounded tasks. However, designing systems that can scale economically to address the high diversity and stiff requirements of industrial labor tasks remains a significant open challenge. \n\nIn this discussion, we reflect on what we\u2019ve learned by observing factory floors, and why we\u2019ve grown convinced that chasing generalization in manipulation\u2014both in hardware and behavior\u2014isn\u2019t just interesting, but necessary. We\u2019ll discuss AI research threads we\u2019re exploring at Boston Dynamics to ",
