(I agree with Firefox being evil for this.) They do not track you I think, and even if they do, it is not like Google. They are non-profit. If you guys are right, then I might install Librewolf and/or Mullvad. What is the difference between Firefox and these browsers. Isn&#39;t Librewolf just Firefox with custom settings?
