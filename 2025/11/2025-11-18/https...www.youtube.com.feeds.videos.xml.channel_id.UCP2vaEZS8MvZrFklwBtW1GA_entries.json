        "description": "Toilet shutoff valve tips\u2026I\u2019m using a 3/8\u201d by 3/8\u201d drop ear. This connects to my 1/2\u201d PEX A and to a SharkBite chrome nipple. The quarter turn angle stop can easily be accessed if the toilet has to be serviced. And it can be swapped out by unscrewing it from the chrome nipple. Very solid and pretty installation. Many thanks to SharkBite for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#plumbing #bathroomremodel #homerenovation #sharkbiteplumbing #sponsored",
