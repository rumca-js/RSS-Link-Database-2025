While most of your time in Demonschool will be spent, well, fighting demons and figuring out how to stop the apocalypse, you still have to hit the books.</p><p>At the very end of each in-game week, you'll be tasked with answering a quiz back at the classroom. In a similar fashion to activities like karaoke, you'll have to pick an answer within a timer. These, of course, are graded at the end--answer everything correctly and you'll be rewarded with relationship points on occasion, as well as moons, the currency used to obtain abilities. (They don't seem to have an official name, so I'll just call them moons.)</p><p>There's a total of ten exams--the main story continues afterward, but there's a clear cut-off point at the end of week 1.
