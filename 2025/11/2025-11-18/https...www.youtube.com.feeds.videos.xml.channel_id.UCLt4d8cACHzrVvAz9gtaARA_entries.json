He re-learned how to play video games with a mouth-operated controller and is now a pro gamer with multiple Guinness World Records and a significant following.\n\nWe invited Rocky to Neuralink to share his story, learn about our technology, and discuss the possibilities of brain interfaces for paralysis and other unmet medical needs.",
