        "description": "The Retroid Pocket G2 is essentially just a \"Pro\" version of last year's remarkable Retroid Pocket 5, with the same design and about double the performance power for a similar price.  It's easily the most powerful and high-quality handheld you can find for around $200...at least until the Retroid Pocket 6 releases in two months.\n\nRetroid website: https://tinyurl.com/Retroid-RGC\nGiveaway: https://gleam.io/IjGjn/rgc-retroid-pocket-g2-giveaway\nAndroid handheld starter guide: https://youtu.be/I4mqgcDYZFo\n\nRetroid dual screen: https://tinyurl.com/RetroidScreen\nShort cable (2x 7cm) https://amzn.to/4ouvy07\nCable connector: https://amzn.to/4oq3oDg\n\nThis was a retail unit that I purchased myself but it was sent to me early by the manufacturer.  All opinions are my own, they did not see this video ahead of time, and no money was exchanged in any way.\n\nWays to support this channel:\nRGC merch: https://store.retrogamecorps.com\nStickers and magnets: https://www.ebay.com/str/retrogamecorpscharitysto",
