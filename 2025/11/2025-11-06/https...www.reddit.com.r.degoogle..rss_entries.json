This is a tool that will allow you to transfer your 2FA codes from google authenticator into any other 2FA app of your choosing.</p> <h1>Couldn&#39;t we do this already?</h1> <p>Not easily. Although Google Authenticator has a &quot;Transfer Codes&quot; option, it uses a proprietary format which can only be scanned and recognized by Google Authenticator. This has made it very difficult to migrate your codes away from Google Authenticator unless you manually went into each of your accounts and changed your 2FA settings which is incredibly inconvenient.</p> <p>Some 2FA apps may have their own way of reading and importing google authenticator codes, but doing things such as moving your 2FA to a password manager or just being able to use a 2FA code shared to you by another person is still a very inconvenient process.</p> <h1>How do I use this?</h1> <o",
