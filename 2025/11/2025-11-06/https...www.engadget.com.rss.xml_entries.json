Sandbar describes Stream as &quot;your extended self,&quot; which is to say that it\u2019s a deliberately minimalist smart ring that you can use to take voice notes and interact with a chatbot directly using the built-in touch-activated microphone.</p>\n<p>When you create a voice note, the Stream Ring uses haptic feedback to confirm that it\u2019s been recorded. You hold the sensor to speak and tap it if you want to interrupt and start over. It can automatically transcribe your voice interactions, whether you\u2019re simply compiling a grocery list on the go, asking it to fetch some information from the web, or having a more back-and-forth conversation with the device. These notes will appear in the Stream app via Bluetooth, which will be iOS-only at launch.</p>\n<span",
