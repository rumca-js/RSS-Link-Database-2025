For some context, I was exhausted and distraught, and my request felt like something along the lines of that Facebook group where folks volunteer to attend queer wedding ceremonies when their family won\u2019t - sort of a shout into the internet void and begging for community support. I didn\u2019t stop to consider how some folks might feel as though my request was predatory or unsafe. </p> <p>While many of you might have queer spaces or large communities that you can reach out to in your area, I do not, and to make matters worse I was raised in a cult and essentially lived an existence close to being Amish until I was 18 and could get away. I think some of you may take for granted the connections you may have made through school or childhood that I simply don\u2019t have access to. My only queer friends are folks I\u2019ve met online that live far across the country from me -",
