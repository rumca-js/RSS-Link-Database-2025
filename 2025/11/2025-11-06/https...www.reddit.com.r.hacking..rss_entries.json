From the blog:</p> <p>&lt;tl;dr&gt; By using structured prompts (YML, XML, JSON, etc.) as input to LLM agents, an attacker gains more control over the next token that the model will output. This allows them to call incorrect tools, pass dangerous inputs to otherwise legitimate tools, or hijack entire agentic workflows. We introduce Data-Structure Injection (DSI) across three different variants, argument exploitation, schema exploitation, and workflow exploitation. &lt;/tl;dr&gt;</p> <p>In essence, because LLMs are next token predictors, an attacker can craft an input structure such that the probability of the next token, and indeed the rest of the output, is highly controlled by the attacker.</p> <p>In anticipation of push back, Zenity views this as distinct from prompt injection. In a metaphor we use,",
