        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi folks, It\u2019s been lovely reading through this sub and seeing so many great recommendations. I\u2019m a PhD student and my research specialises in fantasy writing, particularly novels inspired in some way by the Ottoman Empire. There are many books on my reference list from Dune to The Daevabad trilogy but I wonder if I\u2019m missing any key texts. If any of you have recommendations for books where the setting/power system/worldbuilding seems strongly influenced by the Ottoman Empire, would you mind letting me know? Bonus points if the books were written in the last ten years, and if they predominantly feature a female character. Thanks! \ud83d\ude42</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jumpy-Requirement967\"> /u/Jumpy-Requirement967 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1oqdd1h/fantasy_books_with_ottoman_empire_influence/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fanta",

But the embers continue to burn and threaten to ignite once more.

You know, books where there are still wizards with pointy hats, elves, dwarves, and castles, where people live in that old medieval way, yet there are spaceships and other planets. Something with that <em>Masters of the Universe</em> vibe, where you\u2019re just as likely to see a sword duel as a laser pistol fight.</p> <p>I think these kinds of fantasy stories are hard to tell well because it\u2019s all about balance, especially when it comes to the classic struggle between magic and technology. Make magic too strong, and technology becomes pointless; make technology too dominant, and the magic loses its wonder.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Jokengonzo\"> /u/Jokengonzo </a> <br/> <span><a",
