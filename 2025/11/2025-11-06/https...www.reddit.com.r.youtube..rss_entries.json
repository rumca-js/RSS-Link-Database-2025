Now, I can disable that in the app (for the current video), but I can&#39;t find anywhere to disable this from happening by default, and when I cast to a chromecast, I don&#39;t see anywhere to disable it for the current video either. I just spent 15 minutes trying to solve this without success. Now I spent another few minutes typing up this. I just wanted to watch a video with the original audio track.

But when I\u2019m trying to fall asleep, it\u2019s insufferable having to open my eyes every 10 minutes to skip an almost hour long ad. I hope these podcasts, advertisers, etc. realize eventually these long ads do not make people want to interact, they fully deter people. The call her daddy podcast is a great example. I was actually considering giving it a listen, up until I kept getting the 60 minute ad every night multiple times a night. It\u2019s ridiculous. Advertisers these days are actually doing the opposite of attracting traction and attention. Also I know premium would fix this, but I already have my choice of subscriptions and I can\u2019t afford YouTube premium as well.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/space-kid-sage\"> /u/space-kid-sage </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit",
