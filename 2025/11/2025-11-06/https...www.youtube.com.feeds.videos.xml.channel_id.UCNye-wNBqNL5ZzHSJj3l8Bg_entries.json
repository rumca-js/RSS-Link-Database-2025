        "description": "Israel has targeted every source of Palestinian livelihood across Gaza, including its once-thriving fishing industry. Before the war, Gaza\u2019s fishermen hauled in more than 4,600 tonnes of fish each year, despite facing the constant risk of being detained, killed, or injured by Israeli forces. Since the war began, most of their boats have been destroyed, and those casting their nets a few metres from the shore have come under Israeli fire. In January, Israel declared Gaza\u2019s waters a 'no-go zone,' banning fishing, swimming, and any access to the sea. Gaza has since lost 94 percent of its catch, cutting off one of the last remaining sources of food.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Ibrahim Al Khalili reports from Gaza City.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\n Dow",
