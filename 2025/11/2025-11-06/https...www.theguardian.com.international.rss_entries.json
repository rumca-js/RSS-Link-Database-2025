The man in question is in fact the mayor of Miami, Francis Suarez, encouraging me and other leaders of industry to pay lots of money to attend the America Business Forum. The website tells me \u201cAmerica Business Forum comes to the United States for the first time\u201d \u2013 which begs the question where they\u2019ve held it previously. I\u2019m no CEO, I don\u2019t keep a diary, but I\u2019d have put America right up there as locations to hold a forum on American business.</p> <",

But Gill takes a liking to him straight away with a flick off the pads for four. The right-hander picks up two more from much the same stroke then adds another boundary with a crunching straight drive.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/0",

And like so many British working-class pleasures and pursuits, shifting tastes and the relentless march of gentrification have seen its popularity wane substantially since heydays past. This frisky film explores the canine-centric milieu with affection and respect \u2013 but, laudably, it also makes room, about halfway through its runtime, for the case against racing as articulated by several animal rights activists who decry the conditions in which some dogs are raised, the practice of euthanising animals deemed no longer viable for racing, and the injury risks racing itself poses.</p><p>Naturally, the trainers, breeders and owners we meet here violently disagree with these critiq",
