We have to show live image from it on the screen, and at each predefined interval (like 1 minute or 5 or whatever), make a snapshot and save it on external usb stick. However, microscope has illumination, and it had to be turned on before taking the snapshot and turned off after it. Also, there should be a physical button, which will turn the light on at any time, so user can adjust focus of microscope, etc.</p> <p>I asked here, and on raspberry forums and I was told that Zero W2 should be fine for the task.
