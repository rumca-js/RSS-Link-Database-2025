To me it looks like a great browser in terms of minimalistic look and support for both FF and Chrome extensions. On top of that it&#39;s built on Webkit, which makes it greatly optimized for macOS. </p> <p>However, forums are full of reviews and comments on how Orion is bugged and that it&#39;s far from a possible release/stable version. The reason for that is usually stated as a small team of developers, who treat this project as a sidekick to Kagi search engine. Also, I found a few comments on Orion being not privacy-focused browser, which I can&#39;t verify.</p> <p>Overall, I believe this could be a great option among other browsers with a good potential to expand.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello , </p> <p>I want to open a discussion. To all Mac users out there , Out of curiosity , why do you need to try any browser when you have Safari ? </p> <p>For the longest time I wondered why would anyone switch from this amazing browser. It has all I need , the battery life is phenomenal, the UI , it has an adblocker ( though not for YouTube ) , the privacy , it&#39;s blazing fast , and most importantly the smooth unmatchable integration with the rest of my apple devices. </p> <p>I mean I tried in the past to use Chrome or Firefox ( and the tons of browsers based on them ) but nothing provided me with what I had with safari , also you have to charge your MacBook twice and sometimes three times a day. I went back to safari every time in less than a week. </p> <p>And don&#39;t get me started on this current war of everyone using chromium to build a browser that has AI like you can&#39;t live without it but cautious about using it for banking. </p> <",
