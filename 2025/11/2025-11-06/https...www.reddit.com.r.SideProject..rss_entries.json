Like, is it even worth it when you&#39;re already swamped?</p> <p>So I ended up pulling some monthly active user stats to get a real picture, and honestly, the numbers don&#39;t lie. Product Hunt is still the giant\u20142.7 million MAU with a good chunk from the US. Skipping that feels like missing out on a big boost for early traction, especially for tech stuff like AI.</p> <p>Here&#39;s a quick breakdown I threw together that helped me sort it out:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Platform</th> <th align=\"left\">Est.

It\u2019s free and works with WooCommerce, but I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s anything better.</p> <p>Requirements:</p> <p>\u2022 No upfront cost or open-source \u2022 Should support selling courses (Stripe/PayPal) \u2022 Easy to set up and manage \u2022 I\u2019m only selling 3 courses for now \u2022 Good UI and dashboard</p> <p>Any recommendations? Would love to hear what others are using ,especially if you\u2019ve launched small-scale courses like mine. Any hidden gems or platforms I should avoid?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Strength3748\"> /u/Ok_Strength3748 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1oprr8u/lms_recommendation_for_vi",
