It began interestingly enough, but quickly descended into a weirdness beyond your regular horror book stuff.</p> <p>I understand that the somewhat disjointed writing is a part of the character&#39;s decline, but rather than making for an interesting plot, it just feels (to me, anyway) like stream-of-conciousness babble, or like a child&#39;s first attempt at writing a more complex story.</p> <p>Don&#39;t get me wrong - I don&#39;t think it is a BAD novel. I just can&#39;t quite get a grasp on it. The main character&#39;s &quot;mental decline&quot; happened far too quickly (at least, it feels that way to me).</p> <p>What do others who have read this book think of it? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Whisper-1990\"> /u/Whisper-1990 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comm",

A big portion of these stories come from the sixties and 70s, but one of the stories, &quot;Lady in the Tower&quot;, dates back to 1959.</p> <p>There are also some thoughts provided by McCaffrey about how each of these stories came to be. Especially one about a story, &quot;Changeling&quot;, that she initially submitted to Harlan Ellison for Dangerous Visions.</p> <p>Some of the stories are also part of some of her series like Dragon Riders of Pern and the Ship series. A lot of SF with a little bit of Fantasy, in this case science-fantasy. The stories are highly dramatic, along with a bit of humor tossed in there too.</p> <p>&quot;Lady in the Tower&quot;, &quot;Finder&#39;s Keeper&quot;, &quot;Honeymoon&quot; and &quot;The Smallest D",
