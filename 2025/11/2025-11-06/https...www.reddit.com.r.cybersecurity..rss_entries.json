RCS stands for rich communication services. It&#39;s an open standard that anyone can choose to support. There is something missing from the standard though. It does not include encryption. The RCS standard is an unencrypted standard which means any texts you send through RCS were unencrypted. Google doesn&#39;t want its users sending unencrypted messages through whatever layers of different ISPs see at the end sketchy routers with hacks and things like that on it. So what did Google do? Google added encryption to RCS exclusively through Google servers. The only way you could encrypt an RCS message was to first send the unencrypted one to Google who would send you back the encrypted payload that you could then send to the user of your choice.</p> </blockquote> <p>The quote is from his video <a href=\"http",

What if it&#39;s a bit more.. spaghettied? The scanner won&#39;t notice it.
