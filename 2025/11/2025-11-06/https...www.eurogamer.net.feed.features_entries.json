Your first reaction might be to judge someone by their skill in PvP, but who wins an encounter in PvP can depend on a wide spread of variables. Oftentimes, the measure of a player's aptitude in an extraction shooter is murky at best.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-trials-are-the-perfect-way-to-do-ranked-in-extraction-shooters\">Read more</a></p>",

        "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/eu5-sleep.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>Paradox Interactive? Here's a bloody paradox for you! I <em>love</em> the idea of grand strategy games, perhaps more than I can possibly convey. I've spent countless hours poring over screenshots of Europa Universalis 4, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crusader-kings-iii\">Crusader Kings 3</a>, and Victoria 3, mesmerised by those evocative maps and enigmatic numbers. Where some might see drab undulations and a spreadsheet UI, I see tantalising potential; the chance to bend history to my whims with an iron fist, a clean codpiece, and twinkle in my eye. And yet - and <em>yet</em> - when it comes to actually playing the things, no matter how determined my resolve, I'm pretty much guaranteed to nod off within ten minutes of starting the tutorial.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/europa-universalis-5-keeps-putting-me-to-sleep-but-i-really-wish-it-didnt\">Read more</a></p>",
