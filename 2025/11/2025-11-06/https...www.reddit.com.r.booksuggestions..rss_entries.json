So far, we finished Reach, CE, 2 and 3. I&#39;m already an avid reader (read 122 books this year so far) and my go-to genre is usually fantasy, high fantasy, a bit of romance on the side (the last two books I finished were The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss and then Watch Me by Tahereh Mafi). </p> <p>I picked up Halo Fall of the Reach and fell in love with it (reall obsessed with Reach too, my fave so far in the game series). I bought the second book, The Flood, and my husband suggested I get the Mass Effect and Gears of War books in the book store yesterday (I did get them). He&#39;s not a book reader, he only knows via the games he played. I was wondering if there are more series that is like the Halo books out there? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lemonslicecake\"> /u/lemons",

Any suggestions for a book like this I would love to read some!
