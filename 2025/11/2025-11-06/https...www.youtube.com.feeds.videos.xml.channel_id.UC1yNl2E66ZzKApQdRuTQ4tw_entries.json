According to the paper, the universe was at one point filled with tiny knots made up of pure energy. This sounds crazy, but the paper\u2019s implications could rock the world of physics. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper here: https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/s3vd-brsn\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/ne",
