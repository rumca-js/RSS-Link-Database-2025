I get audio from everything else, but nothing from this one series. As far as I can tell I have all the proper codecs. Forgive me if this is the wrong place to ask, but does anyone have any suggestions? Other than paying HBO $19 to watch 3 hours of content lol</p> <p>Maybe all these uploaders just copied from the same original poster and it was flawed from the beginning? But they all had lots of downloads and lots of seeders, so I couldn&#39;t see why people would seed it if the torrent was bad.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SerUndead\"> /u/SerUndead </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1opxb6y/audio_problem_with_a_specific_show_from_multiple/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.",

I keep separate folders for qbittorrent\u2019s completed downloads and my jellyfin library because I like to organize and rename stuff manually. I know qbittorrent has rename tools, but there are too many edge cases for me to keep them in the same folder.</p> <p>I\u2019ve tried using hardlinks and symlinks but couldn\u2019t get them working (maybe I\u2019m doing it wrong). I don\u2019t want to do it manually every time, and I don\u2019t use the arr stack since I prefer choosing torrents myself. Storage is tight right now, so duplicating files isn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>Any tips on how to manage this kind of setup more efficiently?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/morningliquors\"> /u/morningliquors </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"",
