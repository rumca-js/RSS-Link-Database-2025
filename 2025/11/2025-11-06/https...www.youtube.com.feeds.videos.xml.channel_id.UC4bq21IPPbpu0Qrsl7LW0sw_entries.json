        "description": "How companies fake being \u201c100% renewable.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the trick: companies can run on fossil fuels all year and still claim they\u2019re \u201cfully powered by renewables.\u201d\n\nThey buy annual renewable energy certificates (RECs), meaning a solar credit from May in Texas can \u201coffset\u201d coal power used in Virginia in December.\n\nNow, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol wants to change that with hourly matching:\n\u26a1 If a data center uses 1 MW at 3 a.m., it must buy 1 MW of clean power from the same grid, at the same hour.\n\nThis one rule could redirect billions in clean energy investment and finally decide whether \u201cgreen energy\u201d means real decarbonization or just creative accounting.\n\n\ud83d\udc49Hear the full breakdown on: https://vist.ly/4d7r9",

        "description": "OpenAI might drop its \u201cfor humanity\u201d mission for profit.\n\nOpenAI was founded as a capped-profit company, designed to keep AI aligned with humanity, not shareholders.\n\nBut new reports say it\u2019s planning to ditch that model and become a regular for-profit corporation. The reason? To raise more money for chips, talent, and speed to compete like any other tech giant.\n\nThe risk: it could shift control from safety boards to investors, fueling the next stage of the AI arms race.\n\nSo here\u2019s the question: can a company serve humanity when its duty is to shareholders? \n \n\ud83d\udc49Hear the full breakdown on The Slidebean Stand-Up; streaming now on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and all major podcast platforms.",
