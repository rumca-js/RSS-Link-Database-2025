I\u2019m trying to track down a very obscure arcade cabinet I played as a kid in Italy in the late \u201980s or early \u201990s. It\u2019s one of my fondest childhood memories: I was around 10 years old, and I got so good at the game that I could keep playing for over an hour with a single coin. People in the arcade would stop and gather behind me to watch \u2014 it was surreal!</p> <p>Gameplay: The screen had three vertical columns of cards continuously falling from the top. Using a joystick and a single button to speed up the card falling, you could place each card into one of the three columns. The goal was to form straights (and maybe sets) in the columns. Once you completed a level and reached a score threshold, the static female portrait in the background would lose an item of clothing \u2014 the image itself stayed static aside from the progressive reveal. Every level would increase the speed in which the cards would fall down.</p> <p>The art looked retro/manga",
