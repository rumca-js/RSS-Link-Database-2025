Right now, I\u2019m using a 2TB USB external drive for storage, but it\u2019s almost full (mostly TubeArchivist downloading YouTube videos for kiddos). I don&#39;t really care for redundancy for the videos, which should make my options/budget easier.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking of upgrading to around 10TB?, but wondering do I really need a NAS? Or would adding another USB external drive be fine? It seems like the main thing I\u2019d gain from a NAS is just drive health monitoring, which I believe doesn\u2019t really work over USB.

I just want to make sure this is a no-regrets purchase.</p> <p>I was planning to get the Synology DS925+ (4 bays), but I just found out that it only accepts Synology-branded drives. Those drives are waaaaaayyyyyy too expensive in my country (Not sure on your country), and it made me second-guess my choice.</p> <p>To be honest, for me, Synology NAS units are already much more expensive compared to other brands, yet their hardware specs often don\u2019t look as good, especially when compared to brands like Ugreen that offer better CPUs and RAM for the same or even lower price. And now Synology is requiring their own branded drives on top of that. There must be a reason behind this decision, right?
