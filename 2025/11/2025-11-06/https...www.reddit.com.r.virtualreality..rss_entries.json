We all know about it and how you have to overcome it. But time and time again I read posts and realize that people are just throwing others into the deep end.</p> <p>Before I got my setup a few months ago I literally had a plan to acclimate to VR. Right now I&#39;m basically immune to everything except smooth turning. But I prefer real life turning so I&#39;m probably not going to attempt.</p> <p>When I first started I walked for like 3 seconds in VR and got dizzy lol. But I had an actual strategy that worked. But so many people are just tossing their friends into racing and flight sims which is the absolute worst thing you can do to a beginner. It&#39;s great that sim people want to try VR but their first game usually is a sim and they of course can&#39;t handle it because the worst thing you can do is just try to push through it instead of easing your way into ",

Being put in the spaces in VR made me think so much deeper about then than i ever would have just reading an article or hearing about them, Being placed in the exact spot where some piece of tragic history happened really grounded everything and made it feel so real.

I&#39;m thinking of getting the Crystal Super Micro-oled for seated VR. I have a RTX5090 rig, so should be fine with a high res headset. For roomscale VR, I can&#39;t do it in my room where my PC is, space is limited. Therefore, I&#39;ll need another wireless headset for that, so probably Quest 3 for a cheap solution. Or, I can also get the GXR alone for both seated and roomescale VR.
