It\u2019s already writing articles, coding apps, designing graphics, and even helping brainstorm ideas better than ever before. So it got me wondering: if AI can handle most of the execution work, what will actually make us valuable as humans in the next 5 years? For me, the answer lies in the uniquely human stuff things that are really hard to automate or replicate. Emotional intelligence, for example: the ability to read a room, understand feelings, and build genuine connections. Creativity, too imagining new ideas or stories that resonate on a deep level. Storytelling itself is another powerful skill; AI can generate text, but humans craft narratives that inspire, persuade, and move people emotionally. And then there\u2019s critical thinking the ability to question, analyze, and make nuanced decisions when data alone can\u2019t tell the full story. Also, one key thing I\u2019ve notice",

This piece explains the word, lays out the signs, and shows why the answer is not simple.</p> <p>Zvi starts by asking what we mean by bubble. If bubble means any big drop in prices, that can happen and does not prove the tech is fake. If bubble means prices that make no sense vs likely future cash, he says that is not what we see in AI today. He notes many smart people are yelling bubble because deals feel circular, costs are huge, and profits are not clear yet.</p> <p>He then looks at both sides. On the risk side, some AI firms will get crushed by bigger labs. Hype can run ahead of results. Geopolitics, tariffs, or supply shocks could hit. A scare can trigger a fast drop even if nothing real changed. On the strength side, AI revenue is growing fast, c",
