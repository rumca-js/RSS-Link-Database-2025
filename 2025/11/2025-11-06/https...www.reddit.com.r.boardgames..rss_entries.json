In Vantage, not only do you become competent in the system, but you become competent in the world and can use your accumulated knowledge to your advantage after reset. This is certainly true for a lot of little things in the world, especially the geography once you internalize it. However, I was really hoping this meant it also had some larger, more hidden secret built into the world that you could access or solve once you know the world thoroughly.

It feels like most rounds I am just locked out of certain actions outside of hoping an opponent plays it at an opportune time for me to be able to take advantage but while that might happen in the short term I am sure once we get better it will stop. There is also the issue of someone just getting dealt a lot of high numbers someone having to discard a card to get initiative, only to play their best card and get surpassed anyway. Maybe this gets better as you play more but honestly I struggle to see it ever feeling like anything other than fighting the game design to be able to play and getting punished for no reason other I was dealt a bad hand.</p",

Got a copy of Skymines a while back, noticed recently that I&#39;m missing one of the red outposts. Posted on the BGG forums, they told me to talk to Pegasus Spiele NA, tried 3 times so far and no response any time. Are they known for bad customer service or is this just a hiccup?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ArcReza\"> /u/ArcReza </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oppv03/pegasus_spiele_na_replacement_parts/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oppv03/pegasus_spiele_na_replacement_parts/\">[comments]</a></span>",
