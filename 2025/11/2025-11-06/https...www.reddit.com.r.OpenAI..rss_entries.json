No, I won&#39;t change it. As an individual you may use this in any way you like. I hope you find it helpful. I am able to effectively manage about 3-4 agents at once now.</p> <p>The agents may also schedule other agents. For example we may create an agent for a file, or even a text input box in a window. That agent then can respond to file updates HERE and then update a status THERE and use tools to transform that data as needed to achieve a given desired outcome.</p> <p>It is somewhat secured inside a container, which helps with security and authentication, if you care about those things. There are a lot of tools as well, I think over 120 at this point and more coming in all the time. </p> <p>It&#39;s really for people who like running things locally. It can run in the cloud if needed.</p> <p>You",

I&#39;ve built out a prompt that works fine when running it through chatgpt, I attach a large json file for it to analyze but I have not been able to figure out how to attach a json file through the API. The prompt still runs when I convert the json file to text, but the quality of the output is nowhere near as good as when I run it through chatgpt. The json file has roughly 50k characters, and I&#39;m guessing that this is bloating the prompt as it also has somewhat lengthy instructions as well as ~10 image attachments to analyze. I&#39;ve tried using &quot;type&quot;: &quot;input_file&quot;, &quot;file_id&quot;: &quot;file-12345678&quot; in the content block but this expects a pdf file and doesn&#39;t work with json files.
