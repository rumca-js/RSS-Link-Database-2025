Grammar feels okay in writing but speaking is rough especially pronunciation and quick responses.<br/> Lately I have been trying to learn by following song lyrics singing along to pick up rhythm and words It helps with vocab a bit like catching idioms in pop songs but I end up pausing every line to look things up and half the time I still mess up the sounds feels slow and frustrating when I want to sound natural<br/> Anyone else use music this way to improve?

Ive never experienced anything like this before. I was flattered and enraged at the same time. The music is AI slop and I feel most people will know which is real and which one isn&#39;t.
