I tried Gemini with 2.5 Pro and internet research (both in AI Studio and the app), and I also tried it with Gemini 3 in AI Studio. It just doesn\u2019t come close to GPT Thinking. For example, I needed some legal information researched, and Gemini 2.5 Pro would often give me the wrong number for a specific rule or even hallucinate completely.
