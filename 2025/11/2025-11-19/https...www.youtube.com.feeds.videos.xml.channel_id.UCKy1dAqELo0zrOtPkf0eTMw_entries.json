The military insists they are harmless and slow-moving, offering hope to grieving families. But when Ava (Daisy Ridley) enters a quarantine zone searching for her missing husband, she uncovers the horrifying truth: the undead are growing more violent, more relentless, and more dangerous with every passing hour.\n\nWe Bury The Dead is produced by Kelvin Munro, Grant Sputore, Ross M. Dinerstein, Joshua Harris, and Mark Fasano.\n\nWe Bury The Dead, written and directed by Zak Hilditch, opens nationwide only in theaters on January 2, 2026.",

You'll be able to start the adventure over with your weapons and upgrades carrying over from your last completed save file. There's also new camera featuresd, armor, cosmetics, and more. In other news, the director of the Marathon cinematic short film had to go onto social media to reassure the public that, no, the short was not made by AI. Director Alberto Mielgo claims that a staff of 155 people made the short, and it took them several months. This comes as more games\u2014especially from Triple-A developers\u2014are incorporating AI into their workflows. And finally, The Legend of Zelda animated series from the 80s will be streaming for free on Tubi. That should hold you over until the live-action feature-length film drops in 2027.",

It\u2019s a blast in local or online multiplayer during its traditional races and unique battle mode, and its frankly absurd amount of fun achievements to chase, meaningful unlockables, and deep customization make it great for solo players, too. The biggest hurdle to enjoying its dizzying amount of content is how it all controls, as its frantic pace and slippery one-button control scheme is endearingly novel, but occasionally too simple for its own good. Air Riders just can\u2019t help itself in sticking a little too closely to its original blueprint at times, making it not as approachable to pick up and play as Mario Kart, and not as technically rewarding or competitively viable as a fighting game like Super Smash Bros. But if you\u2019re willing to go along for the ride, you\u2019re in for a chaotic action racing game that\u2019s a great time w",

The new areas are filled with some of the most creative stuff I\u2019ve seen in a life simulator in quite some time, and the four-legged companions you can ride offer fun ways to engage with familiar cozy activities, not to mention make getting around so much faster. I would have liked some more exciting new characters to befriend, and the grind to level up your relationship with each of the mounts has unnecessary timegates that I could have done without, but these missteps didn\u2019t drag down the good times too much.

It\u2019s a blast in local or online multiplayer during its traditional races and unique battle mode, and its frankly absurd amount of fun achievements to chase, meaningful unlockables, and deep customization make it great for solo players, too. The biggest hurdle to enjoying its dizzying amount of content is how it all controls, as its frantic pace and slippery one-button control scheme is endearingly novel, but occasionally too simple for its own good. Air Riders just can\u2019t help itself in sticking a little too closely to its original blueprint at times, making it not as approachable to pick up and play as Mario Kart, and not as technically rewarding or competitively viable as a fighting game like Super Smash Bros. But if you\u2019re willing to go along for the ride, you\u2019re in for a chaotic action racing game that\u2019s a great time w",
