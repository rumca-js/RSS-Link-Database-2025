We have the chip mounted on a custom PCB and have confirmed basic liveness (JTAG is up, simple blinky works).</p> <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> During pre-silicon verification (RTL simulation), we relied heavily on <strong>Spike</strong> (the RISC-V ISA simulator) as a co-simulation reference model to check architectural state step-by-step (lockstep).</p> <p>Now that we are testing physical silicon, I feel like the RTL&amp;SPIKE cosim way will not work.</p> <p><strong>My Question:</strong> What is the standard industry flow for checking correctness in post-silicon tests? And what kind of tests should be done on real chip instead of simulation? I feel like there are two possible ways:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Signature Based:</strong> Should we be running tests that compute a &quot;CRC/Signature&quot; of memory/registers at the",
