        "description": "Gen Z asked the one forbidden workplace question: \u201cHey, what do YOU get paid?\u201d\nAnd suddenly HR needs a support group.\n\nIn this video, we break down why companies act like salary transparency is witchcraft, why 37% of workplaces still pretend it\u2019s \u201cnot allowed,\u201d and how one NLRB webpage destroys that entire fantasy in five seconds.\n\nWe cover the real reasons bosses hate when you compare pay\u2014favoritism, negotiation bias, and the classic \u201cwe paid the new guy the same as the 10-year veteran and hoped no one would notice.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why your manager gets sweaty when money comes up, this is your video. Leave your salary drama in the comments.\n\nNeed a resume / cover letter? \u27a1\ufe0f https://joshuafluke.store\n\u2022 \ud83d\udd0d Resume Reviews\n\u2022 \u270d\ufe0f Custom Resumes\n\u2022 \ud83c\udf93 Courses: Hacking the Resume & Interview\n\u2022 \ud83d\udcde 1-on-1 Consults\n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/Joshuafluke\n\u2764\ufe0f Support: https://www.patreon.com/joshuafluke\n\n\ud83d\udcf8 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@joshua_fluke\n\ud83d\udcf8 IG: https://www.instagram.",
