Armed with cryogenic mucus and pure brute force, the Ossidon serves as a living symbol of raw endurance and elemental might. Starting today, players can find the creature temporarily roaming in cold-biomes across Ragnarok, Valguero, and The Center until the Lost Colony map arrives on December 16. \n\n#ps5 #ps5games #arksurvivalascended",
