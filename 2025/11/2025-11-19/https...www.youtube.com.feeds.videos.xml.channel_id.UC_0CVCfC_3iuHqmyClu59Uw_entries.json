        "description": "n this video we\u2019re taking a first look at the all-new LattePanda Iota, a direct drop-in replacement for the original LattePanda \u2014 but now 8\u00d7 more powerful, faster IO, PCIe 3.0, USB-C, and support for full M.2 NVMe storage thanks to a new FPC adapter.\nPowered by Intel\u2019s Twin Lake N150, this tiny x86 single board computer is way more capable than the first LattePanda ever was. We\u2019ve got 4 cores, up to 16GB LPDDR5 with in-band ECC, upgraded eMMC storage, and tons of expansion options including WiFi/BT modules, 4G connectivity, a UPS battery hat, active/passive cooling, and more.\nIn this video we test browser performance, 4K playback, thermals, TDP tuning, BIOS settings, storage, gaming tests, and emulation. For IoT, makers, retro emulation, or low-power PC projects\u2014this thing is seriously impressive.\nhttps://www.lattepanda.com/lattepanda-iota\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Black Friday Sa",
