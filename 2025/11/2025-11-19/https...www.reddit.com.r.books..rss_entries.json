His voyage is full of adventure and danger, as his ship and others in the small fleet circle the globe. It&#39;s interesting, having read all the Aubrey-Maturin novels, to see life aboard from a midshipman&#39;s point of view, where the captain is a remote and forbidding figure and where the main character is always getting into trouble. It&#39;s a pleasure to see Peter growing up and becoming imperceptibly more competent, not just as a sailor but as a leader.

I don\u2019t agree. The book was great and was so much more than that. No, I don\u2019t condone infidelity but this is missing the bigger point of the book. A favorite philosophy theme of mine is what is beauty. It\u2019s hard to find that theme, but this book pursued it and I loved the perspective. In fact, each characters\u2019 life, though flawed, had their own beauty. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mountain_Stable8541\"> /u/Mountain_Stable8541 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1p0wwgp/the_unbearable_lightness_of_being_surprised_me/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1p0wwgp/the_unbearable_lightness_of_being_surprised_me/\">[comments]</a></span>",
