        "description": "Duravit Toilet Installation Tips...I need to replace an old toilet and chose the Duravit D-Neo. This 2-piece pro series has a DuraShield glaze that eliminates 99.99% of bacteria and is easy to clean. I like the upgraded look and clean lines of the D-Neo. Use DURAJEFF5 for 5% off Duravit products at supplyhouse.com, which is one of my favorite places to buy plumbing supplies",
