Yet, as with many abstractions, real-world performance can tell a more nuanced story&mdash;one that every engineer should verify through careful benchmarking.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://lemire.me/blog/2025/10/05/stdranges-may-not-deliver-the-performance-that-you-expect/\">std::ranges may not deliver the performance that you expect</a></h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tby Daniel Lemire</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFrom the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tGood engineers seek software code that is &lsquo;simple&rsquo; in the sense that we can read and understand it quickly.
