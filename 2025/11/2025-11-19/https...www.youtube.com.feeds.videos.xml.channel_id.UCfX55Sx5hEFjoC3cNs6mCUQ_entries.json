        "description": "Powering Europe\u2019s Energy Future Through Open Source\n\nEurope\u2019s power grid stands at a critical juncture. Aging infrastructures, growing electrification, and the urgent need for cross-border coordination demand a smarter, digital, and software-defined system. Open source is emerging as a strategic enabler to meet these challenges\u2014accelerating innovation, ensuring interoperability, and fostering digital sovereignty.\nIn this session, Christophe Villemer highlights how the Linux Foundation Energy (LF Energy) community is helping utilities and vendors collaborate around shared open platforms, from grid modeling and AI forecasting to virtualized protection and control. Using SEAPATH, a flagship project co-developed by RTE and Savoir-faire Linux, as a case study, the talk illustrates how open collaboration is transforming Europe\u2019s critical energy infrastructure and why hosting under LF Europe marks a new step toward collective governance and resilience.",
