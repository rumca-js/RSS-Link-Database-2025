I use a samsung device and you know,It comes with samsung internet bulit in along with samsung pass I am thinking to use them For my daily browser use but uh. I want to know that is the Browser secure,if not what browser should I use many people may suggest brave but I usually use websites which show ads like wait 10s to continue that kind of thing.But all of you know It blocks them,many people also suggest to turn off ad blocker, it&#39;s true but still it breaks them. My requirements: 1.Open source Browser 2.Uses google password manager(Suggest me if I&#39;m wrong) 3.Blocks ads and trackers like vivaldi or firefox not as strict as brave. Please give me suggestion.

Thanks!</p> <p>I&#39;d like to degoogle, and really my main complaint would be the loss of &quot;sign in with Google&quot; on basically every website. Besides that, I wouldn&#39;t mind switching. </p> <p>I&#39;m not super organized, and I like the idea of just switching from one integrated ecosystem to another. Proton seems like it&#39;s actually consumer-friendly. </p> <p>I know they had some crap going on with sending some emails to the Swiss government or whatever.</p> <p>But the headlines say they&#39;re moving some of their servers around to avoid similar issues, and their overall service pattern <em>seems</em> to be pretty acceptable. </p> <p>So I wanted to get the opinions of anybody who has made the switch from Google to Proton - the good, the bad, the ugly. </p> <p>Thanks for any input!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>This is a really oddly specific request, but does anybody know of an android alarm app that has voice control? </p> <p>I&#39;ve got one of those Lenovo Smart Clocks which I&#39;ve jailbroken to normally run Android, so I can stop relying on the preinstalled Google Assistant. However, the main way I use the device is for alarms, which I have grown used to stopping with a voice command (ie saying &quot;stop&quot; when the alarm goes off to deactivate it). Unfortunately, due to the shape &amp; size of my room, I cannot abandon this feature since I do not have a place to put the clock (or any alarm clock) near my bed to stop it, so voice controls will have to do.</p> <p>Do you guys know of any Android apps that provide this functionality? Alternatively, are there other voice assistants (ones which won&#39;t turn my clock into a wiretap) that can be used to stop an alarm? Thanks for any help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https",
