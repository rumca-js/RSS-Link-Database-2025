For Old School RuneScape - the retro spin off MMO of RuneScape 3 based off of an 07 backup - it marks the arrival of its first ever new, exclusive, Skill. It's quite the regatta after the past proposed Skills, like Warding and iconically the first version of Sailing ten years ago, failed to pass the player polls. Now, however, the anchors are hoisted and the sails are set as Sailing voyages into OSR.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/inspired-by-a-long-running-fan-joke-sailing-makes-port-in-old-school-runescape-as-its-first-unique-skill\">Read more</a></p>",

It was September and <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3405340/Megabonk/\">Megabonk was blowing up on Steam</a>, and I was curious. What was this game that had arrived without a formal introduction and raced to more than 100,000 concurrent players? It was the latest in a line of unpredictable viral hits, and I wanted to know more. I wanted to know who it came from, whether it was a slapdash cash-grab made by an opportunistic company, or whether there was something, or someone, more genuine behind it.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/megabonk-and-the-mystery-of-the-missing-youtuber-is-creator-vedinad-actually-danidev\">Read more</a></p>",
