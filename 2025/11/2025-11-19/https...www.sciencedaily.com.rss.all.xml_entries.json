The treatment restored memory and reduced inflammation in rats, while also proving non-toxic and able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier. Because it\u2019s far simpler and potentially cheaper than existing drugs, researchers are now pursuing partnerships to begin human trials.",

Reprogrammed stromal cells and interferon-responsive T cells create a self-sustaining inflammatory loop that weakens blood production. Surprisingly, the mutant cells themselves may not be the main instigators.",

The coils give the eyes extra slack, enabling nearly 360-degree scanning without neck mobility.",

        "description": "Massive Sargassum blooms sweeping across the Caribbean and Atlantic are fueled by a powerful nutrient partnership: phosphorus pulled to the surface by equatorial upwelling and nitrogen supplied by cyanobacteria living directly on the drifting algae. Coral cores reveal that this nutrient engine has intensified over the past decade, perfectly matching surges in Sargassum growth since 2011. By ruling out older theories involving Saharan dust and river runoff, researchers uncovered a climate-driven process that shapes when and where these colossal seaweed mats form.",

These wind changes affected both peatland carbon storage and how the Southern Ocean absorbed CO\u2082. Today the winds are shifting southward again, driven by climate change. Scientists warn this could disrupt natural carbon sinks and worsen droughts and wildfires.",
