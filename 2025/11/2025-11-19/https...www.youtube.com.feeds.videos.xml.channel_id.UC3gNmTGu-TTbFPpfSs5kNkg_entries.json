        "description": "On today's episode of the Awards Tour podcast, Rotten Tomatoes Awards Editor Jacqueline Coley sits down with legendary actor Brendan Fraser to discuss his newest film, 'Rental Family,' now in theaters. In their conversation, Fraser opens up about playing Phillip Vandarpleog, an out-of-work actor living in Tokyo who\u2019s hired to play real-life stand-in roles for strangers.\n\nJacqueline and Brendan also take a deep dive into his celebrated career and discuss fan favorites like 'Encino Man' and 'The Mummy,' as well as what it was like working with Joe Pesci in 'With Honors,' and being directed by \u201ctheater geek\u201d Martin Scorsese in 'Killers of the Flower Moon.' Fraser later reflects on proving himself within the industry even after his Oscar-winning performance in 'The Whale,' and he gives fans a playful tease of what to expect from the new 'Mummy' film.\n\n\u25ba Learn more: https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rental_family?cmp=Movieclips_YT_Description\n \nSubscribe and click the bell to be notified of",
