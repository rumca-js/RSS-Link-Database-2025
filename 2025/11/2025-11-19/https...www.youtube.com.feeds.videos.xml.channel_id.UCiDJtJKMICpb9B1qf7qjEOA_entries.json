        "description": "Adam is finally ready to tackle one of his dream prop builds: a replica of the sword of Green Destiny from his favorite wuxia film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon! A build ten years in the making, Adam breaks down the constituent parts of the build--blade, handle, pommel, and guard--to explain the progress he's made with each and the challenges to complete them. And the thing that kicked off this build: Adam finding a perfect analogue for the jade guard in a material called G-10. Let's head to the pantograph mill!\n\nShot by Adam Savage and edited by Joey Fameli\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nSavage Merchandising: https://adamsavage.com/\nAbout Tested: https://",
