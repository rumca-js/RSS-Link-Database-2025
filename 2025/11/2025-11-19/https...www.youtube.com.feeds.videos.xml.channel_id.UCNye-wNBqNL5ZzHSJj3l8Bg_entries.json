The attacks hit the Shejaia and Zeitoun districts of Gaza City, as well as the Mawasi area west of Khan Younis. The Israeli military says it struck Hamas targets after its troops came under fire, an incident it calls a violation of the nearly six-week-old ceasefire.

        "description": "Hamas has rejected the UN Security Council passing a US-drafted resolution on Gaza. The council backed Donald Trump's Gaza ceasefire plan, which includes the creation and deployment of an international stabilisation force. The so-called 'Board of Peace' will have sweeping authority over Gaza's governance, its security, and its reconstruction. Palestine's Foreign Minister wants the plan put in place immediately\u2014but Hamas and other armed factions in Gaza say it fails to meet the rights and demands of Palestinians. This resolution has proved controversial in Israel because it refers to the possibility of Palestinian statehood, which Netanyahu has rejected. \n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Nour Odeh reports from Ramallah.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\n Down",
