I kept switching between them for real projects, and that\u2019s when the differences between all three started becoming really noticeable.</p> <p>Replit still feels like the classic coding playground where you get quick feedback, a solid IDE and easy deployment. Cursor is definitely impressive for code editing and refactoring since it understands your repo better than most tools I have tried. But when it came to building something end to end with as little friction as possible, I found myself leaning toward Emergent more often than I expected.</p> <p>The main thing that stood out with Emergent was the way it handles planning before writing code. Replit and Cursor jump into coding immediately which is great if you already know every detail. But for bigger ideas, Emergen",
