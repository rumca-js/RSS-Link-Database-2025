Wait, isn\u2019t that basically the same as System Restore, which has been part of Windows for many years? Kind of, except the big difference here is that even local files and apps can be saved and restored using PITR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second tool is called <strong>Cloud Rebuild</strong>, which makes it possible to reinstall Windows 11 from scratch via the cloud. In this context, Microsoft is also testing a new version of <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2846812/a-new-windows-feature-could-allow-your-pc-to-fix-itself.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.pcforalla.se/article/2526668/sta",

I\u2019m also picky about my keyboard, so I\u2019ve stuck to an old one for a long time. That\u2019s until my birthday last year, when I decided to upgrade to the Logitech MX Keys keyboard\u2014a big splurge for me given its $120 price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me tell you, I don\u2019t regret making that purchase <em>at all</em>. In fact, I hope Logitech will forever make these keyboards so that I can grab another one when mine eventually dies on me. But right now, you can grab one yourself at a solid discount because <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/product/logitech-mx-keys-full-size-wireless-bluetooth-membrane-keyboard-for-mac-with-smart-illumination-space-gray/J7H7ZY3JFS\">Best Buy is selling it for just $96</a> ahead of Black Friday.

It felt like a true evolution in tech, something straight out of the science fiction from past decades. Here it was, a real product you could buy and own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, the Echo itself was ostensibly just a speaker, but the Alexa ecosystem underpinning it made it so much more than that. It was smart, it was functional, and it was a step in the right direction for forward-thinking people keen to build a smart home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, a decade on from its launch, it feels like the Alexa platform has run out of steam. I used to use my Echo all the time, but not anymore. Here\u2019s what happened and what could get me back.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-listi",
