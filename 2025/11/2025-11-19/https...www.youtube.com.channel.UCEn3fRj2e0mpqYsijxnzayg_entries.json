        "description": "My rocket hit Mach 2.2\u2014but there was no sonic boom. \ud83e\udd14 How? This is Spite, my all-carbon supersonic rocket that reached 23,000 ft, and today we\u2019re diving into the science of why you didn\u2019t hear the \u201cboom.\u201d From shock waves and Mach cones to doppler effects and \u201cboom carpets,\u201d we\u2019re breaking down how sonic booms actually work\u2014and why rockets that go straight up can stay completely silent. It\u2019s physics, engineering, and chaos\u2014all at Mach 2.\n\nWatch the full video to learn how sound, shock, and supersonic flight collide (literally).\n\nSupport me on Patreon:\n\ud83d\udcb8 https://patreon.com/xylafoxlin\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/xylafoxlin/\n\ud83d\udc26 X (fka Twitter): https://x.com/xylafoxlin\n\ud83d\udcd8 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/xylafoxlin\n\ud83c\udfb6 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@xylafoxlin\n\nBuy my MERCH:\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.xylafoxlin.com/\n\nAll my favorite Amazon Items!:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/xylafoxlin\n(filming setup, safety gear, etc)\n\n\ud83d\udc8c SEND ME THINGS \ud83d\udce6 :\nXyla Foxlin\n3727 W.",
