As a VR content creator, my only concern is that I can&#39;t find any resources detailing whether or not foveated rendering can be turned on/off at will to ensure video capture isn&#39;t compromised. Similarly (and nobody will know this until it comes out), I am wary of foveated streaming possibly also compromising video capture--although this can likely be mediated by simply setting up a desktop mirror that grabs the video before it is encoded and pushed to the headset (albeit my knowledge in video processing is limited.

From some research i found the following 2 options, either get a metaquest 3 or wait for the new valve headset. Have a 9070 xt, so graphics card should do decent here if i would get a headset without its own processing. Quest 3 would be cheap, but not a fan of meta. Would there be any other reasonable options? When i search up any other headset and then dig for the company producing them i always find some dirt about customer service, hardware problems like dead pixels etc. So if anyone got a recommendation that woulf be great. I&#39;d say my budget would be around 1k, prefered lower thought</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Xallvion\"> /u/Xallvion </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1p0udtu/want_to_get_into_vr_gaming/\">[link]<",
