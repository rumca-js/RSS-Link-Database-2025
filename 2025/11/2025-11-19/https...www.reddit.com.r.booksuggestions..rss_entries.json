This is my first time on this thread, so I\u2019m sorry if it doesn\u2019t follow guidelines, but I\u2019m on the hunt for a book I read as a child. I can\u2019t remember the name, but it was a mystery/thriller book about young girls at a summer camp and there was a serial killer, but it wasn\u2019t too gory or harsh, it was for young teens, I bought it at the scholastic book fair. I believe it had a purpleish/black cover with a lake on it. It was around 2011-2014. It\u2019s not a lot of info, but it\u2019s all I can remember, so I\u2019m super grateful if anyone might have a recommendation!!

So I\u2019m looking for something that might be an easier read.</p> <p>I recently finished reading a Dark Fantasy novel \u201cA Prince of Nothing\u201d by Scott Bakker. It was nice. Not worth another 600 pages for me to pick up the second volume thats for sure. </p> <p>I love \u201cEqual Rites\u201d by Terry Pratchett, some other Terry Pratchett books not so much. I loved Dune 1, 2 was ok, 3 I didn\u2019t even bother to finish (acc depressing how much it fell off).

I usually read thrillers when I need an escape but I\u2019m looking for something a little different (but also open to thrillers). </p> <p>I kind of want a novel that has many layers to it, potentially multigenerational or multiple perspectives, and will just draw me into its world. Big fan of a bit of drama but not saccharine or cliche. My favorite genres are memoirs, historical fiction, and thrillers. </p> <p>Some of my favorite books are Homegoing, Greenwood, Educated, The Glass Castle, A Thousand Splendid Suns, God of the Woods, and 11/22/63. I\u2019m open to biographies and memoirs. </p> <p>Thank you! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ZealousidealPiece182\"> /u/ZealousidealPiece182 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p1a0ed/need_a_book_to_suck_me_in/\">[link]</a><",

Also, preferably not an entirely Christian book centered around faith, rites, and so on, but rather one where their religiousness is just one of their character traits. I&#39;m looking for a story where religion shapes their mindset but doesn&#39;t go much past that, where it&#39;s just present in the background.</p> <p>Do you know any books like that?</p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BlueTurtle2361\"> /u/BlueTurtle2361 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p17axj/recommend_me_a_book_with_a_christian_main/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p17axj/recommend_me_a_book_with_a_christian_main/\">[comments]</a></span>",

The Saxon stories (aka The Last Kingdom) By Bernard Cornwell. Harry Potter by Jk Rowlings. Ive also enjoyed the books with Preacher by Johnstone. I also enjoyed 50 shades of Grey but by the end of the series it got to be a bit cheesy and poorly written and seemed to be rushed to finish the plot. The Cruel Prince was another good series.

This went on for a while and Joseph never caved in, until one day she grabbed his garment and he ran away.
