During the interview for the news, the owner commented that he and other retro shop owners around Sacramento have an open communication ongoing so if something stolen from one shop ends up in another shop they know the situation in advance. These thieves specifically targeted several specific items and after gaining access through a not publicly known entrance went straight to those items, so clearly it was someone who either worked there in the past or was a frequent visitor.</p> <p>I think that&#39;s just so disappointing that someone clearly is after a big score on items that have such niche appeal and audience.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"http",
