Their downtimes being so visible is a\nconsequence of their success.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A few readers have (very politely!) asked me whether yesterday\u2019s outage (which made DF unreachable for, I think about 90 minutes) made me rethink relying on a centralized provider like Cloudflare. My answer is no.</p>\n\n<p>Until I started using Cloudflare in 2018, Daring Fireball relied on no upstream service. I paid for a server from a web hosting provider (those providers changed a few times over the years, and when you, a reader, requested a page on this site, your browser communicated directly with my server via HTTP requests and my server responded directly back",
