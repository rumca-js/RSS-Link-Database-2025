It\u2019s two full days of sessions focused on things people here actually care about:</p> <p>\u2022 Building and deploying real AI agents \u2022 RAG, A2A, context engineering, and other practical workflows \u2022 Live workshops, deep-dives, and case studies (not fluffy keynote stuff)</p> <p>Speakers include people like Harrison Chase, Chip Huyen, Prof. Tom Yeh, Dr. Ali Arsanjani, plus a bunch more folks doing actual hands-on work in AI from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, LangChain, etc.</p> <p>If you\u2019re into LLMs, agents, or just want to see how teams are actually shipping GenAI systems in the wild, this looks worth checking out.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got a small batch of free passes I can share with this community. If you want to attend, simply fill the registration and you\u2019ll be sent the virtual summit link to join.</p> <p>Link",

I\u2019m assuming the issue is the data I\u2019m feeding it, because I\u2019m recording in a proper music studio with high end gear and not processing being subtle tuning and subtractive EQ.</p> <p>The site I\u2019m using doesn\u2019t give any options besides uploading audio, I want to make sure I\u2019m recording the right type of material.</p> <p>Is there a blueprint of sorts for what to feed it or can it just be as simple as singing for 30 minutes?</p> <p>What should I actually record to get the best quality?</p> <p>Could it just be that Audimee isn\u2019t the best for this? Is there a better option out there?</p> <p>Any guidance or tips would be massively appreciated.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DeezA123\"> /u/DeezA",
