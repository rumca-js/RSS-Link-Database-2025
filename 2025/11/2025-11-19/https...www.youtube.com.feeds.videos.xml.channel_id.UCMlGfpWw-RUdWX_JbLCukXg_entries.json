The C++11 libstdc++ ABI updates introduced in gcc 5.1, although not strictly \u201cbreaking\u201d, are still in the collective memory of C++ developers and this experience shows us how sensitive the ecosystem is to ABI updates. \n \nThis talk challenges the assumption that a future ABI break would be equally problematic, as the landscape has evolved significantly in the last decade. \n \nOn the one hand, the C++ standard has evolved in such a way that even if the standards committee and compiler vendors go through great lengths to avoid breaking the ABI of standard library implementations, library authors are not as cautious - so in practice, the ability to link objects built with different C++ standard levels does not hold true for a lot of cases. \n \nO",
