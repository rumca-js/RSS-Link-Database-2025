At first I was enjoying the time skips but after like page 380 it became really dull and overused. Fonda Lee abused the timeskips so bad that the next Gen didn\u2019t even have time to develop. I wanted to see more of Ru , Nico, Jaya, Tia, Ato and Cam but there wasn\u2019t any real time to develop them. We just got lore dumps on their personalities and half baked character arcs (NICO). The pacing ruined Ru\u2019s death to me. I know these moment was supposed to be crucial but it got glazed over because of the timeskips also like I said before Ru wasn\u2019t given much characterization.

Middle school read the hobbit and lord of the rings, read Harry Potter series, a song of ice and fire series, the stand by Stephen king and other popular longer books. </p> <p>I don\u2019t know what it is about becoming an adult but I\u2019m struggling to read these articulate and detailed books again. I\u2019ll be next to my wife in bed and she will read 50 pages in the time I read 5. Like I\u2019m struggling to understand everything I\u2019m reading. Could be exhaustion from working all day, then taking care of the kids then spending time with my wife then coming to bed to read, but it\u2019s just been a struggle. </p> <p>I thought I just needed audiobooks but it didn\u2019t help. I still mix up places and people and details. So I\u2019m thinking I just need to start on something simpler and build my way up. </p> <p>I\u2019ve been gifted the storm light archive by Brandon Sanderson and the first book of wheel of time by Robert Jordan. Books that get high praise ",
