If you're on Mac\nyour settings will probably be different: Select \"Metal\" instead of \"CUDA\" if you've got\nsomething like an M1 chip. For either device switch to GPU compute as it'll be faster, unless\nsomehow you have a device where your CPU is better.\n\n*IMPORTANT*\nWhen baking you typically want to go for .01, I think I did .003 which is a bit\ntoo small. If you have UVPackmaster3 you can set a pixel margin, if you're at 4k it should be\n32px, at 2k it should be 16px, 1k at 8px etc. Obviously it depends on your use case, but\nthose are recommended ranges!!\n\nCorrection:\n46:00 Sorry, accidental cut here, use the loop tools addon we installed and with those fa",
