        "description": "Phantom Brigade 2.0 Update Preview - SHOULD You PLAY It? Is It Worth it?\nIn this Fextralife video. I'm going to be showing you guys Phantom Brigade. This is a turn-based tactical RPG. I use the term RPG kind of loosely here because it has some RPG mechanics, as you will see, but I'm not sure I would call it a proper RPG in that way that you're thinking. And this game was actually released on both Epic and Steam in 2023, and it's been gaining popularity because of the constant improvements and tweaks the developers have been making to the game over the past 2 years.\n\nGet the game here: https://disobey.cc/PhantomBrigade_Fex\nSponsored by: Brace Yourself Games.\n\nTimestamp\n0:00 Phantom Brigade 2.0 Preview\n1:20 What is Phantom Brigade\n4:37 Pilots and Mechs\n6:47 What makes Phantom Brigade Different\n8:24 Rarity System\n10:01 Overworld\n11:22 Workshop\n11:49 Final Thoughts\n\nDon't forget to like the video and subscribe to our channel for more!\n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook: https://www.face",
