They must be able to reach the main server, but not the vice versa - An agent inside each workspace handles SSH access and exposes HTTP services running in the containers. - A CLI on the user\u2019s machine acts as an SSH proxy to connect to the workspaces.</p> <p>This architecture lets you distribute the workload across different machines and networks while keeping deployment relatively simple.</p> <p>I\u2019m particularly interested in feedback about security and scalability.</p> <p>Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/davidebianchi0",
