        "description": "Did you know one of literature's greatest successes originated as one of literature's biggest failures? Lawrence Connolly, the creator of a celebrated adaptation of Frankenstein in Pittsburgh, PA, explores the remarkable resilience of Mary Shelley in the face of adversity. In his talk, he delves into how Shelley\u2019s groundbreaking novel initially floundered upon its release, largely due to her defiance of literary conventions, personal struggles within her family, and other challenges. Through her story, Connolly highlights the powerful lessons of perseverance and the courage to push through failure in pursuit of greatness. Lawrence C. Connolly\u2019s books include the Veins Cycle novels and his collections include Visions, This Way to Egress, and Voices, which feature his stories from Amazing Stories, Cemetery Dance, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Twilight Zone, Year\u2019s Best Horror, and other top magazines and anthologies of fantasy, horror, and science fiction.\n\nVoices was nomin",

This powerful talk from a trauma therapist explores how air pollution, wildfire smoke, drought, and rising temperatures trigger anxiety, exhaustion, and climate grief that many mistake for personal failure rather than a natural response to environmental loss. Through compassionate, grounded solutions for regulating our bodies, we're reminded that there are many ways to care for ourselves in response to a world in crisis.  Born in Malaysia and forged through childhood trauma, Cindy Chia rose to international acclaim as a healer of hearts and minds. Founder of Aspire Psychological and featured by Forbes Council and Utah Business, she transforms pain into purpose, breaking cultural silence around mental health. Amid a changing climate, she helps patients face the grief of a warming world, showing that even in loss, resilience and hope can take root. This talk",

This condition is misunderstood, minimised and misdiagnosed. As a midiwfe and black woman, her journey exposes how racial bias and gaps in maternal healthcare silence women's suffering even in medical systems designed to protect them. Jemma calls for urgent awareness, compassionate diagnosis, and systemic change, reminding us that listeninng to women's voices is not only an act of care, but necessary to save lives. Jemma is the founder of The HG Midwife and Bumps & Bubbles CIC, a proud mum of three, and an award-winning midwife with more than 12 years of experience.

He challenges the traditional idea of limits, suggesting they are not fixed walls but subtle invitations urging us to grow beyond our comfort. Throughout his narrative, he highlights how fear, doubt, and inherited beliefs quietly shape these boundaries\u2014until we choose to question them.\n\nHis climb to the summit of Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa, becomes the emotional centre of the talk. The harsh cold, the long ascent, and the thin air reveal a deeper terrain: the inner landscape where resilience is tested and self-belief is rebuilt. For him, the mountain was never just a physical challenge; it was a place where he confronted his own hesitations and rediscovered his capacity to rise.\n\nMasarrat emphasises that courage is rarely dramatic. It appears in small, deliberate steps taken despite the presence of fear. He frames personal gr",
