It left this gaping void and me feeling hollow for a while after I finished it. I searched for others like it but found none that gave that intellectual high it gave. I&#39;ve watched Monster, Code Geass, Erased, Naruto, Terror in Resonance, Promised Neverland, Black Butler, Attack on Titan, Angels of Death, The Lost Village. I liked all but nothing came close to Death Note. I realised that maybe no anime would ever come close to it because its so unique. </p> <p>But I was wondering whether there&#39;s any anime out there similar to it? With an intense psychological duel, fast pacing, a deep bond between the two protagonists and a narrative style that is like a novel where we constantly and consistently see the inner monologues and thoughts of the characters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Anonymous_rts\"> /u/Anonymous_rts </a> <br/",

These are the shows he has watched so far:</p> <p>Naruto, My Hero Academia, Kaiju No 8, Jujutsu Kaisen (I was a bit iffy about him watching this one but it seems to be his favourite), One Punch Man, Solo Levelling, One Piece (he tends to dip in and out of this)</p> <p>He has asked what can he watch next. He asked for Attack on Titan but I said no to this one but not sure if I\u2019m being unreasonable after letting him watch JJK?</p> <p>I suggested Full Metal Alchemist. Do you think this is suitable? </p> <p>Does anyone have any more recommendations where to go next? He\u2019s quite mature and can handle some language and violence as long as it\u2019s not too intense.
