        "description": "it's interesting to see how a game like Where Winds Meet uses latest technology. After all, the Steam page doesn't indicate the use of procedural tools. So what gives? The answer is engaging chatting for some non-playable characters. \n\nEssentially, you type out responses, and they'll respond accordingly. It may seem simple, but as players have quickly discovered, it allows for various kinds of shenanigans. For example, there's a guard named Zhao Dali, who trains hard but isn't the most positive guy, going so far as to lament the point of training at all. \n\nYou can type out certain responses to slowly raise his self-esteem, and if things go well, it contributes to the Affection system.",

        "description": "A wave of exciting single-player titles is looming on the horizon, and it\u2019s very likely that these games might have flown right under your radar.

Some of these games have elements of multiplayer or co-op thanks to their hybrid nature, but each of these games can be completely enjoyed solo. With this video, we will be taking a look at 15 such games that you probably didn\u2019t see coming.",

        "description": "Kirby Air Riders is quietly positioning itself as the ultimate party game, pastel shades, bright flashes, and a boosting soundtrack overlay an easy to pick up racer. There\u2019s surprising depth here too, from numerous game modes, supplanting the title as a \u201cvehicle action game\u201d over just a racer, plus race tweaks, and plentiful customisation. \n\nThe real kicker though is that Kirby Air Riders is unashamedly built for together-on-the-sofa play. It\u2019s what Nintendo does best, games that are great online but downright joyous when played in the same room as your mates. \n\nThe ethos here, baked into every system, is accessibility and inclusiveness. A suite of thoughtful features, from colour filters and control schemes, to borders which reduce motion sickness, ensure this is truly a game which everyone can enjoy.",
