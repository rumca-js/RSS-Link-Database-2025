The Defence Secretary gave a speech at Downing Street that morning describing the move as \u201cdeeply dangerous.\u201d It comes on the same day that a report from MPs says that the UK lacks a plan to defend itself from a military attack.\n\nAdam and Chris speak to John Healey about the escalating threat to the UK, lifting the lid on what conflict looks like in a world of undersea drones and cables, and what is being done to shore up UK military defences in what Healey calls a \u201cnew era of threat.\u201d\n\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker.
