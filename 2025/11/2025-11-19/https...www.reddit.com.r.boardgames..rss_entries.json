I find myself setting up and taking down more and more games with tons of parts. I really enjoy setting up the games. Putting everything in their place, getting it all nice and organized, making sure everything is in reach of everyone. It&#39;s honestly relaxing to me and I love it when I&#39;m done and can look at the table before the chaos starts and just admire the game. I see so many people complain about set up, but I personally enjoy it. I&#39;m the host type so I also like getting it all set up for my group, and if it&#39;s a new game and everything is set up I can hook them right off the bat if the game has table presence. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SlaterTheOkay\"> /u/SlaterTheOkay </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1p0zx9i/did_anyone_else_enjoy_set",
