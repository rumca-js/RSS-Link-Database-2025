Instead, they transfigure random useless objects like rocks into food, drinks, clothing, even bricks for towers. Well, I was surprised <em>at first</em>. After a bit of thinking, I realised that it makes total sense. We&#39;re wizards, our one thing is that we do magic. I hereby ask you, why don&#39;t we abandon the outdated currency system and fully embrace wizardry?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheAndrewCR\"> /u/TheAndrewCR </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wizardposting/comments/1p1nu4n/why_does_the_council_impose_currency_on_us_we_can/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/wizardposting/comments/1p1nu4n/why_does_the_council_impose_currency_on_us_we_can/\">[comments]</a></span>",
