I would love to identify him here. But this man is very wealthy and very powerful, and I fear that he, too, might engage me in expensive, life-ruining litigation.</p> </blockquote> <p>So this is a seemingly bisexual man in Epstein&#39;s circle circa 2000-2002 who is rich, powerful, and potentially litigious. Who could this be?</p> <p>Googling around I saw that there is mention of one minor-aged anonymous male victim in press reports, but Epstein&#39;s experience with men could be an under-explored area.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/asveikau\"> /u/asveikau </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1p1klmb/who_do_you_think_epstein_was_gay_with/\">[link]</a><",
