I used Steam via Flatpak, but with some games like Arma 3, my mouse would always jump to the second monitor when moving.

I have experience with linux but i am by no means an advanced user yet so.

While i find it being arch based to be attractive in some ways and it does seem like arch based distros offers you a greater ability to customize the distro to your needs and that might be something i could be interested in down the line. I do worry about updates suddenly breaking everything and turning what would be a chill gaming session into a full day of troubles",

I didn\u00b4t want to switch to Linux because of the launcher and games compatibility, and because I had all my library well managed on Playnite, but the Playnite full-screen environment was simply not usable enough for me: whatever I tried, it was laggy, and it was uncomfortable to use on the TV.</p> <p>Well, now I am very happy with how Bazzite works and I think it is perfect for my gaming necessities. I mean, my PC is in a mid-range tier and I cannot play recent releases and heavy AAA games (and normally I am not that interested). But I REALLY miss how easy was the library management on Windows.

Often times, these native games didn&#39;t work properly with past Windows saves, either. It dawned on me one of my biggest concerns with Linux gaming blowing up is broken native ports that deter users away from a smooth experience. You can absolutely just switch to Proton and these issues magically disappear, but there&#39;s *tons* of games where this is a problem. </p> <p>What is to be done?

I have a YouTube channel where I cover gaming. I was so impressed with the possibility of the new steam machine that I made two videos about it. This is part two where I go over specific questions I have Plus I talk about how some of my concerns were asuaged.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TheHistoryVoyagerPod\"> /u/TheHistoryVoyagerPod </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://youtu.be/Lv531FUoALM?si=Z3W_jQQ3wfeqsPVP\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",

My main uses are gaming and programming, and I\u2019ve seen a ton of mixed opinions about both.</p> <p>I\u2019m comfortable with terminals and setting things up, I\u2019m just worried about choosing something that ends up not working well for my workflow.</p> <p>So if you daily-drive either one:</p> <p>How stable has it been for you? Any issues with gaming (Steam, Proton, Lutris, etc.)? How is it for developers long-term? Which one would you pick for a Windows user moving over for the first time?</p> <p>Would love to hear real experiences before I install anything.
