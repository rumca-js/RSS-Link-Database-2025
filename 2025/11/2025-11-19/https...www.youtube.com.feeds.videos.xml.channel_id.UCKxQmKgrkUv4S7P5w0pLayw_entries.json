        "description": "One World Under Doom (2025) Issue 9\n\n\u25b8 FINALE! Doom has confronted all of Earth's heroes in battle - and he's won. What's more, he's used the magical power of Sorcerer Supreme to ensure that this victory has become a fixed moment in time: a thing that will stand forever, impervious to magic or time travel alike. But unbeknownst to Doom, in that climatic moment that can now never be changed, the seeds of Doom's downfall were also fixed for all eternity. Left with an intolerable defeat that cannot be changed, Doom makes a choice he can never undo - and the rest of the world will pay his price... ...it all comes down to this in the big finale of ONE WORLD UNDER DOOM! PLUS: If the Sorcerer Supreme falls, who will rise to take his place?
