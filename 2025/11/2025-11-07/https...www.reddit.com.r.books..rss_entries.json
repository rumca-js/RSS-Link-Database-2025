They were both hardcover bound in dark crimson red leather (or leather-like stuff, idk), with gilt printing on the cover, one or two full-page coloured illustrations on glossy paper, and a few black and white line drawings- none of which were very good or memorable.

The cast of characters is varied and they all have a purpose in the world that he&#39;s trying to create.
