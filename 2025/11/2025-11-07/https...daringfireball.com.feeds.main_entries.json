Mostly,\nthese icons seem dumbed-down, with a loss of detail. For example,\nhere\u2019s Safari\u2019s old icon from MacOS 15 (Sequoia) on the left, and\nthe new Tahoe icon on the right:</p>\n\n<p><img\n  src = \"https://i0.wp.com/onefoottsunami.com/wp-content/uploads/2025-11-terribletahoeicons/safari.jpg\"\n  alt = \"Safari\u2019s icons from MacOS 15 Sequoia and 26 Tahoe.\"\n  width = 475 \n/></p>\n\n<p>To me, the new icon just feels blander, and that\u2019s widely true for\nall of the updated icons.
