The game is advertised and described as a 4X in general, but when I look at the actions the majority of them seem to be related to either acquiring or converting the resources. Am I right ? I love exploration and expansion games, but I&#39;m not sure if I want something that makes me constantly have to calculate how much each resource can I swap for a different one so I can buy/build particular building that will give me even more resource... </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Torello77\"> /u/Torello77 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1or8a60/brazil_imperial_4x_or_euro/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/commen",

I am more into party games where the rules are flexible and you can &#39;check in/check out&#39; easily (Monikers is my absolute favorite!). I want to enjoy some games with everyone and not feel frustrated when someone says &quot;let&#39;s play a game!&quot;</p> <p>I enjoyed Escape the Dark Castle and my husband was super into it. I also really like Patchwork. Almost all my people play Magic but it is too much for me. I am on the spectrum and get overwhelmed really easily with complex rules or a lot of reading.

I have played It&#39;s a Wonderful World on BGA solo several times, and have played Furnace with the unofficial solo variant (2 dummies) from BGG on Tabletopia.</p> <p>The two major differences between the games for me appeared to be as follows:</p> <p>--It&#39;s a Wonderful World offered more variety in engines, but was a lot more subject to the card draw and draft going your way (you can just not get any scoring cards that align with what you have already made). I suppose in multiplayer you can hate draft against your opponent, but even that has limits and cannot affect them getting dealt a better hand or there being multiple choices for them, but few for you by just luck. In Furnace, the engines are not as varied, but your ability to at least get something you can use seems fairly high given that most of the card deck is used each game.</p> <p>--It&#39;s a Wonderful Worl",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello i have been thinking of getting terra mystica big box. now there is apparently a special edition that brings everything the game has in the big box plus game mats and fan made faction mats. The price for all of that is around 230 i beleive with all the bling. taking into consideration the tarrifs it would be around maybe $300 shipped, thats a lot of money for a game lol. i can get the big box for 120, are the fan made factions worth it or nah. i think im better of making them on my own. What are your thoughts regarding the special edition coming out</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OilPrestigious1586\"> /u/OilPrestigious1586 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oqitqs/terra_mystica_gamefound/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1oqitqs/terra_mystica_gamefound/\">[comments]</a></span>",

(Yes, I&#39;m sometimes one of those people, but I&#39;ve talked to others who also feel the same.) For completionist folks who enjoy collecting as much as playing, this now means they need to camp out for the Endgame window to start since nobody knows",
