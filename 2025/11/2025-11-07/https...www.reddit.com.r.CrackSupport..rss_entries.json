        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I play the sims, and a couple of months ago I discovered anadius and downloaded every pack that I didn&#39;t already have for the sims 4, and I did this with no issues and was able to play the game smoothly. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve had time to sit down and play and when I try to open my save, my game says that I don&#39;t have the packs installed and I can&#39;t play my save (because she lives in a world that I downloaded off of anadius). I tried to move the folder with all of the anadius downloads into my mods folder. That allowed me to at least view the world where my household lives, but when i click to play on the household it just glitches and brings me back to the world selection screen. How do I fix this so I can go back to playing as normal?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fluffy-Solid1179\"> /u/Fluffy-Solid1179 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport",
