Games such as Cube 2, Doom and recently FEAR - all of which have their limitations and advantages. I wanted to get into FEAR, but due to needing visual studio 2003 it&#39;s near impossible, right? I&#39;ve been using ArchNoah but it&#39;s very laborious.</p> <p>What I&#39;m asking here is what game allows the easiest access to placing audio objects or hooks within the code which I can then save and compile? Or at least demonstrate?</p> <p>Doom is good for this using GZdoom, but limited in it&#39;s implementation.</p> <p>Are they&#39;re any games that can be accessed that would be recommended to showcase some design work?</p> <p>How does Quake fair with this kind of accessibility",
