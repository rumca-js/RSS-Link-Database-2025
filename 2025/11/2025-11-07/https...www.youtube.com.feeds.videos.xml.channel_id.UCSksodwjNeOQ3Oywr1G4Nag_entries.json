        "description": "Is this the most over engineered way to cool an @OLIPOP ?\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n Inspired by @outsidebrendan I wanted to see if I could make a drink-cooling contraption Engineezy style using a drill powered pump, some gears, and a cooler filled with below freezing water. Using a thermal camera I was able to measure the temperature of the drink after a couple minutes in the machine and I was shocked by the results!\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n#olipop #ad #engineering #mechanicalengineering #overengineered",
