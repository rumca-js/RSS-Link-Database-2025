I\u2019ve been running a few small services on a Raspberry Pi for a few years to cover my personal needs, but recently I decided to streamline my deployment process. Since there were many moving parts, I documented everything to make future updates easier \u2014 and that eventually turned into an article describing how it all works and how I set it up.</p> <p>In short, my home server runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB) and uses Docker to manage most services (except the GitHub Actions runner, which runs directly on the host). The source code is stored on GitHub, with Docker Hub as the image registry. CI/CD is handled by GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL is used as the database, and Caddy serves as the reverse proxy. External access is secured through a Cloudflare Tunnel.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in the details, here\u2019s the full write-up on dev.to: <a href=\"https://dev.to/alex_p_3aad3da0",
