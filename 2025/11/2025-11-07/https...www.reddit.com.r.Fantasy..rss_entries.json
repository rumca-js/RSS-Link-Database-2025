First up, i love how high fantasy this series is, especially the fact that there arent tons of set rules for doing magic. There&#39;s always new advancements in magic, just like science and i absolutely love it. There&#39;s way too many magic systems out there that have fixed rules and it becomes predictable and boring.</p> <p>Second, i love how many creatures there are in this series and how many important ones there are. I&#39;ve looked through tons of posts requesting books that are filled with creatures and this series is never mentioned, which is wild to me.</p> <p>That said, i was hoping for some recommendations. Doesn&#39;t have to have both, preferably the high fantasy and magic thing being a priority, but i wouldn&#39;t complain about a series with creatures also.</p> <p>Edit: I also enjoyed the warlock system and it not being just for pacting with evil beings/demons. It might not be uncommon but it was a first for me",

I&#39;ve looked at goodreads, YouTube, the only response I&#39;ve seen are a couple of ARC reviews from people that got the book months ago. You&#39;d think at least TOR would be rolling out the marketing machine or something. It seems to me like nobody even knows the book has come out.

Where the length of a day or a year is noticeably different to what we have on Earth?</p> <p>Note: I&#39;m thinking specifically of fantasy stories here rather than science fiction - the likes of Lord of the Rings, Narnia, Codex Aleria, the Belgariad, Game of Thrones which are not explicitly set on Earth. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/statisticus\"> /u/statisticus </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/c",

I&#39;m looking for something that would primarily be described as fantasy and secondarily described as horror. Also as a note I&#39;m not necessarily looking for grimdark. I know there is probably a large overlap with what I&#39;m asking for and grimdark, but that is not exactly what I&#39;m looking for.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Capt-Choco\"> /u/Capt-Choco </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1oqhoyv/recommendations_for_fantasy_horror/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1oqhoyv/recommendations_for_fantasy_horror/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Near daylight honestly. There wasn\u2019t a general color theme to set a mood but all random colors flashing after one another like blue green pink yellow red\u2026.

Whilst some guests definitely put some effort in their outfits, a fair number did not (no shame in that, not everyone has the time or means and it\u2019s ok) and having such bright lighting only highlighted it and gave it a cheap prom vibe. There were some other rooms with bar, booths etc, and they were dimly lit and the mood was just 1000 times better.</p> <p>I was also ",
