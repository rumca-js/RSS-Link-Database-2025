In this talk I will describe the fundamentals of data building, along with tips and techniques used to improve performance and efficiency of such systems in AAA game development.\n\nI will introduce the basics of data building, briefly describe the differences between how the game code and data building code operate, how those differences impact processing performance, how a profiler can be used to identify trouble spots, and describe techniques I used to improve overall processing performance.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJoin think-cell as a C++ Developer and work on cutting-edge challenges with a focus on code excellence, innovation, and working alongside an international team of experts \u2014 apply no",
