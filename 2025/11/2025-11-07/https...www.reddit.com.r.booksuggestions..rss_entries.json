Vampires, werewolves, faeries, mermaids, dark carnivals, angels and demons, trained thieves/assassins - whatever&#39;s on the shelf, I want to read it. The problem is, I keep trying them and being disappointed. They&#39;re TOO YA and too tropey for me. (No shade to those who like them, they&#39;re obviously popular for a reason and we all have different tastes.) Examples of things I want to like and can&#39;t get through - Twilight, Holly Black, Sarah J Maas, Cassandra Clare. </p> <p>Anybody have recommendations for books that use these tropes but take the writing up a notch? Can be YA or adult. The only exception is that I&#39;m not a big fan of fairy tale re-tellings. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/larkharrow\"> /u/larkharrow </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1or8h4o/ya_fa",

Now I love reading books but I&#39;m not exactly the kind of person who knows all the great authors and famous books. I&#39;m someone who enjoys reading <strong>supernatural horror, science fiction, fantasy/fairy tales</strong>, and it can range from random children&#39;s story books and all the way to Novels designated for highschool students.<br/> With that being said, my teacher would most probably want us to read something that corresponds to C1/C2 English. However, the problem that often arises is that a lot of these contemporary novels include lots of s*xual content, which I strictly avoid. I would be really grateful if you guys could suggest me fictional books which could fit my interests :))</p> <p>P.S.: I highly prefer the genres I mentioned above, but there&#39;s no problem if the book do",

THEN i got into Fourth Wing..... sat my ass on my couch and read the first book in 1 day. I also enjoyed The Serpent &amp; Wings of Night, Shield of Sparrows, and The Knight and the Moth.</p> <p>Every book since Fourth Wing just isn&#39;t really doing it for me. It took me a whole month to get through Malibu Burning, and I tried Arcana Academy and QuickSilver but they were meh.

So far I&#39;ve read Man&#39;s search for meaning - great quotes, good imagery, The Folk of the Air series - had me hooked like the pages were lined with crack, White Nights - great writing but boring storyline, great quotes, The Honjin Murders - had me hooked, great plot, good pace but the writing was a bit too plain for me.

I resonate strongly with characters who feel estranged from the world around them as they wrestle with their mind and self.</p> <p>The best example I could provide would be <em>Milk Outside a Bag of Milk Outside a Bag of Milk</em>. While it is a visual novel, the style of writing is addicting. I absolutely fell in love with the atmosphere and conflict within the protagonist. The journey from conscious inner ramblings to surreal daydream sequences and nightmares packed with symbolism was enthralling.</p> <p>I love the unsettling atmosphere of works like this and I would love to find more.

Her reading level is quite good for her age but she tends to pick books below her level. </p> <p>She enjoyed reading the wild robot but said she didn&#39;t like &quot;the sad ending&quot; of the first book. </p> <p>She has also enjoyed the Sophie Mouse books, and most recently, Pippi Longstocking. She enjoys books with a spunky protagonist like Pippi or Junie B Jones, and loves books with humour especially. She also really enjoys books with animals! </p> <p>She has vetoed most of my picks like Charlotte&#39;s Web, Magic Tree House, Anne of Green Gables and doesn&#39;t care for Roald Dahl (she read the BFG last year). </p> <p>Thanks so much!!

Obviously, it doesn&#39;t have to be this exactly, but the premise is: A sassy teen girl from the city (hopefully she is an academically oriented student) accidentally time travels (or maybe dimension hops) into a medieval world and bumps into a teenage prince (he can have magic or maybe not) and he is baffled and obsessed with her because she is very futuristic and extermely smart. They have a romantic subplot while they go have to fight a war/start a rebellion/end colonialism/add whatever heroic plot into here--- and she helps win by her wits(but in her training montage she sucks lol) and then she has to make a found family there.
