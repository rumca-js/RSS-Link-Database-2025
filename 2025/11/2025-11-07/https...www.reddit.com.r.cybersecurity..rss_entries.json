For 4 years, I&#39;ve worked in technical writing at two of the top IAM companies for cloud software documentation for PKI and TLS certificate management tools. 80% of my job is project management, cross-functional comms with several company stakeholders, and internal detective work. I then write my gathered materials from research, interviewing, etc., into user-friendly docs. I also perform user research by recruiting users and have presented data and evidence to improve our software UX to senior leadership. Lastly, I am somewhat technical and I build Python scripts to automate doc auditing and linting within our CI/CD pipelines. I&#39;ve also audited our docs to ensure security vulnerabilities and sensitive data are not included, as engineers tend to throw a lot of rough drafts at me with info that can&#39;t be leaked to external stakeholders. </p> <p>Tech writers hit their salary ceil",
