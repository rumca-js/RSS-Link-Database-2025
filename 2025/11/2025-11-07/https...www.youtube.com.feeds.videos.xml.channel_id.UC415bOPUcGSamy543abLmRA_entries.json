Turns out, the secret isn\u2019t muscles\u2026.it\u2019s a stretchy protein that dictates the folding pattern, kind of like origami!\n\nWe\u2019ve taken inspiration from nature to help us engineer telescopes and solar panels, making it easier to launch things into space or build emergency shelters here on earth\n\nFor more optimistic science and tech stories, subscribe!\n\n#shorts #insect #science #origami #telescope",
