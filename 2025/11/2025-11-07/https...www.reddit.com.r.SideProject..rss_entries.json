Now I\u2019m thinking of taking it more seriously and possibly releasing it once I finish. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on the concept. Do you think a habit building app like this is worth pursuing further?</p> <p>The current name for the app is <a href=\"https://atomicsteps.lovable.app/\">AtomicSteps</a>, and I\u2019ve put together a quick website with some designs and a short overview of the problem it\u2019s trying to solve.
