While we often pride ourselves on our public healthcare, the reality is grim.

Rural areas face severe doctor shortages, forcing people to travel hundreds of kilometres for care \u2014 conditions you\u2019d expect in developing nations, not G7 economies.</p> <p>Infrastructure? Every winter, roads crumble, pipes burst, and public transit collapses under normal weather conditions. Major cities like Toronto and Montreal have chronic underfunding in transit and housing infrastructure \u2014 the kind of urban decay critics associate with mismanaged developing countries.
