They are not entirely wrong are they? At what point does the process of focusing on privacy get too extreme? Switching email providers? Switching to a privacy focused OS? Getting rid of conventional social media entirely? Hosting your own matrix homeserver for all chats? Or living off the grid entirely in a forest? But that doesn&#39;t mean you should just resort to giving away all of your data, and doing nothing about it, does it? Like any other argument, this also requires some nuance, so I want to bring forward five points, and ask the subreddit on what they think of it:</p> <ol> <li><p>&quot;Everyone uses these platforms, and you&#39;re not some special person whose data is worth spying on, so why shouldn&#39;t we use them freely, when millions if not billions exchange private information through these apps?&quot;</p></li> <li><p>At some point, ",
