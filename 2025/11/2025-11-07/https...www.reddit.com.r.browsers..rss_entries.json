I took the opposite approach: build the best tab manager, period.</p> <p>What it does:</p> <p>One-Click Save: Instantly save tabs to projects/lists</p> <p>Smart Workspaces: Organize by project, not folders</p> <p>Cross-Device Sync: Access tabs anywhere</p> <p>AI Sorting: When you have 50+ tabs open, AI can organize them for you (optional, only when useful)</p> <p>Privacy-First: No third party, everything hosted in Germany </p> <p>Chrome + Firefox: Both browsers (MV3)</p> <p>The difference: <a href=\"http://tab9.me\">tab9.me</a> doesn&#39;t try to replace your workflow. It just manages tabs really well. The AI is there when you need it - like autocomplete for text - but the core value is fast",
