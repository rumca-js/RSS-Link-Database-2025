But one game they don&#39;t have listed on their site that someone a couple of years ago had a cover for was &quot;Spanky&#39;s Quest&quot; for SNES. It seems now whenever I search for the game in the forums, to get the cover art - I get banned. I guess it&#39;s from keyword searching. IDK but it&#39;s annoying and there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to reach out to them, or if there is, I can&#39;t get to it because I&#39;m banned.</p> <p>Also, most of TCP SNES section hasn&#39;t been touched in years and most of the links are dead in the forums.</p> <p>Any help would be appreciated, thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/abyssea\"> /u/abyssea </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1oqwdah/looking_for_alternative_site_for_ugc_covers/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retro",
