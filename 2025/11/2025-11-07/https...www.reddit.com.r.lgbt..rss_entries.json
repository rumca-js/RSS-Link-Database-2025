I really want to watch the movie \u201cI saw the tv glow\u201d but I\u2019m afraid that if I watch it, I may not be able to go back. I\u2019m not sure what my gender is. I\u2019m happy being a girl, and I want to get married and have children and such, but sometimes I wish I was a boy. If afraid that if I watch \u201cI saw the tv glow\u201d it may finally clear things up for me, and I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what I want. I\u2019m not sure I want to know if I prefer being a girl. I\u2019ve thought about just soldiering through it until college, because then I can leave everyone I know behind and change myself, and nobody else in the place where I go will know who I am. I\u2019m really conflicted.

And I began to realize that I don&#39;t care what pronouns people use because I don&#39;t care. And I feel like gender is just a label, like it doesn&#39;t matter because in the end, what is gender, what is it to be a boy? What is it to be a girl? I don&#39;t know, I just feel that I exist, and people can use whatever pronouns they want because I don&#39;t care. With all this in mind, where am I going with this? I&#39;d like to know if there&#39;s a name for this and if you could answer these questions. What does gender mean to you? What does it mean to be a boy to you? What does being a girl mean to you? If you are of a different gender, you can also respond with that gender. Thanks :3</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/E",
