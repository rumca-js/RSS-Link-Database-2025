The problem? \u201cNo&nbsp;one would play the character!\u201d he says, sitting, impeccably suited as always, in a room at London\u2019s Corinthia Hotel. As it turns out, the material was just waiting for the right actor. Step up Matt Smith to play the titular sex-addicted travelling makeup salesman.</p><p>It\u2019s not surprising that it ended up being Smith. Since his Doctor Who days, he has tended to pick roles that trend slightly twisted \u2013 and the role of Bunny, who in Cave\u2019s book is depicted as a borderline animalistic mi",
