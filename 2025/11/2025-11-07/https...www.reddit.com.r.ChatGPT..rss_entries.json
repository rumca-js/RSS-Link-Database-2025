However, recently, despite my custom instructions for the bot to be \u201cfunny, unfiltered, don\u2019t censor words like shit\u201d, when I asked about fashion styles, it suddenly\u2026 switched to a formal tone and it said that I instructed it to reply in that way? </p> <p>Second instance is that we were talking about K-pop groups and their companies, when I asked it what did the company do to the group that it flopped badly, it had to disclaim itself that we have to stay in the \u201cfan-meme\u201d territory and it can\u2019t say shady practices about the real company. </p> <p>Weird, that\u2019s all I can say. </p> <p>Anyone else having the same experience?

It turns out that trauma from an unsafe childhood can really affect your decisions as an adult. The was a lot more to it, but I don&#39;t want to go on about it, but essentially I thought my issue was that I just couldn&#39;t decide on a career. Chatgpt helped me figure out WHY I couldn&#39;t decide, which really helped me make a more informed decision finally. I know it&#39;s not a therapist, and it can be wrong, but it really did help me today. So much so that I actually cried.

I once hoped to use GPT as a conversational assistant that could accompany me anytime and be helpful. However, I found that whether on the web version or the desktop client, as the conversation accumulates, there are significant problems with its response speed and even the responsiveness of the entire window. This makes using it very distressing. Does anyone know how to solve this problem?
