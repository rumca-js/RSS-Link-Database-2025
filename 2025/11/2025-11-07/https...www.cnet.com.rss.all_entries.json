Not only is it the number one watched title on Netflix of all-time, but it's the first soundtrack EVER to have 4 tracks in the Billboard Top 10 at the same time. KPOP Demon Hunters isn't just a great movie with killer music, it's much more than that. What we are witnessing is a once-in-a-generation success story. So what made KPOP Demon Hunters the golden hit of 2025? I'm going to show you how it's done. (\"How it's done, done, done!\")",
