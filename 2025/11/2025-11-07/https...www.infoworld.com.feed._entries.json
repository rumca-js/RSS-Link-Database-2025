As enterprises migrate from traditional infrastructures to the cloud, they often do so without a clear strategy to mitigate risk, or they fail to set up an ecosystem that fosters innovation and accountability. That\u2019s why governance has emerged as the most important topic in cloud computing today, and why I, alongside my co-author Meredith Stein, decided to address it in our new book,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unlocking-Power-Cloud-Governance-Intelligence/dp/311161710",
