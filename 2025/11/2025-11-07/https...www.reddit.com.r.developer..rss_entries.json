My job is to help the team develop and maintain a HUGE legacy C++ framework. \u200bI honestly thought I was improving my skills, mainly because our team has never failed to deliver a sprint since I joined.</p> <p>\u200bHowever, today my team lead admitted that he basically never had time to properly look at my code before. When he finally did, he ended up having to refactor parts of it. \u200bNow I feel completely stupid. I feel like I not only wrote &quot;wrong&quot; stuff, but that I also wasted my senior dev&#39;s time fixing it. To make matters worse, I have this sinking feeling that I wasn&#39;t actually improving at all\u2014it was all just hidden by a lack of code review.</p> <p>\u200bI&#39;m just here to ask if other devs have ever felt this way? Like you&#39;re pushing yourself 100%, only to discover it still wasn&#39;t enough.</p> <p>\u200bSorry for the wall of text.</p> </",
