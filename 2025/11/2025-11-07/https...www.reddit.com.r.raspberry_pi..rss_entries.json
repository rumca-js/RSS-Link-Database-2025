I currently have:</p> <ul> <li>Sony A7 camera</li> <li>Raspberry Pi Zero 2w</li> </ul> <p>I have the Raspberry Pi set up to use gphoto2 to take a picture once per minute. It&#39;s connected to the Sony camera via a USB cable. All of this is being powered via an AC adapter, <a href=\"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www.theuglytrucks.com/long_term_photo_layout.png\">a diagram of the setup is here.</a></p> <p>I keep hitting a problem with this setup though - over long periods of time (days, but sometimes up to a few weeks) the camera will just no longer be recognized by gphoto2 on the Raspberry Pi. The errors look like this:</p> <pre><code>An error occurred in the io-library (&#39;Unspecified error&#39;): No error description available 2025-10-30 18:24:58,599 - ERROR - Photo capture failed: *** Error *** PTP General Error </code></pre> <p>I&#39;ve posted <a href=\"https://www.reddit.",
