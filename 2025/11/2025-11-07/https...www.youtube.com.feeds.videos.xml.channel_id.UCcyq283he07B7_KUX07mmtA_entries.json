        "description": "Sponsored by American Express \n\nHusband-and-wife cofounders Polly and Julian Buxton built their bookstore and tour company on the belief that storytelling has the power to bring people together. What began as a dream shared on their first date has grown into a beloved gathering spot on Charleston\u2019s King Street where visitors can browse books, attend author events, and explore the city\u2019s past on walking tours inspired by Julian\u2019s book The Ghosts of Charleston. \n\nEvery experience at Buxton Books is rooted in history, mystery, and connection, and as the business continues to grow, Polly and Julian remain focused on quality and purpose. With support from the American Express Shop Small\u00ae Resource Hub, they have access to insights and tools that help them adapt strategically and ensure Buxton Books continues to be a stage for every story.  \n\nSee how American Express helps businesses like Buxton Books write their next chapter of success: https://www.americanexpress.com/us/merchant/shop-small",
