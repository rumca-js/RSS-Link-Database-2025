        "description": "For the first time since Donald Trump's re-election there is renewed optimism among Democrats, after Zohran Mamdani and other candidates won big. \n\nAlongside the win in New York and the governor races in New Jersey and West Virginia, the party also won important \u2013 albeit less glamorous \u2013 races in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nIn this episode, Justin, Anthony and Sarah are joined by Jim Messina, a Democrat strategist and former deputy chief of staff to Barack Obama. He gives his take on what he thinks lies behind Tuesday\u2019s wins, what he thinks the party has learned since 2024 and whether he agrees with Prop 50 - the redistricting measures passed in California to redraw the state\u2019s political lines to favour Democrats.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

Meanwhile, on the diplomatic front, some analysts are pointing to Turkey\u2019s apparent pivot away from Russian oil purchases as evidence that new US sanctions are beginning to bite.\n\nTo answer your questions, Lucy Hockings is joined in the Ukrainecast studio by the BBC\u2019s Europe digital editor Paul Kirby and senior digital journalist Laura Gozzi, as well as diplomatic correspondent James Landale from Kyiv. Could Ukraine develop its own nuclear weapons? Will a Swedish aircraft become a gamechanger? And would the seizure of frozen Russian assets held in Belgium really discourage external investment in Europe?",
