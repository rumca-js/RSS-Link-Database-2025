        "description": "PEX A bend support tips\u2026I bought PEX bend supports to eliminate extra fittings, save on material costs and reduce the chance of water leaks. These bend supports are from @sharkbiteplumbing and available in plastic or metal. The metal supports have a tighter radius and are great for small areas, like shower valve projects. Definitely worth checking out. Many thanks to SharkBite for being a sponsor \ud83d\udd25#plumbing #showerremodel #sharkbiteplumbing #homerepairtutor #brandpartner",
