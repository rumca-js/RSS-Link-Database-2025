Is it possible to run just the Docker Engine as a background daemon without ever starting the GUI? I only use the CLI (docker, docker-compose) anyway. If I quit the GUI, <code>docker ps</code> doesn&#39;t work anymore, so is it the intended way to run it with GUI and not headless?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Just_Independent2174\"> /u/Just_Independent2174 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1or0ox4/how_to_run_only_the_daemon_without_docker_desktop/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1or0ox4/how_to_run_only_the_daemon_without_docker_desktop/\">[comments]</a></span>",
