        "description": "The secret to reducing childhood anxiety is actually quite simple: just let kids do more stuff on their own, says Lenore Skenazy, cofounder and president of Let Grow, an organization dedicated to normalizing childhood independence. In conversation with TED\u2019s Whitney Pennington Rodgers, Skenazy discusses why parenting has become more demanding in our safety-obsessed world \u2014 and offers a more joyful, trusting alternative to helicopter parenting, with tangible steps for how to start safely (and sanely) letting your kids grow.
