They have my $$ and do not seem interested in filling the order or even planning to fill it after 5 weeks. I question the ethics of taking customers $$ without having the product in stock.

A few days ago I experienced an MPD error which I couldn&#39;t resolve. So I decided to re-install Moode Audio Player. The latest Raspberry Pi Imager didn&#39;t have Moode Audio as an option anymore, so I downloaded the image from GitHub and tried a custom install. After booting my Pi it seemed to load ok until it was time for the GUI to show. It stayed stuck in the Login prompt.<br/> I tried editing the .ini file but no succes. After this I downgraded Pi Imager but still Moode Audio was gone from the options. I did however have the customization options which didn&#39;t show in the latest Pi Imager. But still, with all settings the same as the last install that worked fine, it gets stuck on the Login prompt.</p> <p>I tried several Moode Audio images, mainly the 32bit ones. But no luck.
