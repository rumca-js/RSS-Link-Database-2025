I am drawn to the more strategic and thinky vibe of Ankh, but I can\u2019t tell how much I\u2019m into the god powers, and I\u2019m really put off by the idea of additional boxes of content/the idea that the game is intended to be expanded. Overall, though, I was feeling like Ankh was the better buy for me, gameplay wise.</p> <p>But then I saw Kemet: Blood and Sand on sale as well and started doing more research this weekend. I can see why it\u2019s a classic. It seems like a very tightly designed game. </p> <p>What\u2019s your take on the two now that Ankh has been around a while.

Some say it\u2019s the best game they\u2019ve ever played though not all planets are amazing, and other people say the puzzle is too tight and you basically fail the first time to \u201cunderstand\u201d what you need to do and then just have to follow the exact \u201croute\u201d or strategy the game expects you to in order to not lose.</p> <p>What is everyone\u2019s thoughts?

The thing is though, I tried playing with my mom and sister and, I can&#39;t tell if we are just misunderstanding the rules, but, every single attempt resulted in us getting obliterated within 2 rounds. And all of that is on the tutorial boss with no extra difficulty options.</p> <p>First game: by the time we completed the first round, all the player already had taken 4 to 5 damage points.</p> <p>Second game: we tried different positioning at first, completed the first round, my sister received 6 damage before she got to play her first turn. Second round starts, we try to help, she takes more damage during mine and my mom&#39;s turn, goes to 0, her turn starts, game over.</p> <p>Third game: I suggest maybe we have to be more aggressive and take down the boss ",

I thought it would be fun to have him paint a whole set for a game and then 10 years down the line we could actually play it with his terribly painted minis. Most games with minis are more fantasy or sci-fi themed. Would love to know if there are any more lighthearted themes such as nature animals or in that same vein.

It takes time for me to learn the rules, and I even practice how I\u2019m going to explain them so the group can pick things up easily. And when we start, I\u2019m expected to take the first turn to \u201cshow how it\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p>It&#39;s a new game and we haven&#39;t &quot;warmed up.&quot; And sometimes I make mistakes. Maybe I forget a rule or realize mid-game that I missed something important. And instead of being understanding, some people start trashing me or poking fun. Honestly, it sucks. </p> <p>For me, the point of board games isn\u2019t just winning. It\u2019s hanging out, interacting, and having fun together. But lately it\u2019s felt like a chore, especially when some people seem to be waiting to call me out, or they get annoyed because they can\u2019t win easily and start trying to tweak the rules to get an advantage.</p> <p>Does anyone else go thro",
