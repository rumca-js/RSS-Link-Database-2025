But there are times when he doesn&#39;t keep a penny. He&#39;s says to Saint that without the money, the charities will never find Grace. But the homeless people aren&#39;t looking for her. And sure, he grew up poor, but there is no mention of him giving any of the money he earns from his paintings to charity. So why? Just why?<",
