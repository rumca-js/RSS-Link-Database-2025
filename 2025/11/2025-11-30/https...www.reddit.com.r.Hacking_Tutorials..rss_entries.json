It&#39;s no secret that any server on the internet, whether public or not, always exists, attackrd by fucking idiots who log in as root. Yes, you can create a custom user or, even better, an SSH key. But I have a question: where do these geniuses get so many IP addresses? What kind of software do they use that even schoolchildren can attack? I know these are relatively safe attacks, but maybe you know of a more interesting example of an attack on SSH and a server?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Legal_Flatworm_9543\"> /u/Legal_Flatworm_9543 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1pavmah/im_tired_of_schoolchildren_attacking_the_server/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1pavmah/im_tired_of_schoolchildren_attacking_the_server/\">[comments]</a></span>",
