As for games, I&#39;ve been able to install most Steam games without problems; Elden Ring runs even with anti-cheat software. Monster Hunter, Dark Souls, all perfect. And I&#39;m not so attached to Riot that I&#39;d switch to Windows just to play TFT or League of Legends.</p> <p>But the internet speed problem continues to bother me. Outside of Steam, Genshin Impact took me four days to download because it&#39;s so slow, and I try it with a PC with windows on the same internet and download faster. I tried to fix it, and I&#39;m not sure if I even made it worse.</p> <p>In any case, I&#39;v",

The main dev is now full time on Playtron-OS.</p> <p>Then I checked Bottles: the devs made a post about the lack of donations, another one in August... then no news since then. There is periodic releases but that&#39;s not so encouraging.</p> <p>At last I checked Heroic : the last non-fix release is from July.</p> <p>So overall, to my eyes, it seems that the development around the non-steam launchers slowed down a lot.</p> <p>Is steam working &quot;so well&quot; that the need of others launchers reduced? Are the projects mature enough and needs less development? Are new launchers raising?</p> <p>Edit: adding details for lutris</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/_patator_\"> /u/_patator_ </a> <br",

I&#39;m on an OLED Monitor, and 7900XT gpu and 7800X3D cpu. My monitor is 175hz and I&#39;ve set a 175fps cap in mangohud (global enable). Turning that off didn&#39;t really fix it. When i turned on vsync in duckov, the stuttering mostly stopped, except when opening a menu, then there&#39;s always a pretty strong stutter. I also have a second monitor that&#39;s 1080p 144hz, capped in kde to 100hz for idle power reasons. It&#39;s also causing issues with full screen videos in a browser, where there&#39;s often a heavy stutter when hovering my mouse from the video on the left screen to my other monitor.
