The rumor is that NVIDIA will stop bundling memory with GPUs to partners, which we worry will result in worse partner pricing for board vendors and higher prices (while giving an advantage to the first-party NVIDIA FE cards). The good news is that prices have fallen, so at least for now, things have improved. The MSRP is still too high in a lot of cases, but it's certainly better than the huge price overhead on top of MSRP back in June. This video goes through the pricing updates for NVIDIA's RTX 50 series GPUs, AMD's RX 9070 XT and 9070 GPUs, and Intel's B580 and B570 video cards. High-end cards like NVIDIA's RTX 5090 have only gone up in price, and that one will also be most impacted by VRAM price hikes. For anyone looking for the best GPUs to buy for new gaming PCs, this video will help you figure ",
