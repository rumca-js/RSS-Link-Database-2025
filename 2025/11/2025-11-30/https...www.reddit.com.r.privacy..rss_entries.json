Problem is I\u2019m worried they WILL pass, and that\u2019s gonna have some nasty ramifications for privacy in general. I\u2019m sick of the whole age verification laws. Our politicians need to be replaced, but digital rights are usually take a backseat with voters. The petition to repeal the UK\u2019s Online Safety bill got wiped up the arse, and I sure as hell have no trust in reform, and in the US, they\u2019re trying to fastlane it.</p> <p>It feels like we are losing to the moral panic, and paying a dear price for it. I wish for a resolution to change things to at most go back to pre-ID check times, or at least find a standard that is both universal AND anonymized. The latter does not fix the net neutrality or free speech infringements that are most of the laws in committee on that day.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",

I routinely get job alerts from Glassdoor for roles posted tailored for my skills, most of those are far too old to be of use, however I am seeing it spit back alerts on jobs I have applied to 24 hrs previously directly on company sites that I am finding 100% outside of any browsing in Glassdoor. So my question: is this data being culled from doing the applications in Chrome or the emails the companies are sending me in my job hunt puppet account to verify they have received my application? This doesn&#39;t even include what Google is providing to Glassdoor as a service tracking what I apply for. Have set up a proton account and will be using DD Go from here on out for my job applications.
