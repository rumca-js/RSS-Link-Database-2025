According to Transparency International, Honduras ranks among the most corrupt countries in Latin America, faring only slightly better than Haiti, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. \nOscar Zelaya, a member of the ruling Libre party, has publicly criticised his own party for alleged misuse of $36 million intended for social programmes. Despite receiving death threats, Zelaya continues to expose corruption, resonating with many voters in the country.\nThe race is tight, with the three main candidates locked in a statistical tie. The conservative National Party's Nasry Asfura is under investigation for embezzlement and money laundering, allegations he denies. Meanwhile, Salvador Nasrallah of the centre-right Liberal Party has pledged to tackle corruption head-on, and Rixi Moncada of the ruling Libre party faces challenges as her party trails in most opinion polls.
