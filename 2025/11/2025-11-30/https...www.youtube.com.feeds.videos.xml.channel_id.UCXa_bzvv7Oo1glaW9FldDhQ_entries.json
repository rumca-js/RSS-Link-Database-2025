        "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 has seen its reputation take some interesting turns over the years. Before its release, it was a title that had its fans drooling over its brilliant visuals and an open world that would push the limits of what an RPG could achieve. \n\nBut its disastrous launch made it the stuff on entirely the wrong legends, and marked a fall from grace that continues to be a warning to others in the industry. But five years on, Cyberpunk 2077 is now one of the greatest titles you can play on the current generation of gaming hardware, and vastly different from what it was at launch. \n\nJoin us as we take a look at one of the greatest current-gen redemption stories that has unfolded in the past half-decade.",

        "description": "From Ezo to the Forbidden Lands, 2025 has seen a lot of titles with sprawling worlds that have you travelling their vast expanses in search of their mysteries, secrets, and stories. \n\nThe best of them have kept us quite busy as we combed through them to give you our thoughts. Some of them have just stood out, and one of them in particular has been everything we wished we could have in an open world. Join us as we take a fond look back at some of our favorite open world experiences this year, and find out which one had us spellbound enough to win our best open world game award.\n\nThumbnail credit: Nexusmod user: GuardianGigio",
