The technology and high stakes themes generally make me nervous. Could you guys please suggest a book I could read to help me with the first few chapters, where my MC is languishing in a lab and undergoing testing?

He has been reading comic books for a while but is just starting to read chapter books.</p> <p>A few months ago, I read him Roald Dahl&#39;s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and he loved it. More recently, he has started reading chapter books on his own. He started with the most accessible Roald Dahl books: The Magic Finger, George&#39;s Marvellous Medicine, and The Twits.

He told me he wanted a very funny book like The Twits (his favorite).

So far i ask recommendation from chatgpt that suggest Animal Farm :( .Yeahh not a great read for me (extremly political and not a happy ending). Then i ask chatgpt again for suggest. It recommend me The Thief which is great and short but i dont really like it enough to read the sequels. </p> <p>I guess i want the recommendation about the mc that is increadibly lonely not like alone but feel left out. They have family, friends, best friends or partner but the mc is just a second priority. Like when they in party and loud everywhere but they felt alone i guess. I strongly prefer if mc is early adult, in college and romance. A",

They should be 28 or older. They can have kids and families or not, as long as the adult woman is the main focus. Any genre really is fine except true crime or mystery, and any time period and any cultural influence. I love slice of life, horror, tragedy, and classics. Ive enjoyed Jane Eyre, Victor Hugo, Steven King, Voltaire, and a lot of Japanese and Korean literature. </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/talkskyrimtome\"> /u/talkskyrimtome </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1paioqs/a_book_about_adult_women/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1paioqs/a_book_about_adult_women/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;m open to fiction, so long it fits what I&#39;m looking for :-)</p> <p>The latest book that blew me away was &quot;Stay True&quot; by Hua Hsu - I loved his reflection and intricate details throughout the book. Since then, I&#39;ve tried to find books that match his level of detail - and of course, other books that talk about some emotional story possibly involving loss. I&#39;m halfway through &quot;Crying in H-Mart&quot; by Michelle Zauner, but I find that she isn&#39;t as detailed or emotional as Hsu, and it&#39;s too rushed for me.</p> <p>I also have &quot;Flowers of Algernon&quot; by Daniel Keyes and &quot;Human Acts&quot; by Han Kang in my TBR. Unrelated, but I enjoyed &quot;A Civil Action&quot; by Jonathan Harr.</p> <p>Let me know if you have any suggestions for me to read! I&#39;m not too interested in roma",

Reading this made me step back and question what actually matters to me. If tomorrow never came, would I feel proud of the energy I\u2019ve poured into school, or would I regret not spending more time with my family while I still can? While these are difficult questions to face, I enjoy reading books that prompt me to slow down and analyze aspects of my life that I would generally rush past. I recently finished reading \u201cTuesdays with Morrie\u201d, \u201cThe Five People You Meet in Heaven\u201d, and \u201cThe Midnight Library\u201d, and thoroughly enjoyed the shared theme of finding purpose among them. I\u2019m still pretty new to books like these, so if you have any similar recommendations, I\u2019d really appreciate them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",
