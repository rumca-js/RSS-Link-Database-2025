This seems to have two problems: (1) Google is heavily censored and (2) many results are ads or AI slop that are optimized to have high ranks.</p> <p>It seems like it would be possible to make a webcrawler and only do the legal minimum censorship, but I wonder if this would even accomplish anything with all of the AI slop.
