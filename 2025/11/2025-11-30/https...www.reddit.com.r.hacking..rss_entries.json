        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>We picked perhaps the worst time in history to buy music on iTunes. From date X to date Y, Apple encrypted all their songs (.m4p) purchased from their store, such that only iTunes and Apple devices could play them back. After date Y, songs purchased are now unencrypted (.m4a).</p> <p>I contacted Apple support about getting the m4a files since their policy changed over 15 years ago and they told me, essentially, to go fuck myself. So here I am, asking the hive mind for advice.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen utilities online to strip DRM from these songs, and none of them seem to work. I also know that you can burn CDs and rip the songs to get FLAC files, but that will require an obscene number of discs. If there&#39;s no tool or method to work around the DRM, is there a way I can trick Windows into thinking I have a blank disk inserted that I can &quot;burn&quot; to over and over?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
