By my estimates, at least 50 million working adults will be put out of work in the upcoming decades. The industries that will be most affected are finance, IT, law, admin support and marketing. A large portion of the population will have no choice but to do physical labor. I work in finance but when AI takes my job, I want to go into training for the trades, such as car mechanic or construction laborer. But what if there won\u2019t be enough new jobs to go around? And tens of millions of people losing their job, not enough taxes will be put into the economy. And companies would go bankrupt because people would no longer be able to afford their goods and services. I don\u2019t see how the economy would survive. I foresee constant riots by angry people.
