I would like to know how the process works through which pirates manage to publish the protected content of a streaming platform like Netflix, Disney, etc., and why it is vulnerable.</p> <p>I\u2019ve also heard that there is something called DRM, which is like the copyright protection of the content. How does the process work? Is it done through torrents? With which programs? I\u2019m curious to know how Netflix releases a series and, minutes or hours later, it can already be seen on torrents or on Stremio, as if you were watching it on the original platform.</p> <p>For me, it\u2019s an interesting topic. If someone knows, say so and we can start a debate. Thanks.
