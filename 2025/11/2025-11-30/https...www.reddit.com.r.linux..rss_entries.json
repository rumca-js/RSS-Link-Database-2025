I&#39;m using KDE Plasma. The Issue: I am trying to install the proprietary NVIDIA drivers. Here is the behavior I&#39;m observing: * If I try to install nvidia packages via the terminal inside KDE Plasma, the system instantly hard freezes during the installation process. * If I switch to a TTY (Ctrl+Alt+F3), stop the display manager (sudo systemctl stop sddm), and install the drivers (sudo pacman -S nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils), the installation completes successfully without freezing. * However, after I reboot, the system boots up, but shortly after reaching the login screen or the desktop, the entire system hard freezes again. I can&#39;t move the mouse, and I can&#39;t switch to a TTY. What I have tried: * Used archinstall for a fresh setup.",

Now i have a computer that i could comfortably use GNOME on, but i&#39;m still not using it. I&#39;m reluctantly using Plasma, because i think that&#39;s the most polished option outside of GNOME, but i&#39;d still rather be using GNOME.</p> <p>So why aren&#39;t i using it? Libadwaita. I feel like libadwaita basically asks you to subsist entirely off GNOME apps, lest you bear witness to the horrible clashing themes of any other toolkit. Since i don&#39;t really want to make myself do that, i don&#39;t wanna use GNOME. And i know there are kind of solutions to stuff like this, like adw-gtk3 a",

On Windows disabled Tobii users have lots of alternatives like Optikey and Mill Mouse that are probably better than this but the only similar alternative for MacOS and Linux is Talon Voice which is way too jittery and also difficult to setup even on Windows. I will try this on Ubuntu later next week.
