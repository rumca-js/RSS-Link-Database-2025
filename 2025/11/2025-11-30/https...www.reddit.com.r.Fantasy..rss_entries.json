I was hoping to google some stuff with that postpostapo term but it doesn&#39;t seem to quite differentiate from regular postapo, so I wonder if any of you know a better name for it or some similar works, I&#39;d love to learn about it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32;",

I don\u2019t normally have a problem with that, but it is done so here in a way that it assumes I am supposed to know. There are tiny references early on to things that don\u2019t get fleshed out, but which show up later as established lore, critical for understanding the story up to that point. I spend just as much time googling the wiki site than reading the actual book. There is enough with the characters and the shadow of a plot that looks to be developing, that I\u2019m committed to continue, but did anyone else feel this way?

Despite the fact that it seemed to be fairly well liked, I had my doubts because I wasn&#39;t the biggest fan of the last Sanderson standalone I read (Warbreaker) but I found myself really enjoying the book. It has all the stuff I love about a Sanderson book: a unique world (two in this case), interesting characters, an awesome climax, amazing plot twists and fun, if unconventional, action. I also have to praise Graphic Audio again because their take on the book was amazing (also read the ebook while listening for about half of the book). But there were a few things about the book that I enjoyed that I didn&#39;t really expect to",

The whole of season 2 I kept thinking that this is what all of Star Wars could have been, if not from the beginning, since the Disney take over. Well written adult stories with something to say, real world relevance, proper characters properly developed, villains that are more than cartoon characters, heroes of ambiguous character, regular action scenes that are more than just rule of cool.</p> <p>I imagine what it would look like if Disney had treated the movies and shows with this much care and sophistication from day one. What the sequels could have been. What spinoffs we could have gotten over dross like Solo. I like the Mandalorian, but the rest of the IP is in a sorry state.</p> <p>Turns out when people who care come at a project with ambition and ideas they can manage better than &quot;Somehow Palpatine returned.&quot;.</p> </di",

Specifically, book 1.</p> <p>I basically found out that Brazil went to war against <strong>every single other nation on Earth</strong> over the destruction of heaven-1, their colony ship. Almost all earth was destroyed, the last human survivors were in China. China almost won, until brazil used their last warships to use asteroids to destroy china. Then the mcs destroyed the warships. But the main point is, it was a full-blown geopolitical wwiii. Maybe I need a war novel, lol.</p> <p>This was the most overwhelming moment I ever found out in a scifi novel. It was mind-blowing. A nation fighting the world and almost winning. Almost causing the annihilation of the human race.</p> <p>Who knows, maybe they&#39;ll manage to do that.
