That\u2019s it. It\u2019s just looping around that one note. Super one-dimensional main character writing for a game with AAA budget and literally a Sony first party studio.</p> <p>I guess what can they even do here\u2026 when you can play any mission in any order.

Go on mission, get loot and crafting materials, use that to gear up for harder missions that grant better loot and crafting materials, rinse and repeat. </p> <p>It&#39;s a chill vibe and I like the loop, my only problem is that most of these games either fall off in solo-ability or they are just designed for multiplayer groups. Does anyone have anything that does this that&#39;s made for solo?
