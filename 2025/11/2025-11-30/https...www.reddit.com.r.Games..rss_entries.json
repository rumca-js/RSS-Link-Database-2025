We\u2019re a two-person team from Poland. We recently released the demo of our game Robicon and received a lot of positive feedback from players.</p> <p>Robicon is a mix of tower defense, autobattler, and roguelite. You place turrets on a grid, merge them to increase their power, and see how your build handles waves of enemies. Between waves, you choose upgrades that can enhance or completely change how your setup works. Every run is different, and you have to think carefully about where to place your towers and how to adapt your field to the current situation.</p> <p>We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts, answer questions, and get feedback. Thanks for reading!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user",
