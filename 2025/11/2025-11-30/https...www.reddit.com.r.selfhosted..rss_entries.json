I am currently just hosting a pi-hole, Wireguard VPN, and a game server but have plans to host some web applications both open sources and developed myself, HA, Frigate NVR, etc. I&#39;m not terribly familiar with the networking side of things as I develop web applications for a living and just have not gotten into that side of things. Seeing as I would like to 1. Have some hot devices and 2. Open some ports for the things I&#39;m hosting to the web, I need some pointers on how I can do this as safely as possible. Any tips from firewalls and user privelege configurations for the apps being hosted to network segmentation and what not using plans are welcome, although the latter is why I&#39;m here. Where do I even start? What&#39;s the most important stuff to get figured out to limit my attack surface and protect my network?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",
