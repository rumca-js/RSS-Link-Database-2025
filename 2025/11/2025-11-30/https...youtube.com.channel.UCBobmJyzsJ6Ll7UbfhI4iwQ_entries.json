        "description": "Control Rig can replicate most \"classical\" rigging approaches of the type used in Autodesk Maya or other animation software. But it can do much more.  \n\nIn this talk recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, we focus on how Control Rigs can become smart, relying on the real-time functionality within Unreal Engine to empower animators to work faster and more efficiently. \n\nWe take a look at how to blur the lines between runtime functionality for a game and animation authoring functionality when animating in Sequencer.  \n\nThe session will challenge your established approaches and help you to use Unreal Engine to its full potential for animation authoring.\n\nWatch to take a leap from 25-year-old animation approaches to a novel real-time environment framework. \n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#Animation, #ControlRig, #Sequencer, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestStockholm",
