I hope you\u2019re all doing well.</p> <p>Some time ago, I built two applications \u2014 <strong>TheFeeder</strong> and <strong>RSS Skull Bot</strong>. Recently, I\u2019ve been slightly interested in subscribing to a third-party service (taking advantage of the Black Friday discounts). The reason is simple: I don\u2019t always have the time to maintain or develop custom tools for my needs.</p> <p>I\u2019m currently undecided between <strong>Inoreader</strong> and <strong>Feeder.co</strong>.
