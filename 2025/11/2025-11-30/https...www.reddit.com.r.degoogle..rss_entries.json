I have two phones, Pixel with GOS and iPhone. All my banking and important apps on pixel, set up in different profiles. iPhone I just like using with MacBook which I bought a few years ago, before I started my privacy journey. I like iPhone in general, same as GOS, so from time to time I just switch, between these two devices, but I keep iPhone only for CarPlay, communication and photos. As I said important things are on pixel, same as other apps, because I can remove network permission. As for apple devices, I put as much privacy as I could, removing location (only weather and maps have it), no background app refresh, no analytics, no subscriptions , no access, unless its needed. Unfortunately, couldn\u2019t switch off Siri, because its needed for CarPlay. I deleted almost all apple apps in my iPhone, no health app(use Garmin app though), no apple mail (",
