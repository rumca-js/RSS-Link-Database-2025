My new client is an accounting business and they are trying to rank better obviously, conversions are low 2,3 clients every month so the success bar isnt too high. But only one blog page is actually ranking and gets traffic. Would you bother with location pages if they are going after rankings across the US continent or just go after service pages, good quality content and proper internal linking structure. Also we will be doing ppc , should it link to service pages?
