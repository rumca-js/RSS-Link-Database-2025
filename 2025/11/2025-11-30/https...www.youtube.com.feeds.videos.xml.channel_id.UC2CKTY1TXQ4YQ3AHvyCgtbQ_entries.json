        "description": "I've built some of the new plastic Prussians for Trench Crusade - and now I need to build a complete list. I've gotten some other models printed as well, to add to the team. But what models will I use, and what colors? I'll talk about that, and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game!
