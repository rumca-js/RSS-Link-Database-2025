Filled with an infectious charm and surperb character writing, the show's principle writer Yuko Kakihara was placed in an unwinnable position. Today we wanted to see what we could come up with. And thanks to the help of some incredible artsits, sound designers and our friends over at Team Four Star, we've been able to bring this to you today! \n\nCREDITS:\n\nWRITTEN & DIRECTED BY\n@TotallyNotMark  & @AnimeAjay \n\nADDITIONAL WRITING BY\n@KaiserNeko \n\nART BY\nDRAFTSMAN79 - https://x.com/Draftsman79_\nCHRY_INSI_ART - https://www.instagram.com/chry_insi_art/\n\nADDITIONAL ART FROM DRAGON BALL DAIMA\n\nSOUND DESIGN BY\nARTISTE INCCONU\n\nVOICE CAST\n\n@MasakoX \nGOKU\n\n@KaiserNeko \nGOMAH\n\nJET AGGRIND - https://www.twitch.tv/jetaggrind\nSHIN, A",
