        "description": "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked the country's President, Isaac Herzog, to pardon him, over longstanding corruption charges.\n\nNetanyahu has been on trial for the past five years, accused of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate criminal cases. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nPresident Hertzog\u2019s office issued a statement saying it was an \u201cextraordinary request\u201d and the president would seek opinions from justice officials before considering a decision \"which carries with it significant implications\".\n.\nIsrael\u2019s political opposition said Mr Netanyahu should admit guilt before seeking a pardon.  Mr Netanyahu is a controversial figure in Israel, with political opponents accusing him of promoting continuing conflict in Gaza and the wider region, in order to delay a reckoning at the polls and in the criminal court proceedings. \n\nEarlier this month, US President Donald Trump urged President Herzog to \"fully pardon\" Mr Netanyahu.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BB",

        "description": "Model David Gandy has said there isn't enough examples of \"good men\" in a world where social media helps feed the \"immature\" and \"wrong\" ideas of people like Andrew Tate when it comes to masculinity.\n \nSpeaking to Laura Kuenssberg, David discusses his involvement in a report which looks into the representations of men in modern media and how there's been \"something wrong for many years.\"\n \nHe adds that in his own opinion, unregulated social media has a part to play promoting people like controversial influencer Andrew Tate's \"immature\" and \"disruptive\" idea of masculinity.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news\n\n#Masculinity #DavidGandy #BBCNews",

        "description": "Today, Laura and Paddy look at claims that Rachel Reeves misled the public after it emerged that she knew the outlook for the government\u2019s finances had improved before giving a downcast pre-Budget speech.\n\nDowning Street has denied the allegations.\n\nLuke Sullivan, Keir Starmer's former political director, is also in the Newscast studio to give his assessment on those accusations, and how the budget has been received inside the Labour Party.\n\nYou can now listen to Newscast on a smart speaker. If you want to listen, just say \"Ask BBC Sounds to play Newscast\u201d. It works on most smart speakers.",
