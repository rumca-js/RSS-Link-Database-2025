It\u2019s been a testy year for streaming services to say the least, and one big manifestation of that has been continuously rising prices. Disney+ and HBO Max were just a couple of the streaming services that bumped up prices, which means it\u2019s more important than ever to subscribe if and when you can get a discount.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, a ton of streaming services are on sale for Cyber Monday. These are the best Cyber Monday streaming deals you can get this year; just note, though, that most require you to be either a new subscriber to get the deal, or a returning subscriber who hasn\u2019t been a paid customer in a hot minute. Also, most of the end at the end of the day on Cyber Monday, so you only have a bit more time to decide if you want to take the plunge.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-cyber-monday-streaming-deals\">Best Cyber Monday stream",

Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals have been basically in full-swing since early November, and now most of those have become the best Cyber Monday you can get. This is the time of year to look for not just gifts for the holidays, but also for things you need for yourself, be it household essentials, shoes, and yes, new tech.<br><br>Engadget can help with that last category. We\u2019ve been tracking the best Cyber Monday deals on tech since the start of the month, and we\u2019ve collected the best of the bunch here that are still available for Cyber Monday. As to be expected, most things are down to record-low prices, and you\u2019ll find some of the best discounts on things like headphones, streaming devices, robot vacuums, tech accessories and more. These are the best Cyber Monday deals on tech for 2025.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-cyber-monday-deals-engadgets-top-picks\">Cyber Monday deals: Engadget&",
