The findings point not to the oil itself but to the fat-derived molecules it produces inside the body, called oxylipins, which can trigger inflammation, alter liver function, and influence genes tied to metabolism.",

Their research reveals that UV radiation breaks down a protective protein called YTHDF2, which normally prevents a small RNA signal from activating an immune sensor linked to dangerous inflammation. Once that protection is lost, a surprising chain reaction unfolds inside the cell, turning ordinary sun damage into a potential cancer trigger.",

Despite the blunder, the map reshaped the Bible into a Renaissance book and spread new ideas about territorial organization as literacy expanded. Over time, sacred geography evolved into political boundary-making, influencing not only early modern thought but modern attitudes about nation-states.",

Instead of a top-down system, the statues appear to have been produced by separate family groups working independently while sharing techniques. Evidence of varied carving styles and multiple transport routes supports this decentralized picture. The results challenge old assumptions about how large-scale monument building worked on Rapa Nui.",
