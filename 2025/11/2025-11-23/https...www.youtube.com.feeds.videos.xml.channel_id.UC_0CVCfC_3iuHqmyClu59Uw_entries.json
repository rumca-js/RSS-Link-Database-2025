        "description": "The brand-new Anbernic DS is finally here, and this is the lowest-cost dual-screen handheld we\u2019ve ever seen hit the market! Today I\u2019m giving you my first look after spending about 12 hours with it \u2014 and honestly, this thing nails the classic Nintendo DSi XL feel while still being a modern Android handheld with dual touchscreens.\nThe Anbernic DS uses two identical 4-inch IPS displays, a super-solid hinge design, dual analog sticks, front-facing speakers, Android 14, and a quad-core RK3568 CPU. It\u2019s not the most powerful dual-screen device ever, but for DS, GBA, PSP, N64 and other retro emulation\u2026 it\u2019s actually really impressive.\nBuy it Here: https://anbernic.com/products/rgds?sca_ref=2193181.CeT6UNbFuN\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Black Friday Sale code for software\uff1aETA \nWindows 11 Pro Key($23):https://biitt.ly/RUZiX \nWindows 11 Home Key($22):https://biitt.ly/SQKqi \nWindows 10 Pro OEM",
