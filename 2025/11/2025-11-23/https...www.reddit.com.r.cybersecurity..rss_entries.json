I am currently studying for the security+ exam and am only studying network+ (no exam). Im wondering what cert to go after next. My end goal would be to end up with CISSP (since I see most high paying jobs wanting it) but I am not sure. I plan on moving to Charlotte NC in the next few years. I\u2019m not quite 100% sure what path I want to take but I don\u2019t want to be a pentester since it\u2019s a little more niche and I don\u2019t like programming too much.

I\u2019m not a security expert, so I might be misinterpreting it, but since Allegro is a Polish company, this stood out to me as unusual. I\u2019m sharing this here in case others can verify, analyze it properly, or explain if there\u2019s a legitimate reason behind it. Has anyone else noticed similar traffic from the Allegro mobile app?

I think they may have all been by the same author, but not 100 percent sure. One of the only stories that I can still remember some of the details of was about a hacker whose adversary was in the hospital for some reason and he was able to break into the hospital&#39;s computer system and change the adversary&#39;s blood type in the database, thereby either killing him or nearly killing him. There was also a time constraint of some sort involved. I remember it being influential to my IT career that I was just starting, and would like to get a copy for myself to reread and possibly for a few people I am mentoring if it is as good as I remember.
