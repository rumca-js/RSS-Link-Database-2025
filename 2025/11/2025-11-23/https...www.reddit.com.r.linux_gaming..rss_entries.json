I&#39;m pretty new to Linux so I&#39;m not familiar with a lot of what can be done to fix these so any help would be greatly appreciated. I can play games like Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and Arc Raiders max settings ZERO issues pretty much out of the box. I&#39;ve maybe had 1 crash with Arc Raiders but it was on the main menu and since then haven&#39;t had it at all. No freezes, no stutters. However, games like Elden Ring, Witcher 3, Horizon Zero Dawn and a laundry list of others just simply refuse to load up. I&#39;ve probably went through every mentioned fix in past posts that I could find for these games and nothing seemed to be working. I&#39;ve gone as far as one by one checking every single version of proton to see if it will do anything. Essentially, if I&#39;m not focused on the window where the ga",

Using the Scopebuddy GUI I iterated through a couple different settings. It happens on any game, but I used Doom Eternal&#39;s visualize what was going on with my hardware.</p> <p>If I set a refresh rate and/or specify a framerate limit, my CPU and GPU start using <em>more</em> resources than if I left it unlocked or using VRR. Using VRR does not cap the framerate so I am basically not even using it, and I know I have lots of performance headroom because games will max out their FPS as high as they can.</p> <p>I disabled scopebuddy and tried opening Doom Eternal and the same behavior happens when I turn v-sync on. Turning v-sync off relaxes the GPU and CPU again. This happens on my ViewSonic XG3220 (4K60) monitor regardless of the cable or video port I use.</p> <p>&#39;PROTON",

So I recently switched from Windows 11 to Linux Mint 22.2, driven by desire to escape the clutches of the Demon Lord, Bill Gates. All was running smoothly, until I decided to download the Linux version of Baldur&#39;s Gate - Enhanced Edition from GOG. Game would install but simply wouldn&#39;t launch. After multiple failed attempts, and asking for help on the game&#39;s sub, I was defeated; I had no choice but to download the Windows version and run it using Heroic Games Launcher. But that&#39;s not what I had in mind, otherwise I would never have made the switch to Linux. So my question is this : is there another Linux distro that can run Linux games from the get go? I understand that Baldur&#39;s Gate is an old game and there will be issues, but I don&#39;t want to go back to using Windows; I just couldn&#39;t stand watching the four-eyed fiend sneering at me through the screen. Thank you very much in advance.</p> </di",

However, I am running into more and more problems with it. Sounds like it&#39;s been in maintenance mode since the project lead stepped back, the creator of duckstation sounds like he&#39;s done supporting linux, and just recently my rps3 image can&#39;t find the launcher script, which I can find, but when then it can&#39;t find any of the games. </p> <p>So are there any alternatives? I don&#39;t necessarily need cloud saves, I just like to jump from my desktop to my steam deck when I feel like it.

Some games that I ran well on Mint are annoying here.</p> <p>2) are there better alternatives? I know about Cachy OS, I still have to test it, but I&#39;m interested that when it turns on, Steam starts to control it with the gamepad.</p> <p>3) do you have different alternatives?

I got Bottles, Wine and went forwards to try Deltarune (from fitgirl), and it went pretty well. So the next one I tried was The Outer Worlds (from fitgirl too), and it just doesnt download, no matter what. I did the exact same thing I did with Deltarune - Downloading the Installer with Qbittorrent -&gt; Creating a Bottle &gt; Setting sys Wine to run the Setup -&gt; Extracting it to C:(name of the game), but it didnt work. I tried like 3 times, 2 of them the download just freezed, and the other one it gave me a IsDone.dll error and I gave up. I know repacked games are not that stable and all, but am I missing something? Like I have to install additional files? Or switch sys wine other runner? I dont know the best one.

I can get a decent deal on G29 Driving Force (<a href=\"https://www.datart.cz/volant-logitech-g29-driving-force-pro-ps3-ps4-ps5-pc-pedaly-driving-force-shifter-991-000557-cerny#popis\">here</a>).
