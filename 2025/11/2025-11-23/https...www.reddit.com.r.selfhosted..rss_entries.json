I have looked at services like Ntfy and Uptime Kuma but they seem like they have to run on the machine being monitored or require an external service to ping the machine and send notifications via messaging apps. What I&#39;m after is something like a simple iPhone app that just runs a continuous ping to my server from my phone, no external services needed, and notifies me if the ping fails, preferably with some built in checking to make sure I&#39;m not fully out of mobile service. Does anything like this exist or is it even possible to be implemented given iOS restrictions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CloudsOfMagellan\"> /u/CloudsOfMagellan </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1p4n6di/fully_self_hosted_monitoring_tools/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1p4n6d",

I&#39;ve been thinking of using my Raspberry Pi 4 as a client connected to the TV, which will be used to emulate game consoles (tested on 4K, works great) and watch movies, maybe serve other media like music as well.</p> <p>The main problem is what I&#39;d use as a server, I have a Lenovo Ideapad 310-15IKB with NVIDIA GeForce 920MX. Most of the media I have now is high-bitrate 4K, so transcoding is a must unless I re-encode the files (which I&#39;m fine with). My question here is: Should I stick with using a separate client/server, or would the RPi4 handle 1080p video?</p> <p>Also, what would be a &quot;sweet spot&quot; bitrate so the setup can handle serving without much lag?</p> <p>I&#39;m not a very knowledgable person when it comes to video media, so please excuse me",

In other words, I want the file browser to be able to get the HTTP link for the file and drop that link into a device&#39;s clipboard so it can be pasted into another app. It would also be very nice if the app could also do the HTTP sharing since some of the management would be easier that way AND it suggests that the file browser could also edit files to some extent. </p> <p>Is there such an app already out in the world? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.redd",
