He and his cousins would often hunt for pheasants and grouse, or harvest wild berries and Th\u00ed\u014bpsi\u014bla, a wild prairie turnip that\u2019s a staple Lakota food. Sherman\u2019s earliest memories of food were full of history, culture and spiritualism.</p><p>His idealistic experiences of harvesting and hunting for food on the reservation were juxtaposed with the legacy of colonialism.

He\u2019d slotted two of his three shots at goal. He was brave to the line, carrying with zip, stitching moves together as he tried to spark a backline short on fluency. But with the clock in the red, he attempted a raking kick to the corner. Either he didn\u2019t realise the 40 minutes had elapsed, or he thought he was in his own half and a 50-22 was on. Either way, after watching the ball skid into touch to end the half, he stood still, hands on head, stunned by his own misread",
