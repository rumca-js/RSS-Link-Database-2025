I was interested in the Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. In my area they are all fairly similarly priced and people tend to be fairly generous when bundling games/accessories with them. I have a pretty high end PC already and played a lot of the single player games on these consoles back in the day (except for Xbox exclusives which I never really got into), so I&#39;m mainly interested in things like the motion party games as well as maybe some older fighting games and racing games. Playing old Call of Duty games sounds really fun too. </p> <p>So yeah, just wondering what the best option here would be. The Wii is definitely still the cheapest, can find them for like $50 and I believe they can be modded too which is nice. I have a ton of nostalgia for the Xbox 360 and the Wii, more so the Xbox as my parents gave away my Wii t",

Other than that I feel it comes close in rank to games like Contra, Mega Man, etc, albeit easier. If you enjoy those games, you\u2019ll definitely love Journey To Silius.
