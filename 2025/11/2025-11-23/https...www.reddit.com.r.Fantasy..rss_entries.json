I read A LOT of fantasy (just finished Brimstone and really liked it), so I really want to introduce them to the genre.</p> <p>I get to pick the book for January and I want them to read a fantasy book. I have kind of narrowed it down to two books that I think appeal to the masses: </p> <ul> <li>Night Circus </li> <li>Fourth Wing (note: <em>I know, I know, very divided views on this book</em>)</li> </ul> <p>I also was thinking maybe The Grace Year, which isnt exactly fantasy (dont want to spoil it by explaining but if you&#39;ve read it, you might get what I mean, it borders on fantasy and dystopian). What do you guys think? Or is there something else you would recommend to introduce someone to fantasy/romantasy? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tracy_Turnblad\"> /u/Tracy_Tur",

Huge battle and you have your Chosen One or main character against evil incarnate. Do you think Barad is going to be revealed as that? He hints in book 3 that he isn&#39;t entirely human. That could mean many things but in the purpose of this post it could mean he&#39;s an actual God. A Fallen One at that. </p> <p>I love Echoes it&#39;s my favorite series and indie, but I did kinda wish we had gotten that Dark One finale. So if we get that for the sequel to Echoes, I would love it! But then again we are currently doing another Dark One thing with Skara. And he&#39;s twisted. But in LOTR terms, Skara can be described as Sauron with Barad as Morgoth. Barad is described as King of Worl",
