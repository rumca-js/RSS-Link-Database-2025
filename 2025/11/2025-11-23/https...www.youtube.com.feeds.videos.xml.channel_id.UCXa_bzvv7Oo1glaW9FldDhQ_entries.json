        "description": "TMNT: Shredder\u2019s Revenge proved just how exciting the 2D beat \u2018em up genre can still be. Now the same team is turning things up a notch with a roster chalk-full of Marvel heroes. \n\nMarvel Cosmic Invasion is a chaotic co-op-heavy brawler packed with retro charm, modern tag-team mechanics, and a huge hero roster. Marvel Cosmic Invasion launches December 1st for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch 1/2, and Xbox Series X/S for just $29.99. \n\nIf its content pipeline is anything like Shredder\u2019s Revenge, expect some extra DLC characters and stages in the near future (my guess is the Fantastic Four).",

        "description": "Of Ash and Steel is geared primarily for those who enjoy the likes of Gothic, where carefully considering your build and skill unlocks is as important as deciding whether to tackle a group of seemingly harmless enemies. \n\nMaybe it can shine if its various weaknesses are addressed, but even then, its storytelling, protagonist, world design, and gameplay feel ever-so slightly above average.",
