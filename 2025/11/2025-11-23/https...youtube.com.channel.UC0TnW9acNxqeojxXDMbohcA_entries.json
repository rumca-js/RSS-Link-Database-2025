        "description": "In this video, I pull back the curtain on one of the most ambitious experiments I\u2019ve ever attempted: trying to change a stranger\u2019s life in a single night. Over four evenings with 30 complete strangers, I built a high-end, once-in-a-lifetime experience designed to break their patterns, crack open their assumptions, and push them into real vulnerability. From curated conversations to fire-walking, I tried every tool I\u2019ve learned over twenty years of coaching to create meaningful, rapid transformation.
