        "description": "JBL makes a lot of Bluetooth speakers, and its new-for-2025 Grip model falls somewhere between its micro-sized Go 4 and Clip 5 speakers and the Flip 6, which is more mini-sized. While it doesn't sound quite as good as the Flip 7, it costs less and is more compact, weighing 385 grams. The speaker features an integrated loop and built-in lighting element on the back that's programmable via the JBL companion app for iOS and Android. It's more subdued than the light shows on some of the larger speakers and more accent or \"ambient\" lighting, as JBL calls it. It's rated for up to 14 hours of battery life and is fully waterproof and dust-resistant with an IP68 rating. Let's unbox it in purple. #jblgrip\n#portablespeaker #Tech #jblspeaker #bluetoothspeaker #jblaudio",
