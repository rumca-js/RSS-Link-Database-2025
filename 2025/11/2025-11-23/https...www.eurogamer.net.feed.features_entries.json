I'm not talking about the ravages of age when I say that - although, <em>christ</em>, the closer I creep to forty the creakier I become - but I'm thinking, I suppose, about legacy. The very nature of history, especially when it's oral in its delivery, is that it becomes truncated. Short-form takes over. For instance - think of a Prime Minister or President (back when we had normal ones of those, anyway), or the manager of a sports team, their tenure often ends up defined very broadly, no matter how much nuance there was at the time. Oftentimes, it's good or bad, with little in between. Which is a shame - because sometimes the nuance is where the most interesting thinking resides.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/im-tired-of-pretending-that-perfect-dark-zero-isnt-at-least-50-really-really-good\">Read more</a></p>",

        "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/xbox-japan.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>The Xbox business today is pretty unrecognizable from that of 20 years past, which on this week all that time ago was launching the Xbox 360. There's all the changes to the business, a different suite of executives at the top, and an entirely different first-party portfolio, of course - but when I think of the changes, one absence comes to the forefront of my mind: Japan.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-really-committed-to-japanese-game-development-in-the-360-era-and-we-didnt-know-how-good-we-had-it\">Read more</a></p>",
