Berlin\u2019s Egyptian Museum has since made Nefertiti\u2019s effigy a central feature, attracting around half a million visitors annually.\nEgyptian archaeologists, including renowned Zahi Hawass, are renewing calls for its return, alongside other artefacts such as the Rosetta Stone. While some argue the bust belongs in Egypt, German authorities maintain its legitimacy and cite concerns over its fragility. The debate spotlights larger questions about cultural heritage and ownership of antiquities displayed far from their place of origin.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Dominic Kane reports from Berlin.\n\nSub",
