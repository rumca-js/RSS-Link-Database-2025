There are a lot of crazy tribes to play like Beasts, Ronin, Synths and Slashers. Campaigns are fast with a huge focus on replayability and roguelike build variety.

My name is Auro and I am the solo developer of Mortal Glory 2, a Turn-Based Gladiator Roguelike. It features quick turn-based combat that is easy to learn but still has a surprising amount of depth.</p> <p>In the game you recruit a team of traveling gladiators and participate in a brutal tournament. As the manager of the team, you are tasked with finding the best fighters, discovering powerful item combinations and coming up with clever tactics on the battlefield. With a wide variety of unique skills, character perks and relics to discover, there is a lot of variety and different ways to dominate the tournament.</p> <p>I released the game last year and it&#39;s currently 50% off on Steam. Happy to answer any question!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",
