Now I added them all manually and used the pack unlocker, so from my understanding they won\u2019t go anywhere and I\u2019ll still be able to play as long as I stay offline (someone please confirm) Now the problem is, though all the packs work, the game is incredibly buggy (home screen text bugs, only a few aspirations showing up, can\u2019t click on other sims/socialize, sims keep T-posing \u2014 that\u2019s all i saw so far) I currently have no script mods installed, so I have no idea what is causing this. I wanted to go through the troubleshooting guide he put up but it\u2019s all gone . So my question is, can anyone either a) give me access to the troubleshooting guide / discord, or b) just know what the problem is and help me figure that out?</p> <p>merciii </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/smallfacess\"> /u/smallfacess </a> <",
