That's the thesis of economist and author Yanis Varoufakis. In his book Technofeudalism, he argues that markets and profits have been replaced by digital fiefdoms and economic rents.\n\nI met up with Yanis while he was in London promoting his new book Raise Your Soul to ask him about the cloudalists, Trump 2.0, and how to survive in a world which appears to be ever lurching to the right.\n\nDirected and Presented by Tom Nicholas.\nFilmed and edited by Georgia Burrows.\nAdditional research and production assistance by Jack Carter.\n\nWith thanks to Yanis Varoufakis.\n\nWatch this video ad- and sponsor-free on Nebula at https://nebula.tv/videos/tomnicholas-capitalism-is-dead-this-is-what-comes-next\n\nSupport my work on Patreon at https://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nTwitch: http://twitch.tv/tom_nicholas\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://i",
