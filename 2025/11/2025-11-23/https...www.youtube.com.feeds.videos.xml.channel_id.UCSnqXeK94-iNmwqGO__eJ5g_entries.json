        "description": "I built a secret camping fort under a highway overpass bridge and camped out in it for the night. It all went fairly smoothly eventually. It took a couple weeks to get the fort fully built and stocked but when it was done it was amazing. I color matched the paint of the bridge to paint the plywood to disguise my camping activities. We hauled up the fort, set it in place and had a very stealthy camping trip. No campsite required, earplugs optional.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Website: https://campingwithsteve.com\n\u2022 My Amazon store: https://amzn.to/49li5Az\n\u2022 Merch https://crowdmade.com/collections/stevewallis\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGear:\n\nCamera: Sony Alpha FX3\nhttps://amzn.to/3SIMQra\n\nLens: Sony FE PZ 16-35mm F4 G\nhttps://amzn.to/3SL1rm7\n\nEditing: Apple 2021 MacBook Pro M1 Final Cut Pro\nhttps://amzn.to/3YeuCiy\n\nDrone: DJI Mini 3\nhttps://amzn.to/3YqQ0Ew\n\n--------------------------------------------------",
