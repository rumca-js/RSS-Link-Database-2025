Of those, we technically only need the first three to calculate the latter four. But according to a new paper, we can actually calculate the first three as well \u2013 from a single constant. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-71907-0\n\n\ud83d\udc55T-shirts, mugs, posters and more: \u279c https://sabines-store.dashery.com/\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossenfelder.com/newsletter/\n\ud83d\udc42 Audio only podcast \u279c  https://open.spotify.com/show/0MkNfXlKnMPEUMEeKQYmYC\n\ud83d\udd17 Join this channel to get access to perks \u279c \nhttps://www.youtube.co",
