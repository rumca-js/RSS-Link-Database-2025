I've been asked many times to listen to Elliott Smith and it seemed like a good opportunity to do just that. It's shameful that I haven't listened to him before. I didn't know where to begin - so please leave a comment about where I should take it from here. \n\n\nTo see more from JHRA,  join my Patreon here: http://www.patreon.com/jushawk\n\nFor Cameo messages: https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins\n\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f To see The Darkness on tour in 2026: https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/\n\nGet a Justin Hawkins Rides Again T-Shirt & Hoodie here: https://thejawsofvictory\n\n\n#reaction #musicreview #elliottsmith",
