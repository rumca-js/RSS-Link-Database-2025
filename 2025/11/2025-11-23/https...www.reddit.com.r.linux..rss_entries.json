So, out of frustration with the progress on COSMIC desktop, I decided to replace Pop OS with Fedora to try it out. These are some early thoughts.</p> <ul> <li>Installation was fast and painless on a non-nvidia system (I am thinking of trying it out on an Nvidia one as well). </li> <li>Proprietary codecs used to be a pain in the ass and, to be fair, it still is annoying. This is one thing that would scare off any user who doesn&#39;t know why they can&#39;t play their videos or what the solution is. Thanks to this <a href=\"https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/tutorial-how-to-replace-the-fedora-flatpak-repo-with-flathub/44320\">guide</a> I was able to install Flathub and then some multimedia players from that -- a neat solution! I know there is RPMFusion but if it&#39;s anything like Ubuntu&#39;s PPAs, I will avoid it. It will probably break with major updates.</li",
