What i mean by dead is that the battery life is so bad that i get 15 minutes from full charge just IDLING and the board that handles charging has it&#39;s own issues, like charging stopping randomly. Tried multiple cables, new and old, the issue is still there, so i have to constantly check if it&#39;s charging and if it is not then unplug and replug the cable. I mean it happens very frequently, like every 10 minutes.</p> <p>So now i&#39;m looking for a new headset. I am only playing pcvr and don&#39;t care about the standalone features, the standalone multiplayer game servers are full of screaming kids anyway and the game choices remind me of roblox, at least that was the case with the quest 2 platform. I am also against using headsets that are dependent on battery life, since i live in a country that can only be called &quot;Farfuckistan&quot; and oculus (the name on the headset ",

However, I wanted to ask which would be better in terms as a replacement for a Oculus Quest 2?</p> <p>So for context, my Quest 2 has been generally acting up, and I feel like I&#39;m needing to replace it soon. The issues aren&#39;t that important, nor is the point of mentioning it. I bring this up since originally, before I learned about the Steam Frame, I was planning on replacing my Quest 2 with a Quest 3 over Christmas. However with learning about the Steam Frame&#39;s existence, now I&#39;m debating which to get instead.</p> <p>I also feel like I should mention, I don&#39;t mind getting new games to replace the ones from the Quest 2 assuming that Steam Frame wins out.</p> <p>My overall thing here is that I don&#39;t want to get the Quest 3 ",
