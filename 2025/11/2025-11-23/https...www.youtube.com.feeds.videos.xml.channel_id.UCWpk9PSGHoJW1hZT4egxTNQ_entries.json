Additionally, you\u2019ll get free shipping and a 30-day free trial of family research!\n\nUnderneath Las Vegas, there are approximately 200 miles of tunnels, wastewater networks, unused service routes, and abandoned mineshafts. These tunnels, which were once constructed as the city's infrastructure, have become a hidden world for the tunnel people. \n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to find food or clean water here, and there\u2019s no plumbing. People live in constant darkness and haunted by the constant fear of flush floods. Every person who ended down here has a story. Some chased adventure. Some fled trauma. Some lost their jobs and couldn't make ends meet. \n\nIf you want to shine a light to these dark tunnels, consider donating to the Shine a Light Foundation: https://shinealightlv.networkforgood.com/projects/143160-general-fund \n\nSubscribe \u25ba https://goo.gl/MKi8tn\n\"Rediscovery\" Series \u25ba https://www.youtube.com/p",
