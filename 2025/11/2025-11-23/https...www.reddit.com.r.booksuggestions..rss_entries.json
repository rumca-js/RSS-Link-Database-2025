Then Cat Marnell&#39;s How To Murder Your Life was cathartic, as someone too old to get messy myself now these types of books are a rush! Fell into a niche of Laurel Canyon stories, Janis Joplin biography, Stevie Nicks. So something along these lines, or music history from the early-mid 70s where the Laurel Canyon books tapered off. Tried to read The Last Party (Studio 54) but it was too focused on business, idc who had what license for what premises i want to read about fabulous people partying hard! Nothing too traumatic though like SA or DV.

Anytime I google &#39;best friends to enemies books&#39; every result is &#39;enemies to lovers&#39; and that is simply not the same thing? </p> <p>Vicious by V. E.
