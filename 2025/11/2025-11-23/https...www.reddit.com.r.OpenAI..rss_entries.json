But having attachments, images in conversation, or conversation in project shouldn&#39;t mean that if we hit main model limits conversation is paused. It should always switch to mini model just like normal conversation. There could be someway to do this, like optionally ignoring the stuff that needs main model, but mini model keeps carrying context of conversation so far discussed in text. This is could be major daily life use improvement. It breaks momentum when conversation just hits the wall, it&#39;s bigger issue then continuing with less smart model. I think many would rather continue conversation with less smart model temporarily, so some stuff keeps moving forward. Simply switching to other normal conversation despite remembering some stuff is bigger compromise on momentum.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LivingInMyBubble1999\"> ",

I remember the limits can vary by day, but why would it be <em>so</em> low?</p> <p>I used to get around 40 minutes a day for voice conversations and everything worked fine.
