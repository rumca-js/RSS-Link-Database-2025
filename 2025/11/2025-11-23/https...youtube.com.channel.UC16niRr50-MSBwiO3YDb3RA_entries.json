And a US official tells the BBC there\u2019s optimism - and momentum, as he put it.\n \nBut what\u2019s on the table is a 28-point peace proposal for Ukraine that reflects Russia\u2019s key demands. Everything from Ukraine abandoning hard-defended land, to a ban on joining Nato.\n \nAnd US President Donald Trump has given Kyiv until Thursday to sign up.\n \nMet with dismay in Ukraine, the deal\u2019s controversial even in the US - where Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to confirm that this is in fact a US proposal, and not one written by the Kremlin.\n \nRubio is here today, as are officials from the European Union and UK anxious to ensure that if this is a starting point for a lasting peace deal - a big if - then Ukraine\u2019s voice, and those of all its allies, must be heard.\n\nSubscribe h",
