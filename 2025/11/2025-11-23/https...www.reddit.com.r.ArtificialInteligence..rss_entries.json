It also uses videos and sounds from people\u2019s phones. If you see a crime, you can record it. AI can read the video, find the place, and help the police act fast and correctly.</p> <p>This helps stop three big problems:</p> <ol> <li>People are scared to speak against bullies, but recording is quiet and safe.</li> <li>There are fewer loud alarms and fake reports.</li> <li>It discourages criminals who assume bystanders won\u2019t testify or that witnesses will stay silent</li> </ol> <p>AI checks the recording using VLMs and does a basic classification, and sends a message to the police nearby with geo tag ofcourse.</p> <p>If the police think it is not a crime, they must say why. For example, \u201cwatering trees is not a crime,\u201d or \u201cfeeding dogs in a park is not a crime.\u201d If police ignore a real crime, it is recorded, so they must be responsible.",
