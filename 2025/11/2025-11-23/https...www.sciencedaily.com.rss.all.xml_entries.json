        "description": "A Swedish plano-convex ingot once thought to be from the Bronze Age was revealed through chemical and isotopic testing to belong to the Iron Age. Its composition closely matches Iron Age finds from Poland, leading researchers to uncover new evidence of long-distance connections across the Baltic. The study highlights how collaboration and scientific analysis can transform isolated artifacts into clues about ancient trade and networking.",

This enzyme, called VLK, modifies nearby proteins in a way that intensifies pain and strengthens connections tied to learning and memory. Removing VLK in mice dramatically reduced post-surgery pain while leaving normal function untouched, offering a promising path toward safer, more targeted pain treatments.",
