Today, the tables have turned: it is Great Britain that finds itself at the mercy of major US tech firms \u2013 so huge and dominant that they constitute monopolies in their fields \u2013 as well as the whims of an erratic president. Yet, to the outside observer, Britain seems curiously at ease with this arrangement \u2013 at times even eager to subsidise its own economic dependence. Britain is hardly alone in&nbsp;submitting to the power of American firms, but it offers&nbsp;a clear case study in why nations need to develop&nbsp;a&nbsp;coordinated response to the rise of these hegemonic companies.</p><p>The current age of American tech monopoly began in the 2000s, ",

As a child I was a fussy eater, with meat and carbs being the mainstays, but as I got older I found it harder to justify eating meat. A lifelong animal lover and one of those annoying people who jokes about their \u201cconnection to animals\u201d, I never missed an opportunity to pet a neighbourhood dog or say hello to a group of cows in a field.</p><p>So, going into my teenage years, I knew that eating meat was not really compatible with my way of thinking. But like most I found it easy enough to put those concerns to one side when I was scoffing a Greggs steak bake. Until at 15 I got the nudge I needed to take the leap into vegetarianism.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/23/m",
