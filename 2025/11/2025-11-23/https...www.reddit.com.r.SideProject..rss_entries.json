The goal is to give students a fast, focused alternative to overwhelming textbooks.</p> <p>Right now, Thinkly is completely bootstrapped.

What are others doing differently, why does it work for them? So I went and built a full analytics platform to check my competitors.</p> <p>The platform is called HookedKit, the idea is: find what&#39;s working for others, apply it for yourself.</p> <p>It&#39;s a bit rough for now and that&#39;s why I would love to have some of you as beta testers. You&#39;ll be able to help me shape the tool and hopefully make it the reference for personalized instagram tips.</p> <p>I built it because I was tired of all the generic advice I was getting online. It&#39;s obvious that each niche behaves differently, that some hooks works better with a certain audience, audio/no audio etc...</p> <p>So the idea of the platform is to let you input your account, pick some competitors and let it find for you the ideal reel length, the topics you should cover, postin",
