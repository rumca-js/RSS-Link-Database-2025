This lightning talk dives deep into the nature of string literals in C++, exploring the value category of \"hello\", how type deduction works, and why it's more complex than it appears at first glance.\n\nMany C++ developers assume they understand the basics of a string literal, but in this talk, we challenge that assumption. Using the example \"hello\", we walk through how C++ interprets it in terms of type and value category \u2014 is it a const char array? A PR value? An Lvalue? We\u2019ll find out using tools like `decltype`, `auto`, and references.\n\nYou\u2019ll learn:\n- What a C++ string literal really is at the type system level.\n- How value categories (Lvalue, Rvalue, PRvalue, Xvalue) affect interpretation.\n- Why `decltype(\"hello\")` may not return what you expect.\n- How array decay, type deduction, and move semantics play a role.\n- The differ",
