All these resources and other posts lack straight forward clarifications so I&#39;ll try to go over my understanding just to make sure that I get it right with hope that you can correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</p> <p>I don&#39;t want to go into gory details but rather a reasoning method to make sense of how interrupt handling should be set up.</p> <p>I&#39;ll assume that there is a machine with source external interrupts at privilage mode M or S, and there are 3 privilege modes M, S and U that a HART can work in.</p> <p>Let&#39;s say we want to go over how HART would decide what to do with interrupt:</p> <p>Compare mip and mie registers, something like logical mip &amp; mie. At this point we know if there are any pending interrupts that are also handled in this HART.</p> <p>If we want to handle any external interrupt",
