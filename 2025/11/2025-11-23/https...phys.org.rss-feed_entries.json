The team proposed a substitution measurement method that avoids the use of expensive and hard-to-prepare high-purity isotope targets, successfully measuring the 65Cu(\u03b3,n)64Cu reaction cross section with high precision. This method only relies on natural copper (natCu) and previously measured copper-63 (63Cu) data, without modifying experimental facility parameters, making it simple, efficient, and low-cost.",
