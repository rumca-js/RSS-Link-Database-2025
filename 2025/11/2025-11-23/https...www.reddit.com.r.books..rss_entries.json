        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>It sounds conspiratorial, but I&#39;ve noticed in a few books I&#39;ve read, particularly ones from more prolific authors, that they contain inexplicably superfluous details that only seem to function as advertising for a product. A recent-ish example is in the James Patterson/Michael Crichton novel &quot;Eruption&quot;, where a CEO character notably drives &quot;A Rivian R1T, an electric pickup truck that handles like a sports car.&quot; Charitably, it could be dismissed as a character choice, but the amount of attention the vehicle was specifically given, when it could otherwise have been plainly described, felt like an advertisement- and completely un-immersive and world breaking. Is this just a more common thing now, or has it been for a while and I&#39;m just noticing? Either way I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/partiallycylon\"> /u/partiallycylon </a> <br/> <span><",

Faulkner wrote an incredible family saga of the greed and hubris of the Sutpen family &amp; plantation, weaving in themes of tragic family dynamics, the slow decay of Southern society following the civil war and the inescapable impacts of slavery and racism that haunted the South long after their loss.</p> <p>The nature of it being a long family saga was what reminded me most of East of Eden, but upon further reflection it also had a lot of rich Biblical and Greek allegories that actually felt a lot more fleshed out in comparison to Steinbeck\u2019s repeated Cain and Abel analogies.</p> <p>I will say, the two books really quite differ in many ways as well. Compared to Faulkner, Steinbeck seemed to take a much more optimistic view of fatalism and the repetitive tragedies passed down through generations of fathers and sons.</p> <p>A",
