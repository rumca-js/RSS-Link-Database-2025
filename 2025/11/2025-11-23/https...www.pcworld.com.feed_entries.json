A good-quality arm not only frees up usable space on your desk\u2019s surface, it enables more ways to move and position your display/s for optimal comfort and ergonomics. And a monitor arm makes your office setup look really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only catch is the price. Most monitor arms worth buying will cost close to $200, and heavy-duty arms capable of holding two large displays can be priced even higher.
