I managed to get a few cards sleeved, but they started bending. Even after a few days, the cards are still bending.<br/> The cards of the boardgame that had a different size were sleeved just fine in Gamegenic sleeves. </p> <p>Are there any sleeves that are consistently considered 1 or 2mm &#39;too big&#39; for 80x120mm cards, or at least slighty larger than the Gamegenics Dixit size?

You drop the cubes into the tower (which is something I also enjoyed when playing Clank), and when enough cubes build up, the player with the most cubes in that slot must defend against the monsters assigned to it. Monsters are on the backsides of the cards the players are building, and as cards become more powerful so do the monsters that you have to face.<br/> Anyway, during the game, you can choose to attack monsters for larger rewards or you can just wait to defend against them. </p> <p>I also liked that you can -take ownership of neutral cards -build a chain actions with the right combination of cards.

Making a unique boardgame that is all-round fun, replayable and interactive that doesnt involve players solving calculus is in my experience like imagining a new colour. It baffles me how people can still manifest worthy games without getting lost in a sea of 30,000 existing boardgames. Anyone can make boardgames- but 10/10 the veteran boardgame council won&#39;t approve it having it on their shelf. Boardgame development is a never ending suffering of &quot;sounds good, doesnt work&quot; that pulls you into simultaneous state between depression from disillusionment and the obsession to crack the code or finding new ways to approach ideas.
