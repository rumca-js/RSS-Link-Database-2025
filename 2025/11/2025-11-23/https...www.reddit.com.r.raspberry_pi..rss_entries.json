        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am very new to the Rasberry Pi ecosystem but have managed to run Pi Os headless on my Pi 5 8GB quite easily with good performance. However I was looking for a better looking desktop os and found Twister Os. Now that I&#39;ve managed to install it and run it headlessly using RealVNC Viewer, performance is quite poor. There is severe latency/ lag when trying to do anything within the Os. Can anyone shed light on whether there is a way to improve performance or if I should return to another os. Thank you all in advance</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BlacKnigh7\"> /u/BlacKnigh7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1p4abmw/twister_os_headless_pi_5_8gb/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1p4abmw/twister_os_headless_pi_5_8gb/\">[comments]</a></span>",
