        "description": "Verizon just fired 13,000 people in one massive blast \u2014 and just like every other giant layoff announcement, the stock magically jumped right after. This isn\u2019t about \u201crestructuring,\u201d \u201cinnovation,\u201d or \u201cAI skills for the future.\u201d It\u2019s a stock-price inflation button CEOs slam whenever the board needs a quick dopamine hit.\n\nIn this video, I break down why companies announce huge layoffs publicly, why the stock always spikes, and why these mass cuts have nothing to do with \u201cfixing the business\u201d and everything to do with making shareholders smile for 24 hours.\n\nWe look at the WARN Act, how companies decide between mass layoffs vs. quiet \u201cforever layoffs,\u201d why Verizon\u2019s new CEO needed to make a splash, and how corporate PR teams wrap all of this in the most absurd excuses imaginable.\n\nBecause let\u2019s be honest: if you don\u2019t own the company, you\u2019re not part of the plan. You\u2019re an expense to be trimmed when the stock dips or when Wall Street gets grumpy. These decisions aren\u2019t strategic. They\u2019re",
