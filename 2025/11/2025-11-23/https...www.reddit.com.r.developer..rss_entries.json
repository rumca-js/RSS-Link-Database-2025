Figured, I\u2019d share from what I learned since i have tested them both for my chrome extension.</p> <p><strong>Performance</strong> <strong>comparison</strong></p> <p>Openai\u2019s gpt-5 models are generally better at reasoning tasks, like if you need a step by step logic or consistent output formats then gpt generally handles it with less hallucinations. The responses are predictable which matters when you are building something at production level. The pricing runs around $1.25/million input tokens for gpt 5.1 and $10/million output tokens. However, if you can use the cached input method then the price drops impressively like around $0.125 (which I used)</p> <p>On the other hand, Gemini 3 pro is impressively strong with multimodal stuff like audio, video, visuals and long contextual inputs.
