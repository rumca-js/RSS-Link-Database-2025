        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, this is not an offer for employment, but a one-off quest for paid help: we are need a Docker container around a SvelteKit SPA with a Python backend. We (the Bavarian (Germany) Squash Association, i.e. non-profit and small) have about <strong>1.000 \u20ac of budget left in 2025</strong> to spend on this. The ideal result would be a <strong>Github repo that is set up with CI</strong> such that a new container is built as soon as we update the dependencies on e.g. the SvelteKit app or the backend. We also need Mosqitto and NginX included in the docker image, as well as DNSMasq. Happy to provide details to those interested. Best email me at martin &lt;at&gt; squash-in-bayern.de.</p> <p>I hope it&#39;s okay that I posted this here.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/martinkrafft\"> /u/martinkrafft </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1ov24f5/oneoff_job_offer_build_us_a_docke",
