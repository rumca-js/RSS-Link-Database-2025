Never really cared what was in anyones pants, didn\u2019t care about gender, everyone is so pretty, etc</p> <p>I\u2019ve mostly had boyfriends but I\u2019ve had two girlfriends in the past that I still rank above all my past relationships. I just overall enjoyed those so much more and it felt so much easier and lighter. I will also admit, I don\u2019t have a great track record with men, I tend to pick toxic guys. My last relationship also really did a number on me (nothing too bad) but it has really made me want to swear off men. But we can\u2019t help who we are attracted to right?</p> <p>Now, I\u2019ve been single for almost 3 years and decided it\u2019s time to jump back in. Needless to say I ended up hooking up with this guy I\u2019ve been talking to.",

Loneliness is killing me mentally sometimes feel I&#39;m losing it. Almost like what&#39;s the point yk?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MadCaT_9_in\"> /u/MadCaT_9_in </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"",
