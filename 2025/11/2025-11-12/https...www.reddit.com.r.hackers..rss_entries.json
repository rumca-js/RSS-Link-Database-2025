Then said he thought she was my MIL and doesn\u2019t remember. SIL is positive. MIL has said he has always had a p0r4 problem. I want to know if he is watching child bc that will make my decision to cut him off very easy. I have kids who have been in contact with him (very supervised maybe 1x a year) bc they live across the country. So as of now it\u2019s easy to not tell my kids and make excuses if he doesn\u2019t come for a visit (my kids 5, 8, 10, and 12)\u2026 however if we completely cut him off we\u2019re going to have to explain it somehow to the kids. I just wish I knew if he was watching that. I\u2019m at a loss.</p> <p>Is it possible to find out?
