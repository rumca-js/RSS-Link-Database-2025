I am currently GPU bottlenecked quite a bit playing with a 9600x and 6700XT at 1440p. For some games (e.g. ark ascended) to get decent visual smoothness I enable FSR framegen and then enable the anti lag in adrenalin software to compensate a bit for the added input lag from framegen. I have been looking if there is an equivalent to driver level anti lag on linux (because the game itself doesn&#39;t have a native anti lag option) but couldn&#39;t really find a clear answer that I was able to understand. I saw earlier that mesa 25.3 added &quot;Vulkan AMD Anti Lag Support&quot;, but it&#39;s not clear to me if this is about a driver level antilag (e.g. anti lag 1) or the improved anti lag that requires the game to support it (anti lag 2), and how it would work with the DX12-&gt;vulkan translation done by proton. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; subm",
