This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\n\nGiacomo Pantalone (Full Spectrum Dominance) and Federico Valsecchi j have taken their stab at a universal 'modern' skirmish game, suitable for any period using firearms up to robots and lasers. Card driven, the uni profles allow you to quickly generate a team of 6-12 models and manage them on scaling battlefields in anything from 6mm to full 32mm combat.
