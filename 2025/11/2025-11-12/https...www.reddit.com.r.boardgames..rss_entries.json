For what I\u2019ve read, people still complain about typos and issues, and I understand that there are some small changes in ai behaviour and some adjustments, and changes on exploration, but for me none of these sound like worth another 60 euros on top of an already expensive game.

It isn\u2019t from any of the publisher\u2019s games. Clearly the game has the Chinese zodiac involved in play somehow.

We don&#39;t play any hugely complex games, the most I&#39;d say would be either Spirit Island on TTS or Arcs in person. What I&#39;ve found is that even when IRL talk takes a backseat and everyone is 100% in the zone, sometimes certain people routinely take turns that I&#39;ve silently timed to 10 minutes! Which then makes board game night an absolute slog. </p> <p>I&#39;ve been throwing around the idea of a turn timer, but on the other hand I don&#39;t want to be the fun police or make people feel like they aren&#39;t being given fair opportunity to think about the game.

About 2 years ago I got sick of the toxicity of those games and the people they attract, so purged everything for those, and decided to become a board game guy. No regrets!</p> <p>However, as I approach the 400 games mark, we&#39;ve started to purge and rotate out the games that never see the table, or didn&#39;t &quot;hit&quot; for us. So I was wondering, what are your top 10 games? I want to start getting more surefire hits, with the goal that every game we have sees play at least once a year.</p> <p>For reference, here are my top 10: 1. Gloomhaven (forsthaven, gh 2.0... love dungeon crawling) 2. Mage Knight (was my #1 for a decade til I discovered the Haven games) 3.

They couldn&#39;t play the game because of &quot;conflict of interest&quot; or something.
