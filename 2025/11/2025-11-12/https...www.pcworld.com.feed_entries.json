They\u2019re a boon to both desktop and laptop users. While portable monitors might not reach the large screen sizes of conventional displays, they offer other advantages: They are relatively inexpensive, easy to connect, and, best of all, easy to transport \u2014 whether that\u2019s to a different city for work, or to a different room in your house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the widespread availability of these displays and the ability to manufacture them cheaply has resulted in some questionable brands on the market. Often the quality of these monitors can be sub-par. That\u2019s where we at PCWorld come in.

However, the product obviously becomes sluggish when many tabs or windows are open. When this happens, Chrome then consumes a lot of RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how you can remedy this: Open the <em>Settings</em> menu in the top right-hand corner. Switch to the <em>Performance</em> section and scroll to the <em>Memor</em>y area. Activate the <em>Memory Saver </em>mode option there and then select the <em>Maximum</em> option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This should improve the experience when surfing the web. According to Google when this feature is turned on, inactive Chrome tabs or windows are deactivated and the memory is freed up. If you switch to the tab or window, the browser will then load the content and display it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reading tip: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2693064/13-essential-google-ch",
