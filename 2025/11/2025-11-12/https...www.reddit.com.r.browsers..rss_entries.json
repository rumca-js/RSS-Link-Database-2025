Even with HTTPS, the browser has full access to everything I do, right? Since they\u2019re small projects, they lack external audits, rapid updates, and a community that reviews the code. Does this increase the risk? I\u2019m not saying they are dangerous, but I\u2019d like to understand the real level of risk compared to established browsers like Firefox, Chrome, or Brave. Does anyone use them for sensitive stuff? Any technical opinions or experiences?</p> <p>Thanks a lot!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by",
