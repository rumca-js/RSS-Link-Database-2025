Human curiosity follows a simple cycle: explore, predict, feel suspense, and win a reward. Our brains light up when we guess correctly, especially when the \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d remain a mystery, making it feel magical and grabbing our full attention. Even when our guess is wrong, it becomes a challenge to get it right next time. But this curiosity can trap us. We\u2019re drawn to predictions from Nostradamus, astrology, and tarot despite their flaws. Even mostly wrong guesses don\u2019t kill our passion. One right prediction feels like a jackpot, perfectly feeding our confirmation bias and keeping us hooked. Now, reconsider what do we love about LLMs!! The fascination lies in the illusion of intelligence, humans project meaning onto fluent text, mistaking statistical tricks for thought. That psychological hook is why people are amazed, hooked, and hyped beyond reason.</p> <p>W",
