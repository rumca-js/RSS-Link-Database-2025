        "description": "Authorities in Pakistan are trying to identify an attacker following a suicide attack outside a court in Islamabad.\n \nAt least 12 people were killed and 27 others were injured, the country's interior minister Mohsin Naqvi said.\n \nAccording to Naqvi, a bomber was planning to attack the district courthouse but was unable to get inside, and he said authorities would prioritise identifying the bomber, and that those involved would be brought to justice.\n \nPakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has alleged that extremist groups \"actively backed by India\" were involved.\n \nA spokesperson for the Indian government denied what they described as \"baseless and unfounded allegations\".\n \nJumaat Ul Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), has claimed responsibility, according to local media. But two local journalists have told the BBC that the TTP's central leadership has sent messages to them saying it has no link to the explosion.\n \nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more ",
