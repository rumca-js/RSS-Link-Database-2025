Yet even while acknowledging this failure, Dermer praised Netanyahu\u2019s leadership and tried to frame the government\u2019s response as a success. This is less about accountability and more about shaping a legacy that hides Israel\u2019s deeper failures, especially its ongoing oppression of Palestinians.",
