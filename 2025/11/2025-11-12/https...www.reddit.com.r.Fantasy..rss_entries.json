It legit would not have changed the story in the slightest if she were like 23. </p> <p>My other confusion is why Mia came to a school for literal assassin&#39;s for the dark goddess but drew the line at killing innocents?

If so, where did the petrochemicals come from? If they were also conjured from nothing through magic, then why settle on simple petrochemicals when much better alternatives exist? Why not use actual explosives? Using high explosives would be far more destructive for sure. And if you have the power to make chemical reactions (combustion in this case) happen out of nothing, then why stop at simple combustion? Why not experiment with more destructive or situationally more useful chemical reactions?</p> <p>It feels weird that an entire elementary field of magic consists exclusively of &quot;how carbon (or hydrocarbons, potentially some metals too if you&#39;re lucky) react with oxygen&quot;.

It hit me that I don\u2019t love them because they\u2019re powerful, but because they\u2019re tired and still stand up. Maybe that\u2019s what fantasy gives me: proof that even the most broken characters can still be brave.

This isn&#39;t meant to be exhaustive and I will miss out on a lot of good series and ideas here, but my aim isn&#39;t to be exhaustive, but just to give examples that fall at all different points on the spectrum.</p> <p>Also, this is not a comment on the quality of the series at all or how well that magic works within its own universe. It&#39;s merely a comment on the depth and intellectual complexity of the magic system itself. It&#39;s not at all a comment on the quality of authorship, the story, the characters etc. Here are my ratings:</p> <p><strong>1/10: Dungeons and Dragons:</strong> Has a bit of lore WRT to magic with the Weave and Mystra etc. but it&#39;s mostly functional and modular, based on Vancian casting, and magic is a tool with limited use mechanics. Understandable, since DnD is predominantly a TTRPG and not a novel series prompting deep reflection",

He is an incredible writer that is truly elite when it comes to character development, aesthetic, and world building. The simple truth I&#39;ve come to realise is that Kristoff writes beautiful, painful, dark stories that he is too scared to finish.</p> <p>It was an issue in Nevernight to a degree, but the way he ends EOD is a travesty. It appears many readers have enjoyed the ending of EOD which makes me happy, we all need good books to love these days, but I think it was a terrible option.</p> <p>The twist that the entire story over the three books was littered with falsehoods that Gabe and Celene told to buy time for their ar",
