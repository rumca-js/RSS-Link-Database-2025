He has a separate gaming console and he only ever plays roblox or fortnite so he&#39;ll never game on it. He just wants to learn the terminal and play with the software and even use LibreOffice. Im thinking that if he takes care of it then I&#39;ll upgrade it next year since he&#39;s ADHD and tends to forget about stuff after playing with it for 2 weeks and begging for it.

But I can\u2019t figure out how to do this and what I would need to get this to actually work run. My other issue is the distro, I\u2019m sticking to Arch (I use arch btw) and would love to keep using it, but KDE Plasma seems to be taking up my storage space.
