They claimed the DA was good, above 75. I used domain authority checker, MOZ and several other tools and it shows the DA was 75!</p> <p>However, when I tried searching for the articles from this site online, I couldn\u2019t find any of them through search engines, even though the articles were live on the website. I also tried searching the domain name directly, but still couldn\u2019t find the site. This made me suspicious, so I checked the website on SEMrush, and it showed the DA as 2 with very little to no organic traffic.</p> <p>Why do other DA checker tools show such a high DA? How do websites like this exist, and is it possible to fake or artificially inflate DA?

The Canada pages currently live at /locations/product-1-canada/, /locations/product-2-canada/. A lot of backlinks point specifically to those Canadian /locations/...-canada/ URLs. My goals are to preserve link equity, minimize recrawl overhead, and avoid 403/503 hiccups during any changes.</p> <p>I\u2019m debating whether to keep Canada under /locations/...-canada/ or move to a cleaner folder like /canada/product-2/. US would stay at root. I\u2019ll implement hreflang for en-us and en-ca. I understand hreflang is just an annotation and not a redirect mechanism. If someone lands on /product-2-canada, the plan is to 301 to the canonical CA URL.</p> <p>My questions are: Q1: Will SEO materially suffer if I keep a mixed structure (US at root, CA under /locations/...-canada/) instead of normalizing to /canada/product-2/?</p> <p>Q2: If I migrate CA from /locations/.",
