In general I also like the fact that it&#39;s kind of passive and depending on my mood I can take it at face value then let it stick with me or I can take it at high interest and I&#39;m not constantly watching a scene happen/being told what to see when something does happen. I like the idea of unreliable narrator and how everything is up to interpretation and at the same time it&#39;s actually specific and it doesn&#39;t go in circles.

Something portraying a light and gentle romance between two women is what we&#39;re after.</p> <p>Spicy scenes are okay and even encouraged, so long as it&#39;s well written and emotional, and not just porn for the sake of porn.

I love emotional, deep, meaningful love stories where the romance builds slowly and you can feel the tension and butterflies. I\u2019m not into fluffy or overly light \u201crom-com\u201d style reads, and I prefer when the spice is minimal or secondary to the emotional connection.</p> <p>Books that didn\u2019t work for me / felt boring: Beach Read The Unhoneymooners Twisted Love series (too spicy for me) Carley Fortune \u2013 This Summer Will Be Different</p> <p>Books I loved: Carley Fortune \u2013 Every Summer After (literally exactly what I\u2019m looking for) Colleen Hoover \u2013 honestly all of them Abby Jimenez \u2013 Just for the Summer (LOVED this one) Ren\u00e9e Carlino \u2013 Before We Were Strangers</p> <p>If you have any recommendations for heartfelt, slow-burn romances with depth and emotion, please send them my way! \u2764\ufe0f</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"ht",
