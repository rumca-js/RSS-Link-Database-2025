        "description": "Update on Key Improvements to Linux & NFS: Creating a High-Performance Standard for AI Workloads\n\nSponsored by Hammerspace\n\nThe increasing importance of AI in the enterprise has transformed the management, movement, and storage of unstructured data. Enterprises now require the high levels of storage performance and scale previously reserved for elite HPC and Hyperscale environments, as well as advanced data services to find, stage, and process the data needed for GenAI and inference workloads.\n\nThe problem is that AI workloads require high-performance access to datasets that are often distributed across existing on-prem and cloud-based storage silos, requiring performance levels traditional enterprise IT architectures are not designed for.\n\nBut within every enterprise data center there are Linux-based servers that already contain a series of high-performance enhancements that help accelerate existing IT environments to meet these challenges.\n\nWith an ongoing series of updates to the L",

This session delves into how Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) and robust governance models can balance rapid innovation with compliance and risk management. We will examine common hurdles large organizations face when integrating open-source software: from navigating license compliance and security vulnerabilities to managing contributions and community engagement. Through best practices and case studies, attendees will learn how to establish effective open source policies and processes that encourage innovation rather than hinder it. Key topics include setting up an OSPO charter, automated license compliance checks, inner sourcing vs. outsourcing decisions, and fostering a company culture that aligns with open-source values. With OSPO adoption growing 32% s",

        "description": "Securing Open Source With SBOM: From Visibility To Trust - Heejo Lee, Korea University\n\nA Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a comprehensive inventory of all software components within a product, including open-source software (OSS). However, applying SBOMs to OSS projects presents several technical challenges, such as identifying modified OSS components, analyzing third-party dependencies, and verifying security vulnerabilities. In this talk, we introduce IoTcube.net, an automated platform for SBOM generation and vulnerability verification, which integrates with OpenSSF Guac and OpenVEX to enhance the usability and interoperability of SBOM documents. We then propose collaborative initiatives to strengthen OSS security such as standard representation of OSS and licenses, vulnerability management of unpatched OSS components, and recommendation of SBOM management followed by a discussion on potential joint efforts.",

This talk will begin by explaining the transition from traditional lexical search to vector-based similarity search, and how OpenSearch combines both approaches in one complete package.\n\nThe session introduces fundamental concepts of vector databases, including how they store and process embedded meanings of various data types (text, images, and audio) using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) functionality.\n\nWe'll explore practical applications such as visual search, semantic search, and recommendation engines, with emphasis on real-world use cases. This is your opportunity to learn how OpenSearch can serve as a knowledge base for AI systems, particularly in applications like retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with large language models.",
