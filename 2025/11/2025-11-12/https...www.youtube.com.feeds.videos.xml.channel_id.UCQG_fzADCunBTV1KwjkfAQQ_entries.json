One family can\u2019t possibly finish it all, so neighbors often come by to pick some, and the overripe or bug-bitten ones are simply fed to the pigs.\nThe flesh can be tender and crisp, or soft and sweet when cooked. With just one chayote, you can make a whole table of dishes \u2014 steamed, stir-fried, stewed, or mixed cold \u2014 and every way tastes delicious.\n\nHello, everyone! I am Dianxi Xiaoge, a Yunnan native. If you enjoy my videos, please keep subscribing to my channel. I'll continue to share my life and Yunnan-styled food in my uploads. Wish you have a happy life and enjoy tasty food every day\n\nYouTube\u3010\u6ec7\u897f\u5c0f\u54e5 Dianxi Xiaoge\u3011\u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/2MH1T5N\nFacebook\u3010\u6ec7\u897f\u5c0f\u54e5 Dianxi Xiaoge\u3011 \u25b6\ufe0fhttps://bit.ly/",
