The one about our bodies, emotions, relationships, consent, and identity. The one that could\u2019ve helped a generation grow up informed instead of confused.\n\nIn a culture where speaking about sex or intimacy is treated like a crime, silence has become our default teacher. Teenagers are left to learn about their own biology from the internet, whispers, or half-truths shared behind closed doors. Schools, bound by fear and tradition, pretend these conversations don\u2019t exist \u2014 and in doing so, fail to protect the very students they aim to guide.\n\nIn his talk, Utsho dives deep into the uncomfortable truth: our education system skipped a chapter that could change lives.

        "description": "Stained glass isn\u2019t dying. It\u2019s misunderstood.\nIn this talk, stained glass preservationist and advocate Megan McElfresh challenges the myths that keep this ancient art form trapped in nostalgia.\nFrom sacred spaces to community revitalization, McElfresh explores how stained glass can be reframed as infrastructure: an act of generosity, not just a relic to be protected. Her talk confronts scarcity mindsets and survival-mode thinking, which are all too common in preservation work.\nThis is an invitation to reimagine the role stained glass plays in our world today and to choose growth, trust, and abundance in the face of decay.\nWhat will you see the next time you notice a bit of stained glass? Megan McElfresh is a nationally recognized speaker, writer, community advocate, and dedicated artisan with deep roots at the intersection of preservation trades, architectural glass art, and community service. Growing up in stained glass studios instilled in her a passion for hands-on creative trades",
