In 2026, Valve is looking to expand their Steam hardware family with the Steam Frame, a standalone VR headset that doesn't need a PC to run your games. Within the headset lies a computer running SteamOS that gives you access to games in your Steam library, allowing you to play them locally within your headset on either a giant 2D screen within your headset, or a fully VR capable game. Valve has packed a lot of tech into the Steam Frame to allow seamless wireless capabilities to play your VR games at high fidelity. The new Valve VR headset comes with a wireless adapter to stream your VR games from a higher end PC to the Steam Frame for maximum potential. No release date has been give for the Steam Frame of any of Valve's other recently announced hardware, though you can expect them to all launch side-by-side in early 2026.",

        "description": "Valve has resurrected the Steam Machine, this time aiming to make a splash to own a corner of the PC market with a console-like PC meant to be a part of your living room. After the success of the Steam Deck, Valve is spinning up a family of Steam branded hardware in an effort to create an ecosystem that gives you access to your Steam Library pretty much anywhere you are. Designed to easily run most modern games at 4K, 60fps, the Steam Machine does not yet have a price, though you can expect it to be \"competitively\" priced to similarly spec'd hardware. An example of that hardware is a PC with an NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU. The Steam Machine release date is still an unknown with an expectation to launch in early 2026 alongside the Steam Frame and the new Steam Controller. At the heart of the new Steam hardware family is SteamOS, exactly as it is on the Steam Deck.",

It has a great understanding of what makes wuxia such a compelling subgenre of fantasy fiction, bleeding into the vibrancy of it\u2019s characters and the flair of its combat. But it becomes clear pretty quickly that the attempt to shove as many kinds of experiences into one game \u2013 open world adventure, action-heavy MMO, musical rhythm game, card battler, etc. \u2013 only ensures that none of these elements reach their full potential. Instead, Where Winds Meet is an amusement park where every ride is being run at half speed, and the sugary treats at the concession stands come with piles of paperwork to complete before you can chow down.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

I get stuck in a \"just one more run\" mindset every time I sit down to play what I swear is going to be a quick round or two. Its strategies run surprisingly deep for a simple brick-breaker, rewarding smart planning and forethought more so than RNG and luck alone. It's a rare game that I\u2019m still excited to play well after I beat the main story, and, in a lot of ways, I wish I were playing it right now. If you want your life to be completely upended by a seemingly simple brick-breaking roguelite, I cannot recommend it enough.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",

In a recenty financial report, the studio has failed to meet sales and user engagement expectations, about four years after Sony had acquired Bungie. The studios is currently in development in the long-delayed shooter, Marathon, as well as continuing to support Destiny 2. In more positive Sony news, Ghost of Y\u014dtei has sold more than 3 million units in its first month, roughly on par with its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, which sold through 5 million units in four months back in 2020. And finally, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition has been hit with controversy over its price and technical issues since being launched yesterday.",
