        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I got hacked via Facebook and they logged into a bunch of other accounts that were also linked to Facebook. Now I am trying to escape the Metaverse (Something I was going to address over the weekend but felt to sick to do and now I am livid). Going through my app logins to make sure I haven&#39;t missed any accounts.</p> <p>Low and behold, my 12 year old self signed up to HUNDREDS of Playstore games if not thousands using Facebook. </p> <p>I&#39;m honestly not sure what to do with this information. I&#39;ve made a list of Facebook connected apps that I will need to change to an email login (basically just games I will probably want to come back to and apps like Uber).</p> <p>Will Facebook remove the connections to these apps once the account is deleted or should I do it manually before deletion? Does it even matter since they already have my data connected to Facebook? Should I give up at life and hope to be reincarnated as a privacy conscious snail?<",
