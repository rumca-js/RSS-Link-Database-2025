For the most part, I am using PBS to back up all of my containers/VMs, but I also have a few desktops and laptops that run Linux, MacOS, and Windows. I am looking to build my own fully featured backup solution and will probably use my TrueNAS Scale instance as the target for said backups. </p> <p>This leaves out one important element. Which backup software should I consider? What are you using and why do you like it? If at all possible, I would like to use just one tool, and then consolidate all backup tasks to it. It would make managing it much easier, I would think.</p> <p>I hear a lot of good things about Kopia, but isn&#39;t it limited to just storing backups and snapshots to the cloud? My goal is stay local as much as possible. What about Duplicati?</p> <p>Thanks, just looking forward to getting some advice, feedback, and opinions on what you run, what you tried and didn&#39;t like, etc.</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_",

The Proxmox UI has limited options when it comes to cloud init user data configuration.</p> <p>I&#39;m now at the stage where I have a snippets store on a storage accessible by all pve nodes, so I can use the -cicustom command, but that completely overrides whatever user related data is set in proxmox cloud-init UI. That&#39;s okay.</p> <p>Does anyone have some killer examples on how to properly configure Debian images for cloud init?</p> <p>It&#39;d be cool if it created a user, and configured SSH configuration so that ssh login would be allowed from localhost and tailscale with allow password authentication but for the rest there would be another port like 2222 that would only allow SSH key based authentication. I&#39;m not sure how to do that, but some ufw firewall rules need to be added as well.</p> <p>It should also install tai",

I have 4 x 4TB HDDs and from what I understand I can create a pool with these disks. I was reading up on the advantage/disadvantages on different RAID levels and it sounded like using mirrored pools was a good option if you want to add more/replace the smaller drives in the future. </p> <p>This is where I&#39;m a tad confused. When reading about Mirrored vDevs it sounds like I would create 2 pools of 2 x 4TB drives and then I can combine them to get 8TB of usable space out of the 16 TB total. When I create the pool with the mirrored RAID option I only end up with 4TB of usable space when I throw all the disks in the pool. I feel like I&#39;m getting lost in the ZFS sauce right now and not sure what the best way to setup these 4 x 4TB disks. Any help/ guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SelectAerie1126\"",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey!</p> <p>I&#39;m seeking help on how I can improve my homelab setup.</p> <p>Currently I only have a HP Elitedesk 800 g4 mini with an 8th gen i7, 32gb ram and a 256gb nvme. I have this hooked up to my router in my TV cabinet.</p> <p>This runs several docker containers such as homeassistant, a couple game servers, tailscale and a couple other small things. I also picked up a cyberpower UPS on ebay for a good price too.</p> <p>I want to build this out a bit better, maybe setting up a nas for plex and organise it a bit better in my cupboard.</p> <p>Should I get a rack? Should I run a nas through a seperate machine?</p> <p>I also don&#39;t have very good internet in my area... 50mb down. no fibre here yet unfortunately.</p> <p>Any suggestions would be great!<br/> Cheers!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CxJoe\"> /u/CxJoe </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ouqu2a/su",
