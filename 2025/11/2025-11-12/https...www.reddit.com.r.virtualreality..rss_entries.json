LIke if I&#39;m watching netflix and I try to turn it up, it only moves the phone slider, not even the &quot;all volumes&quot; slider. I have to expand the menu to show all of the sliders, and pick the media slider from there. Makes the hard buttons basically useless. Has anyone found a way to switch the default slider that&#39;s controlled by the rocker switch?</p> <p>Second thing, I&#39;m using the Iris detection for security, but sometimes I want to share <em>only what experience I&#39;m in right now</em> with another human, via the headset. Like I want to show my family a 360 photo, for example. As soon as I take the headset off, it locks. I can give them my PIN but then they can get into the device at any time, and I don&#39;t need the kids having incidental access to my full gmail",
