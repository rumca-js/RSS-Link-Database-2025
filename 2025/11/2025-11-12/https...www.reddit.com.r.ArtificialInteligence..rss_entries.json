OpenAI used copyrighted material to train its models without getting licenses or permission from the rights holders.

This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method (BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights, we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its ef",

Trying to wave to the audience, Aidol lost its balance and toppled over.

Our approach leverages Qwen3 as the base model with specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adapters to create three distinct expert modules: tool calling, tool response interpretation, and direct dialogue. The system not only meets but exceeds the computational constraints, delivering responses in an average of 3 seconds (well under the 7-second limit) on L40S GPUs while utilizing less than 30GB of the available 48GB VRAM, demonstrating efficiency alongside performance. This computational efficiency also contributes to reduced energy consumption and lower carbon footprint compared to less optimized approaches.

Prior work explores confidence estimation for self-evaluating LLM-scorer systems, with confidence scorers estimating the likelihood of errors in LLM responses. However, most methods focus on single-step outputs and overlook the challenges of multi-step reasoning. In this work, we extend self-evaluation techniques to multi-step tasks, testing two intuitive approaches: holistic scoring and step-by-step scoring. Using two multi-step benchmark datasets, we show that stepwise evaluation generally outperforms holistic scoring in detecting potential errors, with up to 15% relative increase in AUC-ROC. Our findings demonstrate that self-evaluating LLM systems provide meaningful confidence estimates in complex reasoning, impr",
