But Dumbledore tells Harry that it only ever worked fully for him, its rightful master. So what\u2019s the secret power hidden inside the Cloak?\n\nIn this video, J dives deep into the theory that the Cloak\u2019s magic isn\u2019t about invisibility at all \u2014 it\u2019s about protection. From Moody\u2019s enchanted eye to the Marauder\u2019s Map and even Nagini at Godric\u2019s Hollow, every moment the Cloak \u201cfails\u201d actually proves it\u2019s doing something more powerful\u2026 \ud83d\ude09\nBecause sometimes, to stay hidden\u2026 you have to be seen.\n#HarryPotter #SuperCarlinBrothers \n\nWritten by: J & Ben Carlin\nEdited by: Ethan Edghill\n\n\ud83c\udf9f\ufe0f Through the Griffin Door LIVE Tour \u2014 Southwe",
