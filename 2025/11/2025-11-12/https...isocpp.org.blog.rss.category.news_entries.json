It offers a candid look at what worked beautifully, what fell short, and what future language features could make reflection-driven automation even more powerful.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<h3>\n\t\t<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1nw39g4/a_month_of_writing_reflectionsbased_code_what/\">A Month of Writing Reflections-based Code: What have I learned?</a></h3>\n\t<p>\n\t\tby Boris Staleti&#263;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFrom the article:</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI have been trying to automate writing my own pybind11 binding code with the help of C++26 reflections, as implemented by clang-p2996.</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThere were moments wher",
