I\u2019ll start with the cons.</p> <p>Hardly any dialogue tags so the dialogue was janky at times. Overall writing was a little unclear at times with what was going on even when reading slowly. </p> <p>Pros The challenges of comprehending what was happening made the book better and more interesting in many ways also. The characterization is amazing The description and prose is fantastic The dialogue is natural and convincing The plot is engaging The themes and symbolism is provoking </p> <p>Overall, a fantastic novel. Complex and jammed back of all the delicious parts that make good literature. </p> <p>What was the books biggest strength/your favorite part of it. And What was the books biggest weakness/ your biggest gripe. </p> <p>And\u2026 Does anyone still read classic literature? \ud83d\ude02 I hope so. This book is awesome. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",
