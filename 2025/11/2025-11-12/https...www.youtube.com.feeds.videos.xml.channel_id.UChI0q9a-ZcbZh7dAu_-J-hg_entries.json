Use code ECHELON at the link below and get 60% off an annual plan: https://incogni.com/echelon\n\nThe \"New\" YouTube ban wave, is actually... not so new. With a markedly lower number of bans in the past year, creators are now flocking to the narrative that \"New AI Tools are Taking Over YouTubes Moderation, and Wrongfully Banning Creators\"... despite the facts not supporting that position, and the fact that many of them seemingly deserve the terminations for their constant, spam content behavior. \n\nIts difficult to take YouTubes side on anything these days, but the dual narrative being displayed on social media is not one I can realistically support this time. \n\n\n\nHONEYGAIN LINK: https://r.honeygain.me/UPPER98872\n\nVPN DEAL: https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=1448&aff_id=19647\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\nBecome a channel member: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChI0q9a-ZcbZh7dAu_",
