It looks great on paper, but the stack is pretty outdated (too much outdated, LAMP Stack), and the growth curve has started to flatten.</p> <p>I\u2019m now seriously planning to switch to a better product-based company. The thing is, there\u2019s so much noise online that it\u2019s hard to figure out what <em>actually</em> matters for landing a good role. Everyone says something different about DSA, System Design, Core CS, and projects.</p> <p>So I wanted to ask people who\u2019ve made that jump recently or been on the interview side:</p> <ul> <li>How should I divide my focus between DSA, System Design, and practical development work?</li> <li>What\u2019s realistically tested more these days in product-based interviews?</li> <li>For someone working full-time, what\u2019s the most effective prep strategy to stay consistent?</li> <li>What\u2019s",
