I have a Qnap TS-451+ NAS that I have had for a very long time. I wanted to finally upgrade the drives from 3TB to 6TB I found a really good deal on 4 6 TB HGST drives on eBay but when I received them I didn&#39;t realize that they were SAS connectors and my NAS has regular Sata connections. </p> <p>Is there a SAS to SATA connector/adapter that I could use so I can still use the drives or am I out of luck and need to return them. I thought I checked the Compatibility list on QNAPs site but maybe I missed something. </p> <p>Thank you for your help. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Zero00Shadow\"> /u/Zero00Shadow </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1ovldja/advice_needed_qnap_ts451_and_hgst_6tb_0f22791/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/",
