        "description": "Today on The Matt Walsh Show, the Trump Administration announced their 50-year mortgage plan, but this is a really bad idea. I\u2019ll explain. Also, Kristi Noem gives a tone deaf response to legitimizing immigrants. This is not the advocacy for Americans we were asking for. An A.I. country song dominates the charts. And the author of the Left\u2019s favorite book is whining about book banning. How is this still a prevailing narrative on the Left? We will discuss.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n00:00 - 00:27 Opening\n02:22 - 32:05 Why We Need 50 Million Deportations Instead Of 50 Year Mortgages, AI Music Tops The Charts, And More \n34:33 - 45:44 Kristi Noem Says It's A Good Thing That More Foreigners Are Becoming Citizens\n45:45 - 57:07 This AI Song Is Topping The Country Music Charts\n58:32 - 1:10:24 Margaret Atwood, CBS News, And Every Leftist Falsely Whining About Book Bans Are Canceled\n\nEp.1690\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kUfulOZEzkbzPaYBGqViIw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTE0MDA7aD0xMDU4O2NmPXdl",
