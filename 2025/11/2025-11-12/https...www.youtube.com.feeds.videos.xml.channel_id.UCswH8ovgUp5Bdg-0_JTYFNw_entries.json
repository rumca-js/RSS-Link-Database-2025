        "description": "The BBC was caught editing a Trump speech to make it seem like he incited the Capitol riot \u2014 splicing two clips nearly an hour apart. This wasn\u2019t a mistake; it was a worldview in action. When the press believes deceit is justified in the name of \u201cdefending democracy,\u201d truth itself becomes expendable. From the \u201cfine people\u201d hoax to moral crusades that turn politics into theology, the media\u2019s war on Trump reveals a deeper crisis: what happens when journalism stops reporting power and starts performing it?\n[UNPACKED]\n\nGo to http://rumble.com/premium/brand and use code BRAND to save $10 on your annual subscription\n\nWATCH me LIVE Monday, Wednesday, Friday - on Rumble: \n\nAll links: https://linktr.ee/RussellBrand",
