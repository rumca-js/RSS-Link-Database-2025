Below, we take an in-depth look at the rise of the plucky little mascot, Astro Bot. The pack-in PS5 game Astro's Playroom popularized the character and led to his own award-winning standalone game.</em></p><p dir=\"ltr\">Is Astro, the star of Astro's Playroom and Astro Bot, a Sony mascot? Nicolas Doucet isn't so sure. While the soft-spoken head of Team Asobi recognizes that the plucky little robot has the makings of a marquee character, and while it's become the face of the studio and even graces its logo, he also doesn't think it's his or the studio's place to say. To hear him tell it, a mascot is grown organically out of affection from fans, not a status assigned by corporate masters. On a recent trip to Team Asobi's studio in Japan, we got an up-close look at how Astro came to be and the design philosophy that drives the studio's playful, polished little automaton.</p><h2 dir=\"ltr\">Birt",

Some playlists will indeed have skill-based matchmaking toggled on, but most won't.</p><p>Developer Treyarch <a href=\"https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1988350686925648080\">said on social media</a> that the majority of the Black Ops 7 multiplayer playlists will have what is described as \"open\" matchmaking. In these playlists, skill is only \"minimally considered,\" just as it was during the Black Ops 7 beta where Activision first rolled this out.</p><p>The exception for Black Ops 7 will be one rotating Moshpit playlist where \"skill will be an important consideration.\" Additionally, Black Ops 7 Ranked play will feature SBMM when it launches in Season 2.</p><a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-black-ops-7-multiplayer-playlists-will-have-sbmm-but-most-wont/1100-6536138/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/\">Continue Reading at GameSpot</a>",
