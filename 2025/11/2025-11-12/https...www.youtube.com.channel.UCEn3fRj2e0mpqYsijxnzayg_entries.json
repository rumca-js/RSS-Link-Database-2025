        "description": "Two years ago, I built a \u201cbulletproof\u201d ball gown\u2026 that didn\u2019t fit me. Turns out, wrapping yourself in duct tape and filling it with foam isn\u2019t the most accurate way to make a mannequin. So this time, I brought in Hollywood special-effects pros to literally cast my entire body in plaster to make \u201cXyla-Foam 2.0.\u201d It\u2019s messy, weirdly scientific, and mildly horrifying\u2014but also kind of beautiful.\n\nWatch the full video to see how we cloned me in foam (and what I plan to build next).\n\nSupport me on Patreon:\n\ud83d\udcb8 https://patreon.com/xylafoxlin\n\nFollow me on social media:\n\ud83d\udcf8 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/xylafoxlin/\n\ud83d\udc26 X (fka Twitter): https://x.com/xylafoxlin\n\ud83d\udcd8 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/xylafoxlin\n\ud83c\udfb6 TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@xylafoxlin\n\nBuy my MERCH:\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.xylafoxlin.com/\n\nAll my favorite Amazon Items!:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/xylafoxlin\n(filming setup, safety gear, etc)\n\n\ud83d\udc8c SEND ME THINGS \ud83d\udce6 :\nXyla Foxlin\n3727 W.
