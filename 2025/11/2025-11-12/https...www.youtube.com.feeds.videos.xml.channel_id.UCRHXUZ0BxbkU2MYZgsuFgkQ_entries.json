That\u2019s right, Paradox and Ubisoft have somehow created a game where I, the humble Spiffing Brit, can turn a simple Roman fishing village into a gold-spewing mega-city producing infinite wealth faster than Nero can burn down Rome.\n\nAnno 117: Pax Romana is a genre-defining strategic city builder set during the height of the Roman Empire. You can expand your influence through trade, diplomacy, or military might \u2014 but as always, I will be ignoring all of that and instead using pure economic exploits to create the world\u2019s most overpowered Roman province.\n\nWill I use my vast wealth to bring peace to the empire, or will I accidentally crash the denarius? There\u2019s only one way to find out.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/S",
