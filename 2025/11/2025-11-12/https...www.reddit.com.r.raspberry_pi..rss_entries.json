I know the possibilities are limitless when it comes to them, so when at work a nearly impossible demand for a specific device came up I knew raspberry pi could solve it. Now I might be in over my head but I want to try and accomplish this. I am tasked with building a light sensor for a client that will notify him if his aquarium lights remain on after hours and also of power outages. I have a pi zero 2, PiZ-UpTime Plus, Adafruit DS1307, and Adafruit AS7341.</p> <p>My question is multifaceted, all three devices require them same 5v, sda, scl. Is there a way to set one of the nonprogrammed, i.e. GPIO 23 to fulfill one of those roles? Do I need to use a breadboard,...and how do those work? Can I solder on additional headers on top of the PiZ-UpTime Plus and stack my peripherals? Or is there a simple solution I just don&#39;t know of. All advice is appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted",
