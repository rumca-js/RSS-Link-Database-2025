        "description": "Valve just announced a brand new lineup of Steam hardware \u2014 including the Steam Frame VR headset, a redesigned Steam Controller, and most exciting of all, their upcoming Steam Machine.\nThis small-form-factor PC runs official SteamOS and promises 4K 60 FPS gaming with FSR, powered by a semi-custom AMD Zen 4 + RDNA 3 APU. With built-in power, quiet cooling, RGB notifications, and full Steam Deck-style suspend/resume features \u2014 this could finally be Valve\u2019s true living-room gaming console.\nIn this video, I break down everything Valve just revealed: specs, features, pricing rumors, and why this might be the perfect middle ground between a Steam Deck and a gaming PC.\n\nLearn More Here: https://store.steampowered.com/sale/hardware\n\nFollow Me On Twitter: https://twitter.com/theetaprime\nFollow Me On Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etaprime/\n\nVip-URCDKey 25% Halloween sale code for software\uff1aETA\nWindows 11 Pro Key($23):https://biitt.ly/RUZiX\nWindows 11 Home Key($22):https://biitt.ly/SQKqi\nW",
