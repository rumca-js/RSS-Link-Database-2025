What did the esports team you consulted with change about this mouse? What other materials did you consider for this speaker driver? Normally, these kinds of questions don't result in satisfying answers, but Valve's engineers are refreshingly open. The Steam Machine? Oh yeah, we chose a fan big enough to cool the components and worked backwards from there.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-how-did-valve-design-the-steam-machine-it-started-with-the-fan-of-course\">Read more</a></p>",

After all, the Steam Controller will work with any PC, just like any PC gamepad will work on the Steam Machine, and it's a much-anticipated sequel for the small but passionate group that treasured the original Steam Controller.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-controller-preview-a-smart-touch-centric-gamepad-that-also-packs-in-traditional-controls\">Read more</a></p>",

It also marks the debut of two key technologies, Foveated Streaming and SteamOS on ARM, allowing the headset to be a capable option both for streaming games rendered remotely and playing games directly on the Frame's Snapdragon chipset. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-frame-preview-a-long-awaited-standalone-vr-headset-that-runs-steam-games-on-arm\">Read more</a></p>",

The Bellevue-based firm is making three hardware announcements today, including a new Steam Machine mini PC that it claims is more than six times as powerful as the Steam Deck, a revised Steam Controller with more mainstream appeal, and the Steam Frame, a new standalone VR headset that marks the debut of SteamOS on ARM mobile chips. All three are due to arrive in early 2026. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival\">Read more</a></p>",
