The idea is to offer it as a service to companies as a digital assistant for their customers. I love working on it and I started out with a simple VPS with only 8 GB ram and 4cpu&#39;s, no GPU. This was sufficient to test the app idea and use the smallest OLLama LLM. But now it takes about 5 minutes (!) to get an answer.</p> <p>So if I want to bring it to market, I will need a better solution. Looking for a hoster that offers a platform wich will make the chatbot usable. Scalability would be a big plus, as I&#39;m not able how much power I will need. Costs will be a major factor. I am aiming to keep it down to approximately \u20ac100,-/month for now.</p> <p>Of course I searched myself but it is a rabbit hole you can easily get lost in and some community tips will be welcome.<br/> Who can give some advise/tips from their own experience?<br/> Looking for things to keep in mind when continuing with this idea b",

Author of <a href=\"https://dozzle.dev/\">Dozzle</a> and <a href=\"https://dtop.dev/\">dtop</a> here. dtop is a &quot;top-like&quot; Docker manager and log viewer. It was featured a few weeks ago. I got a lot of good feedback from everybody. I have made some significant changes that I wanted to announce:</p> <p>- `dtop` v0.3 has been completely rewritten in Rust \ud83d\ude80 As a result, total CPU usage for about 20 containers should be around ~0%! (Yes you read that right)<br/> - Added log viewing and fixed multiple bugs around wrapping and styling<br/> - Added stop, restart and remove options with a new context menu. Similar to `ctop`<br/> - Added vim keyboard shortcuts<br/> - Implemented container health status<br/> - Finally, support mouse wheel to scroll up and down</p> <p><a href=\"https://github.com/amir20/dtop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">https://github.com/amir20/dtop/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by ",

Here\u2019s what it does:</p> <ul> <li>Listens for a real Minecraft LoginStart handshake and launches your server process automatically when the first player joins.</li> <li>Polls the server via RCON and an idle timeout (configurable).</li> </ul> <p>I made this because I was self-hosting a modded forge server that had relatively low player activity.
