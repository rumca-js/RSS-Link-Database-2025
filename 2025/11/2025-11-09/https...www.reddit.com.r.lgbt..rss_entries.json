But I don\u2019t think I could ever come out, even if I might actually be into women. I\u2019m 17, and I\u2019ve realized that being shoved into a \u201cmen only\u201d corner doesn\u2019t feel great. I appreciate women, and their bodies too\u2014 everyone, really. I\u2019ve found that I am attracted to trans men, trans women. Wow, and they seem like a dream. Beautiful beautiful people. Anyone, really. As long as I like you. This part doesn\u2019t seem to matter, but I\u2019ve always felt a bit more masculine, despite being feminine presenting. I\u2019m really straight passing, so it\u2019s even hard for opportunities like these to come to me. </p> <p>One time, I gave my bisexual friend a hint about some girl I used to smooch on the low. The \u201csome girl\u201d ended up having feeling for another man. I realized that I felt something. That I craved her once she was gone. It brought tears to my eyes every time I though",

Obviously gender preferences are a thing, but is it a general, nondiscriminatory attraction (barring racism etc..)? Like if you see any sexual trait/organ associated with your gender preference, are you immediately attracted? Is the attraction immediate and unrelated to the acts associated with the organs?

I saw the signs, and guessed that she might be coming out soon, but I didn\u2019t say anything. The last few weeks, we\u2019ve been hanging out a lot, and I noticed that she was wearing some new cool makeup. This friday, I commented that she looked kind of femenine, and that it looked good on her. This led to her directly asking me if I understood that she was trans, to which I replied that I did. She seemes very happy, and genuinely exited about it. On the other hand, she does not have a new name, ao I just call her her deadname, since it\u2019s the only name she has. To my knowledge, I\u2019m the first person who knows. How can I make her feel seen without outing her?
