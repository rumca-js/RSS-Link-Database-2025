It\u2019s an isometric dungeon crawler, and the steam version barely works, but it\u2019s super fun. You start in a town and have to kill a standard evil villain guy, a former monk if I remember correctly. At one point he turns everyone to stone permanently, too. But my favorite part was that you could play two people at once (sorceress for the lycanthropy in early game and a warrior to take hits was my favorite combo). Your characters could die of old age and hunger, too, and you could do some insane ability combos. I think it\u2019s a great game, and I want to know your thoughts.

Two fold out chair/cusions, 32\u201d 4k Samsung TV and automatic hdmi switch. All wireless 8bitdo controllers for the genesis 1 and 2 minis, nes mini, snes mini, a real gameboy, abernic 350m and miyoo mini+ handhelds, and an Xbox Series S for Halo. Built and stained the floating shelf myself, similar to Amazon stuff but I needed a different length and pass throughs to conceal all the wiring.
