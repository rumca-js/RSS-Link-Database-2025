Despite of numerous reviews game \u201cParks\u201d remains a question for me. It\u2019s beautiful (yes) but I cannot get some impression about gameplay (at least from videos I saw). What is your take on this? You find it interesting? Is it esthetic over gameplay case? And finally I see that there is initial edition and edition 2.0. If someone tried both - what is the better version? Thank you all. </p> <p>P.S. Also in parallel we wouldn\u2019t mind recommendations.
