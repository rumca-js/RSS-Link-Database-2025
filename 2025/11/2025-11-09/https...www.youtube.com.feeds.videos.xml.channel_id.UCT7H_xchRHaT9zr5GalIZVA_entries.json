Instead, it became one of the hardest addictions I\u2019ve ever had to break.\nVlog channel https://youtube.com/EvanEdinger\nSome info for those trying to quit kratom: https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom\n\nThank you so much for watching! Hope you enjoyed it!\n\n\nIf you're new to my channel and videos, hi! I'm Evan Edinger, and I make weekly \"comedy\" videos every Sunday evening. As an American living in London I love noticing the funny differences between the cultures and one of my most popular video series is my British VS American one. I'm also known for making terrible puns so sorry in advance. Hope to see you around, and I'll see you next Sunday! :)\n\nIf you want to know HOW I make my videos including gear, lighting, all the tiddly bits that connect it all together, (with cheaper alternatives and kit I used to use), I've listed each item, what it's great at, and why I use it on the gear section of my website here:  \nhttps://www.evanedinger.co",
