This is only the second time I\u2019ve rewatched it, but I remember enjoying the movie the first time in the early 2000s. Here are some observations:</p> <ol> <li><p>Tom Hanks can play a bad guy \u2014 albeit a principled bad guy. But the prosthetic nose seemed unnecessary to me. </p></li> <li><p>The actor who played Michael did a credible job and looks like a young Ray Liotta (minus the blue eyes; RIP). </p></li> <li><p>Paul Newman was still bringing the heat, just a few years before his death. I liked his choice of a vague Irish brogue \u2014 after all, he\u2019s been living in America for many years presumably. His piano duet with Hanks was incredible, setting up the triangle with Newman\u2019s bio son without any dialogue.</p></li> </ol> <p>When he chastises his son in front of his mob captains, he bangs his hand HARD on the table. At his advanced age! </p> <ol> <li><p>Daniel Craig epitomized the entitled, soft brat of a son. ",

The first hour made me think it was going to be a happy-go-lucky movie. Then it got intense when they began having relationships issues all the way to the end. And I must say I love how real it is. Personally I tend to like movies where the main characters don\u2019t end up together as expected. I feel it\u2019s a somewhat accurate representation of life. Sometimes, no matter how in love or perfect for each other two people are they don\u2019t end up together for one reason or the other. And something about that is so touching and beautiful to me. Which I think is what is shown in this movie. I loved the ending. Kind of makes me think around what happiness truly is. At the end they\u2019re both happy having achieved their dreams but at the cost of each other. So are they truly happy or just satisfied. Do they regret any decisions they made in the past or hope thin",

I forgot how absolutely brutal is the Sack of Troy. It starts, and immediately there is raping of women, hurling of babies into the walls and burning buildings, women being pushed out of the windows with a rope around their neck, the constant screaming of women in the background.. I mean, studying history, particularly the history of war is my hobby since elementary school and from all the material I&#39;ve read and documentaries I&#39;ve watched I know the reality of war, especially war in the ancient world all the way up to the middle ages and beyond, but honestly? This part of the movie must be one of the most horrifying things I&#39;ve ever watched.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/resadtriariosvenit_\"> /u/resadtriariosvenit_ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/com",

I mean it\u2019s about getting older and about connection betweena middle-age woman trying to survive in a messed up sexist and racist world and an older guy who feels lonely.</p> <p>I like that there are so many moments where you\u2019re just kind of watching the characters and you have time to really reflect on things. It\u2019s not like nonstop action. Nothing against nonstop action of course, but the character study is quite fascinating. And you got complex characters. Nobody is a hero and nobody is a villain.</p> <p>Funny, ",
