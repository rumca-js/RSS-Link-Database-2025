I&#39;ve chewed through alot of the big names, but are there any I&#39;m missing? I&#39;m currently on Andy Serkis&#39; telling of LOTR, although im a huge rings nerd, so this isn&#39;t my first time in middle Earth. I&#39;ve chewed through most of Sanderson&#39;s works, ASOIAF, And the wheel of time. I&#39;ve finished a couple of N.K. Jemisin&#39;s series&#39;, most of the Gaiman I wanted to read, the demon cycle(?) And s.m. Sterling change novels, the first few anyways, among a spattering of others. I enjoy interesting magic systems, although they aren&#39;t an absolute, and more adult themes than young adult, more Kaladin, less Harry, if you understand my meaning. Keep in mind the audiobooks medium, if the voice actor isnt stellar, it kinda pulls you out of it, big fan of Kramer and Reading from the wheel of ",

It definitely fell into a lot of common Fantasy tropes, but I thought it did them so <em>well</em> that I didn&#39;t mind at all. The thing that impressed me the most about it was the way Vis was always calculating what to say, based on hidden motivations, figuring out what the other person should think based on his motivations, etc. The tension created by this back and forth of information and motivations was really captivating. And the ending...well, if you read TWOTM, you know I was excited for more.</p> <p>So, when I was lucky to get a copy of The Strength of the Few, I devoured it. And here are my thoughts. </p> <p>That tension from the back and forth of hidden motivations/information that I loved? Very minimal in this book, to my disappointment. This is largely due to the structure. Book one was single POV First Person, but book two has three perspectives. By moving around p",

Dan Trachtenberg (the guy behind Prey, Killer of Killers, and Predator: Badlands) has basically laid out the perfect formula for how to do sci-fi and fantasy right: Keep it as far away from Earth as possible and Focus on the characters, not the gimmicks. He\u2019s 3 for 3 so far, starting with Prey which is already shaping up to be a cult classic, Killer of Killers was surprisingly great for an animated project, and Badlands absolutely delivered. That\u2019s why I\u2019m kinda worried about this new Masters of the Universe movie. The second I heard they\u2019re doing a bunch of scenes on Earth, my excitement dropped. MOTU should live and breathe in Eternia. Give us full fantasy with swords, magic, weird creatures, all of it. We don\u2019t need some \u201cmodern-day Earth\u201d subplot to make it relatable. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones proved audiences will show up for pure fantasy if it\u2019s done right. And then there\u2019s Jared",

Dishonored (game series for those unfamiliar) has one of my favorite fantasy worlds that I\u2019ve seen and I\u2019ve been looking for stories with similar setting and worldbuilding. I don\u2019t just mean flintlock fantasy but also the way magic is treated. The clash between the pseudo-steampunk technology, the occult/eldrich magic, the brutal anti-magic religion and weird everyday creatures (river krusts, bloodflies etc.) is just something forever etched in my mind. </p> <p>I know that it is a lot and I am <em>not</em> asking for something that has all of the above, just a comparably rich worldbuilding with similar flavor. The closest thing I\u2019ve read that I can think of is the Raven\u2019s Mark series by Ed McDonnald (which is highly underappreciated) but I can\u2019t think of anything else remotely similar. </p> <p>Does anyone have any reccomendations? I am sure I am not the only Dishonored fan who feels this way. Thank you in advance.</p> </div><",

I love stories where the main character starts off broke or at the bottom, has to slowly figure out their powers, and improves through hard work, practice, and/or lot of trial and error. Like the mc doesn&#39;t even realize how talented he is because he so focused on the grind. I especially like when they\u2019re surrounded by people who are richer, more talented, or better connected, so they have to grind even harder to catch up. </p> <p>Any similar book recs with that kind of underdog/solo vibe?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/h0lidaytime\"> /u/h0lidaytime </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1os92lv/need_books_like_inheritance_of_magic/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1os92lv/need_books_like_inheritance_of_magic/\">[c",

I\u2019m 19, studying computer science, and I live in my university hostel. Life here is busy and loud, but also full of ideas that sometimes feel straight out of a fantasy story.</p> <p>I recently started writing and reading more fantasy, and I really enjoy it. There\u2019s something special about the way fantasy lets you build whole worlds from your imagination. For me, it\u2019s one of the best escapes from study stress.</p> <p>But the hard part is finding time. Between classes and other work, it\u2019s not easy to sit down and write or even read long chapters. So I wanted to ask\u2014if you\u2019re a student or working full time, how do you keep up with your fantasy reading or writing?</p> <p>Do you plan a fixed time for it, or just jump in when you can? And if you\u2019ve had any funny or tough moments while trying to balance both, I\u2019d love to hear about them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON",

Even his tone and inner conflict remind me of Kip. The treatment of the Gifted also echoes how orogenes are seen in Broken Earth being feared, controlled, and forced to hide what they are in general and especially while Nassun is travelling. Plus, the Ilseth\u2013Davian dynamic really parallels Schaffa and Nassun. And the fact that the Gifted\u2019s abilities can be shut off by others? Super similar to Broken Earth\u2019s Guardian/orogene power suppression dynamic.</p> <p>Anyone else get those same vibes, or am I just seeing patterns everywhere?

However I really dislike \u201cedgelord\u201d characters, too much focus on mental problems and obvious tropes like \u201cmain hero will lose, power up, and then return and defeat everyone, ten times total through the series\u201d. </",
