The app gently guides you to track your impulses, build better habits, and use simple mindfulness tools to stay grounded. It even has a to-do list and space for emergency contacts, so everything you need to stay balanced is in one place.</p> <p>I\u2019m really proud of how it turned out, not because it\u2019s perfect, but because it\u2019s something that came from a genuine place.

So around a 2 weeks to complete my MVP and then publish it live on Google PlayStore after 14 days of testing.</li> <li>Got Early Genuine Feedback: Right after publishing my app, I posted on this sub-reddit to promote it. Shout out to who provided very detailed feedback by email. Next day, another user emailed me with detailed feedback. So right off the bat, I got two kind users who gave me detailed feedback for improving the app. That helped shape my road map as continued adding more features and polishing the app.</li> <li>Early Positive Feedback: I got 8 five-star reviews for my app very quickly (within a month). That was motivating. I haven\u2019t been getting a lot of reviews since then though.</li> <li>Buil",

It&#39;s a strategy called &quot;bonus arbitrage.&quot; Companies often pay third-party platforms a high fee to bring them a new user and the bonus they pay out is much higher than the effort required from you. You&#39;re essentially just collecting on the difference in their marketing spend.</p> <p>I spent a long time identifying all the possible arbitrage opportunities out there, and currently you can complete a few tasks in a single day that pay out a total of $900.</p> <p>For proof this works, you can take a look at one particular arbitrage opportunity that is REALLY good... which is the Chime $390 Offer.</p> <p>Basically, you&#39;ll get paid out $390 literally just for opening a Chime account and redirecting a direct deposit from your employer ",

I realized I needed something <em>less serious</em> and more playful to keep me going.</p> <p>So over the past few weeks, I built a small Android app called <strong>Habit Dice</strong>. It has all sorts of habits (like \u201cread 10 pages,\u201d \u201cgo for a walk,\u201d \u201cclean my desk,\u201d etc.), and when you roll the dice, it randomly picks one for you to do next with points for each tasks you complete. It turns self-improvement into a little game of chance, which weirdly makes it more fun and less stressful.</p> <p>It\u2019s <strong>free</strong> (there are a few small ads to keep it running), and I\u2019d honestly love to hear what you think \u2014 whether the idea makes sense, if something feels off, or if you have ideas to make it more useful or motivating.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the link if you\u2019re curious:<br/> \ud83d\udc49 <a href=\"https://play.google.com/st",

I am building a project that detects emergency vehicles before you can even see them, the idea behind it is that people react horribly when an emergency vehicle suddenly &quot;drives up on them&quot; and they unintentionally block ambulances or any emergency vehicle because they have so little time to react. </p> <p>The idea is to give them a heads up before they get within 10m of them so they have ample time to react. I understand paying attention is a fix for this, sadly not everyone does that, its a tool to assist not to fix.</p> <p>I am currently in the testing stages and I have a working prototype and already a bunch of customers in line for when I start making them available! Couldn&#39;t be more excited about it.</p> <p>Disclaimer: Based in Europe and works in most EU countries with some requirements, and it is 100% legal as this question comes up a lot.

As a side hustle idea, I&#39;m pitching a quick-win Chrome extension project that&#39;s equal parts fun and impactful: an &quot;Audio Comic Narrator&quot; for web browsers.</p> <p>Project Breakdown: - How It Works: On comic sites, it scans images for text (using open-source Tesseract or free Gemini API tier), extracts panels/dialogue, and narrates via Web Speech API. Think audiobook for your favorite webtoons! - Polish Touches: Customizable settings popup for voice selection, pitch/speed sliders. Hotkeys for play/pause, and maybe auto-detection of comic strips. - Tech Stack: JS-based extension, no backend \u2013 keeps it lightweight and free to deploy.</p> <p>This could be a great portfolio piece or open-source repo. I&#39;m idea guy only \u2013 if you&#39;ve got extension dev chops (Manifest V3, content scripts), let&#39;s team up! Free for all, equity in the glory. DM for more deets or mockups.</p> <p",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey everyone, Legendz is a sweepstakes platform currently offering a deal where you get 200 SC for just $100. If you are new to sweepstakes sites, 1 SC equals $1, so you are essentially getting $200 for only $100.</p> <p>The condition is that you need to play through the 200 SC once before you can cash out. This means a 1x wagering requirement, so you must bet at least 200 SC before withdrawing.</p> <p>This is super simple to complete. Just find the game &quot;Plinko,&quot; set your bet to the minimum (0.10 SC), adjust the Risk setting to LOW with 16 rows, select 10 balls per play, and run it 200 times to meet the playthrough requirement while keeping roughly 90% or more of your bonus. Most users retain around 96%. In other words, you can withdraw about $195 directly to your bank after spending $100 (about $95 profit in under 10 minutes).</p> <p>\u27a1\ufe0f <strong>The sign up link to farm this promotion is here:</strong> <a href=\"https://tracker.gemified.io/r",

Set in the sprawling, neon-soaked metropolis of Crown City, the series follows Barnaby Dixon, a 24-year-old radio host turned reluctant hero groomed by the corporate superpower Vale Systems. In this world, heroism isn\u2019t about justice it\u2019s about profit, propaganda, and control. Every \u201cprotector\u201d is a trademarked property, every rescue a press event, every corpse a PR opportunity. Barnaby\u2019s mentor, Dr. Miriam Calden, runs Vale\u2019s private hero division with the precision of a surgeon and the ruthlessness of a prophet. Her heroes are engineered, trained, and owned public idols who are privately broken. For years, Barnaby has believed in her cause, convinced the chaos outside Vale\u2019s walls justifies her methods.
