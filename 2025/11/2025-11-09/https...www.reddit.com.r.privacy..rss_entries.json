Are there any tools that perhaps accepts one image as input, and provide couple of output images to the user to check, after tweaking some of the image properties.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Sweaty_Explorer_8441\"> /u/Sweaty_Explorer_8441 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1os8z9d/are_there_imaging_tools_that_automate_tuning_of/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1os8z9d/",
