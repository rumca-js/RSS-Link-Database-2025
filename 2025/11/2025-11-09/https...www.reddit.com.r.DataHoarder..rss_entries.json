Noise is my main concern since I like my room to stay quiet and I get distracted easily.</p> <p>I live in a area where the climate is pretty mild and dry, usually on the warmer side. The garage stays dry too, but for about four months a year it can get up to around 80\u201390\u00b0F (30\u201333\u00b0C) and a bit dusty. In the winter it drops to about 40\u201345\u00b0F (5\u20137\u00b0C), so not bad.</p> <p>The system will start with 5 x 18TB WD Ultrastar DC HC550 (SAS) drives in one vdev, and later I plan to expand to two vdevs (10 drives total). I\u2019ve also considered using consumer NAS drives to keep the noise down, though I\u2019m guessing they\u2019ll still be fairly loud.</p> <p>Electricity is expensive here, so I don\u2019t plan to run it 24/7. I\u2019ll probably power it on once or twice a week for backups and when working on large music or video projects.</p> <p>My main question is: if I keep the NAS in the garage instead",

Is it safe to simply unmount the old drive without it getting corrupted before I can connect it to my PC and transfer the data to the new drives when the raid is set up? Also, I&#39;ve seen that a UPS is recommended in case power is lost, if I don&#39;t have one of these, and my NAS turns off or needs to be moved to another location, what is the risk to my data?
