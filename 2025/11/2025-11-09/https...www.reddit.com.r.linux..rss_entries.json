I used it for school, browsing, and gaming. I used default gnome, and KDE too. It was good for what I needed back then. It was easy to install, and it worked. Solid. But looking back, it&#39;s good for beginners, but thats kind of it. It&#39;s based on debian, stable not rolling release, and for the stuff I do now (lots of compiling and development), that wouldn&#39;t work out well. Stable a lot of the time has mismatched versions of packages because they only update ever 6-12 months, its hit or miss with libraries too. I&#39;ve noticed that Ubuntu is starting to get a bit territorial. They have said they are against Flatpak on Ubuntu, which sounds like Microsoft or apple.</p> <hr/> <p><strong>M",
