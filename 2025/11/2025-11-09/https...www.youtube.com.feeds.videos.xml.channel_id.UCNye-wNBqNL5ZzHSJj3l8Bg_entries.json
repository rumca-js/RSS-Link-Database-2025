Since the ceasefire in October, at least 241 Palestinians have been killed. Residents say the area was not within the \u201cyellow line\u201d that Israeli forces cite to justify attacks. Khoudary says drones continue to hover as explosions hit residential areas, leaving Palestinians fearful that the conflict could resume at any moment.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\n Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\n Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\n Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\n Check out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljazeeraenglish/\n Download AJE Mobile App: https://aje.io/AJEMobile\n\n #GazaConflict #GazaStrike #KhanYounis #PalestineCrisis #IsraelPalestine #GazaResidents #PalestinianCasualties #CeasefireViolation #DroneStrikeGaza #AlJazeeraEnglish",

Media workers on the front lines, documenting every atrocity, have paid a high price though\u2014to ensure the truth endures. The UN says the Israeli military has killed at least 248 journalists in Gaza since October the 7th, 2023.  Israeli attacks have claimed the lives of 11 Al Jazeera journalists. So far, there has been no accountability for any of these deaths.  Mariam Abu Daqqa was killed in August when the Israeli military bombed Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. Her father says she should have been protected.
