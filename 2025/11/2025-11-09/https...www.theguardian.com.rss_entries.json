The England assistant coach, whose focus is fixed on helping Thomas Tuchel win the World Cup next summer \u2013 nothing less \u2013 was playing for Accrington Stanley in League Two. He was in the twilight of a career spent in the bottom two divisions of the Football League and in non-league, and he had taken the first step on the journey that would define him, accepting a voluntary position as the Accrington Under-16s coach.</p><p>\u201cIt was in the evenings, third of a pitch, asked to do 11 v 11 \u2026 flat balls, not enough bibs,\u201d Barry says with a smile. \u201cI was hooked. I\u2019d found what I was destined to do and I thought about what it could become. I\u2019m pretty sure nobody else could see it.
