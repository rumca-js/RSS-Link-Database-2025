Focusing on reducing fat, particularly around the abdomen and liver, significantly improves how the body handles blood sugar.  This approach helps restore insulin response and promotes better metabolic health for the long term.  Prioritizing fat reduction over just scale numbers leads to lasting health benefits.",
