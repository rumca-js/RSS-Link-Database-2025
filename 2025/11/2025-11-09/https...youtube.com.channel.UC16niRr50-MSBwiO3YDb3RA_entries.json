        "description": "Today, the BBC announced that Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is to unveil a major shake-up of the immigration and asylum system modelled on the Danish system, which is seen as one of the toughest in Europe. \n\nPolitical correspondent Iain Watson joins Laura and Adam in the studio to tell them about his trip to Denmark where he\u2019s been speaking to the people responsible for, and affected by, those reforms. \n\nAlso, Laura has interviewed the mother who is taking legal action against the company behind a chat bot which, she says, encouraged her 14 year old son to take his own life. We discuss some of the implications that AI could have for vulnerable people in the future, and how politicians might handle it.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
