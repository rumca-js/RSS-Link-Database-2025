I think that when I read that stuff it kind of makes me depressed, even though I absolutely love it and the older I get the more I don\u2019t want to feed more negative stuff to my brain if that makes sense</p> <p>Long story short I\u2019d really like to get into some sort of series that is for the girls. I don\u2019t know if I want it to be purely romance, but I do want a series that will hook me in fantasy land love story but a little dirty I\u2019m not sure. Please send me any recommendations. I just need something good that\u2019ll catch my attention and hold it not overly romantic.
