I&#39;m traveling soon and figure taking the Pi 5 along as a Plex client would save me from hooking my laptop.</li> <li>We will be in England. I see the Pi 5 power adapter covers 110-240 so I should just need a plug adapter. That said, any are there other issues I should watch out for going from North America to the UK with the Pi 5?</li> <li>Basically, If I could get a card set up with just Plex, that would be great. As an alternative, I could also get Kodi through Batocera and use the Plex add-on. At least, that&#39;s the one path I know.</li> </ul> <p>Any insight on this travel / Plex client stuff, please share :) Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/-Internet-Elder-\"> /u/-Internet-Elder- </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"http",

I used to have it set up before but my Pi software got corrupt somehow and the network port stopped responding so I have had to re image the software. Im using the 64 bit version of Raspberry Pi OS and I have installed Samba. 320gb WD Passport as the USB drive. Id just like to leave the contents of the drive as it is and just have it set up be mapped on one of the USB ports of the Pi, set to auto mount at boot and set it to spin down after a few minutes of inactivity to save too much wear and tear on it. I&#39;ve had a go at this myself but got in a whole lot of mess so ended up starting again with a fresh image. Im familiar with nano but im not sure exactly what to put in the conf file.

So I was wondering if it were possible to connect a raspberry pi 4 with the 4g HAT to a raspberry pi 3 with a waveshare 14300 5 inch touchscreen without having to connect them to an Ethernet cable. I&#39;ve googled it and found a video that uses Bluetooth to connect two pi&#39;s but I figured it would be good to get more ideas. I&#39;m also a super beginner at raspberry pi and coding so maybe I&#39;m just missing something </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Starnaya\"> /u/Starnaya </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1os5g0x/connecting_two_raspberry_pis_to_each_other/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspb",
