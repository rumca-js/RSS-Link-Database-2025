In this one a company called North Power-Air is in very deep trouble. The aircraft that they have are constantly crashing at a wildly growing rate, and yet none of them can seem to find an answer as to why. Wanting answers desperately they seek the help of a crippled genius named Waldo, who lives in his zero-g home in an orbit around Earth. But Waldo himself has very little to help humanity, until he discovers a solution to the planet&#39;s problem also holds the key to his own.</p> <p>Now the second titled &quot;Magic, Inc.&quot; leans heavily into fantasy. The tale revolves around the titular Magic Inc. that is squeezing out independent magicians. But there is one man that i",

The ending is quite different from Mary Shelley\u2019s original novel but honestly that\u2019s not the point of this post. I remember reading somewhere that many readers consider Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein 1818 the first true science fiction novel. I personally don\u2019t fully agree with that claim. For me there were already several works written before Shelley\u2019s time that could be classified as sci-fi as well. Like Kepler&#39;s Somnium in 1634 or Francis Bacon&#39;s The New Atlantis in 1627.</p> <p>Do you consider Frankenstein the first science fiction novel or do you think earlier writers already paved the way for Shelley\u2019s creation?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Delicious_Maize9656\"> /u/Delicious_Maize9656 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1os81nz/why_do_",
