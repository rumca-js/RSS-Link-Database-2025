I intend on keeping my blurbs short and encourage you to check out in-depth reviews if the game sounds interesting. I am also interested in hearing what games you would recommend.</p> <h1>Aeruta</h1> <p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286780/Aeruta/\">PC</a></p> <p>There has been a trend of games where you fight for ingredients and run a shop. The sprites got me into this one and I ended up sticking with it due to the charming cast and polished combat. The game is lighter on the management side of things than others and I like not having a million chores to do. It is more dialogue-heavy than most of its competition, but the text boxes go by fast.</p> <h1>Vivid Knight</h1> <p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.co",
