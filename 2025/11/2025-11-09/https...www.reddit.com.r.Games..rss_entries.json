Over here at Evil Villain Games for a little over 2 years we have been working on a Roguelike where after every run if you escape you can build a custom build to start your next run out of some of the power ups from your previous run. If you die however you loose everything you brought in.</p> <p>In order to beat the game ultimately you still need to beat all 4 bosses in one run however much like Enter The Gungeon there are some large difficult sub tasks leading up to that final run that teach you to master the game along the way. So the game becomes about equipping the right things for your next sub task and building up your stash for one final run where you bring all the right things to win.</p> <p>I want to stress however this is really not about grinding the way other extraction games are.

One day I thought: what if a whole team of rats decided to open a restaurant\u2026 but not in Paris, and instead in a dark basement full of monsters and chaos?</p> <p>Together with your rat crew, you cook meals, put out kitchen fires, argue about who burned the soup, throw food at vampires, and enjoy the delightful madness that unfolds. Rats were the perfect choice - they\u2019re survivors: small, stubborn, smart, and resourceful. In a way, they\u2019re a lot like indie developers - always finding a way out of any mess.</p> <p>Restaurats is all about teamwork, humor, and pure culinary chaos. If you enjoy fast-paced co-op games with a fantasy twist and a sense of humor, give it a try - I think you\u2019ll have fun.</p> <p>By the way, the game is currently ava",
