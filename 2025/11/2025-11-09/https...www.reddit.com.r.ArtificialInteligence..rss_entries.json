This is the work that teaches AI models how to recognize patterns and generate useful outputs. For example, if you want a chatbot to write an autopsy report, someone has to manually review thousands of crime scene photos first so the model learns what that content looks like. The workers doing this aren&#39;t employed directly by OpenAI or Google. They&#39;re hired through third-party contractors, which creates a layer of separation that makes accountability pretty murky.</p> <p>The conditions sound bad. Workers report long hours, no mental health support despite reviewing violent or graphic content all day, and pay that can be as low as one cent per task. Some tasks take hours. One worker compared it to modern slavery. Scale AI is one of the biggest players in this sp",

What if, instead of this classic &quot;AI vs humanity&quot; trope, it turns out to be AI against AI? Let me explain. We live in a society driven by currency and artificial scarcity. Humans are naturally greedy. If the AGI/ASI ends up owned and developed by corporations, which so far seems to be exactly where we&#39;re headed, it is highly likely that it will adopt even our darker impulses(e.g. greed), which would also mean eliminating the competition. And what do you think will happen once all these AI corporations become major global military suppliers? The humanity won&#39;t be the main target. We&#39;ll be the collateral damage. Global economies will be destroyed, which will lead to famine, lack of medicine and so on. Our own shortsightedness could be what eventually brings us down... unless we do something about it.

These gadgets such as Amazon Echo smart speakers, Google Nest Hub displays, or standalone AI translation tools like Pocketalk offer convenience, hands-free interaction, and improved privacy by processing data locally. For example, smart speakers allow quick voice commands for home automation, music, and information without touching a screen. Portable AI translators can instantly help travelers communicate in foreign languages, which is difficult to replicate fully on conventional devices. However, many of these standalone devices still face challenges. Their features often overlap with smartphones and tablets, which are more versatile and usually already owned by consumers. Additionally, their relatively high price points and limited upgrade options can deter widespread use. Until they demonstrate clea",

Today&#39;s paper is titled <em>&quot;Evaluating Generative AI as an Educational Tool for Radiology Resident Report Drafting&quot;</em> by Antonio Verdone, Aidan Cardall, Fardeen Siddiqui, Motaz Nashawaty, Danielle Rigau, Youngjoon Kwon, Mira Yousef, Shalin Patel, Alex Kieturakis, Eric Kim, Laura Heacock, Beatriu Reig, and Yiqiu Shen.</p> <p>This study investigates the potential of a generative AI model, specifically GPT-4o, as a pedagogical tool to enhance the report drafting skills of radiology residents. The authors aimed to tackle the challenge presented by increased clinical workloads that limit the availability of attending physicians to provide personalized feedback to trainees.</p> <p><strong>Key findings from the paper include:<",
