I\u2019ve been managing SEO for the past 2 years. There are 400+ pages, including 250+ blog posts and the rest are service pages.</p> <p>I\u2019ve done consistent work across all areas:</p> <p>On-page SEO Off-page SEO Technical Improvements</p> <p>Still, the traffic graph is flat and steady, no real growth.</p> <p>What\u2019s even more confusing is this pattern: Whenever I publish new blogs, the new pages get traffic but my older blog pages lose traffic. it\u2019s like traffic keeps shifting between posts instead of actually growing.</p> <p>I want to focus on increasing overall website traffic.</p> <p>What should I focus on next to break this?</p> <p>Has anyone experienced this kind of \u201ctraffic shifting\u201d issue?</p> <p>One thing to say you we do not have content cannibalization",
