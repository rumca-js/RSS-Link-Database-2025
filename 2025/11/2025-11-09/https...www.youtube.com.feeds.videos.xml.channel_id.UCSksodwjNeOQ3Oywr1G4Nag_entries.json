        "description": "I really wasn\u2019t sure if it would be possible to shrink the mechanism for labyrinth down to fit on a Mod NX phone case from @rhinoshield  I decided to try a cam driven mechanism first because I thought it would be easier to make tiny. It was a fail. The cam system didn\u2019t account for the 2 degrees of freedom required for the 2 tilt directions.  The original game uses rope and elastics, but it felt impossible to shrink to such a small area so I opted for a ball-joint mechanism instead. After printing many tiny ball joints to find the perfect fit, I finally got the mechanism working and after attaching it to the backplate of the Mod NX case I now had a fully functional Labyrinth game on the back of my phone!\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\nHere\u2019s a bit more info about the case:\nCustomizable Buttons:\u00a0you can swap the buttons out with any color you would like!\nShockSprea Impact Protection: Built with RHINOSHIELD\u2019s high-tech ShockSpread material, the Mod NX case absorbs impacts from drops up to 11 feet / 3.5 meters, ex",
