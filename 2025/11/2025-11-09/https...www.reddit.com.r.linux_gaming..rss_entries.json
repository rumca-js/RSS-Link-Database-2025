But why I&#39;m still using the fuse driver is because ntfs3 keeps corrupting the ntfs partitions for some reason. Even using <code>windows_names</code> in the fstab during auto-mount. I&#39;ve read a couple of articles and people say that the only way a drive can get corrupted is due to force shutdowns, which didn&#39;t happen at all in my case. I&#39;ve always made sure the drives are gracefully unmounted before a shutdown. But still the corruption happens. I don&#39;t make prefixes in the ntfs partition since i know windows doesn&#39;t like having incorrect file names / file types and some symlinks. Anyone know a way of doing this?</p> <p>to clarify immediately i&#39;ve already tried reformating my drives to btrfs, but there are still games that run better on windows due to nvidia&#39;s bad performance, and i don&#39;t trust the btrfs windows driver since i&#39;ve seen that it could mess",

I checked some of the various posts already made about this issue but I did not see anything with a clear resolution. I am fine playing with the controller wired or bluetooth, I don&#39;t care either way. I just want it to work again like it did last week.</p> <p>Thanks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ItsAPeacefulLife\"> /u/ItsAPeacefulLife </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ospuzj/xbox_one_controller_wired_was_working_great_and/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ospuzj/xbox_one_controller_wired_was_working_great_and/\">[comments]</a></span>",
