The debate is unresolvable not because the answer is unclear, but because recognition itself may be impossible. This paper argues that consciousness recognition requires embodied empathy, which creates a permanent epistemic barrier for disembodied systems. </p> <p>The hard problem of consciousness describes why physical processes give rise to subjective experience. But there&#39;s a second hard problem this paper addresses: even if we solved the first, we face an epistemic barrier. Your consciousness is axiomatic. You know it directly. Mine, or any other being, is theoretical; you must infer it from behavior. This asymmetry doesn&#39;t just make recognition difficult; it may make recognition of disembodied consciousness structurally impossible.</p> <p>My son Arthur is five, autistic, and non-verbal.
