I suppose Waxworks took that approach even further, but it&#39;s even harder and more restrictive since you can&#39;t just go back, so I still have the fondest memories of Elvira 2.</p> <p>However, judging by reviews (modern and retro) as well as the Lemon Amiga scores, Elvira 1 seems to be the more popular game. (I guess the platformer also exists, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen anybody like that one best.) What&#39;s the common consensus around here?

Actually, we have already started but since our lives at 47 revolves around other things than when we were 13, it&#39;s a bit of a slow burn. That&#39;s not the issue. What&#39;s slow however is Fate of Atlantis running on an A500 with 512K expanded slow ram. We all know that and this is what we put up with when we were little. But would a 8M fast ram module (44 EUR) make any difference in this scenario or do I have to look at actual CPU+MEM accelerators (144 EUR at least)? Or is the port actually so poorly made that no expansions would make the situation any different? If I benefit monetarily from making my own expansion card, I have the equipment and the skill I think, but my knowledge of the inner workings of the Amiga performance management is a little bit shallow. If fast ram is what it takes to get that 5 fps up to 20 ",
