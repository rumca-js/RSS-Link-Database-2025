They are limiting the internet to 140 GB quota a month for around 6$ . But I&#39;m paying for the 600 GB a month for around 24$ which is a lot considering the currency and average salaries. I didn&#39;t even mention the speed which barely crosses 10 mb/s if I&#39;m lucky. Is there a way of bypassing at least the quota so that i can use more than 600 GB? I have a ps4 and i bought ps plus extra but I can&#39;t even download anything because the average game is like 50-80 GB which is insane because i would need to renew my internet 2-3 times a month just to use it normally and even then the game would take like a whole day because of the speed. I heard about configs but have no idea how that works so can someone please help me bypass that 600 GB?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Consci",
