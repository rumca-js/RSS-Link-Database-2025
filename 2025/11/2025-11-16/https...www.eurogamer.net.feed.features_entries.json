I pretty much have to. To listen to music and to block out as much of the outside world as possible. I'm quite fortunate in the job that I do that allows me to basically take a different pair of headphones or earbuds every time I go, and I think I've found the pair that'll be sticking with me in the meantime.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/after-18-hours-flying-economy-with-sonys-wh-1000xm6-i-may-just-have-a-new-favourite-pair-of-anc-headphones\">Read more</a></p>",

The trouble is, my one overriding memory of Skies of Arcadia is so powerful I can barely remember anything else about the game at all. I can't, for instance, recall where I was when I played it, or even <em>when</em>; and I'm certainly not going to be able to tell you what it was about in anything but the broadest strokes without a trip to Wikipedia. What I do know, though, is Sega's beloved RPG - set in a vibrant world of swashbuckling skybound pirates - was brilliant. And I can say this with absolute certainty.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-my-one-skies-of-arcadia-anecdote-to-celebrate-the-brilliant-pirate-rpgs-25th-anniversary\">Read more</a></p>",

        "description": "<img src=\"https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/civ-7-header.jpg?width=690&quality=85&format=jpg&auto=webp\" /> <p>It's fair to say that upon its initial release, <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization\">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 rather split opinion. I don't think anybody would argue that it was the best-ever Civ game out of the gate. Nobody sane would, anyway. But for a breadth of opinion you only need look at <a href=\"https://www.vg247.com/civilization-7-review\">my review on VG247</a> when compared to the verdict <a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review\">here on Eurogamer</a>. On release, those two opinions were two stars and worlds apart. One considered the game to have a fundamental problem, being too boring. The other considered the base release a creaky but firm-enough foundation for a new generation of Civ.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/im-loving-a-pirates-life-in-civilization-7-which-keeps-getting-better-as-firaxis-diligent-updat",
