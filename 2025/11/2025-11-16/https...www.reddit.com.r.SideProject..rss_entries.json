You look for offers from banks or apps that grant bonus rewards that exceed any effort or initial costs required to meet the requirements. Companies sometimes overpay for customer acquisition, and you&#39;re essentially exploiting this to your advantage. </p> <p>For example, SoFi Plus will pay you $30 to subscribe to their service, which only costs $10 for the month. You subscribe, get paid the $30 bonus through an offer platform, then profit +$20 in less than 2 minutes. That&#39;s how arbitrage works. Competition drives these offers higher as companies outbid each other for signups, creating more opportunities. </p> <p>This probably won&#39;t make you rich but it&#39;s an easy extra couple hundred each month, which has been helping me cover expenses.

There&#39;s a hint system if you get stuck and it shows which operations might help. Has easy/medium/hard modes.</p> <p>Made it because my nephew needed something more engaging than worksheets but I figured others might find it useful too. It&#39;s free and no ads or anything right now. </p> <p>Would love feedback if anyone tries it. Still working on making it more kid-friendly design-wise.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ordinary_shazzamm\"> /u/ordinary_shazzamm </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1oyqhya/made_a_simple_math_game_to_help_my_nephew/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1o",

Thought I\u2019d share it here and get some feedback.</p> <p>What it does</p> <p>Pushray is a file-sharing tool with end-to-end encryption and a different bandwidth model: \u2022 Files are encrypted client-side (server never sees the content) \u2022 Each file comes with free bandwidth \u2022 When the free quota is used up, downloads become pay-per-use \u2022 Uploaders earn a share of the revenue from those paid downloads \u2022 No ads, no speed limits, and no forced accounts</p> <p>Why I built this</p> <p>I\u2019ve always felt that file-sharing services either lock you in, slow you down, or monetize with ads. I wanted something more straightforward:</p> <p>secure sharing + fair bandwidth costs + optional income for uploaders.</p> <p>Status</p> <p>Still in private test, polishing features and tuning the bandwidth logic. I\u2019d really love feedback from anyone who shares files frequent",

I spend a few minutes every day collecting free daily bonuses from sweepstakes sites. It&#39;s a popular and legitimate side hustle right now. </p> <p>Basically, you just log in and claim about $1 from each site. It only takes me about 5 minutes to run through my list, and it builds up to around $600 a month. There&#39;s no catch... it&#39;s just how these sites are legally required to operate (they need to give out &quot;free entry&quot;). </p> <p>A lot of people are skeptical at first, but it&#39;s completely transparent and it works. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions about it! </p> <p><strong>\u27a1\ufe0f For the full list of sites and my free guide on how to start, you can find the link here</strong> <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/lionpenguin\"><strong>https://linktr.ee/lionpenguin</strong></a> <strong>:)</strong> </p> <p>The guide is",
