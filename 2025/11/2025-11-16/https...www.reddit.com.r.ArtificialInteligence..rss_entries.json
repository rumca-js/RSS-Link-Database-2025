Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables more realistic agent behaviour and reduces the number of free parameters, but the heavy computational cost has so far limited research efforts. To address this, we introduce JaxMARL-HFT (JAX-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading), the first GPU-accelerated open-source multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for high-frequency trading (HFT) on market-by-order (MBO) data. Extending the JaxMARL framework and building on the JAX-LOB implementation, JaxMARL-HFT is designed to handle a heterogeneous set of agents, enabling diverse observation/action spaces and reward functions.",

It is real, and it is reproducible. I went through the entire process five months ago during a period of AI induced psychosis.

Earlier work suggested that shared architectural constraints were a major factor, but the success of widely varied architectures after pretraining raises critical questions about the importance of architectural constraints. Here we show that in wide networks with minimal training, architectural inductive biases have a prominent role. We examined networks with varied architectures but no pretraining and quantified their ability to predict image representations in the visual cortices of monkeys and humans. We found that cortex-aligned representations emerge in convolutional archit",
