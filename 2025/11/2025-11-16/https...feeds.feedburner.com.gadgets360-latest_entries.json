        "description": "Xiaomi is making a leap from the 15 to the 17 series in an effort to challenge Apple. We got our hands on the Xiaomi 17 and 17 Pro for a limited period ahead of the early 2026 India release. The Xiaomi 17 will be the latest addition from the company to the compact flagship range, joining the likes of the Vivo X200 FE and OnePlus 13s. The Xiaomi 17 Pro, on the other hand, comes as a direct rival to the iPhone 17 Pro and Google Pixel 10 Pro. Both phones are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC and have strong performance credentials. In our limited time with the handsets, we found them to be solid premium smartphones.",
