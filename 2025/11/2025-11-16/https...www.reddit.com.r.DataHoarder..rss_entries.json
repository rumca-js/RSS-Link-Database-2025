I recently got a Mac Mini M4 and I want to have external storage attached to it so that I can have access to a very very large offline library of tv shows and movies ranging from 1080p-4K HDR remuxes. </p> <p>I&#39;m struggling to decide the best way to expand this set-up. I was originally going to get a 4 bay Terramaster DAS and fill it with 18+ WD Red Pro drives. Only when I started doing more research on this, I saw that people online said that the WD Red Pro drives are incredibly loud. </p> <p>This wouldn&#39;t be an issue, but I live with family and in a small/medium sized bedroom. Now I only plan to have the DAS running when I&#39;m adding media to it, or when I&#39;m watching movies or shows. It will be off when I am asleep, so noise is not a concern for when I&#39;m sleeping, but I don&#39;t want to hear distractingly loud grinding noises when I&#39;m watching movies or shows. </p> <p>Righ",

They are mainly demos of local indie/hardcore/emo bands (Philadelphia area) from probably the late 90s - early 00s. There are also some bootleg live recordings of some popular bands like Modest Mouse and The Sea and Cake from local clubs. Today I picked up a tape deck from a thrift store and want to start digitizing some of this stuff. I probably don&#39;t have the best equipment (Technics Tape Deck, Behringer USB mixer, Audacity) but I was able to record some decent (as far as I can tell) audio. </p> <p>Mainly I was wondering what kind of general advice you have for cataloguing and distributing. I have never taken on a project like this and need some kind of workflow. </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/hungry-freaks-daddy\"> /u/hungry-freaks-daddy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",

The 3TB has 40k hours power-on time, so not sure how much longer it will last but so far I haven&#39;t had any issues with it. I am looking to keep my spending to a minimal right now, but I wanted opinions on two options I am considering:</p> <p>1) Buy a used 3TB drive, so I can get 3TB of usable capacity for the cheapest cost.</p> <p>2) Buy a new IronWolf NAS drive (4TB for $85 or 6TB for $110). This gives me a new drive with warranty, and includes the 3-year data recovery service too. I know I can only use 3TB of the storage with SHR-1, but it gives me one new drive and later I can buy another matching to increase storage.</p> <p>Right now I don&#39;t have any crazy storage requirements, so 3TB would actually be fine for a while.
