No worries, there a module for that. Wanna spin up a VSFTP server? There\u2019s a module for that. Wanna configure global proxy settings? You bet your sweet ass there\u2019s module for that. Now I feel like they took away everything that felt unique about SUSE Linux. Wicked\u2018s gone, YaST is gone, now we have Agama I guess. At least SELinux being included by default is pretty nice.
