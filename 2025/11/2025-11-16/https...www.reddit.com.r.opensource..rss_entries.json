I\u2019ve been working on a project called <strong>EHTML</strong>, an HTML-first approach to building dynamic pages using mostly HTML. It lets you handle things like templating, loops, conditions, data loading, reusable components, and nested forms \u2014 all without a build step or heavy JavaScript setup.</p> <p>I originally built it to simplify my own workflow for small apps and prototypes, but I figured others who prefer lightweight or no-build approaches might find it useful too. It runs entirely in the browser using native ES modules and custom elements, so there\u2019s no bundler or complex tooling involved.</p> <p>If you enjoy working close to the browser or like experimenting with minimalistic web development, you might find it interesting. Just sharing in case it helps someone or sparks ideas.

Everyone seems to be using their own JSON/CSV formats. You can usually read another person\u2019s backtest output, but you can\u2019t reliably verify it.</p> <p>I\u2019m thinking about a no-trust protocol: a specification defining how backtests should be logged, hashed, documented, and reproduced.
