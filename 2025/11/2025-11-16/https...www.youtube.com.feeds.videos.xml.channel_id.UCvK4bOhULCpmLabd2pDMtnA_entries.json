The American islands nobody has ever heard of, yet with some of the most interesting history and culture we've ever found within the US. So much to explore here, so many stories to tell. We travel there while having absolutely no idea where this adventure would take us, and boy were we in for surprises. This story and this series is one of the more ambitious and unique ones we've ever captured, so we truly hope that they click with you as much as we enjoyed making them. If you're here reading this btw, hi this is Thomas.. what was your favorite part of the video? Let me know you read this in the comments.. Probably not many will have seen this little me",
