I use Jellyfin to stream the movies on my TV using a Roku stick(my TV isn\u2019t that smart). However, I\u2019ve noticed that Jellyfin isn\u2019t that great for streaming songs on the TV. Is there an app that makes streaming music from my server a little easier? </p> <p>I don\u2019t see that Jellyfin gives me access to the playlists I had created previously through my computer using the Jellyfin media player. Also, looking up songs is almost non-existent through the TV.

If all the data now is stored on your own computer as simple static files, with no database or server running, does that count as &quot;self-hosting&quot;?</p> <p>For example, Postman stores your API requests, configs, and scripts on their servers, so that&#39;s not self-hosted.
