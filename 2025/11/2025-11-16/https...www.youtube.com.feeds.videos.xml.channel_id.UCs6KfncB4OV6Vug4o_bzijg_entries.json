        "description": "In four days, the EU Commission releases the Digital Omnibus, a proposal to \"simplify\" GDPR that would actually weaken privacy protections on many front: narrowing personal data definitions, giving AI companies blanket access to sensitive data, eliminating employee and journalist protections, and enabling remote device access without consent.
