That's how a Palestinian man described his transfer from Gaza, through Israel and Kenya, to South Africa. \nA journey so desperate that Palestinians paid thousands of dollars to leave their homes without knowing where they were going.\nA journey forced by more than two years of Israel's genocide. \nIn February, Israel and the US proposed forcibly removing Palestinians from Gaza. \nBut Arab states rejected calls to take them in and rights groups labelled it ethnic cleansing. \nSo, do these flights set a precedent for forced transfers \u2014 and signal a push towards the mass expulsion of Palestinians?\n\nPresenter: Nick Clark\n\nGuests: \n\nImtiaz Sooliman -- Founder and Chairman of Gift of the Givers, a South African charity\n\nOri Goldberg -- Israeli political commentator\n\nWilliam Schabas -- Professor of International Law at Middlesex University\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.",

Skateboarding has become an escape, helping children channel fear and trauma into movement. \nWith parks destroyed and equipment scarce, every board and wheel is treasured, and a surviving courtyard now serves as a training space. \nCoaches work with limited resources to give children a sense of freedom the war has tried to take. Despite injuries and danger, their determination persists. \nEven the youngest skaters continue to practise, finding comfort and resilience on their boards. \nFor brief moments, skateboarding restores fragments of the childhood they have lost.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Ibrahim Al-Khalili reports from Gaza City, Palestine.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish\nFind us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\nCheck our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/\nCheck out our Instagram page: https://www.instagram.com/aljaze",
