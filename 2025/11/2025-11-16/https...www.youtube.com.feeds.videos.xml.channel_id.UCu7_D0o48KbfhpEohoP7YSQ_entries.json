        "description": "My problem started when I bought this car. As an electronics engineer, I didn\u2019t want to leave this planet without owning an electric vehicle. With its 650 horsepower, it\u2019s a thrill to drive \u2014 and with 3.8 seconds from 0 to 100 km/h, or 60 mph, it reminds me of my sporty motorcycle. The car is a Smart #5, BTW. I used OCPP 1.6J and EVCC to solve the problem\n\nMy second channel: https://www.youtube.com/HB9BLAWireless\n\nLinks:\nOCPP: https://openchargealliance.org/protocols/open-charge-point-protocol/\nSmart #5: https://uk.smart.com/en/models/hashtag-five/\nOCPP Tester: https://github.com/SensorsIot/OCPP-Tester\nESP32 Mini used for Modbus proxy and EV simulator: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3IK8EPn\nInsulated RS485 (Modbus) interfaces: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c3iegVA1\n\nPatreon supporter companies:\nhttps://www.welectron.com/\n\nThe links above are usually affiliate links that support the channel (at no additional cost to you).\nSupporting Material and Blog Page: http://www.sensorsiot",
