A single breach didn\u2019t just stall a few assembly lines. It froze an entire ecosystem built around precision timing, global suppliers, and razor thin margins. The ripple effects were staggering. From a near half-billion pound quarterly loss to small suppliers on the brink, the damage spread far beyond the company itself.</p> <p>What\u2019s most striking is how fragile the system proved to be. For years, the auto industry has talked a lot about digital transformation, but many players still treat cybersecurity as an IT problem instead of a core operational risk. If production can collapse for more than a month because networks go dark, the problem is deeper than one successful attack.
