Things disappear, the characters have essentially the same conversation about emptiness or \u201cfilling the cavities of the heart,\u201d R insisting that they will remember, the protagonist worries about everything disappearing and the old man saying it will be alright...

Jerome\u2019s humour is light, conversational and wonderfully self-deprecating, turning everyday mishaps into small comedic epics.
