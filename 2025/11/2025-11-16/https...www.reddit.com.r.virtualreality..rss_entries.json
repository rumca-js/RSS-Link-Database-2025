Everything Valve has shown off with regards to the wireless connectivity seems extremely promising.

It&#39;s not a huge deal, I still absolutely love my Deck, but if the Frame is going to follow a similar pattern, I feel like it might be smarter to hold off for a bit. </p> <p>It&#39;s a bit of an awkward situation, because I&#39;m very sold on the prospect of a VR headset with the openness and tinkering capabilities permitted by SteamOS and Valve&#39;s general commitment to engaging with the community. If the hardware seemed a little bit more future proof, it&#39;d be a day one buy for me. Obviously, &quot;future proof&quot; and VR don&#39;t really mix well, given how (relatively) dynamic the indu",

Now I got a job and have decent economical status, got a much better PC and a decent budget for a new headset, so I decided to ask about VR machine choices, both for my future headset choice, and also just out of curiosity.</p> <p>For a player like me who still had a BUDGET for my headset, I heard that Quest 3 would be a good choice for both PCVR and standalone VR. So here my question goes, does Quest 3 tracking performs ok when my hand/controller is behind my back? Or more specifically, is Quest 3 able to track upper body well enough so that I do not need to worry about it when I upgrade to a full body tracking solution(obviously for PCVR-VRChat)? If not so, which mainstream VR machines out there are suitable and cost-effective for my request i.e. good for PC",

I would lean towards oled as that is supposed to be better for low hz? If it does indeed feel like 90hz im more than happy to go down to 72 as i can generally drive that with my 5900X and 3090.</p> <p>I play 70% racing sims and 30% DCS world. I also have a motion sim and when i did have a HMD that supported 120hz that felt so good. For racing sims i find myself CPU limited more than GPU and its more of a tie on DCS world but im GPU limited without DLSS. Cant afford GPU though.</p> <p>I have put in a order for a 9800X3d with ram as ram prices are skyrocketing... But i may cancel it if a HMD is a better choice.</p> <p>Main question i guess.
