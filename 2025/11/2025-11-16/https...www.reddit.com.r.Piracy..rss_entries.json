While doing this I noticed two things; the first was that the website started to randomly not load/said I had no internet with my VPN on (which has never happened before), and the second is that after I got it to work and got my file, Qbit force stopped the downloading process as soon as it was applied.</p> <p>Like I mentioned I am a bit paranoid and was wondering if this is just something that happens sometimes or if I have something to worry about.

The email and stuff are no longer accessible by any means but somehow I can still use the ide without a problem because it&#39;s already logged in. So I want to switch to linux but don&#39;t want to lose my access to my &quot;free&quot; account iykwim, Is there a way to copy the login state from windows to linux ?
