        "description": "Kerbal Space Program helped a whole generation of smart kids become rocket scientists, sometimes for real. However the development of the game has since stopped, and the sequel was never completed. \n\nAnd so an independent group of developers have decided to create a spiritual successor in the form of Kitten Space Agency. One of the most important problems they tackled was the game engine. KSP was built on a game engine which could truly model the scales needed for spaceflight with the precision required. KSA developers are creating Brutal, a game engine that can do this and also support the development by the team, and third party modders. They just publicly released a tech demo showing many of the features.\n\n\nYou Can Download the tech demo and donate to the project here:\nhttps://ahwoo.com/store/KPbAA1Au/kitten-space-agency\n\nFollow me on Twitter for more updates:\nhttps://twitter.com/DJSnM\n\nI have a discord server where I regularly turn up:\nhttps://discord.gg/zStmKbM\n\nIf you really lik",
