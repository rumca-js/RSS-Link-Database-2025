In many situations, this can lead to code that is easier to write and understand and less error-prone. However, it requires a shift to a more functional mindset. This talk gives an introduction to functional programming in C++ using the modern standard library. We will cover algorithms using std::ranges, composable error handling with std::optional and std::expected, algebraic data types, and separating IO from computation. In the end, we'll even cover the M-word.\n\nSlides: https://accu.org/conf-previous/accu2025/\n\nJoin think-cell as a C++ Developer and work on cutting-edge challenges with a focus on code excellence, innovation, and working alongside an international team of experts \u2014 apply now to be part of a team shaping the future of business presentations. h",
