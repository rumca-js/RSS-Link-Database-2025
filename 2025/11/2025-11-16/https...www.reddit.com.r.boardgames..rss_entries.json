Are there any other special editions of popular games that you can only get in Korea, like Splendor Pokemon? They don&#39;t have to be in English.

Just going around asking people until one let you in? I have tried that both times with no success: the first time I asked a staff to ask around if any group was willing to let me in and after a while he said every group was in the middle of a long game or wanted to play with friends only, so after half an hour of waiting I left. The second time I asked around directly and one group said they would let me in after 1 game, but that game finished in 1.5 hours later while I solo&#39;ed another game in the mean time, then they apologized then left due to getting late. What should I do to increase my chances besides toughing it out and try again and again?</p> <p>I have also tried other methods like joining FB and Discord groups to look but got no success either.

This sometimes happens in for example 7 wonder duels, though the bigger problem with the game is the zero-sum aspect. </p> <p>Our tastes differ too.

You place your character(s) on the word start and if you roll a one, you\u2019re immediately in a portal since you moved from start to the portal. That player just travels amongst portals the rest of the game? If the person in that portal rolls a 3 the next time, they just move three times within the portals or they have to go three spaces on the regular board too? I also guess if you land on the portal symbol on the die, you can choose any color portal you want/need. </p></li> <li><p>Once you have all of your colors, you traverse the board using your rolls and get to the exit. You don\u2019t need the exact number to get into the arch. </p></li> </ol> <p>Sor",
