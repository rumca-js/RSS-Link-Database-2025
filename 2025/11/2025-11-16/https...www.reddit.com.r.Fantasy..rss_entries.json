I\u2019ve seen a few comments on this that haven\u2019t been overwhelmingly positive but I\u2019m curious about whether anyone else loved this like I did. </p> <p>First off I will acknowledge it left something to be desired in the development of the relationship between the main characters, which seemed a little neglected - but I was still blown away by the creative portrayal of the Fey and the world and some of the other supporting characters. So much better in this respect than so many other fantasy/Romantasy I\u2019ve read recently! </p> <p>Also considering this was her debut novel I\u2019m inspired to read her other works next!

Also the few original He-man episodes I have watched on youtube gave me the same vibes. The concept of dying earth where some tech exists or used to exist but magic is very much the dominant force, is also super fascinating.</p> <p>The Dark Tower books kinda fit this, specially the The Wind Through the Keyhole but too serious for this genre otherwise. I was surprised to find that the last book of Dogs of War series by Adrian Tchaikovsky kinda felt like it fits",

I&#39;m currently on Book 7. The story genuinely intrigue me, and I desperately want to know how it ends, but unfortunately, I can&#39;t stand the main characters and their relationships. Even when they supposedly love and like each other, they are perpetually hostile, arrogant, and mean-spirited toward one another. The romances and love stories are so unconvincing that they make me want to scream. The entire Aiel nation frustrates me so much that I&#39;m shaking. Practically all the characters are such hypocrites that I feel like just quitting. The only character I actually like is Mat. Please tell me, does it get better? Or would it make more sense to skip to the final volume just to find out the ending or i just should quit. </p> <p>Sorry if my post sounds a bit awkward, English isn&#39;t my native language.</p> </div><!",
