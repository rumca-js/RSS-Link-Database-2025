The version I downloaded is from F-Droid, called Forkgram, because I needed it for downloading. When I opened it, it asked me to sign up for a Telegram fee and requested my credit card information including my CVV, credit card number, expiry date, name, state, postal code, etc. I was like what the hell. I thought Telegram was supposed to be private and here it is asking me for all this stuff.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to know if this has happened to any of you. Did you go through with it or is this most likely a scam? Did I download a fake Telegram app? This one is from Forkgram, by the way, not the official Telegram app. I downloaded it from F-Droid and I have a feeling I downloaded the wrong thing or the developers of this fork might be doing phishing.
