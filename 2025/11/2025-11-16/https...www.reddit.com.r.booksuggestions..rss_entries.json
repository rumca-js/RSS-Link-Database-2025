I love good biographies of interesting life\u2019s especially adventurers, travellers of all kind of sorts. I love a good thriller and mysterious book. Not so much into fantasy and science fiction. </p> <p>Please give me some of your favorites and I\u2019ll make another attempt to download a few books and read them step by step! </p> <p>Thank you!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Roof5912\"> /u/Successful-Roof5912 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1oyw482/help_me_get_out_my_reading_void/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.co",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey! So I&#39;m almost entirely new in this genre, I just recently started reading Rina Kent&#39;s books, and I can&#39;t get enough of the drama. I love how I get to explore entire friend groups, and how my favorite characters reappear over and over, so I was looking for recommendations like that. It&#39;s not necessarily dark romance that I&#39;m looking for, the next series on my TBR is the Bridgerton series, I like my books in a broad spectrum. If it&#39;s possible, I&#39;d like series recommendations, where we have at least one or two lgbtq books, like in the Legcacy of God series, though that&#39;s not a deal breaker if there isn&#39;t. Thank you for everyone, who will be kind enough to answer! <sup>^</sup></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Lilian1326\"> /u/Lilian1326 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1oypt2i/interconnected_standalone_romance_series/\">[",

A book that\u2019s fun for the most part, but has those sudden lines that make you think a little deeper.

I&#39;m over halfway through We Hunt The Flame and I&#39;ve been struggling to really feel any of the storybeats, not because the writing is bad but I genuinely haven&#39;t been able to find a long-term piece of media that makes me &quot;feel&quot; anything in a long time, and I&#39;m worried The Geographer&#39;s Map, while having a more interesting dynamic might not get through to me either. It really sucks because I really want to get back into reading again. So I want recommendations for a book/book series that&#39;ll break through that barrier, something so packed with emotion and tension it has me turning page after page without thinking and holding my breath like the story is an ocean and I&#39;ve been submerged into it headfirst.

Since then, I\u2019ve been trying to get back into reading, but I kept abandoning books halfway. I even tried modern fiction like Yellowface, Babel, and a few others.</p> <p>Recently, I picked up Norwegian Wood and finished it in just three days\u2014it pulled me back into reading instantly.

His two favorite books are &quot;Mistborn: The Final Empire&quot; and &quot;The Butcher&#39;s Masquerade&quot;. He didnt care for &quot;This Inevitable Ruin&quot; but like the series overall. He already intends to read the entire Cosmere collection and a few other Brandon Sanderson books as thats his favorite author. His second would be Matt Dinniman. He enjoys Terry Pratchett, but describes them as a little slower. He also really enjoyed the first few books of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; but really did not enjoy the last 1 or 2, I can&#39;t recall. </p> <p>There are many other series he has mentioned, but I can&#39;t keep up lol.

Her boyfriend that she &quot;loves&quot; has started with the controlling behavior. She has to ask permission to go to the convienece store by her house. She has to have her phone location on so he can see where she is at all times. Etc etc. Please reccomend a book I can get her for Christmas, to hopefully steer her in the right direction . </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/esadmf03\"> /u/esadmf03 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1oy71eg/controlling_behavior/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1oy71eg/controlling_behavior/\">[comments]</a></span>",
