        "description": "A Rockstar Games release without controversy would be like The Game Awards without ads: More or less impossible and rightly inconceivable. Such has been the case since Red Dead Redemption 2, and crunch concerns arose around 2018. While that did nothing to impact the game's success, it reportedly contributed to a major shift behind the scenes at the studio, which would in turn impact development on Grand Theft Auto 6.\n\nYou've likely heard about the firings of 34 employees from the company earlier this month. At the time, Rockstar was accused of union-busting, which it denied, and retaliated by stating that the firings were due to said employees \u201cdistributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.\u201d",

        "description": "Shortcomings aside, Project Motor Racing is a promising start to righting the ship for the racing sim genre. Experiencing how each individual car handles differently based on different setup tweaks, watching the weather change in real-time, and hitting a turn perfectly feel incredible with the new engine, even if the limited amount of content and guidance kneecaps the appeal to non-hardcore racers. It\u2019s an experience that can have you jumping from elation to frustration in a moment, for better and for worse. \n\nRegardless, if this is the beginning of a new racing sim franchise that can build and expand on this foundation in the same way as the ones that came before it, I\u2019m excited about what the future holds for Project Motor Racing.",
