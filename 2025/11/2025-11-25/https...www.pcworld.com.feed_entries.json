Valve just launched the first-ever Black Friday Steam sale, and you know what that means: massive discounts on figurative tons of PC games. You can head over to SteamPowered.com to look around, but Valve\u2019s Steam Deck handheld is certainly the star of the show today. The base model has a rare discount, from $400 <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck\">down to just $319.20 until Saturday</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the OG Steam Deck, and the unupgraded version, which is now showing its age with an AMD Ryzen Zen 2 APU. It also has a smaller, dimmer 7-inch screen and a slightly smaller battery than the revised Steam Deck OLED, which is pointedly <em>not </em>on sale, as well as less space at just 256GB of storage. All that said, just over 300 bucks is a fantastic price for a machine that can play most of the games on Steam without issue",
