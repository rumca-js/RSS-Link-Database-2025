Some solutions seem to be heavily restricted on the free tier (nagios.com) while others don&#39;t offer my preferred docker setup (syslog-ng).

It offers way more raw power and RAM for cheap, but I&#39;m worried about the noise and heat in a small dorm room. Maybe it would be better in the feature I can set up proxmox and will make virtual machines, for feature studying. 3. Or maybe look for other options like a Mini PC or other one?</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to figure out the realistic resource usage. How much CPU/RAM does GitLab actually need if I&#39;m just running jobs without training models? Is 16GB RAM enou",
