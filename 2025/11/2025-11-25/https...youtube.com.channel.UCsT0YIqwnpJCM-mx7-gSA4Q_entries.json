        "description": "This empowering journey as a petite woman in the legal field, who often found herself sidelined and underestimated, relying on others to validate her abilities and ensure she was taken seriously. Through a profound personal breakthrough, she discovered the power of self-love and acceptance. She reveals how she learned to embrace her unique qualities and recognise her worth as an attorney, breaking free from the notion that she needed external validation. She encourages audiences to celebrate their individuality and choose themselves unapologetically. Naazneen's journey is diverse. At the heart of her work is a search for connection - whether through resolving disputes, amplifying stories on air, or unearthing fragments of the past from beneath the ocean's surface. Her most powerful insights come not from titles or achievements, but from navigating the quiet spaces of longing, belonging and identity.

Above all, she calls for the establishment of an Ibero-American network of women oyster farmers to honour pioneers such as Laurencia de Solminihac. She is a vocal advocate for food sovereignty and coastal heritage. She works to make coastal communities visible, valued and resilient. Meyling Tang has found a bridge to transform realities in gastronomy. Through her work with over 40 artisanal fishing organizations, she promotes fair trade and responsible fishing practices, connecting local communities with kitchens and tables across the country.
