So of course our reviewer brought his kids along to see what they thought! \n\nThe sequel builds off the look of the original film with a colorful palette, new terrains and ambitiously textured lighting, and, more importantly, the wall-to-wall animal puns are back in full force! But does the relentlessly hopeful Judy Hopps bite off a little more thematic weight than she can chew? \n\nFind out when Zootopia 2 starring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Ke Huy Quan, Andy Samberg and more opens on 11/26.",
