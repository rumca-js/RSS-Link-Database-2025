You open the box, follow the system rules, cast spell, done. It can be fun, I like a neat magic system as much as anyone, but I kind of miss stories where magic feels unsafe and truly other. Stuff that makes you think this should not exist in a human world, we are poking something we do not understand at all.</p> <p>I am looking for books where contact with magic changes the way characters think or even perceive reality, not just their hit points in a fight. Maybe the sky looks different forever after they see a ritual. Maybe time gets weird, or people slowly start forgetting parts of their own history because some spell rewrote what is true. I want it to feel more like dealing with radiation or a deep ocean creature than like learning a skill in an RPG.</p> <p>I am fine with dark or unsettling tones, but I am not looking for pure horror.

Or the stuff that has a more YA level of logic, worldview, and line level writing, but tons of adult content. </p> <p>Nothing wrong with any of these categories but I\u2019ve had books misrepresented by publisher or user tags so many times it\u2019s starting to get annoying.

It was shaping up to by my new favorite after wizard and glass but I found the ending to be a bit anticlimactic. I was a bit disappointed the wolves were defeated so easily and Andy was subdued that quickly. I suppose I would have liked to see more struggle and a closer call of losing to the wolves. It felt a bit rushed at the end. Over all I really enjoyed the story of the calla and the vibe and the cross over with Salems lot, but as always expectations are the thief of joy. 4/5 stars. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/arsebeef\"> /u/arsebeef </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1p60oez/dark_tower_v_wolves_of_the_calla/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1p60oez/dark_tower_v_wolves_of_the_calla/\">[comments]</a></span>",
