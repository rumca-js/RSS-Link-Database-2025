So I just hit up Amazon and grabbed the &quot;recommended&quot; drive; a Seagate Expansion 8 TB drive.</p> <p>Turns out it&#39;s SMR. I thought I was doing something wrong at first so I tried half a dozen different filesystems including exFAT and they all exhibited the same behavior.</p> <p>Read speeds are fine. Write speeds are horrible, in the neighborhood of 30 MB/s when I&#39;m copying a large folder of Bluray ISOs. The files pass checksum validation, it&#39;s just really slow.</p> <p>The thing that messed with me most is that it has 8 GB of high speed cache, so the first 8 GB of data copies over basically instantly and then the speeds tank. I&#39;ve watched its activity in a hardware monitor and after a prolonged transfer it&#39;ll still be writing data",

Also the million of images that come with those conversations. The reason I ask here is because it&#39;s a pretty specific thing to archive, and I haven&#39;t found a lot online.</p> <p>I might be digging through them once in a while? Otherwise they&#39;re just there for peace of mind that I won&#39;t lose years of history, so mostly untouched. I&#39;ve heard hard drives can degrade over time, so the hope is to minimise that as much as I can.<br/> Now, as someone completely uninformed, what kind of storage should I get? I&#39;ve been using usb sticks but they aren&#39;t large enough, and I&#39;m not sure what the difference between HDD and SSD is</p> <p>I&#39;ve been avoiding cloud storage since I don&#39;t want those chats on someone else&#39;s computer</p> <p>Thank you,</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32;",
