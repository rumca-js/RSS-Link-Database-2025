        "description": "Watch this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm to discover how Unreal Engine\u2019s Substrate material system transforms the way artists create and control surface shading. \n\nThis session dives into the new physically based model, showcases the method through which Substrate produces more flexible materials with greater visual fidelity, and provides practical tips for transitioning from legacy materials with confidence.\n\nWe explore how Substrate replaces the traditional shading model with a more physically accurate node-based system, looking at the way the new workflow separates material logic from surface description, enabling advanced layering, blending, and interaction between materials that was not possible with legacy models.\n\nWe also dive into the benefits for art teams; practical tips for converting legacy materials to Substrate; common pitfalls and best practices; and how adopting Substrate will future-proof your pipeline.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.co",

        "description": "Watch Quentin Warnant present Rare's latest explorations into making interactive hanging foliage\u2014such as groups of vines\u2014in this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm.\n\nHe demonstrates how he's using Niagara to implement a position-based dynamics physics solver and applying the results onto Nanite meshes. \n\nQuentin also showcases ways to integrate external forces like dynamic wind and collisions on the simulation. There\u2019s a discussion on key learnings from the content presented, as well as a look at potential future work to be done.\n\nYou\u2019ll gain practical knowledge on the synergistic use of various Unreal Engine features, with an introduction to position-based dynamics as an algorithm and how to implement it in Niagara by using simulation stages, Grid2D collections, and custom HLSL nodes. \n\nYou\u2019ll also learn how custom data interfaces are used to read bespoke mesh vertex data and control instanced material parameters directly from Niagara, instead of using Niagara renderers.\n\nAddi",
