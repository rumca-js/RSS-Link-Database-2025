Are there any communities of people hacking/jailbreaking cars to disable cellular data and regain control of our property? Or is physically disconnecting the modems (outside of inspections and explicit updates) my only option? If so are there people documenting the process? I have seen surprisingly little discussion of this topic since the technology became commonplace. Are privacy conscious drivers simply all still on older cars? Or do they just &quot;trust&quot; the software toggles and manufacturer/govt claims?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Yugen42\"> /u/Yugen42 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
