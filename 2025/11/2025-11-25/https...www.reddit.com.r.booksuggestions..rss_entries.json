Like &#39;A thousand splendid suns&#39; by Khaled hosseini or &#39;Home&#39; by Manju kapur. I don&#39;t mean homely feeling in the sense that it&#39;s relatable. On the contrary, they make you experience cultural shock and introduce aspects of other people&#39;s everyday life or common practices that are not known to you and are so horrible that you wish you don&#39;t ever have to personally experience but you also cant help but derive like a minimal sadistic pleasure from? (People who have read these two books know what I mean) Apparently they&#39;re usually classified as historical fictions, and are usually asia based but is read whatever as long as it&#39;s written in third person and is of this very particular genre.

I want a little breath of fresh air if anyone has any recommendations!</p> <p>Looking for a sappy romance or coming of age. Smut to a minimum, I appreciate it as a plot point but not a heavy focus. I&#39;m a fan of gaudy writing so preferably anything intended for an older audience not YA. The only books with romantic plots I&#39;ve enjoyed were The Great Gatsby in high school and Vengeance Thwarted by Prue Phillipson so please, I need some help y&#39;all!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Suspicious_Stop6722\"> /u/Suspicious_Stop6722 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p6lohb/fun_romancefantasygiddy_guilty_pleasure_books_for/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p6lohb/fun_roman",

What she does love, though, are light, cozy murder mysteries. </p> <p>She\u2019s a huge Agatha Christie fan and adored The Cat Who series by Lilian Jackson Braun. (anything with animal co-detectives really) Recently, I gave her An Elderly Woman Is Up to No Good by Helene Tursten, and she really enjoyed that and the sequel.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for newer mysteries, ideally stuff published in the last 3\u20135 years, that would appeal to her taste. Any recommendations for cozy, gentle crime novels (or series) would be amazing. I&#39;m trying to swing getting her as many suggested books as I can to hopefully keep her busy throughout ",

We live on opposite sides of the country and don\u2019t get much time to talk anymore, so I thought this would be a good way to connect! We are both avid readers, but have different tastes in books. She is in her mid-40s and typically reads self-help, historical fiction (usually the really sad WW2 ones), and memoirs. She also loves Jane Austen! I typically read fantasy, sci-fi, horror, science, and sometimes historical fiction, but I\u2019m open to other genres! Our favorite book we read together was Tuesday\u2019s with Morrie. I\u2019m planning to get her a few books for Christmas to choose from that we can read together. Any recommendations? Thank you! :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/redhorsequeen\"> /u/redhorsequeen </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p6j2v6/book_recs_for_me_and_my_mom/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <",

I graduated high school last week, and as insane as it sounds, I&#39;ve been craving some intellectual stimulation (watching tiktok is so boring I just end up solving sudoku all day like some grandma), so I really want to get into reading. I really like watching documentaries about social problems, and really enjoyed the Great Gatsby and to Kill a Mockingbird. I read a few biographies I enjoyed. I despise anything to do with romance, fantasy or true crime (sorry to anyone offended).

They spend the entire story trying to make amends, pay back the money, or catch the person who set them up. The twist comes when they succeed, only to realize their entire journey, their desperation to achieve &quot;redemption,&quot; was actually the final, required step in the villain&#39;s master plan. Their act of heroism was, in reality, the funding or mechanism the antagonist needed to make their final escape.

Shark Heart by Emily Habeck and Comfort me with Apples by Catherynne Valente were 2 that I absolutely loved so much I would read them again. I need recommendations of books like them. Weird stuff where the plot makes no sense? That\u2019s what I want!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/juniper650\"> /u/juniper650 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p5y85x/weird_strange_if_you_didnt_like_it_chances_are_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1p5y85x/weird_strange_if_you_didnt_like_it_chances_are_i/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I\u2019m obviously fine with there being feelings and such, but I\u2019ve read wayy too many books where they meet three times and are like \u2018i will love u until the end of time\u2019 at like 20% in or less. hate hate hate. (unless there\u2019s a cultural or some reason for it, like I didn\u2019t mind the insta love in ICB bc it\u2019s part of their fated mates thing, and the women always have some level of rational thought regarding taking things at least a LITTLE slow).</p> <p>so yeah. please please send me some romance books where they actually BUILD a romance and the payoff confession/\u2018i love you\u2018 makes sense. either confession almost very end, or in story reason as to why it makes sense that it\u2019s sooner. i prefer fantasy romance, with M/F or F/F, but will try pretty much anything if it\u2019s well written :)</p> <p>tyy</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://w",
