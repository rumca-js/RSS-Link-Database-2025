After sending a ton of messages, I ran into my first \u201crollback,\u201d where the chat suddenly reverted to messages from a week ago after I sent a new one.</p> <p>It happened again a while later, and today it\u2019s gotten worse: the chat rolled back three times in a row, and now it completely disappeared. I can only send one message before it resets again. I even got a message saying the chat can\u2019t be recovered.</p> <p>Has anyone else had this happen? Is it actually impossible to recover, or is it just a bug in the interface? I\u2019ve never gotten any warnings about the chat being too long before. I\u2019m really frustrated because I lost so much work and some creative/funny responses I was saving.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gabvx_is_offline\"> /u/gabvx_is_off",
