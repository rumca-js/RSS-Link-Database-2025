Armed with nothing more than a paintbrush, Constance bashes and dashes through the physical manifestation of her decaying mental health and clashes against her inner demons. It's a narrative with memorable moments but not an abundantly clear throughline, and an adventure that makes a few missteps throughout. Still, when Constance slows down long enough to allow you to appreciate its splendor and think through its platforming puzzles, it's often a marvel to behold.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The story of Constance draws clear parallels to the likes of <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/celeste/\">Celeste</a> or <a href=\"https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau/",
