He says Owens bombarded him with fake pregnancy tests and claims of having had unsuccessful abortions. Six months later, Marraccini claims Owens admitted to making up multiple pregnancies. Owens denies Marraccini's claims. She faces 14 felony counts alleging she committed fraud and perjury against two other men. Owens has pleaded not guilty.",
