        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve always been skeptical of docker containers, but I figured the best way to get over it was to actually build one. I had this idea to use an Amazon firestick like an old chromecast as an echo endpoint to stream music over my living room sound system. I quickly found that having an Amazon billboard that would randomly auto play adds kinda sucked so I decided to jailbreak my firestick like people used to\u2026 I quickly found out that it is basically impossible anymore. So I did the next best thing I made a service that lives on my home lab that constantly polls the firestick and if it\u2019s doing anything other then playing music or playing a slideshow app that I downloaded it would automatically open the slideshow as a screensaver. I decided it would make for a good container so I containerized it. I hope maybe it will be useful to some of you as well.</p> <p><a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/novarey4200/firestick-minder\">https://hub.docker.com/r/novarey420",

Everything just seems to work perfectly, until out of nowhere, I can be working on a new container and pop, no more docker. The app uninstalls itself. No desktop app, no CLI commands, nothing. My saving grace is that, when I reinstall it, all my containers are still there, but it&#39;s very unsustainable.</p> <p>I&#39;ve already talked with one of our local IT boys to check if maybe the global IT boys may be uninstalling it, but he said it&#39;s all clear, that it wasn&#39;t that.
