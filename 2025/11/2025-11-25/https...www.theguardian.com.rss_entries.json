If the thought of all that excess and single-use packaging gives you palpitations, here\u2019s how to give great-value, joy-inducing presents in a way that doesn\u2019t add to the world\u2019s problems and, in many cases, supports solutions.</p><p>I\u2019ve tried and tested gifts \u2013 from bath-time luxe to nature-positive accessories and charity-supporting fun \u2013 to help you avoid mass-produced fodder or last-minute throwaway tat. For this list I\u2019ve chosen only ethical brands and online retailers with eco- and social-impact credentials, to prove that sustainable doesn\u2019t have to mean sanctimonious.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/n",
