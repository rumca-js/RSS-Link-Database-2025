I&#39;m fairly new to anime and have watched only a handful:</p> <p>Chivalry of the failed knight (My 2nd fav) Guilty crown (didn&#39;t like) Record of Grancrest War (My fav) Darling in the FranXX (Masterpiece, 4 episodes left) Kabaneri of the Iron Fortrese (Loved it) </p> <p>I am looking for similar romantic action anime to watch. What I love most: romance that begins early on and the main characters confess a bit early on too (so the rest of the series is based on improving that romance). I love emotional and wholesome romantic scenes. Couple these with some action scenes and a bingeworthy plot, and I am game!</p> <p>Here&#39;s what ChatGPT recommended: Yona of the Dawn (Ive heard it has very slow romance development, so not interested) Akame ga Kill (I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s too emotional) Zero no Tsukaima (might give this a try) </p> <p>PS: Don&#39;t mind ecchi or harem, only mind slow romance development, I don&#39;t want ",

I&#39;m not familiar with reddit and I saw it&#39;s the right place when you&#39;re looking for help (I guess). I hope some of you could help me :). My English is not very good so I&#39;m sorry if there is any mistakes.</p> <p>So I saw this anime when I was very young on TV, I would guess this anime took place in the late 90s/ earlier 2000s ( I don&#39;t really remember the year but I think its around 2010 when I watched it). I think it was a seinen or maybe josei, it was in high school and there were vampires. I remember there were nuns and there was a church too. As what I can understand, the fl was an high school girl entering a new school but there was a vampire (a guy) who I think was a little older than her and was the bad guy and he was obsessed with her.</p> <p>That&#39;s pretty much all I can remember... I hope you guys can help me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",

He meets some tiny kid that is feral (who was originally sent to try and kill him and take his item/power) and a woman with white hair that uses a katana and she has some type of disease that makes her go berserk. She ends up joining the military group with him because her small town of survivors kicks her out. The military he ends up joining puts him through some odd tests, like hooking him up to some kind of VR to see if he is lying about his intentions and then another test where he and a bunch of recruits get sent into a ruined city to kill monsters and collect 100 crystals (I think is what they where) from them or take the crystals from other recruits.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",

But ever since I finished it nothing else scratches the itch the same way. Can I get some recommendations similar to it that aren&#39;t jjk, demon slayer or tokyo ghoul :&#39;) I also really enjoy black butler, death note, Vanitas no carte, attack on titan, Moriarty the patriot and the promised neverland so any recommendations similar to those are welcome aswell! As for my brother, he&#39;s only 7 but he&#39;s a big fan of demon slayer! I showed it to him and he really loved the anime and even saw the movie recently. But seeing that he&#39;s rewatching it for the 5th time makes me wanna recommend him something else he might enjoy...

But that\u2019s not true because the gaming club has about 20 people playing DND, board games and video games. I\u2019m also in the business club which is very popular and active.
