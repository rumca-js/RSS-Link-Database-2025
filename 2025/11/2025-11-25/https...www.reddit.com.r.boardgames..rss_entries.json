        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I used to think that my battle mat looked too plain compared to the fancy maps people post online. But over time I figured out a few simple tricks that help me to make even a basic grid feel way more cinematic, and thats without buying anything extra.</p> <p>The first fix was layering. Sticky notes became moving hazards.. It sounds silly, but players react fast when the battlefield physically changes in front of them.</p> <p>Then I started using color-coded markers, blue for water, red for danger zones, green for cover. It makes the map readable at a glance. This speeds up decisions and reduces the \u201cwait, what\u2019s that again?\u201d moments.</p> <p>And honestly, small props matter more than perfect art. A bottle cap becomes a boulder. A folded card becomes a door. Players fill in the rest with imagination. You don\u2019t need artistic skills, just clarity and a few clever layers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",

We played ISS Vanguard, also Oathsworn and now we are planning to start Gloomhaven.</p> <p>My question for you is, which is better comparing KDM or ATO (or new game Sins of Herakles)? Soon there will be Black Friday deals so want to come prepared.</p> <p>KDM sounds very interesting, but also expensive plus I don&#39;t know where to store miniatures of the game. Also very expensive with all different expansions and nose changes.</p> <p>For ATO I have watched Shelfside review and from Rulebook is a mess, real mess.
