        "description": "What could it be? \ud83e\udd14\n\nFamed former Apple designer Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have been working in secret on a screenless device that uses artificial intelligence technology. But what does it look like? How does it work? We still don\u2019t know, but the two dropped a few hints recently at Emerson Collective\u2019s 2025 Demo Day in conversation with Laurene Powell Jobs.\n\nThe AI project is said to have a more peaceful feel than some modern devices, although it\u2019s not entirely clear what that means. Altman said that most devices and apps he uses today are noisy and unsettling, but the upcoming device will have a calmer vibe. \n\n\u201cI hope when people see it they just say, \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 \u201c Altman said, to which Ive added, \u201cThey will.\u201d\n\nIve said that most products don\u2019t have a sense of humor and take themselves too seriously. Altman said he hadn\u2019t realized until he saw the most recent prototype, \u201chow much that just doesn\u2019t exist and how lovely it is to have some whimsy back.\u201d \n\n#samaltman #jonyive #",
