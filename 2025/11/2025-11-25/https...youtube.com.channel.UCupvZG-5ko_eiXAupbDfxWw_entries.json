US District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie ruled that the cases were invalid because the prosecutor who brought the charges, interim US attorney Lindsey Halligan, had been unlawfully appointed. Halligan was installed and brought the cases after Trump forced out the existing US attorney who resisted bringing the cases and pleaded with Attorney General Pam Bondi to make them happen. Bondi, during a press conference in Memphis, Tennessee, said that the Justice Department will take \u201call available legal action,\u201d including an \u201cimmediate appeal,\u201d to address the decision.\n\nCNN crime and justice correspondent Katelyn Polantz reports, and Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown speak with CNN legal analyst and former prosecutor Joey Jackson. #CNN #News",
