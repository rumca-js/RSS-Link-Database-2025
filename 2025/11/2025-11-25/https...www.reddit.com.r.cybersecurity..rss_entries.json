According to a Times of India report, several major US banks (JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citi and others) are investigating a sensitive data breach; not in their own systems, but at their vendor <em>SitusAMC</em>, which handles mortgage/loan application data.</p> <p>The vendor confirmed the breach on November 12 and is still assessing the impact. What makes this worrying is the type of data involved: SSNs, financial details, employment info - basically the full identity set.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t a direct attack on the banks, which is exactly the point. Your vendor is your attack surface. Curious how everyone here is handling vendor and API-level risk.
