I know 3D modelling as well, so the thought of just creating something and having it in my hands in a few hours is just too much lol </p> <p>I keep browsing makerworld and printables like it&#39;s social media. Why would I spend half a weekend printing and assembling a focus rail for macro photography? This wasn&#39;t even on my plans. Obviously I have to try printing Lego at some point. Or design a planter or a phone holder. What about all the more functional prints like cable management clips or something. Maybe a kinetic wall art, or a lithophane photo, or even a zoetrope to put on my record player??</p> <p>This is a lot to handle lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://ww",
