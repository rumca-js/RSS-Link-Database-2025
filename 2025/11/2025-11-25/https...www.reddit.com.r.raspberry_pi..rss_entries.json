I&#39;ve found a few projects for making the sign part so that&#39;s not my big concern. What I&#39;m looking to do is add a proximity sensor of sorts to this project.</p> <p>My end goal: When I walk in at the start of my day, I switch the sign to acknowledge that I&#39;m in the office. I want the sign to detect when I&#39;m more than ~15ft away from it that it switches to a message similar to &quot;Around here somewhere&quot;. My original thoughts were to attach that to my phones Bluetooth since I&#39;m almost never without it. Then when I leave the building, I switch the sign to &quot;Not In&quot; or something of that effect. Ideally I could do this remotely versus a physical switch.</p> </div><!-- SC_O",

I&#39;m building a portable moonlight streaming system using a pi 5 16gb and a portable OLED monitor. One of the ways I wanted to mount the pi to the back of the monitor was with a ring magnet being stuck to the bottom of my pi case (GeeekPi Aluminum Case), the kind of ring magnet you see used for cell phones. However, I was not sure if there might any kind of interference the pi might experience due to the magnet, especially with the wifi chip. The magnet won&#39;t be extremely strong, it&#39;s just a ring magnet, however I was wondering if any of you had any input regarding this. </p> <p>Thanks all. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Gatecrasher3\"> /u/Gatecrasher3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1p6mcio/mounting_my_pi_5_with_a_magnet/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https:",
