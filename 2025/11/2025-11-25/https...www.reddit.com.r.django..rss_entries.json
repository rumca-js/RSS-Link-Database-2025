Then I opened a retail store and added a Clover POS system and needed to sync data between them. There were not any commercial off the shelf syncing options that I could find that would fit my specific use case. So I created a simple python script that connects to both APIs and syncs data between them. Problem solved! But then I wanted to turn my long single script into some kind of auditable task log. </p> <p>So I created a dag-style sync engine whichs runs in Django. It is a database driven task routing system controlled by a django front end. It consists of an orchestrator which determines the sequence of tasks and a dispatcher for task routing. Each sync job is initiated by essentially writing a row with queued status in the synccomand table with the dag name and initial payload. Django signals are used to fire the orchestrator and dispatcher and the task steps are run in Celery. It also fe",
