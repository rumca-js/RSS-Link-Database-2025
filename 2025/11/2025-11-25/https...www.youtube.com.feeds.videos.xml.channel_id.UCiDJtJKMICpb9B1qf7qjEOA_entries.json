We start with Adam's favorite prop from those films: the hero Nimbus 2001 racing broom. From there, Adam examines a set of wands that span the franchise, each showcasing the evolution of both wand design and practical effects techniques used to make these look magical on screen. \n\nLearn more about this prop and see more details at: https://propstoreauction.com/auctions/info/id/462\n\nShot by Josh Self and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nSavage Merchandising: https://adamsavage.com/\nAb",
