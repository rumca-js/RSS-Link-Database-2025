They go to some beach house? And meet with his friend who has a very young girlfriend, too. The friend is named Gillian or something like it and she commits suicide after befriending the MC and saying it\u2019s not all great with the rich old men. The main character then tries to reconnect with her hippie artist mom after the fully adult man breaks it off with/abandons her. I have to know wtf that author was thinking, or went through. As an adult now I was talking with a friend about the most inappropriate books we read for our age as teenagers and this is definitely up there. I think it must have been written in the 80s, got it at a library sale. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LettuceInfamous4810\"> /u/LettuceInfamous4810 </a> <b",
