A big one is to find other places in the universe that might harbor life. We only know of one such planet so far: Earth. And so we get particularly excited when we find Earth-mass planets at the right distance from their star to sustain liquid water\u2014also critical for life as we know it. We\u2019ve found lots of those \u201chabitable\u201d worlds. But we also don\u2019t know what factors are really critical to the initial development of life. Maybe star type? We get even more excited if that Earth-mass at the right distance from a Sun-type star. We\u2019ve found a few of those too, and we can infer that there are lots more. \n\nCheck out the Black Friday Sale at the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nPBS Member Stat",
