Calling attention\nto an idea that there\u2019s a pseudo-human spying on you is bad. Alexa\ndepends on the opposite impression, that it\u2019s just a computer. I\nthink AI\u2019s should give up the pretense that they\u2019re human, and\nthis one should be first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/11/chatgpt_5-1_with_renamed_and_new_personalities\">Amen</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a  title=\"Permanent link to \u2018Simple Rule of Thumb: AI Systems Shouldn\u2019t Pretend to Be Human\u2019\"  href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/11/24/winer-ai-pseudo-humans\">&nbsp;\u2605&nbsp;</a>\n</div>",
