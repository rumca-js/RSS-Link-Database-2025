This project is not finished yet but its on that stage I can show it to others and ask other for help in developing it.</p> <p><strong>What I built:</strong></p> <p>Introlix is an AI-powered research platform. Think of it as &quot;GitHub Copilot meets Google Docs&quot; for research work.</p> <p>Features: </p> <ol> <li><p>Research Desk: It is just like google docs but in right side there is an AI pannel where users can ask questions to LLM. And also it can edit or write document for user. So, it is just like github copilot but it is for text editor. There are two modes: Chat and edit. Chat mode is for asking questions and edit mode is for editing the document using AI agent.</p></li> <li><p>Chat: For quick questions you can create a new chat and ask questions.</p></li> ",
