Sometimes, they sought the same collectors and painted the same subjects.

It was the standard Japanese curry of potatoes, onion, carrot and pork, usually thickened with <a href=\"https://www.sbfoods-worldwide.com/curry/\">S&amp;B Golden Curry blocks</a>. It made a weekly appearance in our house, and now I regularly make it for my own family, too. However, my kids are a little fussy: one likes it with tonkatsu on top and the other doesn\u2019t want any meat at all. So I now make curry with no meat in it, and more vegetables, which means that I have to make only one version (and whoever wants to add tonkatsu can do so!).</p><p>This recipe is an edited extract from The Japanese Pantry, by Emiko Davies, published by Smith Street Books at \u00a330.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/nov/25/vegetable-udon-curry-recipe-emiko-davies\">Continue reading...</a>",
