        "description": "Nearly 5 million people in Florida get their health care through Obamacare plans.\n\nBut the cost of these plans is set to skyrocket in 2026 when federal subsidies expire.\n\nWe spoke with Republican voters \u2014 including a resident who was quoted a 291% increase in her premium.\n\n-----\n\nMore Perfect Union is an Emmy-winning, nonprofit newsroom whose mission is to build power for working people. Here\u2019s what that means: We report on the real struggles and challenges of the working class from a working-class perspective. We attempt to connect those problems to potential solutions. We report on the abuses and wrongdoing of corporate power. And we seek to hold accountable the ultra-rich who have too much power over America\u2019s political and economic systems.\n\n To support our independent journalism, subscribe, donate, and follow our other pages through the links below:\n- Help fund our reporting: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/mpu-splash\n- Substack: https://substack.perfectunion.us/\n- TikTok: http",
