Even when a subplot about Megan&#39;s mom being abused by her husband is presented, it is relevant and gives us a deeper characterization of Megan, who&#39;s mostly presented as a stone-faced cop. </p> <p>Go see it if you haven&#39;t. It&#39;s tense and keeps surprising you with a few scary parts. Ron Silver goes haywire as the madman bent on raping and killing Megan. Clancy Brown is a handsome romantic interest. Louise Fletcher and Philip Bosco are also good.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/LaserDiscCurious\"> /u/LaserDi",

Why not build an app, and create a community-driven space for discovering and sharing our short films?! A place to consume short but quality content.</p> <p>Anyone can add their own short films (just link from YouTube or Vimeo), and the more filmmakers who join, the richer the library gets for viewers when it officially launches.</p> <p>Just thought I\u2019d share it here because I know so many of us struggle with the same visibility problem.

It all is leading up to what should be a climax but... then it just abruptly ends. It makes me feel like it was a super waste of time! </p> <p>I&#39;m not sure if this types of story telling is on the rise or if I happen to keep randomly selecting movies that end without wrapping the story up but rarely do these movies hit well for me. There are a few ambiguous endings where the viewers is left to come to their own conclusions (Birdman comes to mind as an example), but many just abruptly end and it feels like part of the movie was quite literally cut/ended in error. </p> <p>I was curious what others felt about these kind of films. Do you have examples of either which were successful or not?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &",

I can mostly hear a man&#39;s voice but it seems like there&#39;s some conversation taking place with at least two people. I went to YouTube and played the same fim version on two different channels that didn&#39;t have a music track playing, and I could hear some scratchy white noise much more faintly in the background at full volume that has a bit of a speech &quot;rhythm&quot; to it if that makes sense, and both youtube videos had the exact same pattern of white noise, but it was different from what I&#39;m hearing on Prime Video. I&#39;m just fascinated by this and wondering how/when these voices could have been picked up and added to the film, but I know nothing about the technical aspects of film audio. It seems even more odd given",
