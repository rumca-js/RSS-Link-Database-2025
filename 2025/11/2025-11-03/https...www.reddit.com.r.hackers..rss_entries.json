I used a couple of my mom&#39;s emails per time I was hacked, and she has a history of being hacked. I was also lax with securing my account after the facts. But from this last time, I took them seriously after they got ahold of my card information. After I got my new card and I got thru to Playstation I changed <em>everything.</em> New email, new password, 2-step verification, new security question, and a password for card usage. It only took less than a month before I was hacked by someone else. This time, they turned off my 2-step first and then proceeded to change the email and password. And weirdly enough, while the last time it showed that someone across the world hacked me, it didn&#39;t show where this hacker was from. Thankfully they haven&#39;t touched my card, but I&#39;m at a loss as to what it could be. It&#39;s been a month since this happened. I w",

My mom isn&#39;t tech savvy enough to know not to let strangers connect to her hotspot, so she kindly let her do it.</p> <p>The lady spent 2 minutes and said she was done. She also was very inquisitive about my mom&#39;s background and life. My mom talked to her for a bit and then promptly left to catch an appointment. My mom has since left the country and returned home.</p> <p>This story immediately threw up red flags for me. My main question is, could this lady have installed any malware/spyware through the hotspot connection? I&#39;m not certain how they work to know whether we need to be worried or not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/n00bDeveloper123\"> /u",
