        "description": "The legends of Good Morning America are celebrating the show's golden anniversary. The very first anchor was David Hartman. He is now 90 years old. His co-anchor, Broadway star Nancy Dussault, is now 89. Joan Lunden was named co-anchor in 1980. Charlie Gibson joined the show in 1987, and Diane Sawyer stepped in as co-anchor in 1999. Three years later, she welcomed Robin Roberts. Now, George Stephanopoulos and Michael Strahan are part of the legacy.",

Chris Evins says he and his wife held onto the girl. He says the seats have two restraints, a lap bar, and a safety belt for each person. The ordeal lasted around 2 minutes until the ride came to an end. The park says it found no issues with the ride but out of an abundance of caution it replaced the lap belts and it has operated safely since the incident.",

        "description": "Chaos as thousands of passengers wait for hours to go through security checks and flights are being delayed across America by a shortage of air traffic controllers turning up for work. What looks like being the longest government shutdown in history means that TSA agents and air traffic controllers are not getting paid. Up to 80% are taking other jobs to make ends meet. If the shutdown is not resolved soon, those delays will spill over into the Thanksgiving exodus, potentially ruining the holiday for millions.",
