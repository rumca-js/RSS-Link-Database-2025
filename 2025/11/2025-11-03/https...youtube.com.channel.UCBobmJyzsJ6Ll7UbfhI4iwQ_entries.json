In this session, we explore how UE5\u2019s Dataflow Graph system can alleviate that pain.\n\nThe Dataflow Graph system provides a non-destructive node-based workflow to set up a variety of Chaos Physics assets, including Destruction, Cloth, Flesh, and Groom.\n\nThe talk teaches you how to take advantage of Dataflow to speed up iteration time and enhance the quality of your Chaos Physics assets. You\u2019ll also gain an understanding of how to automate your workflows to process multiple assets from a single Dataflow graph.",

        "description": "This session recorded at Unreal Fest Bali dives into the art principles of \u2018Fortnite: Battle Royale\u2019 through the lens of a lighting art director. \n\nWe dig into conceptual principles that make up a compelling scene, then show how these concepts can be used in approaches to world lighting, biome-specific lighting adjustments, and considerations around scaling lighting across platforms.\n\nWe also take you through the Day Sequence plugin\u2014a collection of actors and assets that you can use to automatically generate a 24-hour day cycle. These components make it simpler to set up a time of day system while having more artistic control over the sun, moon, stars, and atmosphere. We demonstrate how you can use the Day Sequence plugin to create visually compelling differences in Fortnite islands.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#FortniteBattleRoyale, #DaySequencePlugin, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestBali",
