It\u2019s gotta be good so I can get hooked. </p> <p>Thoughts so far: </p> <p>I really like world building and different races. Cool magic systems are nice as well but not a must. I remember I used to love the Eragon series as a kid (and Redwall when I was even younger). I would read Lotr if I wasn\u2019t so into the movies and knew all the spoilers. </p> <p>I also tried lies of Locke Lamora or whatever it was called, but even though I finished it it was a bit too verbose for me.</p> <p>Dune I read as well and enjoyed, but it was a lot of starting and stopping. Think I\u2019m looking for more medieval fantasy right now.</p> <p>I have done some research ",
