I loved the atmosphere and passion for magic, or in those cases deception. It is told through journals, giving each unique perspective of events. The characters have complex motivations for their actions and their passion extends to all aspects of their lives. It\u2019s not only a tale of revenge but also what drives a man in their art as well. But that\u2019s just the emotional base, the crazy twists and turns the story leads the reader through are unpredictable and very fun. I found it to be a lot more horror oriented than the movie, also the sci-fi element is more present. Another diversion the movie made was to not include the generational effects of the magician\u2019s feud. The generational effect really hits home in the very end and the book finishes in a horror filled present day nightmare. I loved it! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/",

My friend recommended the illiad and the Odyssey and I&#39;ve picked it up and my word it&#39;s brilliant. The translation I&#39;ve got uses the Roman names however, which is a bit jarring but the story itself has kept me reading and I find it amazing that a story that is what thousands of years old? Is still accessible today and is still a great story that rivals modern literature. </p> ",

This thread is less about whether you do/don&#39;t like Monte Cristo, and is more about what makes books more or less easy to appreciate in audio format.

Sometimes smaller houses, but still. I mentioned that I&#39;ve worked with editors as a writer because the kinds of issues I&#39;m seeing are basic stuff any editor should catch.

This book, a part of the bigger Marie Antoinette series is an epitome of what is called &#39;romantic&#39; writing.

On first look, there seems to be an element of dark satire brimming up, but in fact the chapter ends up being completely tragic. I think most would agree it is the high point of the book, and I think that the idea of Osiris and it&#39;s riders will stay with me and my thoughts for decades.</p> <p>To be honest, after this point the book never really reaches ",

The legacy series looks like it used to have 4 books but one of them is nowhere to be found and her website has scrubbed all mentions of it. It&#39;s not on amazon and thriftbooks only lists the other 3 as the complete series.</p> <p>So did <strong>Somewhere I belong (2018)</strong> get published under a different title before or did it never happen? Out of print? I don&#39;t want to start that series if I can&#39;t ever finish it but if it is just a matter of a title change then it&#39;s no big deal. I have noticed she changes cover art very frequently so I thought maybe a title changed. I&#39;m starting to wonder if the book never happened and those are just odd bits of google cookies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pilesoflaundry113\"> /u/pilesoflaundry113 </a> <br/>",
