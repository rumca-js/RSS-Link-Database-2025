I&#39;m sure this has been discussed here before but i haven&#39;t found a solution that worked for me. I just recently installed Arch on my laptop and have been trying to connect my 3rd party Switch Pro Controller through bluetooth. It connects properly through Bluetooth, but i don&#39;t get any input in Steam or an online gamepad tester. I installed Joycond and it didn&#39;t work. I saw that newer Kernels had hid-nintendo built in, but since my controller still wasn&#39;t working i tried installing it anyway. When I do <code>sudo dkms build nintendo -v 3.2</code> I get this error: <code>Error! Bad return status for module build on kernel: 6.17.6-arch1-1 (x86_64)</code></p> <p><code>Consult /var/lib/dkms/nintendo/3.2/build/make.log for more information.</code></p> <p>The output of /make.log:</p> <p><code>DKMS (dkms-3.2.2) make.log for nintendo/3.2 for kernel 6.17.6-arch1-1 (x86_64)</code></p> <p><",

I&#39;m planning on going the Dual boot route since I&#39;m fed-up with Windows and want to give a real shot Linux again. My new PC build is obviously very focused on gaming. In this case a dual boot solution is a must have since I want to play games with anti-cheat like Valorant and especially Battlefield 6, which means I need secure boot. On Linux I will be playing the rest of the games I normally do play. I feel very committed to the Linux jump but the secure boot or anti cheat factor and dual boot complications are bugging me.</p> <p>I am torn between two distros which are Bazzite and Cachyos. For the last years I&#39;ve used Windows, so I am more or less a beginner regarding Linux, although I have Cachyos on my old laptop for testing purposes if I feel comfortable with Linux.</p> <p>Now to my questions:</p> <p>As far I know Bazzite supports secure boot out the gate, right?

I&#39;m looking for older games that will play well on an RTX 4060 at 3440 x 1440. Assume 60Hz and if I find a game playable at higher refresh rates, I&#39;ll use them. </p> <p>Recommendations? The Elder Scrolls series looks good, and I&#39;d think it would be easily playable, at least the earlier ones. What else? I prefer games that require some thought and/or have a good story. Humor is also a plus. Cool graphics are great but the point is to have fun I&#39;m not big on FPS or warfare type games set in the modern day. Science fiction and fantasy settings are cool, and while I&#39;m not aware of anything, any games that involve solving mysteries or the golden age private eye genre would be at the top of my list IF it is a good game. Free or cheap is a big plus. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/BongDomr",

Intel gma 3600.. he will use it for searching online. Using libre office. Reading emails. And playing games (ofc not demanding games but i think at this point everything is demanding to it lol). He wants to play minecraft. A game called stumble guys. Roblox (this one not. I dont think this machine will run it). So as far as i know finding graphic drivers for linix will be complicated.

Why does it work this way? why can&#39;t it be smoother and more flexible like in windows? Does AMD work the same way in linux?</p> <p>B.

Why doesn&#39;t practically any Distro offer a smooth and safe way to downgrade drivers?</p> <p>I&#39;m asking all this because I&#39;ve recently had to downgrade nvidia driver to version 575 because some of the games I play won&#39;t even launch on 580 (a confirmed issue with the driver and nothing else), therefore I had to manually i",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi all, would appreciate any help on this issue: I&#39;ve installed THPS2 PC version using Lutris (on my steam deck), game runs fine, but hangar level has some sort of white noise in the background, like static. It starts after 10 sec or so of the level starting. The issue is from the sound effects, not the music, tried both sepparetly. I&#39;ve tried many suggested solutions (setting pulse latency variable, running compatibility with windows xp, etc), 2 weeks and nothing. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wolf_737\"> /u/Wolf_737 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1omx96o/tony_hawks_pro_skater_2_hangar_level_white/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1omx96o/tony_hawks_pro_skater_2_hangar_level_white/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Obligatory fuck windows out of the way, is there a way to monitor the pin amperage to make sure it doesn&#39;t get out of spec? Ideally, i&#39;m thinking of a systemd service that monitors the pins and shuts down immediately as soon as it gets out of range.</p> <p>Now I know that Asus&#39; software can read the pins, and also hwmonitor on windows, is there software that can do the same on linux? or better, in writing the service, can the kernel read the pins directly? Any docs you can point me towards? Probably going to go with cachyos if that narrows it down.
