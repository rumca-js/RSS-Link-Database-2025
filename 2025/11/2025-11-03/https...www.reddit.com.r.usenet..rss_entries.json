But now that I have radarr, sonarr, etc.. setup and trying to grab older shows and movies, just not getting what I thought with just subscribing to free torrents. Had read that maybe usenets would be better and would like to try that out. Am hoping you all could tell me what I can try and just do monthly for decent price to start and go from there? Maybe even free trial or something? Just testing waters and all.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/devtech8\"> /u/devtech8 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1on0ckd/looking_for_a_usenet_to_try/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1on0ckd/looking_for_a_usenet_to_try/\">[comments]</a></span>",
