I didn\u2019t know this prior to us dating but he did just voice to me that he doesn\u2019t think he can go forever without \ud83d\udc31. Which caused me to feel insecure bc obviously I\u2019m a cisgender male and I have a \ud83c\udf46 and I value monogamy\u2026 it\u2019s a non-negotiable/boundary for me to share my partner. My partner feels as if I\u2019m making him hide a part of himself bc I told him I\u2019m monogamous and I\u2019m not comfortable with him doing anything sexual with other people, man, woman, trans, or anyone else. He still craves \ud83d\udc31and I honestly dk what to do because I don\u2019t want to lose him bc I deeply love him\u2026 but I\u2019m also not comfortable with him sleeping with other ppl bc then ik that will cause me to resent him and cause me to feel uncomfortable. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ClimateNo1403\"> /u/ClimateNo1403 </a> <br/> <span><a h",

I&#39;m 27, autistic and just don&#39;t cope well in social situations. Being gay only complicates things further.</p> <p>I&#39;m really proud of the small goals I&#39;ve achieved recently. These may seem trivial to a lot of people but to me, they&#39;re huge and really want to share what I&#39;ve accomplished. </p> <p>1) I&#39;ve been getting out and engaging in hobbies that might force me into social encounters. 2) I handled some basic small talk with a guy I found attractive. 3) I&#39;ve been active online here in the forums.</p> <p>Well, that&#39;s it really. I understand that dating is still a long way off for me, but I&#39;m doing my best to get there.
