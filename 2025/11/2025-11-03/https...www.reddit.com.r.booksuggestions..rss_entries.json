I also prefer writers like Hemingway, Salinger, Raymond Carver, and Flaubert. They\u2019re quite popular among readers in my country.</p> <p>Contemporary English novelists, on the other hand, aren\u2019t as well known here, so I\u2019m really interested in exploring them and seeing what they\u2019re like.</p> <p>I read Homo Deus in an English lecture at college (maybe three years ago when I was a freshman), and since then I hadn\u2019t really touched any English books But recently I decided to take the plunge again.</p> <p>I finished Conversations with Friends by Sally Rooney. It really touched me and I kept nodding while reading, though the plot felt a bit thin. Now I\u2019m reading The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath, and it\u2019s honestly mesmerizing so far.</p> <p>",

However, the deeper I delved into this history, the more I began to wonder about the beginnings of transcontinental trade, its evolution, and its culmination in the United Provinces. Therefore, I&#39;d like to ask for a recommendation for a book (or several books) that attempt to explain this. I&#39;d particularly like to focus on books describing the Champagne fairs and the financial institutions and practices that arose there, as I see these as the origins of long-distance trade in Europe, as well as the dominance of the Italian republics of Genoa, Venice, and Florence and their innovations in banking and commerce.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Szo_n_n\"> /u/Szo_n_n </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1onbr18/books_ab",

Honestly, I thought it was just one of those overhyped self-help books people talk about for a week and move on.</p> <p>But recently, one of my friends told me he read it a few months ago and said it completely changed how he thinks about money and work. Now I\u2019m kind of curious \u2014 for those who\u2019ve actually read it, did it really make that much of a difference for you? Or is it more of a \u201cbasic finance for beginners\u201d kind of read?</p> <p>I\u2019m not against self-improvement books, but I prefer ones that are actually practical and not just motivational fluff.

It&#39;s not what I&#39;d normally read but it&#39;s clearly very readable, male-orientated, and has lots of original clever sollutions to problems. I know he also really likes John Grisham and Robert Galbraith novels. He doesn&#39;t like when you can quite easily guess what&#39;s coming. He actually did not enjoy The Martian so much. </p> <p>Because we have such different tastes I struggle to find him books as gifts - I prefer fantasy, literary fiction, and queer stories - so I&#39;m hoping someone out there can help!</p> <p>Please could you suggest which books he might like, based off the above whilst being careful not to spoil the plot of Project Hail Mary which, I cannot stress enough, I am only half way through! My dad is 77 years old, and loves walking and football (soccer) and he used to work with the police, if that helps. He is almost definitely autistic.</p> </di",
