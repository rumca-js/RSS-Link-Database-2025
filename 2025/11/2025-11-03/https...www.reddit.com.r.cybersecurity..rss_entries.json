In an attempt to switch it up I wanted to do something interactive and I was wondering if anyone knows of a service that does gamified cyber training? Ideally everyone could connect using their phones and interact with a video/dashboard and at the end it would show a leaderboard.

I am not talking about pre-screen and then interview; I mean straight up 2nd round technical or behavioral/cultural interview and have heard NOTHING afterwards. I obviously just chalk it up to being rejected, but you would think that they at least reach out to those they selected to be interviewed.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Techatronix\"> /u/Techatronix </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ondy3i/not_hearing_back_after_interview/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ondy3i/not_hearing_back_after_interview/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Is code itself considered \u201cdata\u201d under those rules?</p> <p>Also, if the codebase is hosted on a <strong>VM or repo managed outside the EEA</strong>, would that be a problem from a compliance standpoint, or is the key concern only about handling real production data?</p> <p>Has anyone run into this or gotten a clear answer from compliance/legal teams?</p> </div><!-",
