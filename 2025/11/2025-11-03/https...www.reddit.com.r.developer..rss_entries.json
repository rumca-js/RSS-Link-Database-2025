It combines <strong>Ecosia</strong> (for tree planting and sustainability), <strong>Google</strong>, and <strong>DuckDuckGo</strong> (for privacy).</p> <p>The idea started during a late-night study session when I realized how much energy and data our everyday browsing consumes. So I decided to build something lighter, faster, and greener \ud83c\udf0d</p> <p>Right now, I have a <strong>working Windows version</strong>, and I\u2019m looking for a few <strong>beta testers</strong> to try it out and share feedback , anything from usability to performance and design improvements.</p> <p>If you\u2019re into sustainable tech or just curious about alternative browsers, I\u2019d really appreciate your insights.</p> <p>Let\u2019s make browsing a bit better for the planet \ud83c\udf31</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/use",
