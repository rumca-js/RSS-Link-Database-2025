We all still have free will to get up and go outside and do as we please right?

I expected it to be super janky like those old morph filters, but it actually looked scary real. It blended both faces with proper lighting, bone structure, even little freckles and eye shapes that made sense genetically.</p> <p>What tripped me out is how fast it was. I uploaded two selfies and in like 20 seconds it gave me a baby photo that genuinely looked like something you\u2019d see in a family album. Even generated a future Polaroid photo of me, my partner and my baby that was super super realistic. </p> <p>Its wild how consumer AI has reached the point where even casual users can generate something that used to take a team of artists and render time.</p> <p>Anyway, it was equal parts wholesome and slightly eerie seeing \u201cour kid\u201d pop up like that. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gauravioli\"> /u/gauravi",
