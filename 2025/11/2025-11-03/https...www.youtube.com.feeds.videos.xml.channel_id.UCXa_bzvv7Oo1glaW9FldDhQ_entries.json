        "description": "If you haven't heard, ARC Raiders, Embark Studios' extraction shooter, is pretty awesome. Ironically, a new title in one of the most famously unforgiving genres probably shouldn't feel this welcoming and accessible, and yet, it manages all this without once feeling easy. \n\nFree Loadouts solve the issue of trying to scrounge up weapons, shields, and items for a new expedition, especially when you don't want to risk any hard-earned loot. But the twist is that you have no idea what you'll be getting, whether it's a seemingly innocuous Door Blocker or a zipline, never mind the weapons. Perhaps the best part is that if you extract successfully, all those items are yours, no extra charge, to do with as you please.",

        "description": "I\u2019m divided on Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection. As a long-time fan, it\u2019s genuinely great to experience these classics again on modern hardware and displays, complete with some thoughtful quality-of-life additions and nostalgic extras. But for players who\u2019ve spent the last decade exploring fighting games, I\u2019m not sure this collection offers much value.\n\nThe input lag issues and limited matchmaking options certainly don\u2019t help either. In the end, Legacy Kollection feels more like a collector\u2019s item, something to proudly preserve in your vault rather than a title you\u2019ll revisit often. For Mortal Kombat fans, it\u2019s a worthy trip down memory lane. For everyone else, there are far better fighting game options available today.",
