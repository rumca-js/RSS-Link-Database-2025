        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nThe co-founder and former lead writer for Rockstar Games had to explain why Grand Theft Auto will probably never be set in another country besides America (not counting that one PS1 expansion that was set in London). And it's probably for the reasons you can already think of: lots of guns, and American society is already pretty ridiculous on its own. In other news, Mike Pondsmith, creator of the Cyberpunk roleplaying game, knows how to get Johnny Silverhand back into Cyberpunk 2, he just needs Keanu Reeves to hit him up if Reeves wants to be in the new game. And finally, the formerly Xbox exclusive S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 is not only debuting on PlayStation soon, but it's leaving Game Pass, frustrating Xbox players who not only are paying more for the service, but now there's one less Triple-A game to play.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #GTA6",
