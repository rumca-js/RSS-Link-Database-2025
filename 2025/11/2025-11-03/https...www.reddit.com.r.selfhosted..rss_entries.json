However, due to no fault of anyone on this subreddit, NextCloud magically started running at login and took over my local address. Every time I access the local IP address, I can only access NextCloud login. Now Nextcloud is a mess of itself to mess with port, but SearXNG is easier to switch the ports. How do I switch the port, so I can still use the local IP address on any local device like 192.168.x.x:1234 or any other port instead of 80,4",

I&#39;ll get straight to the point. been running my homelab for a couple of months now an now I&#39;m facing the &quot;consequences&quot; of some decisions.</p> <p>My current setup is proxmox with several lxc containers, which most of them just run docker with containers related to a single service. Decided to run it this way because in the beginning I used a single LXC with all my containers and portainer to manage them, untill I had a problem that crashed the LXC container so I lost all the services (luckily it was the first day so no big problem), figured doing it each in a separated container would prevent such a big failure. </p> <p>The problem I&#39;m facing with this setup is to maintain the docker containers up to date. I know Watchtower does this, but in this context it would mean to run an instance in every LXC, and I feel there has to be a better option... except every search I&#39;m doing ends up in Watchtower.</p> </div><!-",

I wanted something that gave the flexibility of building your own backend with the convenience of a BaaS, but without depending on hosted services.</p> <p>Nuvix is built around PostgreSQL and offers features like authentication, storage, and messaging out of the box. It also supports different schema types, including one that automatically applies row-level security, so you can handle multi-tenant or user-isolated data easily.

I thought I had configured my email publishing correct, but then I didn&#39;t get an email for the latest alerts. I believe I have figured out what I did wrong the first time (I use gmail, and I do have a set up for apps to send email, using it in other applicarions. did follow the gmail suggestion in the docs. They say use port 465, I usually use 587. But I set 465, as directed). But what I don&#39;t see is a way to send a test email, to verify that I&#39;ve got the settings right, so I will get the email, the next time an alert actually does happen.</p> <p>Am I just missing that option somewhere?</p> <p>Thanks.

I also know you can use DDNS to automatically update the DNS record with your current IP address which is useful if you have a dynamic IP.</p> <p>With this method your IP is there for anyone to resolve which probably isn&#39;t a big deal if everything is secure, and wireguard is pretty secure from what I&#39;ve heard. But I was wondering whether it would be worth it (or even if its possible) to use cloudflares zero trust tunnels to hide your IP address?</p> <p>Just wanted some thoughts on this. I guess there are limitations with using cloudflare tunnels too, as you can&#39;t stream content over them according to their ToS. So yeah is it really that bad to just use your own IP and ignore tunnels?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=",
