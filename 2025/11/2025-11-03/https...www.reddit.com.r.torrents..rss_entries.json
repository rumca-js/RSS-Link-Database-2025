It has 12 episodes in total, and the full torrent size is over 12 GB.</p> <p>I only have the magnet link from The Pirate Bay \u2014 not the actual .torrent file. The issue is that it has very few seeders, so I can\u2019t download it directly. Normally, I use Seedr for low-seed torrents, but since my free limit there is only 3 GB, I can\u2019t add the full 12 GB magnet.</p> <p>So here\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do: I want to split the torrent and extract the info for just one episode, then turn that into a new .torrent file so I can upload it to Seedr and (hopefully) download that single episode.</p> <p>I\u2019ve found a few websites that let you view or edit torrent file info from a magnet link, but none seem to let you actually separate individual files and create a new torrent for just one of them.</p> <p>Is there any way to do this without a PC \u2014 maybe using an Android app or an online tool? Basically, ",
