        "description": "Nikki Birch | November 3, 2025\n\nOnce, at a concert, I overheard someone whisper that Emily King sounded just like her records, but better. With a nod, her friend replied, \u201cYeah! It\u2019s like getting hugged by a rose petal!\u201d As a longtime fan myself, I know this Tiny Desk will do the same for you. \n\nKing\u2019s silky tones reach new heights when her band members, each a master of their instrument, surprises the audience with beautiful voices of their own. On gutwrenching breakup songs like \u201cGeorgia\u201d and \u201cDown,\u201d they add dreamy harmonies. Despite singing of heartbreak, King\u2019s barely-contained excitement brightens the room between each tune. She remarks on the fun she\u2019s had playing with her band, and speaks about all the music that she and her long-time collaborator, Jeremy Most, have created together over the years.\n\nSometimes, as she tells us, the songs that King writes are intended to give herself a boost when she feels sad or discouraged. She leans into main character mode with her new year\u2019",
