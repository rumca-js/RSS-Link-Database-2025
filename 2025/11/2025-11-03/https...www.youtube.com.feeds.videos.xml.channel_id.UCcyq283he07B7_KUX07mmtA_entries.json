        "description": "The first episode of \"Well Spent,\" a vodcast by Business Insider, follows senior correspondents Katie Notopoulos and Emily Stewart as they investigate why Gen Z and Millennials are struggling to purchase a home, a hallmark of the American dream. \n\nFirst, they speak to real estate reporter James Rodriguez to discuss how home buying has significantly changed since the COVID-19 pandemic, how the 2008 recession impacted the supply of home in the US, and why boomers aren't selling their homes at the rate many expected. Though the picture looks bleak, and homes hit their highest average cost in in the US in June 2025, Zillow's trend expert Amanda Pendleton explains how some have made home buying a reality despite the headwinds, while explaining the mistakes she sees young buyers make most often.\n\n\"Well Spent\" is a video podcast about the business, technology, and culture of consumerism. The vodcast is hosted and produced by Katie Notopoulos, who is known for her curiosity and deep expertise",
