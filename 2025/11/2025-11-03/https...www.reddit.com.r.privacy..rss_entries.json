I knew hackers were a thing, but didn\u2019t know the real scale of this!</p> <p>Just today I saw an ad for Cape, a company trying to offer cell phone service that guarantees privacy. From there I discovered an article from Joseph Cox, a journalist at 404Media that says he hasn\u2019t even owned a cell phone since 2017.</p> <p>But in that article he talks about things like ISMI, IMEI, and MAID rotations to protect privacy. But I don\u2019t know what any of that is.</p> <p>Is there a guide or some sort of educational material out there on how phone privacy works, and what to do to keep yourself safe?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Plastic-Injury8856\"> /u/Plastic-Injury8856 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www",

Any way I can get them removed? Pimeyes offers a \u20ac38 subscription to help you get your images taken down, they say they have 80% success, has anyone tried it? Is it reliable? I mean I also saw you can just opt out on Pimeyes and I&#39;ll do that if there is no other solution, I just suppose there are other sites that do (or will do) the same thing so it&#39;s kinda useless until I manage to delete the images from all sites.</p> <p>Edit: thank you for your answers. If I understand correctly, there is no point in paying the subscription because there is no way I make them disappear completely. They can&#39;t be found with my name, but they can be found with my face, so I just asked Pimeyes to remove them. Are there",

I just watched a video on YouTube from Business Reform (a terrific channel related to privacy issues) about car insurance in the US. As you know there are many car insurers that offer lower rates if you put a tracker in your car via the OBD-II port. One insurer I recently called required me to install an app on my phone for them to provide coverage.</p> <p>I&#39;m sure at some point there will be a law that will require tracking via the OBD-II port or some other method. So what happens then? Do we all need to buy 1992 Toyota Corollas? For the privacy-conscious folks, when do we end up ditching our trackingmobiles, and how?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rlindsley\"> /u/rlindsley </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1omx8c6/cars_without_obdii_ports/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1omx8c6/cars_without_obdii_p",
