        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Something I&#39;ve come to realize is that I really like surprises in board games. Pandemic Legacy Season 1 and 2 (and sorta 0) were some of our best gaming experiences ever. Really loved all the twists and turns, both from the story and from the gameplay. Since then we&#39;ve played many more legacy games, including Aeon&#39;s End Legacy, Risk Legacy, Machi Koro Legacy, lots of Exit Games, and currently on Clank Legacy, and The Initiative. Have yet to start Arkham Horror The Card Game. Which others can you guys recommend? Especially ones with twists or surprises. Like, things hidden in the box is always fun, or secret things to open. So for me for example Aeon&#39;s End Legacy and Machi Koro Legacy didn&#39;t quite do it, though the gameplay was fun.</p> <p>What are some of your favorites that have a strong surprise element?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/cibum\"> /u/cibum </a> <br/> <span><a hre",

We found out there are two man-made expansions based on the 7WD existing ones and we want to try them out. Have any of you got any experience with printing out their own expansions since I want them on cardboard (as close to quality as the base game as it gets) and not on regular sheet of paper. Is the price close or even higher than the base game just for the print? Any help would be appreciated!

We&#39;ve been focusing mostly on the family favorites (Uno, Mexican Train, Flip7) but want more medium complexity games (Nemesis) and less super complex (Twilight Imperium). No social deduction games. We&#39;ve tried Lorcana tournaments, and the like, but again, we&#39;d rather play together all at once.

However, I havent been able to read any information on recent attendance.</p> <p>Here are three of the main things I&#39;ve read, a number of times, about Spiel Essen that have curbed my interest:</p> <ul> <li>You spend the majority of your time weaving through crowds and standing in lines.</li> <li>Most of the popular upcoming games are sold out before you get a chance to procure one.</li> <li>Most booths are so busy that it is unlikely you will be able to discover and learn about many games.</li> </ul> <p>What was your experience at FIJ?

There\u2019s a growing community here in the country, with around 600 people in the Facebook group, and it\u2019s starting to gain popularity in major cities. I live in one of the smaller cities, where we have a local group of about 16 members. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s a good idea to invest in this hobby, especially in Unmatched, for the long run. I\u2019d really love to join tournaments regularly. They\u2019re still pretty small where I live, but the scene seems to be growing fast. The game has already sold over a million copies worldwide, which seems like a good sign that it\u2019s here to stay.</p> <p>Edit: When I say \u201cinvestment,\u201d I don\u2019t mean earning anything back.

I have a group that I play with every so often so he knows of the game. If you know it you know it\u2019s a BEAST of a game. My group plays for 12 hours on average. The issue I have with this is that you need at least three players to play and a lot of patience. I taught him the gist of how to play. Last weekend we played Horrified with mom and brother and that was all right. Then we tried to learn Root, and that is another very sticky game where each faction plays completely different. A few hours ago we just got done playing Star Wars Outer Rim. He\u2019s seen it on my shelf and has asked to play. We didn\u2019t finish a full game because he was getting boarded which is fine. It is also a longer game. My issue is that I am trying to find a game that will really draw him in. </p> <p>Before I get bombarded with a list of games there are something\u2019s you need to know.
