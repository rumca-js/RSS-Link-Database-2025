According to the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey?platform=linux\">latest Steam hardware survey</a>, Linux has just over 3 percent of the market share of users who have Steam installed. It has almost certainly benefited from Valve\u2019s own Steam Deck, which derives its handheld SteamOS operating system from a Linux base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not quite as one-sided as you might think. \u201cSteamOS Holo\u201d is the most popular flavor of Linux among Steam users, claiming 27.18 percent of the Linux slice. (That\u2019s the latest version of the system on Steam Decks and exactly one other retail device at the time of writing, the <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2795080/sorry-windows-lenovos-legion-go-s-runs-better-with-steamos.html\">Lenovo ",
