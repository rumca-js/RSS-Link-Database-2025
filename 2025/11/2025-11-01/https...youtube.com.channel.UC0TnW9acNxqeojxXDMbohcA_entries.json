        "description": "Friendship is the most important thing nobody talks about. In this episode of The SOLVED Podcast, Drew and I dig into what makes friendships work, why they fall apart, and why so many of us are struggling to build or keep them as we get older. We\u2019re talking loneliness stats, Darwin\u2019s confusion about cooperation, and the deep emotional mechanics behind being a good friend\u2014and finding one.\n\nFrom ancient philosophy to game theory, we break down why friendship isn\u2019t just some social nicety\u2014it\u2019s a biological survival strategy. Plus: the modern forces slowly strangling our ability to connect, and exactly what to do about it. You\u2019ll walk away with a clearer sense of what real friendship looks like, how to build it, and how to stop shooting yourself in the foot every time you try.\n\nWe also put together a free companion guide for this episode with all the takeaways, references, and tools to help you get your sh*t together once and for all.
