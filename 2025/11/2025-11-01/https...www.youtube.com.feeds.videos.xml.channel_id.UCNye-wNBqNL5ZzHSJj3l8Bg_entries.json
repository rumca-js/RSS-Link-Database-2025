        "description": "In this special episode of The Listening Post, we examine the rise of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. A democratic socialist and outspoken critic of Israel\u2019s genocide in Gaza, Mamdani has faced a barrage of hostility from US mainstream media, the political donor class and the democratic establishment alike. The press has been particularly relentless, questioning not only Mamdani\u2019s progressive policies but also his identity as a Muslim and an immigrant.\n\nBut Mamdani is a digital native with an international following and a double-digit lead in the polls. His victory would reverberate far beyond New York City, shaking up the Democratic Party nationwide.\n\nThis episode exposes how the media and the wealthy political class attempted to discredit Mamdani and how, against all odds, he turned their attacks into the foundation of a movement.\n\nContributors:\nKate de Gruyter - Senior director of communications, Third Way\nAdam Johnson - Podcast co-host, Citations Needed\nBriahna Joy",
