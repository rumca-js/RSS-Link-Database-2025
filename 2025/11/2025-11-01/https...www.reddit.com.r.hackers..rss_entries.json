They later started messaging each other privately, and that person threatened that they could get John\u2019s IP address and personal details through Instagram.</p> <p>John got worried, but here\u2019s the thing: his account is private, has no profile photo, and no pictures or posts at all. I\u2019m a CS student, but I have very little knowledge about hacking, and he expected me to know the answer, so I\u2019m asking here.</p> <p>Is that threat realistic? What can someone actually get through Instagram in such cases, and what should John do to stay safe?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EijiUrashima\"> /u/EijiUrashima </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1olkivl/can_someone_ge",
