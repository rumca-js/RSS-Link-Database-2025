Some would even crash or not run at all. It turns out, that with pipewire they really don&#39;t like running to multichannel audio interfaces. It could be an issue with pulse, but pipewire is what I was using. I have a Behringer XR-18 that I use for recording as well as my computer&#39;s default audio output. The fix took me a while to find/figure out, but it&#39;s pretty simple. I have another audio output option on my monitor so I set that as the computer&#39;s audio output and used a program called qpwgraph to route the output from the monitor to the XR 18. Now any game that starts up sees the stereo output and doesn&#39;t freak out, but I can still use my audio setup like normal. I can also use qpwgraph to make sure all the inputs and outputs are routed properly between my DAW and mixer. Any GUI for pipewire should work though. Just tho",

I usually run them at 1080p in full-screen. But now the image is so big that it just shows a part of the game. This happens also when set it to 4k resolution. I only can play it on window mode. How could I probably fix it? I am running Fedora Silverblue 43 Gnome. It is weird because it was fine 1 day ago and all other games are fine too.</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/lavadora-grande\"> /u/",

There are small bumps every few ms which throw the Gsync off (TV menu VRR indicator seems to show that goes from 110 fps eg to 40 instantaneously ) so I have this subtle but really annoying soft flash in screen . </p> <p>I have also tried both Wayland and X11 and a bunch of environment variables. Is there anything I can do or that is the current situation with nvidia and DX12 games ? I think when running DX11 games this is no issue.</p> <p>Nvidia driver the latest and I haven&#39;t tried to install older ones ( just started with linux for gaming ) . Also I have tried most of the protons (through steam , proton-cachy , proton-GE latest , proton-GE 9.x etc).</p> <p>Some games I tried : Vampire B",
