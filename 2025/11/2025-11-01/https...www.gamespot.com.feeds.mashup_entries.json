It's similar to the situation back in May when Star Wars season replaced all the Fortnite guns with Star Wars blasters, but since The Simpsons is a sitcom and not a movie franchise about wars, Epic is going about things a little differently, by replacing most of the health and shield items with Simpsons food and drinks, while unvaulting a bunch of Fortnite weapons that have not been in the Battle Royale loot pool in a while.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But there <em>are </em>at least a couple of Simpsons-themed weapons, even so. To start the season, we'll have the Mr. Blasty revolver, with an exotic variant that drops from the roaming Krusty the Clown boss N",

But no collab takeover is truly complete without cosmetics, and Fortnite is adding tons of Simpsons skins and accessories both in the item shop and via the new Simpsons battle pass.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The Simpsons pass is a relatively short one, with about 70 tiers of rewards vs the usual 200 in the linear part of the pass--as has been the case with all previous mini-seasons. The Simpsons pass includes five skins--Homer, Marge, Ned Flanders, Blinky Fishstick, and Springfielder Peely--each of which has substantial style options, along with accompanying sets of pickaxes, gliders, emotes, and so on. The new Peely is the bonus skin that'll become available starting November",

That's because it's the first of them to take place on a completely new and original island. While the other November mini-seasons took place on updated versions of old maps, and Star Wars season just added Star Wars places to the Battle Royale map, Simpsons season is introducing a totally new, cel-shaded island based on Springfield and various iconic locations from the series for us to fight over in November.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">At least one sacrifice was made to make this map happen. This island is a little bit smaller than the current Battle Royale map, and as a result, it uses a smaller player cap than usual at 80 players instead of 100. But that's not necessarily the worst thing, as the smaller island should mean faster and more excit",
