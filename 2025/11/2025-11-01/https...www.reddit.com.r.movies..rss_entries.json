It\u2019s such a fun, compelling adventure film. The Special Effects I feel still hold up, and the Big Action Pieces are great to watch. What I also found with this film is that I feels a little more grounded than the sequels, which I feel dial it up but I like 2 and 3, 4 is okay, 5, I just didn\u2019t like.</p> <p>The Cast is great. Johnny Depp really does steal the show as Jack Sparrow and I feel he is at his best with the character in the 1st film. In the 1st film, Jack is a master manipulator who excels at improving his strategy when things go sideways and you can never really tell if he is a joke or if he\u2019s serious. He is unpredictable, he is charismatic, He is just fun to watch. Geoffrey Rush is also great as Barbossa and makes for a great villain and his banter with Depp ",

There are some classics in here that I have never seen before and there are some classics that I have seen as an 8 year old but never again since, as well as some modern movies that I have read about. My goal was to close some gaps AND get some new era horror in. Rating scale is not relative to horror but to movies in general. No spoilers. Here\u2019s how that went:</p> <ol> <li><p>Hitcher (1986) Believe it or not: never seen this. I was expecting some creepy slow paced road movie. Oh boy was i ever wrong. I really enjoyed it. But it was almost more of a terminator vibe than anything else. 7.5/10. This could go up to a 9/10 if it keeps staying in my head like it did those past few weeks. Greatly recommended.</p></li> <li><p>Final destination bloodlines (2025) Fun all around. Enter",
