I messed up and bought the wrong modem/router/hotspot thingy and now i cant fully set up my security cameras. </p> <p>I have a wifi security cam with solar panels but it needs wifi to connect. I have a usmobile sim for a hotspot already. The cam does not have a sim slot, it is wifi only. I bought a Netgear Lm1200 lte modem. It does not transmit wifi like i thought it would. </p> <p>Is there anyway i could add wifi to the modem with what i have available? </p> <p>I scrounged around camp and found:</p> <p>Netgear lm1200, Alcatel linkzone locked tmobile, lg Aristo locked metro</p> <p>Unlocking the Alcatel seems like the best bet.
