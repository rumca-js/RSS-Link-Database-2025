I\u2019m now looking for a <strong>developer who\u2019d be interested in collaborating</strong> to build out the backend and bring the full version to life.</p> <p>It\u2019s still an early-stage project, so the <strong>payment will be in the form of ESOPs (equity shares)</strong> rather than upfront cash or milestone-based payments. I just want to be upfront about that \u2014 this is more of a <strong>collaboration opportunity</strong> than a freelance gig.</p> <p>If you enjoy building meaningful products from the ground up and would like to know more, feel free to <strong>DM me</strong>. I\u2019ll share the project details and we can see if it\u2019s a good fit!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Forsaken_Desk412\"> /u/Forsaken_Desk412 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/deve",
