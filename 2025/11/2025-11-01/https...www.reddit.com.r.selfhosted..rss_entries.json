With my smartphone it works. I tried vlc and kodi as external player but when i hit play in jellyfin nothing happens. I tried the version 0.16 but it doesnt login when i enter my password. Do you have any ideas? I tried to force transcoding by using a lower Bitrate. But it Soest make any difference. When i have a look at my server transcoding works fine and it creates a healthy buffer.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ninjiens\"> /u/ninjiens </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1olw6kq/need_help_jellyfin_on_fire_tv_doesnt_work/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.redd",
