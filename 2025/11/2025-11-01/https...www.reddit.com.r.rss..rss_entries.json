(On 1 November 1954, Pondicherry and the other French settlements in India were transferred to the Indian Union. To celebrate the occasion, the flag with Mother\u2019s symbol at its centre was hoisted at the Ashram at 6.20 a.m., when the Mother read out the following message.)</p> <p>&quot;For us the 1st November has a deep significance. We have a flag which Sri Aurobindo called the Spiritual Flag of United India. Its square form, its colour and every detail of its design have a symbolic meaning. It was hoisted on the 15th August 1947 when India became free. It will now be hoisted on the 1st November 1954 when these settlements get united with India and it will be hoisted in the future whenever India recovers other parts of herself. United India has a special mission to fulfil in the world. Sri Aurobindo laid down his life for it and we are prepared to do the same.&quot; 1 November 1954 (The Mother, CWM, 13: 354)</p",
