        "description": "Escape from Tarkov \u2013 Battlestate Games\u2019 ruthlessly realistic extraction shooting pioneer - is finally reaching its full version release on November 15th. Mythologised and feared in equal measure, Tarkov veterans have endured the shooter\u2019s suffering combat since the beta launched back in 2017. \n\nSince then, countless extraction-based shooters have emerged; many taking cues from Tarkov\u2019s blueprint \u2013 ARC Raiders, Arena Breakout: Infinite, and Marathon are each having their moment, good or bad. The questions now are: is Escape from Tarkov coming too late to dominate the space it created? \n\nWill the brutality in its 1.0 version entice, and retain, newcomers? Will veteran players\u2019 devotion last beyond the final version\u2019s release? Even with an increase in competition, Escape from Tarkov still offers a unique experience. It\u2019s now down to Battlestate to reward player loyalty; to prove their suffering has been worth it all along.",

        "description": "For a genre with such a simple purpose, laden with layers of complexity, ARC Raiders offers perhaps the most refined approach seen yet. It's brimming with personality, as evidenced in its presentation and incredible music, but never threatens to overpower the extraction gameplay and topside tension. \n\nApproachable yet complex; forgiving yet just as unrelenting if you so choose, it's one of the most enjoyable multiplayer shooters in years.",
