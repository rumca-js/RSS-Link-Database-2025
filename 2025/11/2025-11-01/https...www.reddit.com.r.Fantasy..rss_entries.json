Not romantasy per se - I enjoy that style when done well, but this question is about finding fantasy where the world and plot are as important as the romance, or the romance is a secondary element (and slow burn), rather than the primary driver. Books/series I&#39;ve loved that nailed the balance for me are Finnikin of the Rock (Lumatere Chronicles) by Melina Marchetta, Graceling by Kristin Cashore, The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms by N.K. Jemisin, The Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Laini Taylor (LOVE her work so much), and Six of Crows/Crooked Kingdom by Leigh Bardugo. Any recommendations much appreciated!

The books are also pretty short but they aren\u2019t kids books. The first book was about a girl who had been turned into a vampire and she can turn into a tiger or something. And I think the vampires had tattoos of the animals they can turn into. One of the later books has a witch falling for a vampire. The witch gets hurt and than turned into a vampire so now she\u2019s a vampire witch. Another book was the in world author having written the previous books and somehow the characters from the books were actually real and than she gets turned into a vampire.</p> <p>It\u2019s confusing for me to explain.
