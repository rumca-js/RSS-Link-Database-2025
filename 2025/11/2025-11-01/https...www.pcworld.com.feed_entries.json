In fact, it\u2019s small enough that this \u201cremovable\u201d drive shouldn\u2019t have to be removed, the company said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially, SanDisk will launch the drive next Tuesday, and a representative appearing at the 2025 Pepcom Holiday Spectacular didn\u2019t identify the model name. The company previously introduced what it called the world\u2019s smallest USB flash drive at CES 2018, called the Ultra Fit. At that show, it shipped with a USB-A connector but also showed off a prototype USB-C device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any event, the new USB drive sits perpendicular to the connector, in a change from other USB flash drives of the past.
