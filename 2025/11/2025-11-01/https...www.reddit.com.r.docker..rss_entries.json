After researching my options, I narrowed it down to three potential solutions: Docker Secrets (via Swarm mode) for built-in encryption, Infisical, and HashiCorp Vault.</p> <p>After experimenting with Docker Secrets in Swarm mode and Infisical, I discovered a key limitation with Docker Secrets: not all environment variables can be used as secrets. This depends heavily on whether the image developer added support for them.
