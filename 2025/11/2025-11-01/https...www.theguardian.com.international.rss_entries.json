But it\u2019s easy to stand by your man when victory is in sight. A more significant rendition came at nil-nil, when the pressure was still firmly on and Dominik Szoboszlai had just squandered a glorious chance to punish the kind of lackadaisical defending that would ultimately prove Aston Villa\u2019s downfall.

It is a brilliant pan. As I turn on the heat to crisp the skin on my chicken thighs on the stove top, I can prep the vegetables I will then roast in the same pan. There is a soothing rhythm to this type of cooking, where most of the work is done in the oven. Here, I use jerusalem artichokes, the most delicious of autumn vegetables, parboiled in lemon juice to make them more digestible and then roasted with garlic and onions, until beautifully caramelised, and it\u2019s a marvellous thing to put down on the kitchen table.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/nov/01/crispy-chicken-pancetta-nutty-apple-salad-recipes-thomasina-miers\">Continue reading...</a>",
