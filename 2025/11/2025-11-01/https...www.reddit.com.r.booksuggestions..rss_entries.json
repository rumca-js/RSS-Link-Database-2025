I think the reason i don&#39;t like him is because his dialogue and characters sounds like rick and morty without the comedy and sitcom aspect. Like i guess he was very influential, but that leaves his work like bones picked by vultures. Likewise i like hp lovecraft and murakami who can be considered similar. It seems they&#39;re more literary, while PKD feels like a rick and morty screenplay without the sitcom warmth, or the comedy. And not great drama. Am i wrong? For his time very influential, but now that his influence has disseminated, seems he&#39;s not very good. From what i&#39;ve read, i also prefer jack vance and gene wolfe. Pkd feels like watching 5th element, which i thought was a bad movie if not for the blockbuster graphics. Right now for instance, chapter 4 of flow my tears, its like 60 pages of dialogue between a guy and girl which isn&#39;t great and basic sci fi. Seems like hes not worth reading anymore, but of course,",

However, I\u2019m not that well educated on poetry (especially from english-speaking poets) and I\u2019m really looking forward to discover more about it and acquire knowledge like vocabulary or else to improve my poems, essays, have better and more original examples (I study literature), and maybe, who knows, to find a poem or an author who will affect me deeply/to whom I will relate. I already know many great english-speaking poets (Thoreau, Plath, Poe,\u2026) but I almost haven\u2019t read any of their works except for Annabel Lee by Edgar Poe which I loved. Hence, I\u2019m searching for an anthology which could make me discover various poets without having to read an enormous list of books because I don\u2019t have a lot of time, and if possible, I would like this anthology not to be too hard because I have quite a good level in English but it is still mediocre and I aspire for so much better but I fear beginning by r",

I have read very few books in my life cuz I prefer manga, but I want to try something new. I was thinking something shorter this time like &quot;I am a legend&quot; (I also watched a movie few years back). My issue is that I also dissociate sometimes while reading idk why, maybe bad attention span. I also have &quot;The Darkness That Comes Before&quot; but will not start reading it untill I finish some other book first since I do not want to leave just that one unfinished cuz it seems too cool. </p> <p>Anyways, some of my favourtite peaces of fictions are: Attack on Titan, Vinland Saga, Game of Thrones, Sopranos, Dark Souls</p> <p>English is not my native but I would say I am pretty decent at it (especially reading)</p> </div><!-- SC_",

I\u2019ve looked up countless searches trying to find similar books and haven\u2019t found anything that has stuck with me the way that one has. It was a smaller book but it meant the world to me. I\u2019m looking for something a lot like it. I love the \u201cbeauty and the beast\u201d, darker love kind of trope, especially set in highschool, I do still have a young heart after all :,). I prefer when it works out in the end and has sweet, building romance. I like the darker aspects of a crush, but I also enjoy lighter recs too! Some of the other books I\u2019ve read and enjoyed were \u201cWhen it happens\u201d by Susane Colasanti, \u201cCrazy Messy Beautiful\u201d by Carrie Arcos, and \u201cWhat Light\u201d by Jay Asher.

They&#39;re just sitting there, mocking me.</p> <p>Here&#39;s what happens: I pick up a book (physical or digital), and immediately this voice in my head goes, &quot;Why are you wasting time on a romance novel or some melancholic story? If you&#39;re going to read ANYTHING, shouldn&#39;t it be your textbooks? Something productive?&quot;</p> <p>And then... I don&#39;t read the novel. I don&#39;t read the textbooks either. I just end up scrolling on my phone for hours instead.</p> <p>I&#39;m stuck in this weird reading slump where I&#39;m guilting myself out of reading for pleasure, but that guilt isn&#39;t actually motivating me to do anythin",

Which I think is just the genre. Anyways, I don&#39;t really know which books are considered lit fit classics. I want to make a list to read through of staple lit fic books + underrated ones. I&#39;d love to hear which ones you think everyone should read *and* titles you love that aren&#39;t super popular.
