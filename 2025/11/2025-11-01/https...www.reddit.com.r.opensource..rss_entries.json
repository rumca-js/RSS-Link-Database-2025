We&#39;re excited to share that LyteNyte Grid, our high-performance React data grid, is now available directly via the shadcn/ui registry. </p> <h1>Fast shadcn/ui Setup, Simple Integration</h1> <p>LyteNyte Grid is a headless (or pre-styled) React data grid compatible with Tailwind. It\u2019s designed for flexibility and massive scale. We&#39;ve added native themes for shadcn/ui (both light and dark), using shadcn/ui&#39;s own Tailwind token system. For developers, that means:</p> <ul> <li>No extra styling layers to manage.</li> <li>If you update your theme tokens, the grid updates automatically.</li> <li>It looks and feels like a natural extension of your shadcn/ui app.</li> </ul> <p>You can install it using the standard shadcn/ui command and get up and running in minutes.
