        "description": "Serial killer Joel Rifkin murdered at least 17 women, many of whom sex workers, between 1989 and 1993. But even as the victims' remains turned up, police never made the connection that it was the work of a single serial killer. However, thanks to a simple traffic stop gone wrong, Rifkin was caught and confessed his crimes. In the latest \"New York Gritty,\" host Sal Bono speaks with those who investigated the case, a college buddy of Rifkin, and Inside Edition Weekend anchor Mary Calvi, who was one of the first journalists to interview the killer behind bars.",

For years, we've been told that being active and maintaining a healthy weight actually lowers cancer risk. But a new study shows long distance running could be linked to colon cancer.
