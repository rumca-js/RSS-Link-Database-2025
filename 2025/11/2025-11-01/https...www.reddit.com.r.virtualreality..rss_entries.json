Even those that are supposed to be flat, and should stay like that.</p> <p>I immediately noticed that in the game&#39;s thumbnails. Untill yesterday they were all flat images, while today they become stereoscopic. The effect is correct and coherent, but this sort of automated stereoscopic conversion of flat surfaces is happening everywhere, even in games, in surfaces where this isn&#39;t supposed to happen (a poster on a wall, a drawing on a car&#39;s door etc).</p> <p>Is anyone else experiencing this? Is my Quest simply acting weird or is this some kind of new feature that Meta rolled out without saying?
