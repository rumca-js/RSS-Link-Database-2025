Should I pursue this, I will no longer have a PC case that can host 3.5&quot; HDDs, and will need a new solution to house some.</p> <p>I really only need an HDD enclosure for basic data backup/DAS use, and would prefer a simple a 2-bay setup that would suffice for occasional powered-on use (maybe once per month). The Unitek S1308A01-US caught my eye as a possible choice, as it&#39;s affordable and has a cooling fan. Another similar unit that caught my eye was the Maiwo K35262C.</p> <p>Anyone have experience w/either of these units, and is it realistic to expect an OK 2-dock unit at the $60-70 price point? I&#39;d be ok going a little higher for something better if I really should, but I&#39;m hoping to avoid having to drop something like $200 on a unit ai",
