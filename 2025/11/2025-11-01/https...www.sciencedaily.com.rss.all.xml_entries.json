By turning off a circadian protein in mice, they raised NAD+ levels and reduced harmful tau buildup. The findings suggest that adjusting the body\u2019s clock may one day help prevent neurodegeneration.",

        "description": "New research from Australia overturns the old idea that exercise \u201cuses up\u201d heartbeats. It shows that fitter people actually use fewer total heartbeats each day thanks to their lower resting heart rates, even when accounting for workouts. Athletes\u2019 hearts beat around 10% less daily, saving over 11,000 beats per day compared to sedentary people. This efficiency not only signals cardiovascular fitness but also translates to longer life expectancy and lower disease risk.",

These proteins revealed both sex and subtle genetic differences among fossils, suggesting Paranthropus might not have been one species but a more complex evolutionary mix.",
