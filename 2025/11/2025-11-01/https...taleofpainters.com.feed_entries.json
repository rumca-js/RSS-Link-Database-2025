        "description": "<p>The fourth wave of Duncan Rhode\u2019s Two Thin Coats paints brings 30 new colours \u2013 but this time, everything\u2019s gone grimdark. Dark Arts is the name of the new expansion, and it does quite a few things differently from the regular Two Thin Coats paints. In this video review, I\u2019ll be testing the new acrylics, metallics, and inks, explaining the differences and similarities, and comparing them with The Army Painter\u2019s equally grimdark John Blanche Masterclass paints.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/11/review-dark-arts-paint-set-by-two-thin-coats/\">Review: Dark Arts paint set by Two Thin Coats</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
