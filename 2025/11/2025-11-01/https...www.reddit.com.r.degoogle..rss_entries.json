Within the last week Google has decided that 2 of my business emails that are tied to websites I&#39;ve created have somehow violated there policies. One of which they denied the appeal so I&#39;ve lost hundreds of dollars tied to that email. They aren&#39;t used for anything besides logging into the website hosting. Has anyone else recently had this happen? I&#39;m seriously considering removing all of my 15 accounts from Google seeing as how I don&#39;t know what is safe and unsafe. Can anyone tell me what policies I could have violated??</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Royal_Sir1603\"> /u/Royal_Sir1603 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1olf4k1/gmail_policies_violated/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/degoogle/comments/1olf4k1/gmail_policies_violated/\">[comments]</a></spa",
