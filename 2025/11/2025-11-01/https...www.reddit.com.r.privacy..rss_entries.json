I know cell towers give pretty close approximate location but I\u2019m talking about all the other stuff that my iPhone collects. Obviously a dumb phone collects less stuff. But how much less? Would it be worth it? Like if I just use my iPhone like an iPod in airplane mode with no cell service, download music onto in from my home network etc. would it be possible to drastically reduce the information collected? And how to best do that (I know the clear answer is don\u2019t use a phone, but wondering if there\u2019s a way to keep some of the good stuff about having a phone but lose some of the bad stuff? Sort of a thought experiment but also a genuine question.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/N0b0dy5pecial\"> /u/N0b0dy5pecial </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1olis8q/flip_phones/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre",
