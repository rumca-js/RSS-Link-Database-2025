Andrew has always denied wrongdoing.\n \nAt least four Democrat members of the House Oversight Committee have since renewed their calls for Andrew to testify - although the panel is controlled by Republicans, who have not indicated they would support the move.\n \nMeanwhile, it is understood that Andrew will not have to Royal Lodge immediately and could move to Sandringham as late as the new year.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",
