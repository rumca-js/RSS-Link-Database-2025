It&#39;s called <strong>bonus arbitrage</strong>.</p> <p>In short, some companies spend so much on customer acquisition that they sometimes make mistakes or overpay, and you can profit from it. You&#39;re simply capitalizing on that inefficiency.</p> <p><strong>Here&#39;s a great example that takes 5 minutes (or less):</strong></p> <p>SoFi (the fintech company) pays platforms $75 to find them a new user who creates an account and makes a deposit, and they <strong>only</strong> require a $25 deposit to qualify.</p> <p>So you deposit $25, and they pay you $75. That&#39;s all. Takes about 3-4 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p> <ol> <li> Sign up: <a href=\"https://gemsloot.com/?aff=shg\"><strong>Gemsloot</strong></a> <em>(this is the platform we use for arbitrage)</em></li> <li> Search &quot;SoFi Invest&",
