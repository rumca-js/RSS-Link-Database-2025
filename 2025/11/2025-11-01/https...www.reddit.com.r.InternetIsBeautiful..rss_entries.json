Either they are too expensive or look too corporate and bland.</p> <p>I also felt like on top of habit tracking, it&#39;s important to know how much \u201cdeep work\u201d I&#39;m doing on a daily basis, because that&#39;s ultimately the marker that actually moves me closer to my goals.</p> <p>So I built an app to do just that. Tell me if I wasted my time or if this is too similar to what&#39;s already out there. I appreciate all feedback, good and bad.</p> <p>So far it&#39;s helped me a lot, I mean I&#39;m at least 10x more consistent when I&#39;m using the app, and it&#39;s really satisfying to increase my stats on the app. Tell me what you think.
