There are so many books I want to read, so many I want to read again, and so many that come out every year. I&#39;ll never have enough time. IF I read a book a week for the rest of my life, I&#39;ll have approximately enough time to read 1,500 books. </p> <p>And I find myself thinking, how is 1,500 enough?

Its not bad advice but after a while it all feels the same.</p> <p>One that actually felt a bit different to me was The Elite\u2019s Wealth Secrets by Robert Bluestein. It talks more about how people at the top think about time, risk, and control instead of just repeating tips. It made me realize how much of wealth comes down to how you think about things and not just how much you work.</p> <p>It made me curious though.

I have really loved these characters and have used them as sort of touch stones growing up, but now that I&#39;ve almost finished with school myself I am starting to feel a disconnect. I feel like I need to find similar characters but who are in late 20s/30s girl. Sally Rooney is sort of close to this except her characters are just a bit too ultimately unlikeable.
