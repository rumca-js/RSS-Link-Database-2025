To better understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated with deception and roleplay: s",

We have heard a lot about all the things AI will be able to do and all the jobs it will displace but little speculation about what it will not be able to do. Anyone who has produced AI images knows even the most powerful models can produce images that humans can recognize on first glance to be flawed. I have encountered this with a specialized thumbnail generation model and popular image models like Flux and SDXL. With the music AI musicgpt I have produced some bangers and some not so bangers by accident. Producing the patterns of a hit and be able to hear the music are different things.</p> <p>AI does not have perception and it may never have perception. It has pattern recognition as a substitute in my opinion. I am not sure that AI will ever be able to develop perception the way humans can. Name so",

LLMs are very impressive and can feel intelligent but it&#39;s far from being the case. They can&#39;t evolve while answering to people, they&#39;re static models which are trained and shipped to customers. </p> <p>I think something very important models are missing currently is true long-term memory. Not some piece of paper on which they write information but something directly incorporated in the model which influences its answers and actions. My understanding of models is very lacking but what convinced me of that is by thinking of how humans work. We can think &quot;Last time I did this action and it hurt me so I won&#39;t do it again&quot; the first few times after doing that action, but then it becomes instinctive. We don&#39;t receive that information each time so we don&#39;t forget it, it&#39;s deeply present in our thinking and how we&",
