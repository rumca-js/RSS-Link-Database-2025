Our 6 yo is getting into boardgames and I think this will be a nice one to have in rotation for her too because it&#39;s more tactical than her current fave, Sushi Go Party, but a similar art style too.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been pondering about how an increasing number of games are being made with modular expansions, or &quot;plug-in&quot; systems, allowing you to take different parts and mix and match for every play. Personally, I&#39;m a fan of this approach. It helps a game feel fresh and allows players to customize their play probabilities. But at the same, time I somewhat wonder how much thought has gone into the combinations. Some combinations seem like they could be mechanically incompatible, or overly tip the balance of the game. So I&#39;m curious, how does everyone feel about modules? Do you enjoy games that offer a lot of mix and match content, or do you prefer when designers concentrate on simply creating a single experience that is well thought out?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/elkend\"> /u/elkend </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1op6tz7/how_do_you_feel_ab",
