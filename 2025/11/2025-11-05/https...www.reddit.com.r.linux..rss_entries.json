Its made for noobs to avoid terminal configuration that are not easy to understand (including TUI). Its not made to replace some integrated network manager from some distro, just made for distro that don&#39;t have integrated GUI manager. But it also include a CLI mode, made for easy connection (and interaction with connex).<br/> It also have a tray mode (integration with waybar)its very similar to nm-applet for ppl wondering.</p> <p>I&#39;ve added some new features (and fix some bugs):<br/> - An integrated speedtest<br/> - Shortcuts for easy navigation<br/> - Airplane mode (shut off the wifi)<br/> - Added some animation</p> <p>Now im wondering if I should make like a configuration file (colors of the window, on/off animation, ...) If you have any suggestion its welcomed !</p> <p>Here is the link: <a href=\"https://github.com/Lluciocc/conn",
