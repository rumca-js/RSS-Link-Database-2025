This will be the 30th UN climate summit, known as Cop30. It marks ten years since the negotiation of the Paris agreement (a global agreement to keep temperature rise to well below 2\u00b0C, and as close to 1.5\u00b0C as possible). For the first time, this global summit is being held in the Amazon, the largest rainforest ecosystem in the world.",

Similar arrangements exist around the world, often called \"sugar-daddy\" relationships, but the South African version is closely tied to extreme inequality, youth unemployment, and a culture in which conspicuous consumption carries strong social currency. As a result, \"blesser\" has become a mainstream, even aspirational term among some young women, particularly in urban settings.",

        "description": "When wars, pandemics, and trade disruptions shake global markets, one question becomes urgent for every nation: can we feed ourselves? A new study from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem offers an answer\u2014and a warning. According to researchers Prof. Iddo Kan, Prof. Israel Finkelshtain, Ph.D. student Yehuda Slater, and Prof. Aron M. Troen, achieving full food self-sufficiency in Israel is technically possible\u2014but only for plant-based foods intended for human consumption, not for livestock feed. In other words, during a severe import blockade, Israel's food system could sustain a vegetarian population, but not maintain its current levels of animal-based production.",
