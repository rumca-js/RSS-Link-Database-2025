Sadly that would mean no profit money from selling data, but that\u2019s kinda what I want. </p> <p>I\u2019m gonna be straightforward and say that there is no money in it in the short term.

I don\u2019t want to give everything out on this post (I don\u2019t want meta to steal my ideas), but if someone wants to work with me, or give me some advise or words of encouragement I would be grateful.</p> <p>Than",
