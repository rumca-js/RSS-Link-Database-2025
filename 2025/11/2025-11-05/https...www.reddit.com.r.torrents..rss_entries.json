I never switched the torrent client, I did 2 or 3 upgrades to the Seeding HDD but managed to retain the torrents &amp; their metadata.</p> <p>If you calculate the data uploaded it&#39;s of course nothing compared to other posts we see here but the longevity and the fact I am the only one in the world (8.2 billion people btw) keeping this media alive makes me feel good. I think it&#39;s important to keep seeding stuff for public trackers, not everyone has access to private trackers or wants to make that step</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/aside24\"> /u/aside24 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/1oox9lz/one_of_my_torrents_just_turned_10_years_old/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"",
