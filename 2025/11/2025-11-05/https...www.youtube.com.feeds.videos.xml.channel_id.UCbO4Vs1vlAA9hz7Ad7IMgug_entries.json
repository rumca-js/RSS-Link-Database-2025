        "description": "We're back with The Indie Hour Episode Forty-Four! This series focuses on games you may have never even heard of and gives us an inside look at the wider world of independantly published Tabletop Wargames of all genres.\n\nWho doesn't love a plucky band of space-smugglers taking jobs, carving out a dubiously ethical and sometimes \"doing a little good to do a little bad\" life on the edge of space? Morgue Stars is a procedurally generated Stats-light but story-heavy card and dice driven game. Let's dive in!\n\nCheck out the Rulebook HERE: https://www.wargamevault.com/en/product/509751/morgue-stars-2nd-edition?affiliate_id=210041",
