(Okay, affordable is a relative metric \u2014 it\u2019s been harder to find a significantly discounted one.) Things are finally starting to settle back down, though. Take this AOC Agon monitor as an example: Today it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D682HF6R?th=1\">going for just $449.99 on Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Agon AG276QZD2\u00a0is hitting at about the baseline for a current OLED, with the familiar 27-inch, 2560\u00d71440 panel and 240Hz refresh rate, a definite upgrade over lower-priced monitors just a year ago. That\u2019s fast enough to handle the twitchy gameplay of online shooters like <em>Counter-Strike </em>and <em>Valorant</em>, while still delivering the gorgeous colors and perfect contrast that make OLED so desirable.
