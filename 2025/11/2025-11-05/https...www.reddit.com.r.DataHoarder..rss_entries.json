HBAs are generally built to run in racks of hot servers 24/7/365 and be rock solid. Consumer PCIe sata cards.... aren&#39;t. </p> <p>I&#39;m curious tho, to the best of my knowledge they both do the same thing, pass x number of sata ports to the pcie bus. What is an HBA doing that it generates SO much heat even at idle compared to it&#39;s cheaper consumer cousin with the same number of ports? I have a little HBA here that sitting idle with no drives connected gets so hot I almost can&#39;t touch it. Normally electronic things heat up proportional to the work they are doing and electricity they are using. Very generally speaking.</p> <p>Should I be concerned that cheap PCIe sata cards don&#39;t have a heatsink or fan? Is there anything in between the two? Something built to a higher consumer standard with a fan maybe made by asus or msi or something? Or do they just go from cheap no n",

I did it to bump r/w to 1gb/s and since it&#39;s 90% steam downloads, I wasn&#39;t concerned if one failed and I had to dl it all again. </p> <p>That was 5yr ago and they&#39;ve been great, but I&#39;m past the tbw and warranty and want to replace them with 2 4tb drives in the same config. </p> <p>I found the below on Amazon, and the kingspec site lists their tbw at 1920 (which would suggest they&#39;re tlc), and while Amazon gives good reviews, Newegg is less so.</p> <p><a href=\"https://a.co/d/2rGCQE8\">https://a.co/d/2rGCQE8</a></p> <p>So, has anyone actually looked into these to see if they&#39;re legit, or does anyone know a quality 4tb 2.5&quot; tlc ssd I should go for instead? </p> <p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: they aren&#39;t past tbw, but close (1200 total nand and tbw is 1600)",
