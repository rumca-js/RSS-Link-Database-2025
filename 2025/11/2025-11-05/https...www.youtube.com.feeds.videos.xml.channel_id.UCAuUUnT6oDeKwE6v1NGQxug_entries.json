        "description": "Before algorithms ruled our feeds, the internet was a mess \u2014 glitchy, chaotic and full of unexpected magic. Internet culture writer Michael Sun reflects on the wild digital world of the 2000s \u2014 and makes a funny, wry case for why we need to reclaim its spontaneity, weirdness and genuine connection.
