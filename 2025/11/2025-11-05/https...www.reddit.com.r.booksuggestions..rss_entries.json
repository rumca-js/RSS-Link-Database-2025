We just finished reading all Riordanverse books we could find a few months ago, and currently I can&#39;t find anything that can hold my attention for too long. Specifically I&#39;m looking for any YA or teen novels/series with fantasy or something supernatural as my sister is getting more into things like that. It can also have romance, but more as an undertone, nothing too major, and we&#39;re okay with LGBTQ+ romance as well (which might be obvious considering we just finished reading Magnus Chase, I mean). Also my sister has been reading this webtoon Jackson&#39;s diary that features genres like highschool and supernatural so if anyone has any books similar to that it would be great.</p> <p>Thank you all for reading and for help :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/H",

I\u2019m putting together a reading challenge for next year \u2014 50 books across literature, science, philosophy, history, and more. I want to explore ideas that expand how I see the world and hear from diverse voices and perspectives. What\u2019s a book that truly changed how you think or understand life? I\u2019d love your recommendations, fiction or nonfiction!</p> <p>I\u2019ll be honest with you guys, I didn\u2019t really enjoy reading. I have only ignited this interest after finishing Brave New World. So maybe some more classic literature book suggestions will help but I would also enjoy anything else. Also, I know 50 books is ambitious (maybe, not sure if this is average or not) but I wanted to take this challenge. So please help me! I do really want to emphasize that I want to read books from different voices, perspectives, time period., etc.! So if you can, suggest a variety of books!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.re",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I\u2019ve been in a reading slump for years. Barely gotten back to it recently and I\u2019ve been reading fantasies only (since I started TOG). I\u2019m personally such a sucker for a seriously passionate story line that\u2019s filled with crazy chemistry &amp; die hard love, but I\u2019ve never read a good romance book (according to me). I don\u2019t want to read anything that\u2019s nothing but sex (like fifty shades of grey) but something that\u2019ll have me climaxing just based off how much the guy is yearning for his woman. In short, I just want to be blown away by an intense love story to where I am beyond glued to the pages. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Necessary-Ad9275\"> /u/Necessary-Ad9275 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ooqc7j/i_need_a_good_romancepassionfilled_book_recs/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ooqc7j/i_need_a_",

It\u2019s intriguing, interesting, fantastical, and really freaking fun.</p> <p>I also love the romance and the spice of course.</p> <p>Are there any other books out there that have this same style of fantasy elements?
