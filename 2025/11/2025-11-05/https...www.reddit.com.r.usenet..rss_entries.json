I have Newshosting, easynews and tweaknews (black friday 2025) and a few more months on frugal + Bonus.</p> <p>Despite all these servers and indexers, sabnzb continues to fail 90% of downloads, especially when it comes to TV series that aren&#39;t even that old.</p> <p>The crazy thing is that if I insert the NZB file on TorBox... magically I have my file ready to download (after it has downloaded from the server, so NO CACHE TB)</p> <p>Can anyone tell me how to improve my provider/indexer configuration?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/marcb84j\"> /u/marcb84j </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1opfszu/difficulty_completing_downloads/\">[link]</a></span",
