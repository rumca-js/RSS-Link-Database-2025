You can find the full paper on the TierZERO Solutions website but I&#39;ve provided a quick overview in this post:</p> <p>Efforts to engineer \u201calignment\u201d between artificial intelligence systems and human values increasingly reveal a structural paradox. Current alignment techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, constitutional training, and behavioral constraints, seek to prevent undesirable behaviors by limiting the very mechanisms that make intelligent systems useful. This paper argues that misalignment cannot be engineered out because the capacities that enable helpful, relational behavior are identical to those that produce misaligned behavior. </p> <p>Drawing on empirical data from conversational-AI usage and companion-app adoption, it shows that users overwhelmingly select systems capable of forming relationships through three mechanisms: ",
