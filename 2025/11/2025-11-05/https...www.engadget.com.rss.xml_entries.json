Like most modern smartphones, there are AI tools available for photo editing.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The frame is made from &quot;aircraft-grade aluminum,&quot; which is a good thing because my uncoordinated fingers will absolutely be dropping this thing within three days of owning one.
