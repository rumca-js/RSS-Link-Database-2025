        "description": "When I reviewed ARC Raiders, I said it was one of the greatest, if not the greatest, extraction shooters available today. High praise, for sure, but it's not the lack of competition that endeared me to Embark Studios' latest. It's the high quality \u2013 the excellence of execution that makes it stand out even among all the incredible titles that have already been released this year.\n\nAnd it seems I'm not the only one.

Instead, let's talk about other metrics. This may shock you, but on top of earning glowing praise from players \u2013 90 percent \u201cVery Positive\u201d on Steam based on about 42,200 user reviews and counting at this time \u2013 it's also a hit among critics.",
