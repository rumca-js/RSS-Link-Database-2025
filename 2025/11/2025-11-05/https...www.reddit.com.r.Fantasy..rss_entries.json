And what I\u2019ve enjoyed a lot in audiobook form has been: a heretical guide to fishing, Dungeon crawler Carl series, the stormborn chronicles, the first law trilogy, and of course the classic Harry Potter series. Looking for series recommendations specifically for physical reading as of right now, as I have a list of about 25 audiobooks for work right now. Thank you for the help in advanced incase I miss your comment!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WranglerPracti",

The plot is dense, the tone is brutal, but what\u2019s really caught my attention is how Hoffman reuses real-world elements like cities, religions, even family names and twists them into this dark, alternate fantasy setting.</p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li>There\u2019s a <em>siege of London</em> with catapults and cannons, because \u201cthat worked in Paris.\u201d</li> <li>The Redeemers are basically an ultra-fanatical version of the Catholic Church, violent, authoritarian, and deeply dogmatic.</li> <li>The Materazzi are an imperial family \u201cwhere the sun never sets,\u201d clearly evoking the British Empire. (Also fun coincidence: the name\u2019s super close to the real-life Matarazzo industrial businessperson from Brazil.)</li> <li>Then you get little worldbuilding jokes like deserts in Norway, salmon from Nigeria, and champagne from Ukraine.</li> </",
