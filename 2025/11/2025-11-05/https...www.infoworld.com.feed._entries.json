It\u2019s a group of autonomous digital entities that negotiate, share context, and solve problems together. Over the past year, MAC has begun to take practical shape, with applications in multiple real-world problems, including climate-adaptive agriculture, supply chain management, and disaster management. It\u2019s slowly emerging as one of the most promising architectural patterns for addressing complex and distributed challenges in the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In simple terms, MAC systems consist of multiple intelligent agents, each designed to perform specific tasks, that coordinat",
