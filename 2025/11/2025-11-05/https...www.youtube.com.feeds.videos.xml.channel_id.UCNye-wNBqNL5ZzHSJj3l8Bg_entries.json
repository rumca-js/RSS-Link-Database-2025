        "description": "Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has won New York City's mayoral election, defeating independent candidate Andrew Cuomo.\nHe said voters had ended a political era ruled by the few and pledged to make the city affordable again.\n\nHere are the major pledges Mamdani made on the campaign trail:\nHe's promised to immediately freeze rent for all stabilised apartments. Those are units where rent increases are regulated by local law.\nMamdani has also promised to enable people to travel for free on city buses. He says one in five New Yorkers struggle to afford the cost of commuting.\nHe's promised to create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low.\nAnd Mamdani says he'll implement free universal childcare, for every New Yorker until the age of five.\n\nJohn Zogby is a public opinion pollster and is a senior partner at John Zogby Strategies. \nHe explains the strategy behind Mamdani's victory.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X: https://x",

His promise to make life more affordable for working-class New Yorkers, combined with his outspoken criticism of Israel\u2019s crimes against the Palestinian people, earned him a powerful coalition of opponents who poured millions into defeating him. \n\nMamdani\u2019s rise also exposed deep divisions within the Democratic Party, whose leadership either declined to endorse him or waited months before doing so. In the end, his campaign served as a litmus test for the growing distance between what voters want and what elected officials and their donors are willing to offer.\n\nBigger than Zohran takes you inside the battle for New York \u2014 and the future of the Democratic Party.\n\n#zohranmamdani #nyc #documentary \n@AljazeeraEnglish\n#Aljazeeraenglish\n#News",
