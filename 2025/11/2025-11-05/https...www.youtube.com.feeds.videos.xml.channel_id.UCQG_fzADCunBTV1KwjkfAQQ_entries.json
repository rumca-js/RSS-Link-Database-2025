That\u2019s why many people will drive dozens or even hundreds of miles just for a taste of these local delicacies. When you\u2019re in Miele, not trying a bowl of braised chicken rice noodles would be a missed opportunity! The local hens, slaughtered fresh that day without going into the fridge, are marinated with cooking wine and salt for a day, then cleaned, blanched, braised, and soaked, and finally roasted for 15 minutes. The result? No unpleasant smell, tender skin, juicy meat, and a savory aroma that penetrates the bones \u2014 truly a Yunnan culinary treasure!\n\nHello, everyone! I am Dianxi Xiaoge, a Yunnan native. If you enjoy my videos, please keep subscribing to my channel. I'll continue to share my life and Yunnan-styled food in my uploads. Wish you have a happy life and enjoy tasty food every day\n\nYouTube",
