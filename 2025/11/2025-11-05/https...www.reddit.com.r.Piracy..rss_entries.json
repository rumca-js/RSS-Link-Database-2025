Honestly piracy is such a hassle it takes me like minutes and minutes of setting up and once I eventually do get it set up the source fails or whatever and I have to switch, and I tried looking into torrenting and direct downloading and that was far more confusing and everyone just kept saying &quot;look at FMHY&quot; or &quot;look at the megathread&quot; and neither ever told me a basic step by step for what to do. And the crazy part is if I wanna torrent I gotta pay for a VPN, what is even the point then. It is just such a hassle there has to be a easier way.
