The feature was previously in beta, but is now available to all users, provided you have the right PlayStation Plus membership. Game streaming via the cloud does not require the PS Portal to be connected to a PS5 console. In related news, code and graphics for a 'cross-buy' option has been found on the PlayStation Store. Sony hasn't announced anything yet, so many are speculating that this could mean dual PS5/PC purchases. And finally, the highly-anticipated Terminator 2D: NO FATE has been delayed yet again, but this time only about two weeks. The game is now slated for December 12, 2025.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #PS5",

There are jokes, slapstick comedy, and there's a cutesy sidekick. \n\nIt is a big swing for the Predator franchise, so we spoke to the Predator: Badlands Director, Dan Trachtenberg, about why he decided to go in this direction for the Predator series.\n\n#IGN #PredatorBadlands #Predator",

        "description": "Wreckreation reviewed by Luke Reilly on PC. Also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.\n\nOverflowing with ambition but ultimately plain and with no style to call its own, Wreckreation feels like a supermarket brand homage to a series of better arcade racers, built with the user-generated content tools of another game. While slamming into my opponents rewarded me with snapshots of an arcade racer that\u2019s fast and engaging for seconds at a time, any buzz I gleaned was quickly snuffed out by unpredictable handling, a dull open-world map, samey event structure, and an assortment of annoying design choices and bugs.",
