I opened the screenshot which contained an email response from a customer support agent - an AI agent customer support. At first when you look at the email, it did everything that it was supposed to do correctly:</p> <ul> <li>Acknowledge the sender&#39;s issues</li> <li>Reroute to the appropriate department</li> <li>Listed things that might be needed to resolve the issue</li> </ul> <p>The problem was that the email address it provided as the right and appropriate channel was pointing to Obsidian note-taking app instead of the one belonging to Obsidian Entertainment.</p> <p>In my opinion, this is as much as a security issue as it is an architectural design issue. There are things you do not hand off to the AI to do, some things that are meant to be deterministic which is what happened in this instance.</p> <",
