I use that raspberry pi as my chart plotter Open plotter/OpenCPN with a 10 inch touchscreen and some accessories (USB dongle for keyboard and mouse, GPS dongle and USB input from the AIS Receiver)... With the raspberry pi 4 everything (except the ais receiver who has its on 12v power supply) was powered by the pi running off an 12v to 5v 5amp buck converter just fine... Only thing added was the geek worm active cooler.... But it seems that the 5amps aren&#39;t enough as as soon as I plugged a simple thumb drive in (to copy the actual charts onto the pi) the screen begun to cut out and back in.... After the removal of thumb drive everything went back to normal. So I ordered another 12v to usb outlet with QC 3 and PD charging and hope this will fix the missing Amps for the pi 5... But want also some other suggestion how I could power the pi 5 from my 12v system aboard... Any advice is w",

I&#39;ve set the desktop resolution to 4K, and used the defaults option in control centre to select the option for large monitors to give the largest font sizer. This seems to work ok on the system fonts (I think it&#39;s scaled to about 150%, maybe 175%, whatever is right for 2560x1440), but some other apps don&#39;t seem to work correctly. For example, in browsers, the fonts are smaller than the default system ones, and some are even smaller than that. There&#39;s no consistency - for example Firefox seems to display the same as the system font size, even in the address bar, but Brave has a tiny font in the address bar and the rest of the text on a page looks slightly too small as well. I hope that all made sense.</p> <p>Is there a way to make <strong>everything</strong> scale to 2x (so looking like 1920x1080 but nice and sharp)",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, I&#39;d like to hookup a temperature probe (auxiliary adapter) to a raspberry pi within a Gameboy package. Id be more than happy if I could boot up in shell and just run a simple ncurses with some simple menus using the buttons as a starting point. But would be even cooler if I could use more advanced Python graphics libraries to draw graphs, log data, etc using qt as an example. </p> <p>I&#39;m a little familiar with navigating around Linux and I use git bash a lot, but a bit fuzzy on the form shell casing, and how to boot it up into shell, required graphics drivers to get things to display correctly in the LCD screen etc. I&#39;m hoping I can also rewire the audio jack to one of the ADC ports to read / convert to temperature reading. </p> <p>Does anyone have experience or have suggestions for the Gameboy casing etc and how to boot it up? Pretty much all of the examples I&#39;ve searched online already run some kind of a custom rom already. </",

I&#39;m using the WoR Imager and I selected all correct versions. I am using a Windows 10 ARM ISO ver. 1709, build 19H1 (which is supported). Tried a 3 different USB sticks, a Micro Center 32 GB, a Lexar 128 GB, and some kind of Chinese drive. The reason I am using a USB instead of a Micro SD is because I don&#39;t have a MicroSD adapter but its arriving in 2 days. None of them worked. I asked ChatGPT and it told me that Raspberry Pi 3 would &quot;no longer work&quot; but it didn&#39;t cite any sources. Wondering if anyone else was having this issue, or was crazy enough to try running Windows on 1 GB of RAM.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/InfiniteLight07\"> /u/InfiniteLight07 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ooqjfz/is_rpi_3_no_longer_su",
