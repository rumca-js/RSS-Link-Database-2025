The results highlight two rising models within the party: moderates like Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, and progressives like Mamdani, a democratic socialist. With affordability and economic issues front and center, the wins give Democrats fresh momentum and a chance to redefine their path ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
