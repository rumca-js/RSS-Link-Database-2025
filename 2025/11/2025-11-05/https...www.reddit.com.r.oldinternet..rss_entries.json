I noticed he hadn\u2019t posted in 10 years and I couldn\u2019t find anything on his other socials like twitter or Facebook. It\u2019s like he disappeared off the face of the earth and I was wondering if anyone knew anything about where this guy has been or what happened to him?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Hellosharkeyy\"> /u/Hellosharkeyy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oldinternet/comments/1oovvj7/evmoney_tv/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oldinternet/comments/1oovvj7/evmoney_tv/\">[comments]</a></span>",
