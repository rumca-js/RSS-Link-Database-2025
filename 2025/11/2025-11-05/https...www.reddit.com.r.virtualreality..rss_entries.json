I wanted the Valve but they were out of stock and I do not have \u00a31k to spend lol. So it was a toss up between PSVR2 and Quest 3. Whilst I will miss having the original RE4 VR on quest and team beefs mods, I will not miss the constant struggles I had with Quest 2 that apparently transferred over to Quest 3 (link cable garbage connection, constant having to restart headset, stick drift issues actually the controllers in general just having non stop issues). So long story short I heard a lot of praise (with some criticism) of the PSVR 2 and so I purchased it as it was the cheaper option out of the 2, allowed me to play PSVR 2 games I was interested in AND I got the adaptor for my PC games.</p> <p>My question to",

But I scanned full floors of my parents house using Meta Hyperscape. Then went home and walked around in them. There are some artifacts but I really got that feeling I could almost be there. I even did an outdoor patio at dusk. It was just so impressive. You are not limited by a boundary when scanning. I did a whole floor in one go. I did try to do their whole back lawn and did get a too far from origin error, but that was really pushing the limits. This app really needs to get more hype. About 10-15 minutes to scan one space and 4-8 hours to process it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dupdup7833\"> /u/dupdup7833 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ooqdth/hyperscape_gave_me_that_feeling_i_got_when_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a ",
