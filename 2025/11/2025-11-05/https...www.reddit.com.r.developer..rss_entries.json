The only issue I am having is, despite it being an option, I can&#39;t give my developer access to my apple developer account without him running into issues. The solution for this is starting an organization account. Only problem with that is its expensive to start a business in my state and also unnecessary to submit an app to the store. So basically my only option is to give him full access to my apple developer account where they can, I think, see sensitive information? I am not entirely sure but I am reluctant to give him full access to my account. What are my options here? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/spilledmind\"> /u/spilledmind </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1opc26r/hitting_a_road_block_with_getting_my_app_into_the/\">[lin",
