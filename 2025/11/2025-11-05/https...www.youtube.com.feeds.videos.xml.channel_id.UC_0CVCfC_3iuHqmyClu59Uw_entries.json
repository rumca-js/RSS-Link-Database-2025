        "description": "The Lenovo Legion Go 2 just went full-Steam! In this video, we install and test official SteamOS 3.8 running natively on the Z2 Extreme-powered Legion Go 2, and the performance results are shockingly good.\nWe\u2019ll benchmark top AAA titles like Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Spider-Man 2, Elden Ring, Borderlands 4, and more \u2014 all running directly under SteamOS 3.8. With full TDP control, power profiles, HDR, and VRR support, the Legion Go 2 is shaping up to be one of the best SteamOS handhelds ever built.\nIf Lenovo and Valve keep this partnership momentum, the Legion Go 2 could easily become the ultimate SteamOS gaming device.\n\n\ud83c\udfae Buy the Legion Go 2:\n\ud83d\udc49 https://bestbuycreators.7tiv.net/554vmn\n\n\ud83d\udcbb Software Deals (Use Code ETA):\nWindows 11 Pro Key ($23): https://biitt.ly/RUZiX\nWindows 11 Home Key ($22): https://biitt.ly/SQKqi\nWindows 10 Pro OEM Key ($17): https://biitt.ly/KpEmf\nWindows 10 Home Key ($16): https://biitt.ly/2tPi1\nWindows 10 LTSC 2021 Key ($14): https://biit",
