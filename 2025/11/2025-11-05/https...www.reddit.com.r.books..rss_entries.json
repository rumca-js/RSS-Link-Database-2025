But it is so unique, creative and intriguing that I can&#39;t stop thinking about it.</p> <p>To prevent myself from driving my other half mad as I rant at them, I wanted to lay down some of my interpretation here.</p> <p>I think this book is about regret, through the eyes of somebody with dementia. I, like many, have direct experience of loved ones with dementia and as I read this book I felt a kind of dawning horror that this is what it must feel like to suffer with it.</p> <p>Ryder struggles with his memory.

The essays about his childhood, growing up in a neurotic family and living in Paris are especially delightful, blending humiliation and wit in a way few writers can.</p> <p>Not every piece lands equally well but even the weaker ones carry his wry, confessional and oddly kind voice. Beneath the laughter runs a thread of melancholy and vulnerability that gives the book surprising emotional weight.</p> <p>Its the kind of book that makes you laugh out loud and then quietly nod in recognition a moment later. Sedaris may not be for everyone, but when his humor hits, it hits perfectly.</p> <p>8/10</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; s",
