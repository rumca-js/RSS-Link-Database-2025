This 2D puzzle game guides you through a maze-like (computer) circuit board in where you have to find the exit. On the way you will be greeted with different kinds of booby traps like falling bombs or tricky floppy disks, while you also have to collect all &#39;atoms&#39;.

If I recall correctly there was a device you stuck in the game slot that connected to the cable line. Each month it had a decent catalog of games you could play directly. I remember it being surprisingly good and loved having access to tons of games. Pretty advanced compared to slow dial up internet and the speed and ease of use blew my mind. </p> <p>I have no idea how I convinced my parents to subscribe.
