With so many changes--including switching game engines to Unity--and numerous delays, the game simply wasn't up to standard in time. Couple this unforeseen gap year with the promise of a brand-new foundation built on an improved match engine and a completely overhauled interface, and Football Manager 26 quickly became the most highly anticipated game in the long-running series. Unfortunately, the end result is a cliched game of two halves. While the match engine is as impressive as advertised, the UI debuts with significant teething problems. Throw in some missing features and a multitude of frustrating bugs, and FM 26 would be disappointing even if expectations weren't so high.</p><div data-embed-type=\"video\" data-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0Mhw11bTYA\" data-width=\"100%\" data-height=\"100%\">       ",

Think of it more like a forest than a jungle, packed with its own enemies, traps, and weather hazards. In addition, you can also expect an assortment of fresh items to play with and <em>totally not ruin</em> your current run with friends.</p><p>From new edible mushrooms with mysterious properties to scary bugs and occult items, there's a lot to unpack.
