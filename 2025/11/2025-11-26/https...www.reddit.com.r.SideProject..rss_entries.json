The concept is simple: a platform where anyone can request a live, real-time video from anywhere in the world.

The viewer can guide them in real time \u2014 turn the camera, walk a little forward, show a specific angle, etc.</p> <p>It\u2019s basically the opposite of Snapchat Maps or Instagram stories.

Our goal is to build the future of coding. Unicoder integrates multiple advanced LLMs and offers an intelligent development experience where Al does not just suggest code; it understands your project, collaborates with you, and helps you build faster. What Unicoder does: Auto-completes and explains code intelligently. Helps debug and refactor entire files using natural language Understands context across multiple files, not just one Allows Al-driven file creation, documentation, and code reviews. Integrates seamlessly with your workflow, making it feel like having an Al teammate beside you We have already completed about 70 percent of the development, and now we are looking for frontend and backend developers to help bring Unicoder to its full potential. We are still in the early phase, so instead of salaries right now,",
