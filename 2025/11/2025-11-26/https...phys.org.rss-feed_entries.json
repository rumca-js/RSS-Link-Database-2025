As modern wastewater treatment plants cannot remove these contaminants from the wastewater, they can freely enter the environment and pollute rivers and lakes. Recently published research from a Bremen area group has shown that rare earth elements directly attributed to MRIs are now present in the North and the Baltic seas.",

        "description": "Food quality and safety are crucial. However, conventional food-monitoring methods, including ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction, tend to be destructive and lengthy. These shortcomings limit their potential for broad applications. In this regard, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing, with real-time, non-destructive, and high sensitivity capabilities, is a highly promising alternative.",

As a result, life expectancy in Gaza in 2024 fell to nearly half the level expected without the war. An update of their analysis, produced after the publication of the study, revealed that the current violent death toll likely exceeds 100,000.",
