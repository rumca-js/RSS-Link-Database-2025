        "description": "Many Warhammer miniatures, especially characters, come adorned with huge stones, rubble, or debris on their bases. The height advantage gained from standing on these so-called tactical rocks is clearly very important to heroes and characters from the 41st millennium, the Age of Darkness, and even the realms of Sigmar. \n\nTactical rocks have an important role to play in how our miniatures look. They\u2019re great for world building, allowing for more dynamic and interesting poses, and of course making your favourite characters stand big and tall amongst the rest of your army! \n\nTune in to see Ollie show you four simple ways to paint them!\n\nHere\u2019s a list of the paints we used in today\u2019s video:Scheme OneMechanicus Standard Grey \u2013 BaseCelestra Grey \u2013 BaseAgrax Earthshade \u2013 ShadeScheme TwoZandri Dust \u2013 BaseSeraphim Sepia \u2013 ShadeScreaming Skull \u2013 LayerScheme Three Death Guard Green \u2013 BaseCoelia Greenshade \u2013 ShadeKrieg Khaki \u2013 LayerScheme FourAdministratum Grey \u2013 LayerCorax White \u2013 BaseNuln Oil \u2013 ",
