My question is, will a fresh install be enough or is there really that much of a difference in the hardware? I have seen DietPi but Im not a fan of the &quot;graphics&quot; in a terminal. Id prefer an actual GUI. If any one has any other recommendations, Id appreciate it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/kreugerburns\"> /u/kreugerburns </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1p758mn/3_vs_4b_os_requirements/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1p758mn/3_vs_4b_os_requirements/\">[comments]</a></span>",
