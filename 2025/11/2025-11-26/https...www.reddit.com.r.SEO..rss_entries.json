Compared to last year, client&#39;s site traffic has drop from a 300k visitors / month to like 30k visitors / month. Ranking 2 or 3 for revenue generating keywords to Ranking 15 or 17.</p> <p>After a audit, I&#39;ve seen that the desperate client generated multiple duplicated pages and led to duplicate / conflicting content issues, and timing of these duplicated content correlates with the traffic drop. So our team went through and de-indexed the site&#39;s duplicated pages and cleaned up the page speed etc.</p> <p>Went through a site clean up last week. We saw some initial fluctuations in pages disappearing off of google&#39;s rank and now appearing on rank 13 to 14. How soon should I be expecting results and when is the right time to start optimizing pages. Should I time the optimization to after Google&#39;s Core update? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.",

I&#39;ve heard that keywords and metatags aren&#39;t nearly as important as they once were, and focusing on the mobile site is even more important than ever. Besides that, are there any new thing that are really important, specifically for very local-based business?
