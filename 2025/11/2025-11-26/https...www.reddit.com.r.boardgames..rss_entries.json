It\u2019s a negotiation/trading game at its core, but then out of nowhere you\u2019re dealing with legal. tax too. I remember it to have a very low learning curve back when I play tested it.

The details that we can remember are the board and a general idea. The game&#39;s board was a grid system (roughly 12x12 or 15x15) and you needed to navigate around that grid using a 5x5 square with a 1x1 cutout at the center. As you move the tile around, the tile would block the game board around the center &quot;peep hole&quot; so you needed to remember where the obstacles were. (this tile was similar to that of a ouija board, in the fact that you couldn&#39;t see through it except the cutout) The obstacles on the board were cat&#39;s faces, and we can&#39;t remember if the rest of the grid tiles had cheese in them or if the point was to find the cheese.

What are some more examples? I searched BGG for deck construction, but this also seems to include a lot of other types of games. Examples are:</p> <p>Compile Main 1 &amp; 2: Draft 3 protocols, each with their own 6-card deck. Shuffle together to make your 18-card personal deck. </p> <p>Smash Up: \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bPick 2 faction decks and shuffle together to make your personal deck. </p> <p>Bat Flip: Draft 2 smaller team decks to shuffle together to\u200b\u200b make your team. </p> <p>Tag Team: \u200b\u200bPick 2 fighters and shuffle their unique decks together to form your draw deck. </p> <p>Does anyone recommend anything else with this mechanism?

What are the strengths and weaknesses of playing it strictly at 2P? My sister and I love Stonemaier games and we own a bunch of games with different mechanics integrated in them. A few months ago, we tried to have worker placement game in our collection and it was Everdell. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t enjoy Everdell. Does Everdell share similar mechanisms with Viticulture? Everdell felt boring to us because of its basic worker placement, tableau building, and set collection. What additional mechanisms does Viticulture offer?

However when looking online I only really see pirate related naval games, or board games from the age of sail. If anyone knows of any good board games like what I&#39;ve mentioned above, I&#39;d really appreciate if you could tell me.
