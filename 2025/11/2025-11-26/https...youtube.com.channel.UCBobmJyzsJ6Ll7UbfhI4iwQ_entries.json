        "description": "Since its initial Experimental release in UE 5.2, the Procedural Content Generation (PCG) framework has grown into a powerful toolset for Epic\u2019s internal productions as well as licensees, enabling both to create a wide range of fast and iterative procedural content generation tools. \n\nIn this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, we cover the latest revision of the framework from the ground up by going through its main concepts, use cases, and best practices in production. \n\nWatch for a better understanding of how to reason about, develop, and create with the PCG framework.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#ProceduralContentGeneration, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestStockholm",

This will cover how the Nanite Skeletal Mesh Animation Instancing Wind works in conjunction with Assemblies; and how we dealt with shadows, ray tracing, and instancing in the far field. \n\nWe also touch on what the plans are for wind as an engine feature, building on the learnings from the demo.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#Witcher4UnrealEngine5TechDemo, #NaniteFoliage, #NaniteSkeletalMeshAnimation, #Assemblies, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestStockholm",

        "description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, we walk through how to take a static mesh all the way to a fully animated character, entirely within Unreal Engine.\n\nFrom rigging and skinning to Control Rig and final animation, every step happens in engine. The flexibility is incredible: stick with the standard Control Rig workflow or take advantage of Modular Control Rig to speed up your setup, build reusable modules, and create variants for scalable, production-ready animation systems.\n\nUnreal Engine 5.6 is a true game changer for real-time animators, and 5.7 will push the boundaries even further. With new tools like the Animator Kit plugin, which now introduces Deformers, this is the perfect time to level up your workflow and stay at the cutting edge of real-time animation.\n\nTo showcase the entire process, Epic\u2019s St\u00e9phane Biava has created an original character just for this talk: Droid-Oh, a charming little robot with a whole lot of personality. He\u2019ll be your guide through every",
