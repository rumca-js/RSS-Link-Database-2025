They excitedly heralded its entry into what we all know to be the long-dead \"console war.\" The media <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/microsoft-xbox-steam-machine-analysis/\">chimed in too</a>, opining about the timeliness of its return and whether or not it has the chance to significantly dent the crowded market it's entering into.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">But I don't think the Steam Machine really needs to \"fight\" in the traditional sense to be competitive. That's because I don't believe it actually has to do anything in order to chip away at the already-crumbling console infrastructure to win hearts and minds. It just has to be there.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">The console market is arguably in the best place it's ever going to be for a large shakeup. Nintendo",
