        "description": "Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's Zombies mode reviewed by Will Borger on PC, also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.\n\n\"I\u2019m of two minds about Zombies this year. I think Ashes of the Damned is a good map when it works and that playing it with a good group is enjoyable. I think the core of the \u201cdo all the Easter Eggs\u201d design is still quite strong. I also think this map is too damn big, that this year\u2019s Easter Egg hunt takes too long to do in a single sitting, and that the experience when you\u2019re matchmade with other players is miserable. The map being this difficult in a game that is more than happy to sell you impactful Gobblegums for real money also just\u2026 feels bad. I wouldn\u2019t blame anyone for bowing out before they saw the end, though I am still personally determined to keep going. I can\u2019t call this iteration of Zombies bad, but it feels like a remnant of something greater, a shambling corpse that reminds us of the man it used to be. See you next year.\"",

Also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC.\n\n\"During the moments it manages to keep everything together, Cricket 26 is genuinely capable of providing an entertaining and challenging form of bat-on-ball action that elevates it above the last couple of entries in the series like a lofted drive over the infield. However, the countless glitches and bugs still present even after a few post-release patches means it\u2019s prone to break down as often as Ben Stokes\u2019 body, and its small handful of new modes are either seriously undercooked or inaccessible at this stage, making it far from being a must-have upgrade for fans of Cricket 24 in its current form. Cricket 26 is a bit like fledgeling Aussie opener Sam Konstas \u2013 undoubtedly capable of genuine brilliance in bursts, but still clearly a work in progress not quite ready for the top of the order.\"",

In other news, a new Helldivers 2 warbond is coming, and it will feature a fan-favorite weapon from a fan-favorite movie about an invisible alien hunter stalking soldiers in a jungle.
