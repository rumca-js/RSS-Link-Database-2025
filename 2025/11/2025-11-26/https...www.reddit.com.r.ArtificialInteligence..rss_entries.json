The mis-framed observations go like this: AI can\u2019t do this or that or the other thing so my career won\u2019t be significantly affected. The salient point is that AI doesn\u2019t currently replace entire jobs, but it\u2019s already replacing many tasks in nearly all jobs. That is already reducing the need for human workers and will soon lead to general unemployment rates to rise. If persistent unemployment rises to as little as 15%, massive socioeconomic changes will certainly result.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/WaveWhole9765\"> /u/WaveWhole9765 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1p6tk6k/ai_unemployment_is_framed_all_wrong/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1p6tk6k/ai_unemployment_is_framed_all_wrong/\">[comments]</a></span>",
