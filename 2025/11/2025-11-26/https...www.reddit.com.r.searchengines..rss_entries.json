LinkedIn hasn\u2019t been really helpful.</p> <p>For context we\u2019re a Latam startup, working on a B2B marketplace with a pretty big catalog, and our search works\u2026 just okay; but we really need to improve it. We already have some people who put some work on it \u2014 but we need someone with stronger Search experience to take set us in the right direction.</p> <p>Any useful tip, on where could I connect with such people would be really appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Outofnicknameideas\"> /u/Outofnicknameideas </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1p78drt/tips_on_where_to_connect_with_experienced_search/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1p78drt/tips_on_where_to_connect_with_expe",
