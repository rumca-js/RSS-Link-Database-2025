This has led to widespread but incorrect advice about using std::atomic in shared memory. When moving queue implementations from threads to processes, seemingly rock-solid code can induce undefined behavior. \n \nIn addition, traditional queue interfaces are fundamentally insufficient for cross-process communication. A properly designed inter-process queue API must enforce role separation, ensuring that a process can only perform operations appropriate to its designated role. For example, a producer process should not be able to consume messages or manage the queue itself, and the API should preven",
