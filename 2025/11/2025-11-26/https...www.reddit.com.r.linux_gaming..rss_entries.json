I wanted to share it with the community.</p> <p>What is it?</p> <p>Linux Game Helper (linuxgh) is a lightweight Python utility designed to make the process of using Windows-based game trainers and other executables within your Linux gaming environment easier for the average person. It hooks into your game&#39;s launch process, captures the specific Proton/Wine environment, and then provides a simple way to launch your chosen tools. If this reminds you of protonhax, the backbone is basically that with some new features included. I was originally planning on making it just run off of protonhax, but the more that I added, I felt that I should just make it a standalone program. So I took some of the features of protonhax and integrated it into this program</p> <p>Why did I make this?</p>",

I&#39;m actually learning how it&#39;s working (how to customise, commands etc). </p> <p>I&#39;m struggling to choose the GPU I&#39;m also going to. I have a R7 5700X3D and a 600W PSU, + some budget limitation (550\u20ac) so I can&#39;t go higher than the RTX 5070 / RX 9070, even if it&#39;s a 30\u20ac difference. </p> <p>I know that AMD cards are interesting on Linux because of the drivers implementation in the Kernel. And I know that Nvidia isn&#39;t really interesting on Linux because we lose a lot of technologies (RTX Super Resolution which is my favorite). But at the same time FSR4, as good as it is, is similar to DLSS 3 Quality while DLSS4 is better than native and available on a lot of games. </p> <p>I just don&#39;t know what to choose, both cards are at the same prize.

Lately I&#39;ve felt that Windows is getting worse, so I finally got tired of it and decided to switch to Linux.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been reading a bit and even asked ChatGPT (sorry) for distro recommendations. I use my personal PC mainly for gaming, watching series/movies, browsing, and occasionally working from home (I\u2019m a data engineer). ChatGPT recommended Nobara, but I\u2019ve also seen many people saying it\u2019s not the best option for gaming. That\u2019s where I started getting confused.</p> <p>What I\u2019m looking for:</p> <p>- A distro that lets me play games without headaches.</p> <p>- Something I can customize to look similar to macOS (not for the Apple hype, but because I really love the Sequoia aesthetics).</p> <p>- Reasonable compatibility with apps like ObsidianMD, KeeperSecurity, NearDrop, Steam etc. Not sure how well they work on Linux.</p> <",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>So I am curious what settings should I use on heroic launcher to get the maximum performance I could. I use EndeavourOS, gnome, wayland.<br/> Should I use ntsync and how do I enable it? Will I need to disable fsync and esync in heroic settings?<br/> Do I need to enable vsync or is it better to just cap my fps at 140? Should I cap fps with in-game settings or in heroic launcher? (I cap fps to lessen the noise from my laptop)<br/> Which proton should I use? Proton-GE/Proton-cachyos or maybe something else?</p> <p>Thanks for any help.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Internet6438\"> /u/Ok_Internet6438 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1p6yum4/arkham_knight_performance_suggestions/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1p6yum4/arkham_knight_performance_suggestions/\">[comments]</a></span>",
