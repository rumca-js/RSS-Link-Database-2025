        "description": "Operation Take Back Christmas! https://www.givesendgo.com/takebackchristmas \nXi Jinping is in trouble\u2014politically, economically, and spiritually (if communists had spirits). So he\u2019s dusting off the legacy of Hu Yaobang, one of the most beloved and politically dangerous figures in CCP history, in a desperate attempt to look like a \u201creformer.\u201d The problem? China is outwardly strong, inwardly brittle, and very publicly miserable. From daily protests to a collapsing economy to an endless series of purges that make the Cultural Revolution look like a yoga retreat, Xi is trying to convince the Party and the people to \u201cchew tough bones\u201d while everything around them breaks. This episode dives into Xi\u2019s political cosplay, the CCP\u2019s growing panic, and why none of this ends the way Xi thinks.\n\nOperation Honey Pot: Paste this emoji \ud83c\udf6f in your comment below.\n\nWant to go deeper than YouTube will let us?
