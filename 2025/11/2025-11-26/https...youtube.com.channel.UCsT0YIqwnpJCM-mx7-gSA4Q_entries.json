        "description": "In this deeply human talk, Rashida Jones reflects on the stories that have stayed with her throughout her career\u2014from breaking news to moments of quiet bravery. She makes the case that journalism, at its best, is an act of service: a way to witness, to hold power accountable, and to remind us of our shared humanity. At a moment when trust is fragile, Jones offers a hopeful vision for how storytelling can still move society forward. Rashida Jones is a television executive and the former President of MSNBC, making history as the first Black woman to lead a major cable news network. She became president in February 2021 and previously served as Senior Vice President at NBC News and MSNBC, where she was an executive producer for major events and programming. A graduate of Hampton University, her career also includes producing roles at The Weather Channel and local news stations. \nEarly career: Jones started her career as a producer for local news affiliates, including WTKR-TV, and later m",

        "description": "This is a profoundly moving dialogue between Leonor Varela and Mono Gana, two women who have transformed deep pain into a path of service and connection.\n\nThey explore how the memory of a loved one who 'moves on to another plane' can be kept alive through everyday gestures and moments that capture their essence. They discuss the discovery of a new secret language, rich with synchronicities and deciphered only by the heart, that emerges in absence and redefines connection, transcending life itself.\n\nDrawing from her work at Casa Familia Foundation, Mono Gana joins Leonor to reflect on the nature of unconditional love, resilience and the profound meaning of empathy during life's most challenging times. This encounter invites us to recognise new ways of loving and remembering. Leonor Varela is an internationally recognized actress and dedicated activist. She is also a prominent Chilean cultural figure and mother. Varela is the author of the memoir, \"Ir al cielo y Volver\" (Go to Heaven an",

Architecture is not just about structures; it\u2019s about systems. It's about shaping environments that shape people. The chairs we sit on, the classrooms we learn in, the homes we find comfort in, these are not accidents. They are designed. So, what do architects really do? We create life\u2019s silent framework.

        "description": "Rahul Sachar challenges the common belief that financial freedom is about earning more. He reframes freedom as a mindset shaped by awareness, discipline, and early habits. Through simple principles, real-life examples, and the power of compounding, he demystifies modern investment avenues and shows how anyone, regardless of background can build long-term financial security. It\u2019s a call to shift from income-focused thinking to informed decision-making, proving that financial freedom begins not with money, but with understanding. Rahul Sachar, founder of PunjiBaazar Pvt. Ltd., has established the company as an early-stage investment platform focused on high-growth businesses entering the J-curve of expansion. With over 11 years of experience in the investing ecosystem, he has developed deep expertise in India\u2019s unlisted and pre-IPO markets. Turning his passion for investing into a successful enterprise, he has achieved multiple high-value exits across startups and pre-IPO opportunities.",

She explores the \u201cHelper\u2019s Paradox\u201d, the belief that one can serve others but shouldn\u2019t receive in return and reveals how genuine selling helps people invest in their own growth. Through relatable insights and honest reflections, she shows how selling rooted in integrity becomes a catalyst for belief, confidence, and meaningful transformation. With over a decade of corporate experience working with international brands, Beena Srivastava wanted a life of freedom, balance, and deeper purpose. She transitioned from the corporate world to help people live and lead with authenticity. Along the way, she realized that many talented mentors failed not because they lacked skill, but because they couldn\u2019t align with pushy sales tactics. That insight led her to create her Heart-Centered Sales System \u2014 a soulful, ethical way to sell that creates impact and income with ease. Today, Beena empowers people to b",

She reflects on how societal expectations, silent pressures, and everyday conditioning slowly push people away from their true selves. Through relatable insights and practical reflections, she reveals how small acts of honesty can rebuild confidence, deepen connection, and inspire a quiet but transformative rebellion: the choice to be real in a world of constant performance.

Through compelling stories, including the journey of a young boy, Atul illustrates how societal pressure and lack of guidance often steer talented youth away from their true potential. He reframes career guidance as life approach, emphasizing self-awareness, clarity, and purpose over mere academic choices. With actionable advice for students and parents alike, Atul inspires a shift from confusion to clarity\u2014helping every young Indian chart a path that aligns with their mind, passion, and potential.
