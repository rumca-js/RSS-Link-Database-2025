This happens regardless of the complexity of the question. For instance, I gave it very difficult integrals, but it still responds immediately without the usual &quot;thinking&quot; process.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Curious how common this problem actually is for startups building with LLMs.</p> <p>I had to shut down a side project after users discovered they could manipulate prompts and drain my API budget ($100 gone in hours). It was a nightmare to debug and even harder to prevent.</p> <p>Since then, I&#39;ve been working on a detection tool that flags malicious prompts before they hit your API, currently sitting at 97% accuracy.</p> <p>Have you experienced prompt injection issues in your deployments? Are you actively protecting against it, or just hoping it doesn&#39;t happen?</p> <p>Would a plug-and-play detection layer be useful, or are you handling it internally? Really trying to gauge if this is a widespread pain point.</p> <p>Any experiences or thoughts would be super helpful![](<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1p7f93j\">https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1p7f93j</a>)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"h",

This cap feels unreasonably restrictive for paying users who rely on the agent for tasks.</p> <p>It would be much more reasonable to provide at least 100 agent uses per month for Plus subscribers. This would better reflect the value of the paid plan compared to free tiers and ensure that paying customers aren\u2019t constrained by low quotas.</p> <p>Another issue is that a single continuous action can consume multiple credits when the agent asks yes/no confirmation questions, and consumes credits even when it was halted due to an issue on the serverside, which happens to occur a lot. Even if it\u2019s part of the same task, each confirmation sometimes counts as an additional use. This only exacerbates the already lackluster amount of agent use credits.</p> <p>Paying use",
