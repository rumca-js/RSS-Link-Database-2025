        "description": "Rheumatoid arthritis begins years before pain ever appears, and scientists have now mapped the hidden immune battle that unfolds long before symptoms. By studying people with RA-linked antibodies over seven years, researchers discovered sweeping inflammation, malfunctioning immune cells, and even epigenetic reprogramming in cells that had never encountered a threat. These changes show that the body is preparing for autoimmune attack long before joints become damaged.",

The procedure creates a hybrid immune system that stops autoimmune attacks and eliminates the need for immune-suppressing drugs. The method uses tools already common in clinical practice, putting human trials within reach. Scientists think the same strategy could transform treatments for autoimmune conditions and organ transplantation.",

These forces made crowded, costly city life worthwhile for rural farmers. But when conditions improved in the countryside, people abandoned cities for more autonomy and better living environments. The story turns out to be far more complex than drought alone.",
