I wouldn&#39;t mind owning 2-3 collections that each bring something amazing to the story when I read it again, but I don&#39;t know how to know if I&#39;m picking a good one when I search on Amazon or at a book store. It doesn&#39;t help that most of the titles are too similar to distinguish. </p> <p>So I&#39;m here to ask, do you have a favorite? What do you love about it?
