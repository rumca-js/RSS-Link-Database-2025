And my current hosting plan is very low, which is </p> <blockquote> <p>1 core CPU, 2gb ram, and 5gb storage. It&#39;s a budget shared plan and the website is working fine in it. And I&#39;m trying to add a AI Chatbot using API from Gemini. It&#39;s done with the development. And maybe you already know that I need to use some heavy library like Langchain and ChromaDB for this. So when I&#39;m trying to deploy in the same plan the process is getting full (100/100). And after contacting the hosting provider he said I need to use a VPS for this. And here is the biggest problem, which is money. After comparing some hosting providers I learned that Hostinger gives the best price but it is also very high for me as a student. So can anyone guide me what can I do in this situation? </p> </blockquote> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/m",

A formatter takes a database object\u2014basically a Django model instance\u2014and formats it.

Then I need another formatter that returns about 80% of the same data, but with slight additions or removals.
