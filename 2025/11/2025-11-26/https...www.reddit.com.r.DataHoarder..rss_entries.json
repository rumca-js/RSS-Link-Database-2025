Thanks for the answers! </p> <p>My Motherboard supports:<br/> CPU:<br/> - 2 x PCIe 5.0 x16 Slots (PCIE1 and PCIE2), support x16 or x8/x8 modes<br/> Chipset:<br/> - 1 x PCIe 4.0 x16 Slot (PCIE3), supports x4 mode</p> <p>I know I can resolve this by just putting the HBA card into PCIE2 which has 5.0 x8 bandwidth and it&#39;ll just run at 3.0 x8 speed.</p> <p>But I&#39;m curious if the PCIe 4.0 x16 slot running at x4 speed should have all 16 lanes connected, but then throttled to x4 speed to not overpower everything else that needs to use the same DMI 4.0 x8 connection between the chipset and the CPU.</p> <p>I feel like I know just enough to know to ask this question, but not quite enough to figure out the answer without physically looking at the solder points for the slot connected to the motherboard.</p> <p>",

On paper Btrfs sounds amazing (snapshots, checksums, etc.), but I also keep running into comments saying it had some issues on UGOS over the last year.</p> <p>Is Btrfs stable enough these days, or is EXT4 still the safer choice?</p> <p>Here are some of the things people ran into: \u2022 Some users said their Btrfs pool went \u201cUnavailable\u201d after an update \u2022 A few mentioned RAID rebuilds acting weird on Btrfs but not on EXT4 \u2022 Reports of slower performance on HDDs with Btrfs (small files especially) \u2022 Some snapshot quirks (not deleting, freezing, etc.) \u2022 One or two cases where the Btrfs volume needed repairs after a bad shutdown \u2022 And a couple people said volume creation failed with Btrfs but worked fine with EXT4</p> <p>Again\u2014this is just what I found searching around.</p> ",

I have all the HDDs that I need to get off to a great start, but I have no clue what I should be looking for to do what I would like to do. I am thinking I should be able to transcode video if needed, but the majority really would be a basic media server and redundant backup for video and audio files.
