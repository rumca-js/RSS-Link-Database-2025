I started <em>Empire Of Silence</em> in February and finished it around the beginning of September (had a months long break in between). However, it only took me around two weeks to finish <em>Howling Dark,</em> and then four days to finish to <em>Demon In White</em> and then two days to finish <em>Kingdoms Of Death</em> and also two days for <em>Ashes Of Man</em> which I just finished. I used to read pretty fast some years back but I&#39;ve really slowed down over the past year or so. However, I&#39;ve really improved my reading speed again over the past month or two and I have to give a lot of credit to the fact that I&#39;ve started listening to Audiobooks whenever I can.

Some stories are more centered around sex than others-think about 50 shades of grey. But I\u2019ve never seen a fictional story centered around sex. The only example that comes to my mind are the last two books in Frank Herberts Dune saga-Heretics of Dune and Chapterhouse: Dune. There are a lot of works of fantasy (movies, books, etc.) which have tons of sex, but in none of them sex is a tool that the story centers around.

I keep catching myself re reading the same paragraph two or three times even when I fully get what is going on. It is not that the prose is confusing or that I missed something important. It is more like my brain hits this weird loop where I feel like I need to soak in the scene again before I can move forward. It happens the most when a chapter has that quiet moment before the big emotional hit. Like my brain refuses to continue until I go back and let the tension simmer a bit longer. I noticed it big time last night. There was this scene with the MC finally confronting the old mentor who betrayed them. Nothing super dramatic yet, just that heavy silent vibe between them. I read the exchange once, then instantly scrolled back because the weight of it felt good but also kinda scary. Then I did it again by accident. At some po",

Who cares?&quot; That has evolved slightly over the years to &quot;Just make sure everything is consistent. Throw together names from a bunch of cultures and the setting is a melting pot?

I love Abercrombie&#39;s prose and the way he just sticks with the plot. It&#39;s quick and fast, sometimes predictable. But still interesting. </p> <p>I enjoyed The Blade Itself more as there were a lot of humorous moments when Logen enters Adua, Jezel&#39;s training and obviously Glokta. The lore of the world was pretty simple and straight to the point. I can guess what the overarching plot is. </p> <p>A lot of similarities to ASOIAF with Shanka, The Feared, Glokta, the Union, the far North and lots and lots. But the difference here is that there aren&#39;t lots of plotlines and pov characters. Constricted to only 6 povs, it doesn&#39;t get tiring at all. Yet I felt that there were at times, the characters mused a lot more than the plot required them to.

There\u2019s a lot I loved, and some stuff I felt was just odd. One being the whole idea of white people being physically inferior to literally everyone else for seemingly absolutely no reason, it genuinely felt like a \u201cwhy?\u201d to me every time it was brought up. I mean it\u2019s not a big deal, but why was that a thing the author specifically decided to add in there. In the beginning I thought maybe it would lead to something later in the story but nope.</p> <p>They even specifically call them \u201cwhite people\u201d at a bunch of points in the book\u2026 as if there aren\u2019t many Asians with equally pale skin too, just really odd for a fantasy world setting. Idk, I suppose I\u2019m just curious if anyone else also felt the same head scratching way about it.</p> <p>[My original post got removed due to the title?
