If you saw a car, you could just take it. Just like that. You could just walk up to anyone and kill them. But now it was in 3D! The idea of this was so crazy it seemed too good to be true.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>This game&#39;s release changed everything. The idea of what was possible in its sandbox caused games to imitate it or adapt to its style for almost a decade. With games like Saint&#39;s Row for example being called a GTA clone. But there were MANY games with that basic premise: walk up to a vehicle and steal it, attack people on the street, etc.</p> <p>But no game could out-GTA GTA like GT",
