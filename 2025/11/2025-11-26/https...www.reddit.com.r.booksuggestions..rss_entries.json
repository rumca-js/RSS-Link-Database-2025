I need good books about knights and princess. Note\u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be romance. It can be a platonic adventure book. Whatever it may be, please give me your best suggestions!

I recently devoured &quot;The Silent Patient&quot; by Alex Michaelides and &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; by B.A. Paris, both of which kept me on the edge of my seat. I love stories where the plot unfolds in surprising ways and the characters have depth, making you question their motives and reliability.

I had asked for recommendations from friends many years ago and was given some great titles but all my friends had read them in middle and high school. As such, they were probably aimed for that audience, and I was 26 when I started really getting into reading/listening (I had a 12hr round trip every few weeks driving, with lots of time on my hands). I&#39;d like to start diving into things meant more for the adult audiences.</p> <p>Some of my favorite books have been:<br/> - The Nightangel Trilogy (11/10, re-read 3 times.)<br/> - Mercy Thomson series by Patricia Briggs (10/10)<br/> - He Who Fights With Monsters: A literary RPG (9/10)<br/> - Deathstalker Trilogy (10/10, great books. Wish there was more.)<br/> - Alex Verus series (10/10)<br/> - The Kingkiller Chronicle (7/10. Great books overall. N",

I have three boys and these are our favorite books to listen together on the way to grandma&#39;s house. I hope you like them too. These suggestions are for families with kids from 5-12.</p> <p>Here&#39;s my list. The best are at the top:</p> <p><strong>No Talking.</strong> This is our favorite listen. The plot revolves around a group of kids in school who have a competition to stop talking. It is a really intense listen for kids because they can relate to the characters. The book gets them to think about how they use language and no one talks during the road trip. Bonus points for being short.</p> <p><strong>Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy - Radio edition.</strong> These short plays are much better than the books, in my opinion. There isn&#39;t as much filler and that makes it even funnier. It will have the whole car laughing and thinking. ",

She has mentioned before mainly liking books with a strong female lead, and enjoys books more when there&#39;s a romance element. I also think I would be looking for a standalone, as she doesn&#39;t seem to be into series THAT much - and I know she likes fantasy. She also likes books which are feel good. (I know she likes the thursday murder club etc.) </p> <p>Please help if you can! I&#39;m not really that demographic at all (I&#39;m a gay 33 year old man) and I want to make sure I get something good! If that&#39;s too vague I can try and provide more details but honestly just a solid standalone fantasy with a good female lead is what I&#39;m after! </p> <p>Feeling a little lost so thanks so much!!!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Frameglasseye\"> /u/Frameglasseye </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.re",
