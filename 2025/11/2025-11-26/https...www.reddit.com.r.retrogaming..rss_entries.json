I\u2019ve been collecting for a few years now and the monitor that I use doesn\u2019t have AV or RF or any other inputs that a lot of older systems use. I\u2019ve bought plenty of converters and stuff throughout the years, but they either don\u2019t work, look like shit, or crap out after a while. So, I\u2019ve been thinking about picking up a Retron 5. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s pretty hit or miss, but I\u2019d like some suggestions or advice before I purchase.
