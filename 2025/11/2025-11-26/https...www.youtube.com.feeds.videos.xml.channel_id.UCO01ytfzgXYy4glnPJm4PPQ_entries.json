        "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, as we head into Thanksgiving we are going to take a close look at a piece of sophisticated anti-American propaganda just released by PBS and the documentary filmmaker Ken Burns. There is a neverending effort to make Americans embarrassed of their history, and to give credit for its achievements to people who don't deserve it. American history has been rewritten for this purpose. Today we will debunk the lies. Also, Pennsylvania just passed a law against hair discrimination. That sounds absurd, and it is, but it's even worse and more nefarious than you think.\n\nEp.1698\n\n-- -- --\n\nLIKE & SUBSCRIBE for new videos daily. https://www.youtube.com/@mattwalsh?sub_confirmation=1\n\nClick here to join the member-exclusive portion of my show: https://bit.ly/4bEQDy6\n\n-- -- --\n\nToday's Sponsors:\n\nPureTalk - Switch to PureTalk and start saving today!
