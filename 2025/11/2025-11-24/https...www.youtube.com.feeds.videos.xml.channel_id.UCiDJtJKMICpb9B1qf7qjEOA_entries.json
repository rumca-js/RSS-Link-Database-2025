        "description": "Adam Savage visits the Lucasfilm campus to pay a visit to some of the surviving models and miniatures he worked on for Steven Spielberg's A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)! It's a walk down model shop memory lane for Adam as he shows us the details he and the model team put into the ruins of New York skyscrapers, and the tricks they used to make these practical effects look so convincing on film. Plus, an intricate miniature Adam built that never made it to the final cut of the movie!\n\nShot by Joey Fameli and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\nAdditional media courtesy of ILM\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nSavage Merchandising: https://adamsavage.com/\nAbout Tested: ht",
