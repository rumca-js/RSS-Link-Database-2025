So what&#39;s the point of having the Plus version? Isn&#39;t this a bug?

Nothing unusual there in the world of Silicon Valley, but what a waste to go through this whole song and dance with safety research and protocols only to roll it back. But, it makes sense.

I am using ChatGPT Plus for some time now, probably since August, and everything has been smooth so far. </p> <p>Until 5.1 rolled out. For past few days, I noticed that ChatGPT replies seemingly with same message for three or even more times.<br/> (i.e I say &quot;good morning&quot; and more text, and ChatGPT replies with &quot;Good morning!&quot; and some other text. But few messages afterwards, I say &quot;Can you help me with this, I have problem with x and y&quot; and it still even after three messages of different context still says &quot;good morning!&quot;)</p> <p>Any idea what the problem might be? Full memory? I am using the ChatGPT app on my macbook, so maybe it&#39;s app problem?
