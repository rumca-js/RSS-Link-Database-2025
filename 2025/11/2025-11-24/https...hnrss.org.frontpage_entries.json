Many ATS providers have a public API that you can hit with the slug of the companies to get open jobs. The hardest part was finding the companies. I tried Firecrawl but it returned around 200 companies per provider which wasn\u2019t enough for me. Then, I tried SERPAPI but it was expensive. I ended up using SearXNG to discover companies by ATS type and fetch their job postings. This produced a large dataset of 200k+ jobs (I only use a subset as it would have taken too much time processing). A few days ago, I decided to build a visualization of the data as I didn\u2019t know what to do with it and wanted people to benefit.<p>I kept catching myself wanting to ask simple questions like \u201cshow only research roles in Europe\u201d or \u201cfilter for remote SWE positions\u201d (and had plenty of free ai credits) so I added a small LLM interface that translates natural language in",

But on HN Simulator, all of the comments are generated by LLMs + generate instantly.<p>The best way to use it (IMHO) is to submit a text post or a curl-able URL here: <a href=\"https://news.ysimulator.run/submit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ysimulator.run/submit</a>. You don't need an account to post.<p>When you do that, various prompts will be built from a library of commenter archetypes, moods, and shapes. The AI commenters will actually respond to your text post and/or submitted link.<p>I really wanted it to feel real, and I think the project mostly delivers on that. When I was developing it, I kept getting confused between which tab was the \"real\" HN and which was the simulator, and accidentally submitted some junk to HN.

        "description": "<p>Easy to use, portable app to play midi music files on all flavours of Microsoft Windows.<p>Brief Background - Used midi playback way back in the days of Windows 95 for some fun and entertaining apps, but as Windows progressed, it seemed their midi support (for Win32 anyway) regressed in both startup speed and reliability.  Midi playback used to be near instant on Windows 95, but on later versions of Windows this was delayed to about 5-7 seconds.  And reliability became somewhat patchy.  This made working with midi a real headache.<p>Cynthia was built to test and enjoy midi music once again.  It's taken over a year of solid coding, recoding, testing, re-testing, and a lot more testing, and some hair pulling along the way, but finally Cynthia works pretty solidly on Windows now.<p>Some of Cynthia's Key Features:\n* 25 built-in sample midis on a virtual disk - play right out-of-the box\n* Play Modes: Once, Repeat One, Repeat All, All Once, Random\n* Play \".mid\", \".midi\" and \".rmi\" midi f",

AI is great at explaining malware signatures, but I couldn't use ChatGPT for my work because pasting potential malware or sensitive logs into a web form is a massive security risk. I needed the intelligence of an LLM but with the privacy of an air-gapped machine.<p>Under the hood, it\u2019s built on Python 3. I use subprocess to manage the heavy lifting of the scanning engines so the UI (built with CustomTkinter) doesn't freeze. The \"se",
