I tried to follow them, and the module is copied into the app, but according to <a href=\"https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm/\">this</a> website and netflix, I still do not have a functioning drm module. When I tried the drm test, it said: DRM_MEDIA_KEY_INITIALIZATION_FAILED. If I had to guess, that means the module would be signed by google right? I am using <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">homebrew</a> on macOS to install it, and running Sequoia 15.7.2. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Natjoe64\"> /u/Natjoe64 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/1p54ywg/how_to_get_widevine_on_ungoogled_chromium",
