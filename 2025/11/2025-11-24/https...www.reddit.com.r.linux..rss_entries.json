I&#39;ve actually really enjoyed it and I&#39;m glad I did it (the sole reason was to dive into the deep end to learn things the hard way), but recently I&#39;ve been having issues with certain software being built for more popular distributions and leaving Arch out (I understand why it is this way and I am not complaining about that). This has started to get old and I&#39;m ready to move towards something more widely supported.</p> <p>Currently, my top pick is Debian, just because I feel like I&#39;ve seen it being the most widely supported distro (things like MATLAB, STM32CubeIDE, etc.), but I&#39;m open to anything. Does anyone have any informed opinions on this that they&#39;d like to share?</p> <p>Thank you! Much appreciated.</p> </div><",

I gave up after the third or fourth time my whole Gnome Desktop crashed because of an NVIDIA driver and I had fix it by removing and reapplying the driver. Keep in mind that I didn&#39;t adjust anything at the OS level or even set up an own desktop environment or something. It just bricked every time I installed an automatic update.</p> <p>Then recently I thought I give it another shot and switched to Arch with Garuda Linux. This time I planned it carefully, I first tested it on a VM for a week, set up all my applications and everything was fine. Then I dualbooted it, just to be 100% sure, tested it another two weeks...and everything was great, I was ready to leavy Windows fina",
