        "description": "Hardwood floor protection tips\u2026I\u2019m using Ram Board to protect these floors from paint and dust. The green Edge Tape secures boards to the hardwood without leaving behind residue. I use Seam Tape between boards because it\u2019ll block liquids and debris. Definitely worth the time and effort to keep nice floors looking good. Many thanks to Ram Board for sponsoring this tutorial \ud83d\udd25#homerenovation #hardwoodfloors #ramboard #homerepairtutor #sponsored",
