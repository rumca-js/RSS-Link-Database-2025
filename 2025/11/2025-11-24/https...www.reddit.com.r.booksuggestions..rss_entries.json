I&#39;m in college, so it takes me a little longer to read with all of my school work, but I have winter break coming up and want to make sure I finish my goal before the end of the year!</p> <p>I&#39;m looking for books that are fast paced that made you so immersed that you read them super quick. They don&#39;t have to be short!</p> <p>Some books I&#39;ve read recently that I loved are:</p> <p>Atmosphere and Carrie Soto is Back by Taylor Jenkins Reid </p> <p>Chain-Gang All-Stars by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah</p> <p>Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir</p> <p>Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus</p> <p>True Biz by Sara Novi\u0107</p> <p>I also read most of the Throne of Glass series and enjoyed it!

Right now I&#39;m putting ACOTAR on held to finish the whole Crescent city series. I&#39;m definitely more a fantasy reader than a romance reader, however I love a well done romance. It seems like everyone and their sons have read the Chestnut spring series and rated it highly. I&#39;m not a huge fan of too much spice unless it&#39;s done well and has purpose to the story and I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s up their on the spice rating.

I somehow read all of it and I absolutely LOVE WarHorse by Michael morpurgo, I remember what page where I cried the most and it was page 144. Don&#39;t ask me why lol. I started to love reading and I am currently tackling the Harry Potter series because almost everybody tells me to read that series. It&#39;s kinda confusing to read because I grew up hearing American English and ofc my mother language(Cebuano) and I had little knowledge of British terms so I mostly googled it whenever I don&#39;t know what their meaning is. So I&#39;m planning on what to read after I finish my book.

He used to be obsessed with dragon masters and finished every single one of them multiple times but now says they are &quot;for babies&quot;. He also used to love kingdom of wrenly but same thing... now for babies. He seems to want more complex books that are fun and adventurous but not super violent (1st book of WOF he was ok with that level of violence but barely). He loves word play, puns, and witty banter. Doesn&#39;t have to be about dragons. I would prefer books without potty talk or humor (seems to be a trend for books geared towards 8-10 year old boys).
