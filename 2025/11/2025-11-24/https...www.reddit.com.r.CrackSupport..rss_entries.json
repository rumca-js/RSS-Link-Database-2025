I&#39;ve downloaded a fit girl repack for Sims 3, everything works right up it verifies all the files at the end and it appears I&#39;m missing 5 which leaves me with this nonsense. Is there anyway to get these missing files or is just a massive L? It&#39;s been done on a reasonably older gaming laptop but i had no issues making it work from my modern PC</p> <p>I had antivirus and everything off and everything else worked until the end. If you can give me a fix, I&#39;ll be ever so grateful.</p> <p>Also, please explain it to me like you&#39;re speaking with a toddler. Very much no",
