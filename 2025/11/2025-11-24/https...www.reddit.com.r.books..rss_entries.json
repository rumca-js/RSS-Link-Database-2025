I&#39;ve bought all the books in the Game of Thrones series, but I don&#39;t have the motivation to start it because I know it&#39;s incomplete. I know that it will most likely stay as is, but I can&#39;t bring myself to start. Same with The Fourth Wing series - I&#39;ve read the first two, I pre-ordered the 3rd back in January, but have no desire to open it until the final book is released. Now I&#39;m experiencing the same dilemma with the Alex Stern Series and Brian Sanderson&#39;s Cosmere. I thought that I could re-read the books again when the next installment comes, but the thought of that makes me want to just wait.
