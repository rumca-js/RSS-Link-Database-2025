        "description": "In today's Daily Fix:\nCall of Duty: Black Ops 7's launch likely isn't going the way Activision would have hoped, at least in Europe. Via The Game Business, the European launch of the game saw 63% fewer copies sold compared to competitor Battlefield 6. It's also down more than 50% against last year's Black Ops 6. Game Pass subscriptions have not been taken into account as Microsoft has not provided that data. In other news, Charlie Cox doesn't want any of the credit for his performance as Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, even as he's nominated at this year's The Game Awards. Cox would prefer the accolades go to mo-cap artist Maxence Cazorla. And finally, despite what the internet is saying, Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet very likely won't be out in 2026, and probably won't have presence at The Game Awards next month, either.",
