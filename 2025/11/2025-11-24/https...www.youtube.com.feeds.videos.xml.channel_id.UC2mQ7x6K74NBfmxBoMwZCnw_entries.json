        "description": "Thinking about getting into 3D printing for tabletop terrain? Black Friday might be the best opportunity you\u2019ll see all year. In this video, I break down why printers like the Bambu Lab P1S and A1 Mini are perfect for building a full 4'\u00d74' Depths of Perdition table at home for around $400 total\u2014including the printer, PLA, and STLs. \n\nI compare that cost to buying a printed set, explain how easy modern printers are to use, and show how owning one opens the door to endless terrain options from creators across the hobby. If you\u2019re curious about 3D printing terrain, the upcoming Depths of Perdition Kickstarter, or how to build affordable, high-quality sci-fi boards, this video will point you in the right direction.\n\n*Links You'll Need:*\nDepths of Perdition  https://www.miniwargaming.com/perdition\nP1S Printer:  https://www.miniwargaming.com/p1s\nA1 Mini Printer:  https://www.miniwargaming.com/a1mini\nRecommended PLA:  https://geni.us/rapidplaplus\n\n*Sign up for our FREE How to 3D Print Terrai",
