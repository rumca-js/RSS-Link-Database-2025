Pierce answers no. At the end of the movie, he shoots someone in the back so he doesn&#39;t get away with it.

Usually I leave them to it as this is &quot;their thing&quot;. However, it has occurred to me recently all the classic films from the 80s, 90s and 2000s they watch together are pretty male centred. Think star wars, Indiana jones type things. All great films! But not the only things out there. So we have started watching some things together that are a bit more women centred. So far she has really enjoyed oceans 8, miss congeniality, the devil wears prada and practical magic.
