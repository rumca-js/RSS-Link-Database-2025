Drawing on firsthand experience with world leaders, he unpacks the crucial differences \u2014 and surprising similarities \u2014 between today\u2019s conflicts and the 20th-century struggle. McFaul explains what America gets right, what it\u2019s getting dangerously wrong, and why the real battle may be happening inside democracies themselves. A sharp, urgent talk about power, values, and the choices that will define the 21st century. Michael McFaul is director at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, the Ken Olivier and Angela Nomellini Professor of International Studies in the Department of Political Science, and the Peter and Helen Bing Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution.

In this timely talk, he reveals a breakthrough approach to repairing our fractured public sphere: small, intentional \u201ccircles of trust\u201d that use community-led dialogue and carefully designed AI tools to amplify real listening rather than outrage. Roy shows how Cortico, the platform his team has developed, is already reshaping schools, cities, newsrooms, and national projects, and invites all of us to join in building a healthier conversation ecosystem. Deb Roy is a professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, where he directs the MIT Center for Constructive Communication (CCC).  He leads research in designing human-AI systems that foster dialogue, listening, and deliberation in ways that build civic muscle.

Hard-of-hearing, chemobrained amputee and three-time cancery person Ashley Shew shares her disabled dreams about the practical realities of the world we have coming. Ideas about perfection and fitness have a stranglehold on our ideas about what constitutes good technology -- and what constitutes good people.

Dr. Shew is a multiply disabled person: tinnitus-buzzing, hard-of-hearing, chemobrained amputee (all due to treatment for bone cancer) with Crohn\u2019s disease (unrelated to bone cancer).

Boglands form from an overabundance of death: the laying down of preserved organic matter over thousands of years.  This accumulation of thick layers of peat is what makes a bogland a bogland. Peat\u2019s remarkable preservative powers make bogs the keepers of memories, secrets, and dreams; they are archives of information and protectors of artefacts.  They also are one of our greatest allies in the fight against climate change.  For thousands of years, they have cooled our global climate by absorbing carbon from the atmosphere. Merritt is a scientist, professor, and mom. For the past 30 years, she has led field expeditions across the far north to better understand the impacts of rapid climatic and landscape changes.

Drawing on ideas from his recently co-authored book, Lily in a Codebox: The Search for AI's Poetic Voice, speaker Lee Frankel-Goldwater takes us on a journey into new realms of poetic expression. What can artists and technologists discover together when exploring our creative potential in the age of AI? One thing is for sure, the poets and artists aren't going anywhere, and are more essential now than we ever were before. Lee is a devoted social innovator and environmental educator. His work explores how co-created approaches to community engagement can improve the design, implementation, and assessment of trans-boundary environmental initiatives. Recent projects include co-creating a community-based research initiative with Boulder Food Rescue, co-leading community development projects in Costa Rica and Israel with The Sustainability Laboratory, and researching rural community learning models w",

At 15,000 feet, she was responsible for planning, safety and keeping her team moving through conditions that tested every limit. But this talk isn't just about that expedition, it's about the chain reaction of uncomfortable decisions that got her there. The moments of staring down failure and choosing to keep going anyway. The deliberate practice of rewiring how she responded to discomfort, one small choice at a time. She reveals how resilience isn't built in the big dramatic moments everyone sees, it's built in the daily practice of choosing the harder path and she discusses how those small choices accumalate into the ability to handle what once seemed impossible.

Dabei nimmt sie die Zuseher nicht nur in die Welt des Balletts mit, sondern verr\u00e4t auch, wie jeder/r Einzelne KI beeinflussen und besser machen kann.  Simone Scholz bringt als KI-Expertin mit langj\u00e4hriger Erfahrung bei A1 und heute als engagierte Speakerin Klarheit in ein Feld, das oft von Schlagworten und \u00c4ngsten \u00fcberlagert wird. In ihrem TEDx-Talk beleuchtet sie die Schw\u00e4chen K\u00fcnstlicher Intelligenz \u2013 von Biases bis hin zu diskriminierenden Entscheidungen \u2013 und zeigt, dass die Ursachen h\u00e4ufig nicht in der Technologie selbst, sondern in den Daten und damit in uns Menschen liegen.

Wie das funktionieren kann, was es daf\u00fcr braucht und warum das BIP als Messgr\u00f6\u00dfe ausgedient hat, beleuchtet Christian Felber in seinem Talk.  Christian Felber ist \u00f6sterreichischer Autor, Gr\u00fcnder der Gemeinwohl-\u00d6konomie-Bewegung und international gefragter Referent zur Frage, wie Wirtschaft nicht nur Profit, sondern vor allem Menschen und Umwelt dienen kann. In seinem TEDx\u2011Talk erkl\u00e4rt er, wie die Gemeinwohl-\u00d6konomie \u2013 initiiert 2010 gemeinsam mit Unternehmen und zivilgesellschaftlichen Akteuren \u2013 ein alternatives Wirtschaftsmodell mit ethischer Marktwirtschaft, kooperativem Miteinander und nachhaltiger Wirkung beschreibt. Er zeigt, wie die Gemeinwohl-Bilanz Unternehmen dazu bringt, soziale und \u00f6kologische Werte messbar zu machen, statt allein dem Wachstum zu folgen, und weist den Weg zu einer Wirtschaft, die demokratische Teilhabe und Gerechtigkeit als Grundlage versteht.\nAutor, Aktivist, Universit\u00e4tslektor.\nInitiator der Gemeinwohl-\u00d6konomie ",

Renowned Bariatric & Metabolic Surgeon, Dr Mohit Bhandari, took a leap of faith that changed not only his life, but the field of bariatric surgery as we know it.\n\nIn this TEDx talk, Dr Bhandari recounts his journey - from venturing into an unplanned field of medicine to advancing groundbreaking medical innovations. Dr Bhandari is credited with some of the world\u2019s biggest technological marvel - performing the world\u2019s first tele-robotic bariatric surgery, establishing India\u2019s first hospital dedicated solely to obesity, introducing robotic surgery systems and building IRCAD India, a world-class training hub for surgeons from over 80 countries. Dr. Bhandari has turned what many called a detour into a revolution.\n\nThrough his story, he reframes the idea of success \u2014 showing how courage, vision, and a refusal to settle can transform not just a career, but an entire city\u2019s destiny.

You may think your brain is trying to rationalize and blame it on your impulse buying problems. However the reality is: it's not entirely your fault - there is foul play at hand.

        "description": "In the hustle and bustle of today's modern world, what meaning does literature bring to the table? Many fictional elements in books we read may seem superficial, outlandish and even exaggerated at times, but they have an even more profound significance and impact once we view them for what they reflect in our lives. Join us as Miss Hien Trang shares her journey of enlightenment - from having a narrow view of books to truly appreciating their nature and meaningful lessons - and shines a light on literature's ability not just as a story-telling device, but also as a means of communication between inner self, humanity and the world around us. In her highschool days, Hien Trang was not really into literature: \"What's the point of learning non-realistic things?\u201d. But then, an encounter changed her life. Through her speech, Hien Trang - now as an author - expressed how fiction, despite depicting an imaginary world, could shift our perspective on the currently pragmatic world. This talk was ",

        "description": "\"Have you ever told yourself: 'I'll be happy when...?'\" As humans, we tend to chase the idea of happiness far more than we think. We're attracted to the ideal future that retains our imagination of happiness that we often forget to stay in the present. Students may say, \"I'll be happy when I graduate\", and adults will mull over, \"I'll be happy once I settle down and have a family\". But are we happy now, in the current? Follow along as Mai Linh shines a light on the trap of ideal happiness and shares advice on how to escape such a mindset. A young spokesperson with much experience as an MC, Nguyen Mai Linh is a driven and confident student aiming to spread the same energy to the world.
