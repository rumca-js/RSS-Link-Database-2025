The file type also does not matter, it will not download them all regardless of the file types I have tested (MP3, M4A, MP4), and I&#39;m not sure why. </p> <p>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s user-error and there&#39;s just functionality I was unaware of, but the playlist is around like maybe 230-ish videos, and everytime I try to download it only around 70~ downloads start. That is not to say that out of 230 videos 70 download and the rest crash, this is not the case. Rather, the rest of those downloads will not even begin, which means for some reason the program will not even begin to download anything other than those first 70~ or so videos. </p> <p>These ",
