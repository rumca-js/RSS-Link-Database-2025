Not your product pages. Not your blog. Your collections.</p> <p>Here&#39;s why this matters: collection pages let you get really creative with how you structure pages and capture bottom funnel traffic at scale.</p> <p><strong>Think about how people actually search.</strong> They&#39;re not typing &quot;blue running shoe size 10&quot; into Google. They&#39;re searching &quot;best running shoes for flat feet&quot; or &quot;lightweight running shoes under 100.&quot;</p> <p>Those are collection page queries. And most brands are leaving this traffic on the table.</p> <p>The beauty of collection pages is you can create hyper specific versions targeting exact search intent. Same products, different presentation, 10 times more ranking opportunities.</p> <p>Example:",

The problem is the representative image (thumbnail) shown next to the search result is completely wrong.</p> <p>For example, if you search for a keyword like &quot;nanaobanana&quot;, you&#39;d expect to see a banana image for an AI image generator, right? That would be intuitive. But in my case, Google is picking up a random background graphic element from our landing page, which conveys zero meaning to the user.</p> <p>Our site is built with Next.js using SSR. I\u2019ve already:</p> <ol> <li>Registered the site on Google Search Console.</li> <li>Requested re-indexing multiple times.</li> </ol> <p>But the image remains the same. Does anyone know how to explicitly tell Google which image to use as the search thumbnail? Is this an <code>og:image</code> issue or do I need specific Schema markup?</p> <p>",
