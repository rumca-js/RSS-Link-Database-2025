During the heatwave, which peaked over Friday and Saturday, temperatures soared to between 10C and 12C above average, as low-lying parts of the country widely reached between 30C and 35C and exceeded 35C more locally. Israel\u2019s previous record for the latter third of November was 34.9C.</p><p>On Friday, temperatures reached 36.2C in Beit Dagan, near Tel Aviv, where the average November high is around 24C, while on Saturday they reached a peak of 37.3C in Eilat on the Red Sea coast, where the average is 27C. Though temperatures were less extreme at higher altitudes, they were still well above average; Jerusalem, at an altitude of more than 700 metres, reached around 27C, in comparison with an average November high of 19C.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com",

The two are inseparable: her story justifies the crackdown. It moralises the crackdown. And it silences criticism of the crackdown.
