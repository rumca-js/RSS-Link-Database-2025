As a result there\u2019s a capacity crunch on memory production, shooting the prices for RAM sky high, over 100 percent in the last few months alone. Multiple stores are tired of adjusting the prices day to day, and won\u2019t even display them. You find out how much it costs at checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s according to <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/stevelin.bsky.social/post/3m6au5t2mks2w\">BlueSky user Steve Lin</a>, who snapped a photo at Central Computers, a retail chain in central California. The store cites a global shortage in memory chips causing prices to change drastically every day. \u201cBecause of this, we can\u2019t display fixed prices on certain products at this time,\u201d reads the sign posted in front of a case full of Corsair RAM.

The two criteria I look for are 8GB of RAM and a large 1080p display, and this Chromebook delivers exactly that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most deals drop the available memory down to 4GB instead. More memory means that you can leave more tabs or applications running at any one time, which is one of those quality-of-life advantages you\u2019ll appreciate, like a more spacious seat on an airplane.
