My frustration with Windows and the whole Microsoft ecosystem was the initial push.

I have a MacBook, which I use for work and light gaming, an iPhone <em>(I\u2019ve been using one for 7 years and can\u2019t imagine switching to Android because of the ecosystem)</em>, and an iPad, which I mostly use for graphic design work.</p> <p><strong>My main question is: how secure and privacy-focused is the Apple ecosystem really?

Yesterday, an ad video started playing on my Echo device in the kitchen and I finally said &quot;That&#39;s it. You&#39;re getting sold or into the trash&quot;. I&#39;m only using it as a timer and music player, and can do without the voice commands. I also tolerated the random music for far too long, since I won&#39;t pay for Amazon Music.</p> <p>Are there standalone devices that can stream music playlists and random songs from e.g. Navidrome? I don&#39;t want to stream from my smartphone. I like a dedicated device with good speakers for a reasonable price, with a (simple) display.</p> <p>I&#39;m open to alternatives to Navidrome, of course. It just seemed like a good pick for audio streaming.
