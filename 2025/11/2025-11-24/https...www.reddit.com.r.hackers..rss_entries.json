        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Ryan, who positions himself as a \u201chacker\u201d and participates in cringe worthy interviews to project this persona, seems to fall into the Script Baby category. A closer look at his actions, knowledge, and portfolio reveals that he is not the hacker he claims to be. Instead, Ryan appears to be a \u201cscript kiddie\u201d or \u201cscript baby.\u201d Someone who runs pre-built tools created by others without true understanding or skill. His reliance on gadgets like the Flipper Zero and his unimpressive GitHub history paint a very different picture from the self-proclaimed hacker persona he tries to sell.</p> <p>A Hacker or Just a Script Baby?</p> <p>In interviews, Ryan often talks in vague terms about hacking techniques, pen-testing, and cybersecurity. Yet, his discussions are mostly limited to surface-level, general knowledge. This is a common red flag among script kiddies who want to be perceived as hackers without investing the time to master the underlying principles. Word",
