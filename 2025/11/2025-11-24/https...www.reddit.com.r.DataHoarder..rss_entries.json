I had google drive until yesterday, but i cancelled the subscription because my computer has conectivity problems and is too slow to load the data from the drive to the cloud and it would crash/internet fell so many times that uploading stuff was pointless. The computer It&#39;s from 2010 and works at a limit. It has 240 gb of ram, Internet crashes even with TP link, The speed is around 20MB at best and i could never upload anything without it collapsing. So it was pointless to have it. What could i do?

Most platforms don\u2019t give individuals a way to block scraping or control how their posts are used in AI datasets.</p> <p>I\u2019m considering building a browser extension (or web tool) that lets users type their post as usual, but when they publish it, the content is converted into an image with a visible watermark. The image is then posted instead of the raw text. The watermark could be designed to make automated scraping/OCR by AI models difficult, while keeping the text readable for any actual person\u2014so the content is accessible if someone wants to manually input it into any LLM, but not easily harvested at scale by bots.</p> <p>A few questions for the community:</p> <ul> <li>Is there something similar already being used or discussed?</li> <li>Would you consider usi",

Does saved chats get removed with users that have deleted their account? I tried contacting snapchat suppport but theyre kinda useless. They only said something in the line with saved chats cant be recoverable by anyone after account deletion but my account is still active so im wondering would our chat still be included in my data export?. Have a great day yall :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Green_Security_2731\"> /u/Green_Security_2731 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/1p56r4b/snapchat_and_data_export_tool/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre",
