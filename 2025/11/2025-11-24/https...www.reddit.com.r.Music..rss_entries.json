The band achieved 21 consecutive <em>Billboard</em> Top 40 hits, including three number-one singles, between 1969 and 1975. Yet many of their biggest hits, like &quot;Joy to the World,&quot; &quot;Shambala,&quot; or &quot;One&quot; are rarely played on any classic rock stations, playlists, nor known by a lot of people (even those above the age of 50). Nobody I&#39;ve talked to seems to know who they are either.</p> <p>Another contender, possibly a hot take, is 10cc. In the 1970s they scored multiple UK Top 10 hits, topped charts internationally, and were praised for their innovative studio work, songwriting, and blend of art rock and pop. Even though \u201cI\u2019m Not in Love\u201d remains a production landmark, the rest of their bigger hits like \u201cThe Wall Street Shuffle,\u201d \u201cDreadlock Holiday\u201d and &quot;The Things We Do For Love&quot; are rarely ever talked about in 70s rock, overshadowed by artists like Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin.</p> <",

I am thankful for his family, friends, fellow artists and coworkers who have shared his journey with him. To all his fans around the world, please know that your support was his strength throughout his whole career. He really appreciated each and every fan for their love. I also wanted to thank Dr. Couceyro and the whole medical staff, as they have been extremely supportive and helpful during this difficult process. Jimmy, my darling, may you rest in peace.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently found a new band called PlasticSkin, and I just wanted to share. Their sound blends grunge, alt rock, alt metal, and shoegaze.</p> <p>Many people often compare their sound to deftones and their appearance to sleep token. They just dropped their debut EP called A Light Thread Through Dark Cloth on September 18 and it&#39;s one of my favourite EP&#39;s of 2025.</p> <p>I started a subreddit for fans (<strong><a href=\"/r/PlasticSkin\">r/PlasticSkin</a></strong>) because I really believe they could grow \u2014 and I\u2019d love to talk to anyone else who discovers them.</p> <p>If you give them a listen, tell me what track is your favourite.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Studying_Radiology\"> /u/Studying_Radiology </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1p57158/a_new_band_you_might_love_if_youre_into_deftones/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Mu",
