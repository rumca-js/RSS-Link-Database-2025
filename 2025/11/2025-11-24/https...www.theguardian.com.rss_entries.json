Usman Khawaja\u2019s mid-game back problem was annoying for the player and potentially damaging for his team, until it wasn\u2019t. Clearing out the regular dry-powder opener created space in the final stanza of the Perth Test, allowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/22/australia-england-ashes-first-test-report-day-two-hosts-win-inside-two-days-travis-head\">Travis Head to finish off England</a> with the gory certainty and splatter count of a Mortal Kombat fatality move. Sometimes you mash the buttons and it all just works.</p><p>Consider an Ashes innings of 123 from 83 balls, on a bouncy pitch where two other players nudged 50, in an effort that did not just win the&nbsp;match, but has sent the opposition into a demoralising tailspin. So the fortuitous success creates a quandary about what to do next.</p> <",
