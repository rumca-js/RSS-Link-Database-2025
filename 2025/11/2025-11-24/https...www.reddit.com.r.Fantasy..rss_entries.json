Prose is the fundamental element from which all others are derived, the key differentiator for style and immersion in a story. Similarly to movies, where the visual language built by the director would be the most important element (since it&#39;s the &quot;how&quot; upon which the &quot;what&quot; is told), prose to me shows how good an author actually is at writing. At the end of the day, prose is writing in itself.</p> <p>That doesn&#39;t mean I cannot like books where the prose is not that good, but it is the first thing I will notice about a novel. Good prose doesn&#39;t need to be flowery/purple at ",

Their enemies are basically left as few unspecific groups that rarely are on scene together (Vin Thalun, Jehar, other basic warriors with shield and sword, Giants) and almost never consist of more than 1 specialized group.

Not the plot or the magic system or the characters, but the feeling of the world itself. Some books give me this strange sensation like the setting has its own emotional climate. Not just dark or bright, but something more textured . A kind of atmosphere that sticks to you even when you put the book down. I realized that a few worlds hit me like actual places instead of backdrops. For example there was one book where the forests felt lonely in a warm way. Not scary, not mystical, just this sense that the trees had seen too many travelers pass by and were quietly watching without judging. I remember closing the book and still feeling that same quietness inside me like the world had left its fingerprint on me. Another time I got the opposite with a city setting that felt impatient like it wanted its own story to move faster than the characters were moving. It sounds silly but",

She just read TJ Klune\u2019s \u201cThe House in the Cerulean Sea\u201d and Madeline Miller\u2019s \u201cCirce.\u201d</p> <p>Three of the major things she loved about both were first, the writing quality and world building of these fantasy worlds. Second, all their esoteric creatures (from Klune\u2019s book that was all the fantastical drakes and wyverns and from Miller\u2019s it was all the many obscure Greek mythological characters.) and finally, all the rich character development and large number of distinct characters. As well, she also likes a strong female MC, though this is less a determining factor and more a bonus. </p> <p>Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated, and please ask clarifying questions if I\u2019ve left something out!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Juji2558\"> /u/Juji2558 </a> <br/> <span",
