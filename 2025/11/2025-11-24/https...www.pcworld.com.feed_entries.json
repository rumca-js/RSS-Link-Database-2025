Some of the best discounts I\u2019m seeing have been for mini PCs, and that\u2019s perfectly fine with me because I absolutely love these tiny computers. They take up very little space on the desk, they offer excellent performance for the price, and they don\u2019t cost too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did I mention they\u2019re super easy to upgrade and they usually support at least three 4K displays? Now that\u2019s a fantastic way to increase your workstation productivity without breaking the bank!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the right deals can be tricky, however, because there are so many things to consider from the configuration to the price. Fear not! I\u2019ve been covering mini PC deals for a long time, so let me help you out.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-idg-base-theme-listicle-chart-block wp-block-product-chart product-chart\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-listicle-",
