One goes into debt to invest in the other\u2019s products who in turn goes into more debt to invest in the other\u2019s product continually paying off the debts of the others in an ever expanding debt bubble. It\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s happening because of course there are outflows \u2013 energy, materials \u2013 and inflows \u2013 both hardware and software \u2013 from outside of the ecosystem. I\u2019ve heard that that in net is not nearly enough, but betas can outstrip the market forever, beta-froth can go on forever. </p> <p>Human error due to information asymmetry, lack of closeness to real time data, and irrational exuberance ie yolo would be the butterfly effect. Nadella and Huang are smart though, they\u2019ve got good teams so error is not super likely but as the debt bubble gets bigger, the probability that it will pop goes up because errors are amplified",
