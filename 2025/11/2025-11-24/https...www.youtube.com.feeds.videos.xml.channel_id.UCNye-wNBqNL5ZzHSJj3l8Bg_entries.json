        "description": "A boy who grew up during Syria\u2019s war reveals the untold origins of the conflict and the fight for his nation\u2019s freedom.\n\nIn 2017, Al Jazeera broadcast a documentary by Clover Films that sought to highlight the true origins of the Syrian civil war. By that year, international sympathy for the rebel cause had diminished dramatically as Western media adopted the accepted mainstream position that groups such as al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front and even ISIL (ISIS) had been behind the revolution. (ISIL didn\u2019t even exist at the time of the uprising.) The Boy Who Started the Syrian War would change the narrative.\n\nNow, with the collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime along with its army and militia, the Shabiha, it\u2019s time to meet once again with the surviving characters from the original film. One of those is Mouawiya Syasneh, who had laid down his school satchel and picked up a gun to fight with the Free Syrian Army.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/AJSubscribe\nFollow us on X : https://t",

In a society where crime deprives children of their futures, some only see death as a way out.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s John Holman reports from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.\n\nSubscribe to our channel: http:",

        "description": "Somali soldiers on the frontlines in Lower Shabelle continue their fight against the armed group al-Shabab, regaining control of key areas such as the strategic village of Awdheegle. \nSupported by African Union forces and clan militias, they have reclaimed significant territory in southern and central Somalia over the past three years. However, the conflict remains protracted, with frontlines shifting and some towns repeatedly changing hands. \nCommanders emphasise the need to maintain momentum despite al-Shabab's evolving tactics and a challenging security landscape.\nThe Somali government aims to take full control of its security as international support diminishes. Training provided by the US, EU, and Turkiye has bolstered the military, but political divisions and varying strategies among international partners risk undermining progress. \nAlongside combating al-Shabab, the soldiers strive to rebuild trust with local communities, recognising the importance of winning hearts and minds ",
