From what people have said, the group was involved in extortion, coercion, blackmail, and manipulation of vulnerable people, usually through Skype or similar platforms. The person who supposedly ran it went by \u2018Lunatic808,\u2019 and he seems to have been the one coordinating most of the group\u2019s activity. A lot of stories describe the group as basically trapping people into compromising situations, then using threats, pressure, and psychological manipulation to control them. The really disturbing part is that the group has been linked to multiple deaths, but every article or post about it seems to have disappeared over time. What I\u2019m curious about is: \u2022 How exactly did this group operate day\u2011to\u2011day? \u2022 Was \u2018Lunatic808\u2019 ever identified or tracked? \u2022 Did police/FBI ever look into this group, considering the scale of what they w",

People often ask me why we can&#39;t get better cybersecurity, and this is one of those big reasons. In the US, politicians make it impossible for us to institute cybersecurity requirements broadly across all businesses. Even when we do, which is nearly impossible to begin with, they are often rolled back.

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I recently got into an argument on Reddit. The other person was essentially claiming that VPNs and ZTNA ultimately achieve the same goal: providing private access tied to identity. IPsec authenticates the user via the SA (Security Association), firewalls can enforce per-app rules, and a VPN can be locked down to /32s or App-ID policies, so there\u2019s no lateral movement. Meanwhile, ZTNA still relies on a gateway, still uses tunnels or proxies to move traffic, still exposes infrastructure to the internet, and still reveals whatever services an identity is allowed to reach. In their view, a \u201ctunnel is a tunnel,\u201d the mechanism doesn\u2019t matter, and a properly configured VPN delivers zero trust just as effectively.</p> <p>This morning, I was reading about &#39;Hackers Attacking Palo GlobalProtect VPN Portals with 2.3 Million Attacks&#39; - <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com/palo-alto-vpn-under-attack/#google%5C_vignette\">https://cybersecuritynews.com/palo-",

Honestly, I have some concerns:<br/> How much of what I\u2019m learning on TryHackMe actually applies to real-world hacking scenarios? Are some of these topics outdated or less relevant today?</p> <p>The reason I\u2019m asking is that the amount of material feels overwhelming and not just the topics but also the number of tools we need to learn. It seems like we\u2019re expected to be experts in everything. I\u2019m considering going deeper on my own, but maybe some areas and tools are more critical than others. If certain vulnerabilities or tools are rarely used in practice, does it really make sense to spend a lot of time mastering them?</p> <p>Any advice on prioritizing what\u2019s most important for practical, real-world penetration testing would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Klutzy-Ganache3876\"> /u/Klutzy-",

I couldn&#39;t submit it to a conference due to time constraints, but I didn&#39;t want to just throw it away, so I finally uploaded it (it took almost a year;;).</p> <p>What I propose in the paper is an anti-cheat system (more like an &#39;architecture&#39;) that can filter out cheating users with high accuracy without requiring kernel-level privileges.</p> <p>Anti-cheat systems usually require high privileges mainly to get more detailed information about the user side (even for detecting cheating systems, setting aside personal information).</p> <p>The main idea of the paper is to solve this problem without kernel privileges by using the consensus of the users who are playing the game together.</p> <p>This consensus is achieved through a vote on the result",

It also changes the port being used (everything from telnet to http) constantly. The only thing that remains constant is the mac address. I understand why firewalls don&#39;t allow blocking mac addresses on the wan port, but how does everyone handle this?
