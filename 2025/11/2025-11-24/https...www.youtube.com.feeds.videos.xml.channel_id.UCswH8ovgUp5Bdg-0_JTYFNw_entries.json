        "description": "In this deep-dive, I break down the latest twist in the Epstein saga: Congress has voted to force the release of the Epstein files, Trump has signed it, and now the establishment is scrambling. From national-security carveouts to sudden \u201congoing investigations,\u201d you can already see the machinery of power moving to limit what the public gets to see \u2014 and what they don\u2019t. We look at why this moment matters, what the political class is trying to shield, and how the fight over transparency reveals far more than the files themselves.\n\n[UNPACKED]\n\nENTER THE REBORN GIVEAWAY \u2014 I\u2019ve partnered with Reborn for a massive giveaway where you can win a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 392 plus $10,000 cash. I actually use several of their products myself \u2014 the Methylene Blue Tincture, Methylene Blue Capsules, Bovine Colostrum, and Creatine Powder \u2014 and all of those count as bonus-entry items if you grab them through the giveaway page.\nEnter here: https://tryreborn.com/pages/current-giveaway\n\nGo to https://rumb",
