        "description": "Technical artists are often the first line of defense for diagnosing in-game frame rate and memory problems, so it\u2019s important to establish efficient workflows for analyzing those issues and communicating clear optimization recommendations to the content teams. \n\nIn this session recorded at Unreal Fest Orlando 2025, Alyssa Reuter of Crystal Dynamics covers helpful out-of-the-box tools in Unreal Engine for diagnosing performance issues, engine modifications that Crystal Dynamics created to work more efficiently, and tools and pipelines the team made to quickly translate data into actionable recommendations. In addition, the session discusses common patterns to look for in profiles and how technical art can act on them.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#TechArt, #GameProfiling, #CrystalDynamics, #UnrealEngine, #UE5, #UnrealFestOrlando",
