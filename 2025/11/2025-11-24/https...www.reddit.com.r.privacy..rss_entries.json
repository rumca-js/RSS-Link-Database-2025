Mods of communities you participate in and redditors whose profile posts you engage with can still see your full profile for moderation.</p> </blockquote> <p>I know curating the profile is not foolproof. But at least it should give some privacy. </p> <p>If you go to Reddit&#39;s search bar and search using <code>author:&lt;reddit_username&gt;</code> you can see all posts and comments of any profile you want. This is no trick or hack or requires any technical knowledge.</p> <p>Now what&#39;s the point of curating the profile?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/reddit__is_fun\"> /u/reddit__is_fun </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1p59rji/reddit_curate_profile_breaking_using_reddits_own/\">[link]</a",
