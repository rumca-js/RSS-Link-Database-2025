In an effort to reduce waste is there an effective way to clean the cards so they&#39;re not in such rough condition? I saw a couple videos about cleaning cards that gave me some ideas. In one video they shook some cards in a paper bag filled with several tablespoons of corn flour and used a soft towel to clean the cards and in a second video a scrap booker used Stampin&#39; Mist and a soft towel to clean off the dirt. What has worked for other people? And before people start suggesting buying a new copy or sleeving the cards, yes, I know those are options, but I&#39;d rather see if there&#39;s a way to restore the games without creating further waste and I prefer not to use sleeves but I don&#39;t worship at the altar.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zangster\"> /u/zangster",

The deck is 611 cards. You try to make the funniest responses to prompts, and the deck has some &quot;punishment&quot; cards which are fun dares, or challenges that can turn up the laughs. I&#39;ve played this a ton with various groups in my town (Nashua, NH), and got nothing but smiles. The cards have a glossy finish, and are quite durable.</p> <p>We&#39;re just a few people in North East USA that came together to create something for people to enjoy together. We&#39;re not anywhere close to some big mega-corp. We want it to succeed so we can continue on our mission to bring people together.

The issue is clearly that three sides of the card are heated together and the top isn&#39;t (obviously to allow you to put a card into it). </p> <p>However, it seems like it would be a simple enough matter to heat the top edge before the two sheets of the sleeve are joined. If this happened, then when the sheets are joined later in the cycle, the top edge would be roughly the same thickness as the bottom edge and everything would balance out. </p> <p>Why isn&#39;t this done?

After the first game, a couple people needed an intermission, so I decided that I should show them <strong>The Gang</strong>. We only just played one round, when our server told us to put the game away. I didn&#39;t know that it&#39;s illegal to play games that have King, Queen, and Jack (Knave) in Kansas. The Gang also uses poker chips, so I can see that it looked like gambling.

Would definitely love to delve in Brass Birmingham but I face a huge problem while trying to get these games on the table and that is the language barrier. My group of friends are not fluent in English (some of them do not even speak English at all) and there are not many companies out there that publish their games or even translating them in Greek apart from Kaissa. So how do you guys teach a game to people that do not speak English and enable them to play such games? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Low-Lawfulness3845\"> /u/Low-Lawfulness3845 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1p5aw4z/boardgames_in_a_small_european_country_a_small/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/b",
