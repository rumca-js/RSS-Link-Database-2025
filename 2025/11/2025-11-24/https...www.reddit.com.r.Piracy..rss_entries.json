I&#39;d love to buy that full version, but you simply can&#39;t anymore.</p> <p>I noticed while moving files to the other storage that games, updates and patches are just files you can move from one drive to another. I&#39;m not familiar at all with 360 piracy, but I&#39;m wondering: Is it possible to load a game / dlc on to a USB and play it / transfer it to the console?

This law (AB 105/SB 130) has passed the Wisconsin House and resides with the Senate for final ratification. Michigan tried the same thing very recently, but the law didn\u2019t pass the House. This is already a significant issue in England.</p> <p>These laws are being enacted under the global push for ID verification to attempt to ensure minors can\u2019t get to sites deemed harmful to them. The legislation targets sites publishing or distributing material \u2018harmful to minors\u2019, although \u2018harmful to minors\u2019 has yet to be succinctly clarified with solid walls around the topic. Make no mistake: the attempt to ban VPN use has very little to do with age verification. The underlying driver for these laws is to ensure the government can see what any one of us is doing, and we cannot circumvent their desire for full surveillance.sff</",
