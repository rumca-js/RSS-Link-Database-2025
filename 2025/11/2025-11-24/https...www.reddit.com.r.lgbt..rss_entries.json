I was infuriated by the fact that, after the law was passed, I recently saw on TikTok that they were conducting raids to round up LGBTQ+ activists.

One point, I was telling my friend(at the time) that I didnt like her boyfriend calling me the f slur. This coworker overheard this and had a full crashout, yelled at me, called me the f slur repeatedly, and repeatedly cited the 1st amendment. I reported every incident, nothing happened. Well, he finally got fired and I am so happy that I can finally work in peace. I don&#39;t have to feel like I&#39;m walking on eggshells at work. Its much more peaceful without him there. </p> <p>P.S.
