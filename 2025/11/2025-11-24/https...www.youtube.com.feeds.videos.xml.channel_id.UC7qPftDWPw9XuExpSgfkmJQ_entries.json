        "description": "Nintendo didn\u2019t actually make Donkey Kong.\nThe game that created Mario was built by a Tokyo broadcast-equipment company called Ikegami Tsushinki; working from Miyamoto\u2019s design notes on 8-inch floppy disks.\n\nIn 1980, Nintendo\u2019s arcade flop Radar Scope left thousands of machines gathering dust in U.S. warehouses. Desperate to survive, they hired Ikegami to re-code the boards into something new. Three frantic months later, Donkey Kong was born; a mix of creative chaos, quick fixes, and pure brilliance.\n\nThe result? Nintendo\u2019s first worldwide hit\u2026 and a lawsuit that followed soon after.\n\n#DonkeyKong #Nintendo #RetroGaming #GamingHistory #Mario #VideoGameFacts #80sArcade #NostalgiaNerd",
