Channel 5 has revived the BBC\u2019s wildly influential and much romanticised drama strand Play for Today.

Four players dealt a hand of cards. Without turning them over, player one makes the first guess. \u201cJust one question. Does the suspect wear glasses?\u201d he asks. \u201cYes,\u201d replies player two. \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t have to pay for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d says player one. \u201cIt\u2019s Keir Starmer in the Cabinet Office with the suicidal tendencies.\u201d Yup. Keir had managed to sneak up on Keir inside No 10 and club himself to death with the lead pipe. It had been a long and agonising end. Every time Keir had shown signs of regaining consciousness, he had somehow found the strength to inflict further damage on himself. You could only admire his determination. Players two, three and four throw their cards on the table in disgust. If only they had got there first.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/nov/13/keir-starmer-labour-downing-street-ga",
