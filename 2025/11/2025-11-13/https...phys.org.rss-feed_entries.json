The success of a film relies not only on its artistic merits, but also on studios' operational decisions, particularly those related to a movie's initial box office release. A critical concern for the industry is how to manage movie piracy, a form of digital counterfeiting that undermines legal box-office sales.",

From 3D medical scans to robot orientations and AI transformations, much of today's data lives on curved geometric spaces, called Riemannian manifolds. Analyzing such data accurately has remained a challenge, especially when noise or outliers distort results.",
