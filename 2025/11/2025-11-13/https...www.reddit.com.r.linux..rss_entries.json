Used it off and on starting in 1994. Almost went full time in 2007.</p> <p>It&#39;ll be really interesting to see how the next version of Windows will do (Windows 12 possibly) since people are removing Windows 11, you&#39;ve already bought Windows 11. So it&#39;ll be interesting to see how the sales for the next version of Windows goes. I know Windows probably has a way to see how many people are currently using Windows on their computers and if they can see that now (I&#39;m sure they can) then those numbers are probably dropping as well. Not enough to make a significant impact but it&#39;ll be noticeable I&#39;m sure. </p> <p>So, welcome to the revolution everybody!!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Phydoux\"> /u/Phydoux </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://w",
