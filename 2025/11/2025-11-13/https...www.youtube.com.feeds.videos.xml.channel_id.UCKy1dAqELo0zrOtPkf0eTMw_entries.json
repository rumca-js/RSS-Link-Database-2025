Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner serve as executive producers, creators, and showrunners. Todd Howard, Bethesda Game Studios,",

Marvel Rivals has won over the Overwatch crowd, and Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls looks to get some love from the MvC crowd. Cosmic Invasion and Deadpool VR are dropping next month and 2026 is shaping up to be big with Marvel 1943: The Rise of Hydra and Insomniac\u2019s Wolverine. Plus, there\u2019s still Arkane Lyon\u2019s Blade game in the works. We\u2019ve certainly come a long way from the licensed cash-grabs that make up so much of the earlier games based on these beloved characters, which is very nice to see.
