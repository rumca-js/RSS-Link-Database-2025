        "description": "Dogs have become cherished members of our families, seamlessly integrated into our daily lives and routines. Our love for them runs deep, yet we often overlook their most fundamental needs. All too often, their well-being takes a backseat to the demands of human life. And while we may provide the basics we tend to neglect the deeper, more essential needs that truly support their health and happiness. Dogs have a remarkable way of teaching us about compassion, presence, and responsibility. Perhaps they\u2019re in our lives not just for companionship, but to remind us of what it means to care selflessly and live with intention. In this TEDxOldHickory talk Ali Hemyari, a world renowned dog training expert, shares firsthand insights drawn from working with thousands of dogs - including specialized working breeds and law enforcement canines. \n\nAli Hemyari is a dynamic and accomplished entrepreneur, having founded multiple successful companies within and outside of the pet industry.

Throughout her story, she explains that although education is often framed through a Western structure, true learning is much broader and includes understanding food as medicine, developing essential life skills, and carrying community values. Her message shows that education is not limited to classrooms or curricula, but is rooted in culture, identity, and reconciliation, offering a vision of learning that strengthens both individuals and communities.

She reflects on Lauren, her college roommate, and the unlikely friendship that shaped her.

In my heart and soul, I will never not be a camp counselor. I'm also a wife and a mom of a 10-year-old son, which happens to be my favorite role. I'm originally from upstate New York, and I live in Framingham with my family and my ridiculous dog, Hobbes. I'm the Director of College Counseling at Beaver Country Day School, and I've been in the college counseling/ admission world since I graduated from college.

Un profesor despert\u00f3 el gusto por la lectura, y desde entonces los libros, las personas y los gestos de confianza, formaron una red que impuls\u00f3 nuevas etapas. La escritura se convirti\u00f3 en refugio durante el desamor y en una forma de encontrarse a s\u00ed mismo, mientras comunidades literarias confirmaban que no estaba solo. A pesar de cr\u00edticas y momentos duros, otras manos extendidas lo llevaron a descubrir mundos, poetas y pa\u00edses donde su voz fue reconocida. Con perseverancia y fidelidad a la palabra, alcanz\u00f3 logros como viajar por varios pa\u00edses, publicar, ganar premios y entender que lo imposible es cuesti\u00f3n de tiempo.
