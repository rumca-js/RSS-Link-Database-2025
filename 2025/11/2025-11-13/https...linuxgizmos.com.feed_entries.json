        "description": "Arduino has released the Nesso N1, a compact IoT controller developed with M5Stack and built around the ESP32-C6. The device integrates a touch display, onboard sensors, and multiple wireless protocols inside a small enclosure aimed at rapid prototyping and portable embedded applications. The system is built around Espressif&#8217;s ESP32-C6 microcontroller, a single-core 32-bit RISC-V processor [&#8230;]",
