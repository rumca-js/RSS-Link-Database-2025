We consist of a small group of five employees and this is our shared hobby, so we are not a major publisher, nor do we have a massive marketing budget. Last week we had a successful launch of our crowdfunding campaign on Gamefound. </p> <p>We launched at a large board game convention and we were able to reach quite a lot of people during the first two days of our launch. Most of the board game developers and distributors from our personal circle told us the first few days of your launch are crucial. So we spent our time spreading flyers, inviting people to our stand, hosting test games and explaining the core mechanics and appeal of our game to the people that visited our stand. </p> <p>Our stand was a success, people were standing in line for a test game, started following us on instagram and gamefound. In the first two days we gathered most of our current pledgers. We are no",

This game doesn\u2019t have a lot of tutorials and it\u2019s new, but may be someone can help to understand one confusing (for me at least) action related to turn order? </p> <p>\u201cRearrange the player turn order markers any way you choose. Play continues with the player next in order (after your marker) in the new lineup.\u201d</p> <p>It seems to me that following this rule you can force someone to skip their turn? And someone will go twice? Let\u2019s say order is A (first), B, C, D. A did turn and B is doing this action rearranging like C, D, B, A so next will be A (who already had a turn) and C and D just skipped? </p> <p>Also (with one exception) game doesn\u2019t have ties. So if there is tie - no one gets reward. But what does it mean for third player? Lets say there is tie for 1 and 2 players (they both have 5 cubes), so they receive no bonus, but does it mean that third player with 4 cubes receives reward? It\u2019s a bit confusing. </p> <p>Thank you for your thou",

A deck of cards would be shuffled and either player (we were only 2, but it could be more players) would be dealt 3 cards with the rest being placed in a pile. Rock paper scissors would determine who went first. They would draw a card from the pile. The goal was to have 3 of a kind. Could be all red, all 7\u2019s, all spades, something like that, just 3 matching. You could only have 3 cards in your hand at a time so you had to decide if you would keep the new card and get rid of one of your original cards, or get rid of the new card.
