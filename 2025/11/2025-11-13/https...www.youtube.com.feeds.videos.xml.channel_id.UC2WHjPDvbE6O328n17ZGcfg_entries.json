And that's all this video is - it's not what you should do, or what operating system is best, but just my thoughts and what I've learned.\n\nCheck out Micro Center\u2019s Newest Store: https://micro.center/4a9879\nRead up Micro Center News: https://micro.center/f033f1\n\n[TIMESTAMPS]\n\nA portion of this video is sponsored by Micro Center.\n\nIf you're a developer, sign up to my free newsletter Dev Notes \ud83d\udc49 https://www.devnotesdaily.com/\n\nIf you're a student, checkout my Notion template Studious: https://notionstudent.com\n\nDon't know why you'd want to follow me on other socials.
