        "description": "The United States Congress will vote next week on forcing the release of all the case files in the Jeffery Epstein investigation.\n \nIt comes hours after Democrats on the committee published emails written by the convicted sex offender that referenced President Donald Trump and the photograph of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor with the known Epstein victim, Virginia Giuffre.\n \nThe e-mails also appear to show Andrew pleading with Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell to make sure that he was not involved in the allegations against them.\n \nThe White House has accused democrats of trying to smear the President and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has always strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#JeffreyEpstein #EpsteinFiles #BBCNews",
