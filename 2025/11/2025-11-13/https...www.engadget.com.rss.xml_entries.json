The possible origins of the term \u201cwhite elephant\u201d provide one way of looking at it: According to legend, the King of Siam would give a white elephant to courtiers who had upset them. It was a far more devious punishment than simply having them executed. The recipient had no choice but to simply thank the king for such an opulent gift, knowing that they likely could not afford the upkeep for such an animal. It would inevitably lead them to financial ruin.<br><br>Whether or not that story is true, it gives us one way of looking at a white elephant gift: something just useful or amusing enough that it won\u2019t immediately get tossed into the trash, but is also somewhat of a burden. However, there are plenty of other ways of interpreting this strange yet delightful tradition.",

The gaming legend made the announcement at a Disney+ event in Hong Kong alongside series director Sano Takayuki. It will be the first Kojima Productions&#39; partnership with a global streaming platform, with Kojima serving as an executive producer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The series will tell a new story set within the Death Stranding universe and not draw from any of the games&#39; narratives. All we know so far is that it &quot;will follow a young man and woman as they set out on an adventure&quot; and that traditional hand-drawn 2D animation will be used. Concept art displayed at the event was created by <em>Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045</em> character designer, Ilya Kuvshinov.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents",

The streaming service is rolling out recaps for audiobooks that can summarize the story up to where a user stopped listening. Recaps will be available once a user has gotten 15 to 20 minutes into the audiobook and will be updated to reflect the point the listener has reached without spoiling anything yet to come. It could help listeners to finish audiobooks they haven&#39;t revisited in awhile without needed to restart from the beginning, and it might be handy just to refresh your memory on the plot.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an AI-powered feature, but Spotify noted that it will not be training any large language models on authors&#39; content or developing voice generation from narrators&#39; performances.
