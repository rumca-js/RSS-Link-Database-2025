Although I have never managed to play the \"main\" Blood Bowl game, I have played its \"little brother\" Blitz Bowl extensively instead. In this post, I present to you my collection of painted teams: Skaven, Undead, Orcs, Humans, and Dark Elves. Tutorials and tips are also included.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/11/showcase-stahlys-blitz-bowl-team-collection/\">Showcase: Stahly&#8217;s Blitz Bowl team collection</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
