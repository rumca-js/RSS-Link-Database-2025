I&#39;m sorry if this question/post is too repetitive.</p> <p>But I really value stability and performance over anything else. Right now I&#39;m on Opera GX, which, isn&#39;t great, because I&#39;ve been having issues with the ANGLE graphics backends. Every single one of the backend options. And then it&#39;s just bad performance, and obviously privacy issues.</p> <p>So, what are browsers with very good performance and stability? Specifically on Windows 11. I know it kind of depends a bit on your hardware, some people could have a very different experience than someone else.</p> <p>Also, I&#39;d love it if it updates automatically, has the bookmarks and speed dial features, isn&#39;t built on Chromium, and is from trusted people that don&#39;t sell your data. But those are just nice optional bonuses.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",
