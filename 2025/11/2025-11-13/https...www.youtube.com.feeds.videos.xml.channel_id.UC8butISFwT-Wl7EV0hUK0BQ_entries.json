        "description": "Learn discrete mathematics in this beginner's course. Discrete mathematics plays a key role in IT solutions, used in machine learning, accelerating queries in search engines and databases, in algorithms such as finding the shortest paths (graph theory), encryption, compression, and many other modern systems/solutions.\n\nThis field is constantly evolving along with the development of its key application: computer science. This course is an introduction to this group of mathematical sciences, and we will focus on the most important issues on which other branches of discrete mathematics are based: combinatorics, number theory, prime numbers, and several selected topics: pigeonhole principle, stars and bars principle, Stirling's number, and the Chinese remainder theorem. At the end of the course, there are tips and encouragement for further exploration of this field.\n\nKarol Kurek teaches this course. He is a former math teacher and senior Python developer.\n\nContact: http://karolkurek.pl\nYT",
