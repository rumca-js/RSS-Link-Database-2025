        "description": "When it comes to city-builders, the Anno franchise is the only major AAA series still surviving these days, and  the series has further capitalised on this with the release of Anno 117: Pax Romana. Unlike the previous title that focused on the industrial revolution, this time around we get to go back to the past and help build out the Roman Empire. \n\nIt is worth noting that while Anno 1800 has a lot more content thanks to the plethora of expansions it got, Anno 117: Pax Romana is still a great way to get into the franchise, and even the genre, thanks to the excellent streamlining that helped in further refining the gameplay without sacrificing the depth that one would expect in building and managing a city. \n\nThe fact that the setting also takes us further into the past also means that supply chains can still remain complex without getting out of hand, with factories needing multiple refined materials, for example.",

        "description": "Dispatch's visuals and music are top-tier, the former making each episode feel more like a high-quality animated TV show than a game on most occasions. However, I was also very impressed by the cinematography, editing and overall cutscene choreography. Even without the choices and gameplay, this would be a highly compelling show to watch in its own right. With them, it's a superhero story that's simply impossible to resist.\n\nEven after the positive reception to its first two episodes, I never thought AdHoc Studio would build on that momentum and deliver one of my favorite stories \u2013 video game and otherwise \u2013 of this year. Dispatch is just so packed with such passion, be it in the writing, performances and presentation, that it's almost impossible to put down. Where Robert, Z-Squad and the SDN go from here remains to be seen, but this is a narrative adventure that you simply owe it to yourself to experience.",

In case you missed it, Todd Howard announced an Anniversary Edition for the role-playing game to celebrate its tenth anniversary.  \n\nThis isn't out of left field for the company \u2013 see Skyrim Anniversary Edition \u2013 but also, memes aside, must Bethesda continue to trot out its older games, repackaging and reselling them for no other reason than that people will buy them regardless?",
