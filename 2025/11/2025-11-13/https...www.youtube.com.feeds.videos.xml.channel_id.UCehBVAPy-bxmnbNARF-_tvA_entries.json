The report omits key grocery items from their methodology and inaccurately asserts that the average breakfast grocery costs have dropped over the past year.\n\nWe compared Doordash's report to official data on grocery prices. Here's what the numbers actually show.",

They're demanding a fair union contract with better hours, higher pay, and a resolution to the thousands of unfair labor practice charges they've filed against Starbucks for union-busting.\n\nWorkers say that finalizing a fair contract would cost Starbucks less than one typical day of sales.",
