Here is patriarch Esteban, whose wild desires and political machinations are tempered only by his love for his ethereal wife, Clara, a woman touched by an otherworldly hand. Their daughter, Blanca, whose forbidden love for a man Esteban has deemed unworthy infuriates her father, yet will produce his greatest joy: his granddaughter Alba, a beautiful, ambitious girl who will lead the family and their country into a revolutionary future.</p> <p><strong>The ",

Itd be great to have like a series on sale, or bundle deals. Wouldn\u2019t they sell more? Like \u201cget all 3 for $20\u201d or \u201call 5 books for $25!\u201d. I have to imagine you\u2019d probably receive more sales and promotional opportunities with flash sales and stuff - sorta like Steam. Honestly I RARELY see it.</p> <p>The consumer would probably adapt to the mentality of \u201ci wasn\u2019t sure about that series but maybe i\u2019ll pick it up since the whole trilogy is on sale!\u201d</p> <p>Wouldn\u2019t that just support sales and reading in general for the long term? Why do they not do this? I\u2019d have to assume its something to do with the individual publisher\u2019s restrictions on pricing, but honestly I\u2019m sure they could work that into the contracts.</p> <p>Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddi",
