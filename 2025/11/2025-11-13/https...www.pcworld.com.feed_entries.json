For 2025, I\u2019d expect to see predominantly Thunderbolt 4 and USB4 (the generic equivalent) docks to be on sale this holiday season, since Thunderbolt 5 docks are generally aligned with gaming PCs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve listed each dock deal below, together with an explanation of why I picked them. Although I check multiple retailers and e-tailers, most of the top deals in years past have been on Amazon.

Turkey Day is coming, and with it the yearly smorgasbord of consumerism that is Black Friday. It\u2019s your best chance to find monitor deals before the holidays, and there are already plenty of them going around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve checked all of the deals below for accuracy, value, and, you know, whether they\u2019re actually worth getting in the first place. (We have decades of experience with monitor reviews, so we know our stuffing.) Since deals often come and go as promotions expire or stock runs out, we\u2019ll also be regularly updating our deal picks to make sure they\u2019re fresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, in <s>no particular order</s> a very specific and carefully considered order, are the best monitor deals you\u2019ll find before Black Friday.

Even better, some of these products are dropping to their very best prices, or, in some cases, to brand new lows.
