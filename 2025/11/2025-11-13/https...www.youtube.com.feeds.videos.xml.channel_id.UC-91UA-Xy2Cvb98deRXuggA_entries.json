        "description": "Job interviews are completely cooked. One hiring manager says a simple \u201cI\u2019m good, thanks\u201d shows no initiative. Another says answering with enthusiasm is \u201cperformative.\u201d Then someone else demands military-level bed discipline as proof of character. Apparently the modern interview is a psychological maze where every normal response is somehow wrong.\n\nIn this video, we dive into the contradictions of interview advice, where every \u201ctip\u201d sounds like satire and common sense has been replaced with corporate clown tests. From managers who want ChatGPT-level monologues on demand to founders who expect unpaid-founder commitment from candidates, it\u2019s peak workplace absurdity.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why getting a job feels like auditioning for a role you didn\u2019t ask for, this one\u2019s for you.\n\nNeed a resume / cover letter? \u27a1\ufe0f https://joshuafluke.store\n\u2022 \ud83d\udd0d Resume Reviews\n\u2022 \u270d\ufe0f Custom Resumes\n\u2022 \ud83c\udf93 Courses: Hacking the Resume & Interview\n\u2022 \ud83d\udcde 1-on-1 Consults\n\n\ud83d\udcac Join the Discord: https://discord.gg/Joshu",
