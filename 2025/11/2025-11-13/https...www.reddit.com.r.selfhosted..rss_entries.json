I also plan to add an NVR with AI, tvheadend with three sources, Jellyfin, Immich, and an LLM container. It would be nice if I could start on a small budget now and upgrade bit by bit later.

I&#39;d like to take advantage of my little a310 for some AV1 encoding but running into an issue with debian, ffmpeg versions and oneVPL or vaapi. Jellyfin gets away with this containerized I guess because it can control it&#39;s environment and not rely on machine dependencies. My goal would be to input basically any video codec and output another codec including AV1.</p> <p>A Google search didn&#39;t comeback with any recently maintained projects, so just wondering if anyone knows about something. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Standard-Recipe-7641\"> /u/Standard-Recipe-7641 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ovvl7h/media_encoding_docker_container_that_supports/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ovvl7h/media_encoding_docker_container_that_supports/\">[comments]</a></span>",
