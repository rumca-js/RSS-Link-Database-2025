        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The Call of Duty: Black Ops games lean into fantasy and often surprise with a mind-bending narrative, and the Black Ops 7 campaign is no exception. It's themed around the enemy using fear as a weapon, and you're dropped into a storyline filled with hallucinations of monsters, trippy locations, and bizarre scenarios. This is a specific flavor of Call of Duty story that only developer Treyarch has shown the capacity to tell, and despite a few stumbles, the Black Ops 7 campaign does enough to leverage the potential of its more psychological narratives, while also moving the satisfying shooter gameplay into a new framework.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Confusingly enough, Black Ops 7 takes place over 40 years after the events of last year's Black Ops 6 and 10 years following the events of Black Ops 2. The story is set in 2035 as a direct sequel to Black Ops 2, and it brings back David Mason from that game as the main protagonist. In Black Ops 7, you see the effects of Black Ops 2's canoni",

Equipped with a versatile chemical sprayer, you'll also cleanse the colony of the deadly fungi contaminating its every nook and cranny--a first-person cleaning process that's both cathartic and urgent, as you cycle through nozzle types and chemical agents to fight back against a hostile ecosystem by clearing it away.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">As a sci-fi cleaning game, Ambrosia Sky is relatively novel.
