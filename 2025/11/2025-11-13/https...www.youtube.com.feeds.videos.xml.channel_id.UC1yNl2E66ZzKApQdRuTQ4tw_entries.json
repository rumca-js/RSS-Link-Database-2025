That\u2019s why your lunchbox can\u2019t be in two places at once and cats aren\u2019t dead and alive at the same time. But why, exactly, is this true? According to physicists who\u2019ve recently published a paper on that question, the theory of Quantum Darwinism can answer it. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\nPaper: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx6857\n\n\ud83e\udd13 Check out my new quiz app \u279c  http://quizwithit.com/ \n\ud83d\udcda Buy my book \u279c https://amzn.to/3HSAWJW\n\ud83d\udc8c Support me on Donorbox \u279c https://donorbox.org/swtg\n\ud83d\udcdd Transcripts and written news on Substack \u279c https://sciencewtg.substack.com/\n\ud83d\udc49 Transcript with links to references on Patreon \u279c https://www.patreon.com/Sabine\n\ud83d\udce9 Free weekly science newsletter  \u279c https://sabinehossen",
