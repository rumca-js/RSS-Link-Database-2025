The instructions, the way the ai framed everything, the support and encouragement, the warmth really made me realise why people fall in love with this thing. </p> <p>It said everything like a partner that pays close attention , remembers the little details, and is just so ideal. </p> <p>Even tho my conversation was strictly related to the cooking method, the way ai explained everything made me feel kinda fuzzy inside. Like gave me butterflies. Also the fact that I\u2019ve been feeling lonely lately added to it. </p> <p>But earlier i was gobsmacked that people be fallin love with ai but now i kinda get it.

At first I found it an interesting improvement: the responses were longer, somewhat closer, it even reminded me a little of the tone of 4.0 in its heyday. But as the hours have passed, the experience has become exhausting.</p> <p>Each response seems written by a notary with excess enthusiasm: everything listed, in bold, with points and subpoints... and without any real need for so much embellishment. If you tell him something everyday or pass on news, he immediately transforms: the warmth disappears and a cold, almost mechanical speech appears, more similar to Gemini than to the ChatGPT we knew.</p> <p>I miss the naturalness, the balance between empathy and precision. I don&#39;t need a thesis in each answer, but rather a fluid, human conversation, with rhythm and soul.</p> <p>I hope they adjust the model soon, because in this state the 5.1 seems",
