Basically a feeder that moves cards one by one past a camera. The camera would record video, and I\u2019d process that to identify the cards. </p> <p>The problem: my lack of knolwdge around cameras and lenses</p> <p>From my research, a global shutter camera (possibly the Raspberry Pi global shutter camera) seems like a good fit for capturing fast moving cards.</p> <p>However, I\u2019m worried about the limited space inside the device. I\u2019d like it to be compact, but I\u2019ve read that these cameras/lenses need a certain distance to focus and get the right field of view. In my build, the camera might only be 10 cm or less from the card.</p> <p>How can I make this work at such a short distance? Any advice on lens choices, camera modules, or setup would be really appreciated.</p> <p>T",
