You play as a fighter jet, shooting down other aircraft in the desert, and the main(?) boss is a giant coiled-up cobra that will escape if it takes too much damage\u2026 I think. I never got to play the game; some kid named Chance spent all his tickets on computer time, and would only play this game. All we could do was watch. I don\u2019t think he ever beat it, but apparently he played it the year before too (teacher moved up a grade with many of his students and used the same classroom; I was the new kid). I\u2019m pretty sure I found the name in my early twenties and then FORGOT. I cannot find it again bc the Internet is now different.
