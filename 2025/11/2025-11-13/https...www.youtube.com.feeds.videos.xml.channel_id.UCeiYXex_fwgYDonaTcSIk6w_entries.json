It turns out that most researchers now think that _Smilodon populator_ had a short tail rather than a long tail, but we didn\u2019t catch that in time for the first poster print. We changed it for the video, and we\u2019ll change it for future printings of the poster!\n\nThe feline family is a hugely diverse group of lions, panthers, and \u2013yes\u2013 kitties that have spread all over the world. MinuteEarth explains who they are and how they\u2019re related.\n\nSUPPORT MINUTEEARTH\n**************************\nIf you like what we do, you can help us!:\n- Become our patron: https://patreon.com/MinuteEarth\n- Our merch: http://dftba.com/minuteearth \n- Our book: https://minuteearth.c",
