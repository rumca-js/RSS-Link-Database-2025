I&#39;ve been working on a project for several months by myself to recapture some of that early internet magic that I miss. </p> <p>I&#39;m pleased to invite you to check it out at <strong>HomePageAgain.com</strong>! This is my attempt to bring back the weird, creative internet we grew up with. The one that felt personal and vast. Think MySpace meets GeoCities and modernized with a touch of love for features I&#39;ve personally always dreamed were there.</p> <p>You get your own pixel home (and can wander a graphical neighborhood to visit others!), join ThreadRings(communities that can actually branch and evolve) and just\u2026 exist online without algorithms, ads, or data tracking.</p> <p>You can fully customize your profile page, or even build your own little webpage in its place.</p> <p>It\u2019s a place for express",
