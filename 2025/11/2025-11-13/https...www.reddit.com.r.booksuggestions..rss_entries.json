        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been reading comics and manga for around 20 years, but only got into actual novels earlier around March this year. Since then I&#39;ve read nearly all of the Cosmere books before starting to feel a little burnt out, so I was looking for something a little less fantasy and a little more scifi. I found Red Rising, which I enjoyed, but not as much as Sanderson&#39;s books. I then found Dungeon Crawler Carl which I absolutely love, and was a great contrast to the more serious Cosmere books.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been considering some of the Warhammer books as I already collect and paint Orks but I feel like those are more standalone stories when I&#39;m really looking for a long running series that could scratch that Cosmere or Dungeon Crawler Carl itch.</p> <p>EDIT: I travel a lot for work, so I tend to do a 50/50 mix of both physical book while at home or in hotels, and audiobook while driving so the narrator would have to be good too.</p> </div><!--",

I won\u2019t spoil but a huge part of the book that made me love it was the dynamic of one part of it being phycological (LOVE the phycological aspect) and the other side being physical.

Also Darkmotherland, though I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it supernatural. More recently read Mistborn 1 and 2, found 2 to be too long and overall worse edited and worse written. Planning on reading Mistborn 3.</p> <p>Also good with sci-fi. Have read the first three Red Rising books and Le Guin\u2019s Lathe of Heaven &amp; Word for World is Forest. Read Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide as a boy, loved it.</p> <p>Horror is cool. Read Ring Shout, didn\u2019t think it was great but the premise was awesome. The Shining and Doctor Sleep. Now trying Lovecraft, only read a couple short stories so far.</p> <p>I say supernatural fiction because I like those ideas. Either that people have sort of evolved over time, or some are ",
