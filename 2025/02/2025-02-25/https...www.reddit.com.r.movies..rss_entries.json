All of it is played out like a stage play, with the action occurring over the course of dinner party. A lot happens in the dialog, philosophies are challenged and characters wrestle with their morals. Whenever I see this I am engaged the whole time. Cameron Diaz and others in the cast are good, but Perlman steals the movie. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/onepostandbye\"> /u/onepostandbye </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iy7alo/one_of_my_favorite_ron_perlman_movies_the_last/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iy7alo/one_of_my_favorite_ron_perlman_movies_the_last/\">[comment",

Rather than focusing on what you&#39;re hearing or what characters are saying, the scene uses silence to make things feel more uncomfortable. Long pauses in dialogue where there&#39;s more to read from what isn&#39;t being said and the stretch of silence rather than what is being said. What are some movie scenes that pull this off really well? </p> <p>The Shining stands out as a really strong example. There&#39;s a scene with Jack and Grady that has plenty of silent moments in between conversation. Just long awkward pauses within the conversation that really made the scene feel more eerie. Sometimes it isn&#39;t about what&#39;s being said but what isn&#39;t that can add a lot to a scene.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/squallLeonhart20\"> /u/squallLeonhart20 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iy3cm1/movie_scenes_that_used_silence_",

Apparently, Ronald Reagan liked the Rambo sequels which doesn&#39;t put these films in a positive light. </p> <p>Part II wasn&#39;t even good. The point of the first film was a critique of fascism, of how veterans are not taken care off and become social outsiders bcause the Government refused to do its part. Part II almost completely forgot what the first film said, didn&#39;t get John Rambo is not G.I. Joe and basically turned the sequels into the antithesis of the crux of the original. Part II is generic, formulaic and violent. ",

There&#39;s a scene where Alan Grant is having raptors explained to him, while in the background, John Hammond is having a separate conversation. Both conversations are audible, but as the audience, you naturally focus on Grant\u2019s, which is more relevant to the plot. This layering of dialogue makes the world feel more lived-in, like we\u2019re overhearing real people rather than just following a scripted exchange.</p> <p>In <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>, that moment with the translator, Upham, works similarly. His nervous, clumsy energy contrasts with Captain Miller\u2019s (Hanks) composed discussion, reinforcing their dynamic. The overlapping dialogue makes it feel like you\u2019re eavesdropping rather than being spoon-fed exposition, adding a level of realism that pulls you deeper into the scene.</p> <p>Spielberg does this in <em>Jaws</em>, too\u2014think about Br",
