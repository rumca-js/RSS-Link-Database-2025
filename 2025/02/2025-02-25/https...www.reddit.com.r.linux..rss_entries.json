I have 2 different displays. Laptop and a ultrawide. When I turn on fractional scaling, the entire screen layout breaks. Full screen applications are rendered FAR outside of my screen. It is completely unusable.<br/> I try to use some hotfixes like increasing font size and manually adjusting some menu or icon sizes. But still, a lot of applications are displayed badly. Text is cut off, icons are mispositioned, elements are not readable, other ui elements are way too small. You probably know the deal.</p> <p>I was on Ubuntu 24 (i think i tried wayland and xorg) and now I am on Mint.</p> <p>Now to my questions:</p> <p>- Is there a way to get fractional scaling working properly with any Linux Distro?
