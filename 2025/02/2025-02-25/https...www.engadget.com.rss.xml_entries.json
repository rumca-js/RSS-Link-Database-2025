They can also help keep tabs on your pets\u2019 actions or let you check in on other parts of your property like your backyard. Set them up outdoors or at a window and you can get notifications when someone\u2019s delivering a package or heading to your door.<br><br>Of course, anything that takes footage in and around your home is a privacy risk, so you\u2019ll want to look for security cameras with proper privacy features. And if you\u2019ve already got some smart devices, it\u2019s important to know whether your new camera will work with them. Some cameras are practically useless without a subscription, while with others, the subscription is just nice to have.
