So far, the experience has been waaaaaay smoother than even Windows 10, and feels a lot better after upgrading from a 550ti to a 4060ti. However, Some games don&#39;t seem to be working correctly with frame generation, yet everything else is spotless or at least close to. When playing games like Dying Light 2, dlss upscaling works extremely well but the frame generation option just doesn&#39;t show up whatsoever. On the other hand, Witcher 3 when playing on Proton-GE I have strange stutters that don&#39;t seem linked to the fps, almost as if vsync is forced but my fps isn&#39;t capped. Is there some way I can iron these issues out, as I would like to make full use of my GPU. Just for interest sake, frame generation actually does work properly, because in Cyberpunk and Portal RTX they both work th

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is this game that I remember playing on my hand-me-down laptop that ran Linux and used Ubuntu. Given how it was quite a few years ago my memory might fail me it was sometime around 2009-2010 however the laptop would be quite a bit older early 2000?.</p> <p>In the game you would fly a spaceship in the shape of a cursor but without the tail bit if you get me, it was 2d and from what I remember it was sandbox style where you would just fly around and destroy stuff, the graphics were super simple most likely 8-bit. I believe you would also be able to land the ship and walk around. The most similar modern game I could compare it to would be Noita but without all the magic and sprinkle in sci-fi instead.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Filetex"> /u/Filetex </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1ixvxyf/trying_to_find_old_linux_game/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span
