I need to read something a little lighter, but I still really enjoy books with a strong sense of meaning and importance, with a profound takeaway. Something that moves me. Not like comedy, though. Sorry if this is a little vague, I&#39;m having trouble expressing the certain type of book I want to read. I haven&#39;t read a lot of the &quot;classics&quot; or widely-read books, so it&#39;s okay to suggest them.

However I recently found out that my wife is pregnant with kid #2. I figured this was a good time to try and catch up on some books. I cancelled my gamepass subscription and instead am using that money towards audible. So I plan on listening to the game of thrones collection first bc I&#39;ve put it off for forever. However I&#39;ll have plenty of time to read and listen to books throughout this pregnancy and paternity leave. I was hoping people could recommend some good horror books or creature feature books. I&#39;ve read all the Stephen King classics and Pete benchley/Steve alten shark and ocean creature books. But any recommendations that people could give for me to add to my list would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone and wish me luck!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/med4l",
