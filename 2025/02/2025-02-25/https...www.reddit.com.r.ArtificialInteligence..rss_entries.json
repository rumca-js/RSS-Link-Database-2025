The AI worked relatively well, but of course I had to debub some stuff on my own.</p> <p>Que to a few days ago, I saw that I could upload files to some of these models?? The data i&#39;m looking at is public, so I decided, &quot;hey, why not,&quot; and went ahead and directly inputed the spreadsheet into the model. And with literally 2 clicks and a quick prompt, the model spit out a whole months work of time in 2 seconds. At that moment, I felt so stupid yet extremely exited. </p> <p>Anyways, I feel like AI is accelerating extremely fast that it&#39;s hard for me to keep up. I also feel like I found a pot of gold, and I&#39;m keeping said pot of gold secret from my supervisors who have 0 AI literacy. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NeptuneTTT\"> /u/Neptu",

I think it&#39;s important to recognize that analogies have their limits, especially the ones people use to characterize the progress being made with AI.</p> <p>Take spaceflight - people rightfully point out that people thought we were 1000 years away from manned space flight mere decades before we achieved it, and that we went from manned spaceflight to a man on the moon in under a decade. People usually mention this when talking about what&#39;s around the corner with AGI/ASI, but I can&#39;t help but see this analogy as a reason to both avoid expectations and unnecessary pessimism.</p> <p>If you were a futurist in the 1970s, you have every reason to be expect that interplanetary travel, moon bases, and martian colonies were right around the corner.

Not because it\u2019s the best model, but because no other AI knows me this well.</p> <p>Every interaction refines how it understands me. If I switch, I don\u2019t just lose access\u2014I lose the memory it\u2019s built of my preferences, my reasoning, even my quirks. It\u2019s like starting over in a relationship where the other person has zero recollection of who you are.</p> <p>I call this <strong>Context Lock-In</strong>. AI doesn\u2019t just get better over time; it gets better <em>for you specifically</em>. And that creates a problem:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Personalization Depth</strong> \u2013 Every prompt shapes how it thinks about me.</li> <li><strong>Cognitive Efficiency</strong> \u2013 No need to re-explain. It already knows.</li> <li><strong>Path Dependency</strong> \u2013 My thinking adapts to its responses.</li> <li><strong>Switching Cost</strong> \u2013 A &quot;better&quot; AI isn\u2019t better if I have to retrain it from scratch.</li> </ul",

The free version is already wildly inaccurate, and the premium one does not seem to offer anything that justifies the price unless you are an AI nerd with too much disposable income.</p> <p>The only real selling point is Google service integration, but let\u2019s be real. Is that worth a monthly fee when ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Grok exist? Even if ChatGPT is not the best at everything, it is at least consistently decent across multiple tasks, and its pricing does not feel like a scam.</p> <p>Google doesn&#39;t seem to be putting in serious effort to make Gemini a strong competitor in the AI space. Google is not innovating or competing seriously but still expects users to pay for Gemini.</p> <p>What do you think?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/PoindexterXD\"> /u/Poindexte",
