In addition, Macbeth is one of the more ubiquitous of Shakespeare’s plays (if such a thing is possible) and is studied in anglophone schools the world over. It’s shorter than some and contains a multitude of phrases and words that have since become common parlance. All of which makes Macbeth not only a great introduction to Shakespeare but an important entry in the history of the written word. “It will have blood, they say: blood will have blood.” So, why watch this particular version of Macbeth?
