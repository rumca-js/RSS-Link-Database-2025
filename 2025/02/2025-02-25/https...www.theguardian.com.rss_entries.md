<p>The birthday boy Ismaïla Sarr ended Crystal Palace’s wait for a home victory as Adam Wharton starred on his return from injury to deal a major blow to Aston Villa’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League again.</p><p>It was a night when everything seemed to go Oliver Glasner’s way as Unai Emery saw his side succumb to a seventh defeat in their last nine away matches in the Premier League. Having found a way back into the game at the start of the second half thanks to an equaliser from Morgan Rogers after he had seen another goal disallowed for the narrowest of offsides, Villa were blown away as Jean‑Philippe Mateta and Sarr’s second on the Senegal forward’s 27th birthday sealed only a third league win of the campaign at Selhurst Park for Palace.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/25/crystal-palace-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fabian Hürzeler refuses to discuss potential European qualification for this Brighton side, but the prospect is looking increasingly likely after winning three successive Premier League matches for the first time since 2023. In a thrillingly congested top-half scrap, Brighton are now up to eighth, just one point off a fifth place that will almost certainly provide Champions League football next season.</p><p>Befitting a contest between two sides that now sit on identical points tallies, this was an entertaining tussle with little to split them. If Bournemouth edged possession and perhaps enjoyed the best of the action in the middle of the park, it was Brighton who made their chances count.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/25/brighton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In what could yet be a tight relegation battle, Wolves were left to rue two minutes of dozing off at the start of each half to hand Fulham victory. Ryan Sessegnon scored in the opening minute of the match and Rodrigo Muniz fell just short of replicating the feat after the break to boost their European hopes, while the hosts blew the chance to move eight points clear of the drop zone.</p><p>Vítor Pereira’s side were worthy of more but set their own downfall by not paying sufficient attention after kick-offs and being wasteful in front of goal, apart from João Gomes’s consolation.

It is also wrong –&nbsp;forcing the world’s poor to pay for Britain’s safety. This is a false economy. Cutting aid will make the world more unstable, not less.

<p>The actor’s insistence on scripting his own scenes in Paddington 3 and Bridget Jones 4 are proof of his talents. So why on earth hasn’t he written his own film yet?</p><p>We can all agree that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/nov/04/paddington-in-peru-review">Paddington in Peru</a> was, well, fine. Compared to the previous Paddington films it was a bit of a damp squib, but Olivia Colman got a few chances to be decently silly and it was leagues better than any of the recent live-action Disney remakes.</p><p>However, there was one moment where Paddington in Peru touched greatness. And this was the mid-credit sequence. For those who haven’t seen it, it’s a nod to the Paddington 2 scene in which a huge number of prisoners introduce themselves, only this time it’s a huge number of bears. And the person they’re introducing themselves to is Phoenix Buchanan, played by Hugh Grant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/25/hugh-grant-movies-writes-his-own-line

<p>Netflix’s new Robert De Niro-led hit series toys with real-world references but hasn’t got the faintest clue what to do with them</p><p><strong>Spoilers ahead</strong></p><p>For decades, movies and TV shows that feature the president of the United States as a character have tried, often playfully, to keep pace with the headlines. Sometimes they even managed to move a little faster than real-life progress; Morgan Freeman was chosen to lead the nation in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/73160/deep-impact">Deep Impact</a> a decade before the election of Barack Obama, and plenty of women have occupied the on-screen Oval Office, anticipating a glass-ceiling break that has yet to actually happen.</p><p>So at first, the new Netflix series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/feb/20/zero-day-review-de-niro-trump">Zero Day</a> comes across like a slightly and understandably mistimed attempt at topicality by focusing on George Mullen (Robert De Niro), a forme

<p>For more than 20 years, scientists have followed the animals in Norway’s Arctic archipelago to understand how they may adapt to changing threats as the ice they depend on melts</p><p>When Rolf-Arne Ølberg is hanging out of a helicopter with a gun, he needs to be able to assess from a distance of about 10 metres the sex and approximate weight of the moving animal he is aiming at, as well as how fat or muscular it is and whether it is in any distress. Only then can he dart it with the correct amount of sedative. Luckily, he says, polar bears are “quite good anaesthetic patients”.</p><p>Ølberg is a vet working with the Norwegian Polar Institute, the body responsible for the monitoring of polar bears in Svalbard, an archipelago that lies between mainland Norway and the north pole. Every year he and his colleagues track the bears by helicopter, collect blood, fat and hair samples from them and fit electronic tracking collars.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/fe
