Been using QBittorent and mostly Yify (YTS?) to download a ton of movies to my new Plex server, and it\u2019s all been smooth and amazing! Tonight, mid-download of a movie, I get a warning email from Verizon Fios. I wanna make sure I have that setting enabled where I\u2019m &quot;bound to the IP&quot; or something to that effect where if the VPN fails the download will stop (or SOMETHING like that). Would anyone be willing and able to guide me? Also how could that happen, any other advice?
