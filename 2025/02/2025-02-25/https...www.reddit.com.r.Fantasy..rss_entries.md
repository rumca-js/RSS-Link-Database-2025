## Wheel of Time only has character conflict caused by the characters not saying what they think

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m going through the fourth book – the Shadow Rising – and I&#39;m reading chapter 14, Customs of Mayene, as I&#39;m writing this.</p> <p>Ever since I started the first book, I&#39;ve been constantly bothered by how conflict happens in the series. All three of the male main characters are stubborn, uncivilized idiots. That bothers me a great deal, especially with Rand, the superstitious country bumpkin.</p> <p>The enjoyable and exciting parts of the series so far have mostly been the parts focused on the female characters. Even so, the way Nynaeve and Egwene are written, with them being constantly at odds with each other, it&#39;s hard to find the motivation to read on. The issue is not them being at odds with each other, it&#39;s with them spending every waking hour together and still being locked in a passive-aggressive power struggle without a resolve or even a hint of development. They are not believable as characters who regard each other a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Some context - I am 29 years old and have been reading Sanderson since I was in 10th grade. That would mean I have been reading Sanderson for about 14 years. A lot of ups and downs for me as a fan. I have been disappointed with the last few books and the direction of the series. I told myself this was the last chance I would give Brandon. Here is my thing - as a Wheel of Time fan, I just accept that in any large book series, there will be bad books. Simple as that. I haven&#39;t read a large series where I look back and said, &quot;every single book was amazing&quot;. I can forgive an author&#39;s vision not aligning with mine. So I dove into this book begging for Sanderson to &quot;keep me&quot;. That 14 year old who was reading on his Kindle Fire in every class he could. This isnt a &quot;review&quot;, just my thoughts as I read them. Trying to separate the good and bad but did a poor job.</p> <p><strong>Gripes</strong></p> <ul> <li>What drew me in

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was blissfully uaware of the current condition of ASOIAF and Winds of Winter. It&#39;s honestly frustrating when you start realising how George has written himself into a corner while reading the book. The Lannister twins chapters are the best part of the book till now I was not expecting Cersei&#39;s chapters to be such a treat but the nameless chapters (by nameless I mean The Kraken&#39;s daughter, soiled knight etc ) are causing some problems. The chapters are good enough but I think I would have enjoyed the sub-plots more if I knew there was an end (or if I read the book when it was released being unaware of the future of the series) where all loose ends and sub-plots get tied up but that end is nowhere to be seen .... The plot was complex enough but now there is a bit too much to tie up in two books.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Risb1005"> /u/Risb1005 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://w

For bloggers, we ask that you include the full text or a condensed version of the review but you may also include a link back to your review blog. For condensed reviews, please try to cover the overall review, remove details if you want. But posting the first paragraph of the review with a &quot;... &lt;link to your blog&gt;&quot;? Not cool.</p> <p>Please keep in mind, we still really encourage self post reviews for people that want to share more in depth thoughts on the books they have read. If you want to draw more attention to a particular book and want to take the time to do a self post, that&#39;s great! The Review Thread is not meant to discourage that. In fact, self post reviews are encouraged will get their own special flair (but please remember links to off-site reviews ar
