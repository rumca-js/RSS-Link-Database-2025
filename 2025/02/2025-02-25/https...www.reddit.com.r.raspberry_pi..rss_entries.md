<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I thought more would be better and bought few 128gb endurance/extreme cards which I now want to use for my house cams instead since obviously 128gb is overkill. But I can&#39;t find a way to copy the whole disk to a smaller card and I don&#39;t want to redo everything again. I&#39;ve been at it all day today trying to get everything to work on the 64gb card and having issues i never had with wireguard. I been at it all day yesterday trying to make a full copy onto the 64gb card.</p> <p>I tried to do a docker for pihole+unbound and gave up on that. Want to use omv but rather have pihole. So I&#39;m just sticking to ezbeq, pihole+unbound, and wiregaurd/ddclient/pivpn. I&#39;m pretty much done messing around with this rpi4. </p> <p><em>this is for the OS/booting..</em> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Any_Onion_7275"> /u/Any_Onion_7275 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if this is a proper flair, but oh well. I want to make a simple NAS from a 4B. I was looking into the Radxa&#39;s Penta SATA hat, but on the website it says it&#39;s compatible with Radxa&#39;s &quot;Rock&quot; sbc&#39;s so I&#39;m not sure if this is applicable to my Raspberry. Would it be feasible to just connect the SSD drives into Pi&#39;s USB ports? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;ll handle the power draw from 2-4 drives being connected to it, so I also considered USB &quot;data-power splitters&quot; so I could connect just the data ends into the Pi, and figure out power through the other ends. Does that make sense? Or is Radxa&#39;s Penta hat a compatible and better solution to my problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gold-Engineering173"> /u/Gold-Engineering173 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ixzpld/making_a_nas_with_12_pairs_of_25_s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’m running a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) with a 2TB NVMe SSD on a HAT, primarily as a full node for Bitcoin and Lightning.</p> <p>This morning, I noticed that none of my apps were running. After connecting a monitor, I saw that the NVMe HAT was not recognized. After multiple power cycles, it was finally detected again.</p> <p>I have two main questions: 1. How can this happen during runtime? I’m using an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) with four battery packs, so power fluctuations should not be the issue. 2. How can I monitor this in the future? A simple ping check won’t help since the Pi remains online, but I need to ensure critical services (or the SSD itself) are functioning.</p> <p>There are other Pis in my network that I could use for monitoring if needed. Any suggestions on the best way to track this kind of issue?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/
