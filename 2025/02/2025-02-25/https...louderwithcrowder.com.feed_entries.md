The way people overreacted, you would think Cousin Elon asked them to... well, show up to the office in the first place. </p><p>Scott Jennings, the lone voice of sanity on an increasingly unhinged CNN, asked a simple question: you have time to complain on CNN, but don't have time to respond to an email?</p><blockquote>We had a lady on CNN today, a supposed federal worker who said she was infuriated by the getting this e-mail.
