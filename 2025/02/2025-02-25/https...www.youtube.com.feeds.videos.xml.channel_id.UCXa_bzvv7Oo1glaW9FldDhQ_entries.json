        "description": "Two Point Museum is the latest game in the charming management sim series, releasing for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. It\u2019s a great sim for beginners to the genre but also supplies plenty of challenge for veterans with its multi-tasking and unlimited star challenges for each museum. \n\nYou hire staff to work on various museum amenities and maintain exhibits. Managing the layout of the museum is also a key factor in successfully running the museum business. There\u2019s also a lot of threats involved in curating a museum. \n\nThieves like to disguise themselves as guests, requiring security guards and careful camera placement. Going on risky expeditions can likely spell death for staff too, so that\u2019s another fun challenge.",
