But the Man Without Fear is returning to Hell\u2019s Kitchen on Disney+ with the long-in-the-making and hopefully just the first) season of Daredevil: Born Again. Returning with familiar faces like Foggy Nelson, Karen Page, Kingpin and even Frank Castle aka The Punisher, there is a backstory the size of a truck full of toxic chemicals to catch up on. So before you dive into Born Again, here\u2019s everything from 3 seasons of his Netflix show, 1 season of The Defenders and a cameo or two in the MCU that you should probably remember about Daredevil.\n\n#IGN #Marvel #MCU",

Also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.\nTwo Point Museum is a rewarding, deep, challenging, and highly entertaining tycoon game that demonstrates Two Point Studios has really hit its groove with this third iteration of the idea. The variety of different exhibits to unlock and level up, the thrill of discovering new expedition maps, and the array of clever and easy-to-use management tools make designing and running a museum joyful and consistently rewarding. I've sunk more than 40 hours into it already and I could easily see doubling that without running out of stuff to do. Call the curator. They're really going to want to take a look at this.",

While King himself isn't writing it, he teased he's doing something on the project. It's the latest attempt to adapt King's sprawling magnum opus series, this time headed by Mike Flanagan, who has already adapted some of King's work into movies. In other news, James Gunn knows acknowledged gaming's importance in his new DCU, and has already had discussions with developers. But since the media crossover project is still getting off the ground, it'll be a while before we see games starring the new DCU lineup of heroes. And finally, we have a peek at Universal Orlando Resort's upcoming Universal Epic Universe.\nPresented by Universal Orlando Resort and its new theme park, Universal Epic Universe.",

Apparently older builds of the game are out in the wild, and people are already streaming it (those streams, of course, have been taken down). In other news, Spider-Man voice actor, Yuri Lowenthal, has confirmed Peter Parker will be in the third Insomniac Spider-Man game. In what capacity, he didn't say, but he teased that Parker won't just be sitting on a couch and letting Miles have all the fun. And finally, the trade war between the U.S. and China could be affecting gaming hardware, and Sony is preparing for just such a situation. They plan to move as much of the PS5's production outside of China, and stockpiling enough of them in the U.S. that hopefully they can meet demand until production costs level out.\n\n#IGN #Gaming",
