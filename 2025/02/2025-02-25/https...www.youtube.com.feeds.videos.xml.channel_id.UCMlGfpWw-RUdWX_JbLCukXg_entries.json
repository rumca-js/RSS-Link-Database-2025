Indeed, if we have perfectly deterministic simulations - we can simply pass all the inputs to all the clients, and rely on each client to produce the same results, reducing network traffic by orders of magnitude. While especially important for RTS games, all kinds of multiplayer games would benefit from it.\nHowever, while determinism was achieved in practice for single-platform, it is known to be a next-to-impossible to achieve for cross-platform clients. We will discuss the (well-known) reasons for it first - and will proceed into discussing our approach to the solution (with our open-source lib actually providing some implementations).\nThis talk is important for multiplayer gamedevs - and for anybody who is interested in deterministic calculations.\n---\n\nSlides: https://gith",
