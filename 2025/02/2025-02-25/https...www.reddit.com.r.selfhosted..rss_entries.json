        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hi! Recently discovered Dockge and I really love it. I am looking for an easy solution to manage my docker containers. I have everything in one compose.yaml, but I am looking to split docker-compose files per &#39;service&#39;. For example &quot;download-services.yaml&quot; containing Radarr, Sonarr, sabnzbd etc. etc. and &quot;homeautomation-service.yaml&quot; containing homeassistant, mosquitto, zigbee2mqtt, etc. etc. </p> <p>In Dockge I can do this perfectly, but I noticed if I had more than one container in a &#39;stack&#39;, the terminal section is no longer working? If I create individual stacks per container I do have a working terminal section in the stack. </p> <p>Is there a way to combine containers in one stack and still use the terminal feature to see what is happening? Maybe I am overlooking but can&#39;t figure this one out. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Timdedraak\"> /u/Timdedraa",

All started when Slack limited the message history to 90 days for the free teams. As we used Slack for a very small team (&lt;5 people) upgrading to a bigger plan was never an option. This must have been around 2022/2023 as I turned to Mattermost we switched to that. Sadly a lot of Mattermosts features are behind another paywall and it is more like a freemium to me. Not really free/libre and I think not even 100% open source. So after a short stint with Mattermost we are now at Discord. We dont have to talk about data privacy on Discord and I am desperate to go back to a self hosted solution.</p> <p>I have tried:</p> <ul> <li>zulip (zulip)</li> <li>Mattermost</li> <li>RocketChat</li> <li>letschat</li> <li>Synapse (Matrix)</li> </ul> <p>All of them have some kind of paid model which involves being able to chat mostly for free but having to pay for more ",

It&#39;s a very simple script, but then again, I don&#39;t host anything without a docker image anymore, so I thought I may as well do one for Scrobblex.</p> <h1>\ud83d\ude80 Features</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Scrobble Plex plays to Trakt</strong>: Automatically log your Plex media plays to your Trakt account.</li> <li><strong>Push Plex ratings to Trakt</strong>: Sync your Plex ratings with Trakt.</li> <li",
