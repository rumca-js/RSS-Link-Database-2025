I am, unabashedly, a Humean emotivist. Like David Hume, I hold that emotions—not abstract reason—form the foundation of our ethics. Cold logic alone doesn&#8217;t guide our moral compass; it is shaped by the deep wellspring of human feeling. This isn&#8217;t a rejection of reason, but a recognition of its limits and its partnership with emotion in [&#8230;]

I realize that using the word &#8220;racist&#8221; to describe an ExTwitter account is pretty much redundant at this point, but there&#8217;s something more to this story. It&#8217;s not that a racist is using ExTwitter to make racist posts. It&#8217;s that a prosecutor working for ICE is, and has been, posting racist content for years on [&#8230;]

In a stunning display of government overreach, the UK has effectively forced Apple to disable its iCloud encryption for British users. Earlier this month, we wrote about the UK wielding the Investigatory Powers Act — aka &#8220;The Snooper&#8217;s Charter&#8221; — to demand Apple create a backdoor in its iCloud encryption for all users globally. Despite [&#8230;]

It really doesn&#8217;t seem like too much to ask that legal representatives who are specifically trained to handle legal work actually know what the fuck they&#8217;re doing when they engage in legal representation. While I understand that not every lawyer&#8217;s competence will be equal, I don&#8217;t believe we should be expected to put up with [&#8230;]

Last Friday brought two seemingly unrelated stories: the Associated Press suing White House officials over retaliatory press access restrictions, and Trump&#8217;s interim DC US Attorney Ed Martin launching what appears to be a personal intimidation campaign against Trump/Musk political rivals — precisely the kind of unconstitutional &#8220;lawfare&#8221; that Trump and Musk themselves have previously denounced.

Last October,&#160;Trump sued CBS&#160;claiming (falsely) that a 60 Minutes interview of Kamala Harris had been “deceitfully edited” to her benefit (they simply shortened some of her answers for brevity, as news outlets often do). As&#160;Mike explored, the lawsuit was utterly baseless, and tramples the First Amendment, editorial discretion, and common sense. CBS/Paramount is looking for [&#8230;]

We have been talking about the problem of ownership in the modern world for some time, particularly as it revolves around how digital or internet-reliant products are sold. It&#8217;s become such a prevalent problem that there&#8217;s something of a generic mantra for it: You don&#8217;t actually own the thing you bought. There&#8217;s a spectrum to [&#8230;]
