<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently watched an interview video by AmigaBill on youtube with the creator of AmiKit. I never realized I could download an older version (10.5.3) to try it out. Let me just say that it is impressive. I&#39;ll have to review what is included and different in the newer versions and will likely purchase a license to help support his work. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/jsauer"> /u/jsauer </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ixu7jg/amikit/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ixu7jg/amikit/">[comments]</a></span>
