        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am prepping a CVE for publishing, and I have a question I can&#39;t seem to find a resource for. CVSS 4.0 includes subsequent system CIA vectors. But the concept of a subsequent system is not well defined. In this case, there is a server side request forgery vulnerability allowing GETs to arbitrary URLs. There is nothing else within the environment that is particularly vulnerable. Clouds are obviously vulnerable to metadata scraping, etc. Theoretically, a known unsecured server in the same network that the server can reach that external sites can&#39;t could have any number of potential vulnerabilities, but they are not part of the &quot;system&quot; that is being reported in the CVE. So how would one scope the subsequent system specifically for a general CVE release? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/gormami\"> /u/gormami </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/",
