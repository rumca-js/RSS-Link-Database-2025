I have done the Next.js getting started tutorial where you get to create a dashboard app and deploy it using Vercel, that was very simple. Can I deploy Django on Vercel aswell? That would be great if possible as it only took a few minutes to set up and it automatically deploys what is pushed to the main branch of the connected Github repo.</p> <p>Also, I&#39;d like to add that the database used currently while I&#39;m developing is the default SQLite but I do want to switch to a &quot;real&quot; database like PostgreSQL, for example, later when launching.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Decent-Ad9232\"> /u/Decent-Ad9232 </a> <br/> <spa",

I&#39;ve gotten so invested in building little tools for it (e.g., base classes centered around general CRUD operations, dynamic serializers, etc.).
