And when someone gifted me a book, whether parents or friends or others, it really felt like a special moment. I would stay up reading the book, almost as if I had just found a world in a hole in the backyard. I had the same attitude once I was able to buy myself books as I got older.</p> <p>But then years passed by and now when I go to a bookstore, I feel overwhelmed with choices. Too many books, too many options, bestsellers, classics, comics, and yet so little time. Now I have expectations. I want to be blown away. No time to read a book that takes its time or an author who is not established. I used to think it was a privilege to be given a chance to explore a world through another person&#39;s imagination. Now my attitude is, How entertaining and mindblowing can this book be and how quickly can it do that?</p> <p>And I&#39;m exposed to a lot",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve been reading &quot;The Brockets&quot; by David Vardy recently (also has a good audiobook version). It revolves around the misadventures of an over the top social climbing mother, &quot;Penelope Brocket&quot; - probably intended as a caricature (parody?) of Jane Austen&#39;s legendary Mrs Bennet, though set in an outlandish Father Ted/Monty Python-esque regency period world. </p> <p>I would recommend it as a fun, light read for anyone who might like a modern humoured, over the top, absurd family sitcom. Where each chapter almost comes off as an episode, so good for short digestive reads / attention spans.</p> <p>The book most definitely does not take itself seriously - especially the on going war between the mad matriarch mother and her maid. This is a case where the mother is too menacing to work for, and the maid is too inept to work for anyone else. So despite the calamities, both end up perpetually paired and fighting against each other.<",

Several friends read it and I went on the read Atrocity Exhibit, Crystal World, Unlimited Dream company, Hello America and more. I loved the books and thought about &amp; discussed the deeper meanings. My friends liked them also. Now almost 40 years on, I\u2019m listening to the Audible version of Crash and just don\u2019t get it. What\u2019s the point? There is a good chance that electronic media has made me stupid. I also found reading Kingdom Come last year boring. 1) Can someone comment favorably about Crash? 2) Has anyone else lost the ability to read books as they\u2019ve aged?
