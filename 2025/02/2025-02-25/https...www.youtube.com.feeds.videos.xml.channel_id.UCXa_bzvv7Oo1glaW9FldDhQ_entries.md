Two Point Museum is the latest game in the charming management sim series, releasing for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. It’s a great sim for beginners to the genre but also supplies plenty of challenge for veterans with its multi-tasking and unlimited star challenges for each museum. 

You hire staff to work on various museum amenities and maintain exhibits. Managing the layout of the museum is also a key factor in successfully running the museum business. There’s also a lot of threats involved in curating a museum. 

Thieves like to disguise themselves as guests, requiring security guards and careful camera placement. Going on risky expeditions can likely spell death for staff too, so that’s another fun challenge.
