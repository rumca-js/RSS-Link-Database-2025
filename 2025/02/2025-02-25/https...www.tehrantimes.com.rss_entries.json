While rarely explicit, the industry\u2019s storytelling often mirrors broader American political alignments, emphasizing themes of Jewish resilience, historical trauma, and Israel\u2019s right to exist. However, this approach frequently sidesteps critical engagement with Zionism\u2019s modern political implications or Palestinian narratives. The 2023 biopic \u201cGolda\u201d epitomizes this trend, offering a case study of Hollywood\u2019s selective framing of Zionism and its consequences.",
