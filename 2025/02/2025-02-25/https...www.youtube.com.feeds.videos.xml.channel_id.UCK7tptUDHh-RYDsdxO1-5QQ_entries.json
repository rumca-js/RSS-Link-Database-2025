        "description": "In the Baltic Sea, a shadow war is raging between Russia and NATO. Commercial ships believed to be part of the Kremlin\u2019s fleet stand accused of deliberately cutting subsea cables by dragging their anchors. There have also been incidents involving damage to other Baltic cables that have been traced to ships connected to China, sparking concerns about the level of collaboration between Moscow and Beijing.\n\nWSJ explains how these acts of sabotage have turned the Baltic Sea into a flashpoint for the hybrid war and how NATO is ramping up patrols and military presence to protect critical underwater infrastructure.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Shadow war \n0:44 The strategy behind cable cuts\n2:58 Russia\u2019s role\n4:15 What can NATO do?\n\nNews Explainers\nSome days the high-speed news cycle can bring more questions than answers.
