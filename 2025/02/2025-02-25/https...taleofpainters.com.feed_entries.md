<p>Greetings Hobby Heroes! I hope you are enjoying your hobby journey so far this year. I continue to work on my Cadian Army during January and February because Garfy and I are running some fun 40K games with our painted models. We have run games at 1000 and 1650 points, and it will all come to a head in a larger 2000-point battle this March.</p>
