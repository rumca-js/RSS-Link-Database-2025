<p>When you’ve lost three games in a row any win is a good win. And there’s no such thing as a bad win by four goals. But equally, the context is unavoidable. This is a Southampton side who are doomed, who are letting in 2.41 goals per game, who have lost 14 of their past 17 league games and who have nothing to play for this season beyond trying to scrape together the three points that would take them above Derby’s record low of 11. The Premier League’s USP is supposed to be that anybody can beat anybody, but it’s hard to square that with this Southampton.</p><p>No win can be taken for granted, but equally there’s not a huge amount of credit to be gained in beating Southampton.

But its imagery will be indelible well after the baubles are forgotten</p><p>Thinking about it, I wasn’t sure which image disturbed me more: the one where an eyeball begets another eyeball and the two of them start jostling for prominence in the same socket hole?; or the one where one eyeball begets <em>four</em> other eyeballs and they, you know, start slamming into each other?</p><p>On reflection, it’s the first that’s worse. As terrifying as the second may be, in a moment that sets off The Substance’s super gross-out denouement, it is at least expected. Also, with four eyes (actually it could be six, or eight, it all happens so quickly) you can feel the body horror being ratcheted<strong> </strong>up to levels of preposterousness that take the edge off.

<p>Teenager and people key to his ascent reflect on a journey that began in Devon and takes him to former club Chelsea this week</p><p>The mannequins stood no chance. After a two-hour drive from Wiltshire, Jeremy Newton would arrive at Axe Valley Academy in Devon on Friday afternoons, unload his car and furnish the school’s 3G pitch for a one‑on‑one session. The Southampton academy coach would build in-game scenarios using props: cones, dummy opponents to recreate a back four or three‑man wall. An iPad would record the next hour, providing the opportunity to review footage, hone details. Once school was out, a 14‑year‑old at the start of his GCSEs would get to work on his fledgling career.</p><p>It is the reason why Tyler Dibling’s signed No 7 shirt, from England Under-16s duty, greets visitors in the school’s reception in Axminster.

<p>At the rural orphanage where I volunteered, the place resembled a Dickensian workhouse. The staff’s main tools were antipsychotics and violence. The experience gave me a window into Putin’s Russia </p><p>In the summer of 2007, I joined a group of 30 Russian and English students to work on a month-long summer camp at a state orphanage for mentally and physically disabled children in the Pskov region, south of St Petersburg. We lived in a house nearby, or in tents pitched in the garden. Every day, we walked up to the orphanage to put on developmental activities, sporting events, solve puzzles, play games, stage shows and go on camping trips.</p><p>I volunteered at the orphanage, in the village of Belskoye Ustye, for almost a decade, but it was the first visit that made the biggest impression. I had seen nothing like it. My closest reference point was probably workhouses or orphanages from a Charles Dickens novel. I vividly remember the smells – cooked food, unwashed bodies, chlorine

<p>From the latest in Musk’s fight to fire federal workers to concern over appointment of Dan Bongino – key US politics stories from Monday at a glance</p><p>Confusion continued on Monday over the demands made by Elon Musk of federal workers. Just hours after the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had directed agencies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/elon-musk-federal-workers-chaos">that responses to its email were optional</a>, Musk again threatened federal workers.<br><br>
 He wrote on X, the platform he owns: “Subject to the discretion of the president, they will be given another chance. Failure to respond a second time will result in termination.”<br><br>
 President Donald Trump backed Musk earlier Monday, two days after OPM initially sent an email asking federal workers to list five things they accomplished last week. Several government agencies, including the FBI and state department, have told their employees not to respond.</p><p>Here are the big

<p>Keir Starmer is travelling to the White House for a high-stakes meeting. But will he have any influence over the US president? Patrick Wintour reports</p><p>It’s the most important international relationship the UK has, and for decades has been referred to as “special”. Since the second world war, the UK and the US have considered themselves the closest allies, working together for shared values, with any resentments, differences of opinion or cross words kept to private channels.</p><p>But now Donald Trump is back and he seems keen to throw the usual world order of alliances and enmities into chaos. Keir Starmer’s first meeting with the US president comes at a crucial juncture for Europe, with the future of Ukraine in the balance. “The stakes at the moment could not be higher,” says the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, <strong>Patrick Wintour.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/feb/25/can-the-special-relationship-survive-donald-trump-podcast">Continue

<p>Distinctive, slender deep-sea creature, also known as ‘doomsday’ fish, seen wriggling on Baja California beach</p><p>A shimmery, slinky oarfish – a deep-sea creature that is rarely seen near the surface – was spotted in Baja California Sur, along Mexico’s Pacific Coast, this month. A group of people visiting the area noticed the shiny, wriggling fish along the beach, and tried to guide it back into the water.</p><p>The slender creatures live at depths between 660 and 3,280ft underwater, and on the rare occasions that they have been seen by humans, they have usually been dead – washed ashore after storms. In Baja California Sur, Robert Hayes of Idaho, who was visiting the beach with his wife, saw a live fish and quickly began filming it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/oarfish-mexico-baja-california-sur">Continue reading...</a>
