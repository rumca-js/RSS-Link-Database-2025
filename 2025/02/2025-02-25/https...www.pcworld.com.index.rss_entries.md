<p>That said, Watch Together will live on in the Plex web app “for the foreseeable future,” the rep continued, adding that “we don’t preclude the possibility of offering similar functionality again in the future, using new tooling.” </p>

<p>Microsoft is taking an aggressive step towards lowering the price of top-tier AI reasoning, giving Copilot users free, unlimited access to OpenAI’s o1 model directly within Copilot’s new “Think Deeper” feature.</p>



<p>OpenAI released the o1 model in December, and company chief executive Sam Altman promised that it would be the most powerful model available. But it came with a catch: two subscriptions. OpenAI’s ChatGPT Pro charges a whopping $200/mo for unlimited access to the model. The company’s $20/mo service, ChatGPT Plus, also allows access to the o1 model, but with limited access.</p>



<p>At the beginning of February, Microsoft’s chief of Microsoft AI, Mustafa Suleyman, announced that access to the o1 model would be available to Copilot users <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mustafa-suleyman_today-weve-made-think-deeper-free-and-available-

<p>How many Steam Decks has Valve sold so far? The company isn’t saying, except that it’s “multiple millions.” We know the Steam Deck is a smash hit, but new research estimates give us a better picture of the new handheld PC market, combined with competing devices like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.</p>



<p><a href="https://archive.ph/AxsXZ">The Verge commissioned IDC research</a> into handheld PC sales for 2022 to 2024, and estimates for sales this year. According to the projections, the combined sales of the Steam Deck, Lenovo Legion Go, Asus ROG Ally (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2351490/hands-on-asus-rog-ally-x-gaming-handhelds-a-big-upgrade.html">multiple models</a>), and MSI Claw (<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2360397/msi-talks-claw-lunar-lake-coming-to-original-model.html">ditto</a>) were approximately 6 million so far

<p><em>Balatro</em> is a fantastic mix of deck-building, roguelike runs, and <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2249368/indie-hit-balatro-reinvents-poker-by-forcing-you-to-cheat.html">cheating at poker</a>. But you don’t have to take my word for it. This indie darling was such a smash hit last year that it sold millions of copies on PC and console before quickly expanding to Android and iOS.
