<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a Vivo V15 pro that I bought back in 2019. In 2021, I dropped in on the floor due to witch it&#39;s display blacked out. At that time, I didn&#39;t repair the phone but bought a new one though I still had my data in it, I thought I&#39;ll do the data recovery later. Today I got the display repaired but I am failing to recall the pattern. I really don&#39;t want to reset the device. How do I open the pattern lock without resetting the device? Any help would be really appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Internal_Spread7458"> /u/Internal_Spread7458 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ixwq6e/how_to_unlock_pattern_lock_without_reset/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ixwq6e/how_to_unlock_pattern_lock_without_reset/">[comments]</a></span>
