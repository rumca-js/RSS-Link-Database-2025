<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>No Twitter. No Instagram. And Reddit keeps talking to me about karma</p> <p>But we like talking about sports and want to keep up and engage with what the community has to say</p> <p>Cue the early concept for The LockerRoom - a social space that is solely catered to sports. Eliminate the surrounding noise that fills the other apps and build common ground for sports fans to talk, connect, and engage and interact.</p> <p>We are starting with the social aspect of sports because it&#39;s the one area where we can all participate. Whether we all should is an argument for a different day. </p> <p>This past Saturday, we wrapped up our UI/UX revamp to better compliment user flow. </p> <p>Next, we will use the prototype to do some subtle marketing while the actual build of the app is happening in the background. </p> <p>Just the start, but we&#39;re making good progress. Attached some images for a look at a few of the screen layouts. We will have a better look

## how i cured my phone addiction and took action (finally built an idea I had)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For the longest time, I had great startup ideas but never acted on them. My biggest problem? My phone. Every time I sat down to work, I’d end up doomscrolling TikTok, Reddit, or YouTube instead. I tried app blockers, but they were too easy to disable.</p> <p>So, I built CutOff, a no-loophole focus app that completely blocks distracting apps and websites during work sessions. Once you start, there’s no quitting—not even restarting your phone will stop it. It forced me to stay disciplined, and for the first time, I actually followed through on an idea.</p> <p>Now, my app is live, and I’m finally making real progress as an entrepreneur; We have 350 users in the first week! If distractions are holding you back, this will help you too! Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xxxMogul"> /u/xxxMogul </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/com

The bot lets you connect randomly with another user, chat privately for a chosen duration (1 hour or 24 hours), and optionally share your contact info at the end. After the session, everything is wiped from the bot’s memory. It’s simple, it’s fun, and I’m hoping to make it even better!</p> <p>Here’s what I’ve implemented so far:</p> <p>Anonymous Pairing: Users can choose their gender and chat duration. The bot then tries to match them with someone from the opposite gender first; if that’s not possible, it’ll pair them randomly (including same-gender matches).</p> <p>Timer-Based Chat Sessions: You can pick between a 1-hour “quick chat” or a 24-hour “long chat.” Once time’s up, the bot ends the session automatically.</p> <p>Optional Contact Sharing: After the session ends, you both have 30 minute

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I’ve been working on a live map that shows real-time fuel prices at 7-Eleven stations across Australia. It’s free to use, always up-to-date, and I’d love for you to check it out.</p> <p>If you’re not familiar, 7-Eleven offers a fuel lock feature where you can lock in a price for a week. My map helps you quickly find the cheapest prices near you (or anywhere in Australia) so you can lock in a good deal and fill up at a convenient station.</p> <p>It’s still a work in progress, but it already has some features I find useful:</p> <ul> <li>Use the table view to easily spot the cheapest prices.</li> <li>Select a station to see other stations where the price isn’t more than $0.25/L higher—great for comparing options.</li> </ul> <p>I’d really appreciate your feedback! If you try it out, let me know what you think or if there’s anything you’d like to see added.</p> <p>Check it out here: <a href="https://fuelprice.co/">https://fuelprice.co/

## I Built an iOS App with Zero Coding Experience—Using Only AI 🤯 Surprise Gift inside 🎁

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>So, a while back, I set out to build something I always wanted—an app to help people stay consistent with their habits. The catch? <strong>I had zero coding experience.</strong></p> <p>I come from a <strong>product design background</strong>, so while I could <strong>visualize</strong> how the app should look and feel, writing Swift code was a different story. I didn’t even know how to upload an app to the App Store. But instead of letting that stop me, I decided to <strong>build the entire thing using AI.</strong></p> <p>I relied heavily on AI to figure out complex features like <strong>Core Data, CloudKit, and syncing across devices</strong>. Even today, if I look at parts of the code, I don’t understand <strong>95% of it</strong>. Every bug, every crash, every weird behavior—I asked AI to help me debug. There were weeks where I thought, <em>this is impossible</em>, or <em>who am I kidding, I’m not a developer</em>.</p> <p>But

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First up, the cost to get a developer to make a basic radio app is extremely high. I was quoted between 10k and 40k USD by local developers for an app that would play me stream and have listeners be able to message me. I ended up finding a dude in Pakistan to make it for $1k USD.</p> <p>Next, the red tape to get through was insane. A full on application with lots of followup questions for the music licence. Hours burned doing this. Creating the content for a radio station is way more time consuming than I would have thought. I fly solo and creating a mastered 90 minute show takes roughly 10 hours after editing. </p> <p>Now the real hard part. Marketing your radio app so people other than friends and family know about it. This is also very time consuming and you have to be creative to really get your name out there if you have a minimal budget. E.g posters on local community noticeboards, marketing at appropriate events (retro ones in my case).</p> <p
