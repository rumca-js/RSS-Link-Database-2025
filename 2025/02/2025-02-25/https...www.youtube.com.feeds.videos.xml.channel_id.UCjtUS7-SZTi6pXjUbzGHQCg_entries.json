Try Rocket Money for free: http://rocketmoney.com/undecided Solid state batteries could address some of the biggest issues facing energy storage and EVs; safety, charge capacity, and longevity. But the biggest problem they face? Cost. But there's a new electrode manufacturing technique that apparently uses less energy, less materials, and less factory floor space \u2014 all of which means more savings. Plus, researchers have found a new cathode material that works just as well as lithium iron phosphate, but costs only 1 or 2% of its price, potentially knocking 50 to 60% off the cost of a finished battery. That's right, 50 to 60% off the entire battery's price. How are these massive savings even possible? And could these innovations realistically dethrone current manufacturing methods and battery materials?\n\nWatch Why Big Tech's Betting Billions on Nuclear (Not Renewables) https://youtu.be/wnHyYKNnUTo?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7uzySCXq8VXhodHB5B5Oi",
