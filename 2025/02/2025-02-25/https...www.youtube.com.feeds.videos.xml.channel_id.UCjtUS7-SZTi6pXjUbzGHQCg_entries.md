Why This Ultra Cheap Battery Breakthrough Matters. Try Rocket Money for free: http://rocketmoney.com/undecided Solid state batteries could address some of the biggest issues facing energy storage and EVs; safety, charge capacity, and longevity. But the biggest problem they face? Cost. But there's a new electrode manufacturing technique that apparently uses less energy, less materials, and less factory floor space â€” all of which means more savings. Plus, researchers have found a new cathode material that works just as well as lithium iron phosphate, but costs only 1 or 2% of its price, potentially knocking 50 to 60% off the cost of a finished battery. That's right, 50 to 60% off the entire battery's price. How are these massive savings even possible? And could these innovations realistically dethrone current manufacturing methods and battery materials?
