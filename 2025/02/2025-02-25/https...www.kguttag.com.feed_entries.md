Since starting this blog, I have been interested in AR optical designs that are different from others I have seen. When Xreal showed their Xreal One Pro at CES 2025, I was curious to know how it worked. As it turned out, the design was not as different as I had first thought.  But the journey lead me to find some connections between Xreal's optical design and that of, Ant-Reality which was reportedly acquired by Google.
