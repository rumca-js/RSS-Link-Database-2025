<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When was the last time you had to manually take care of your proxies in the codebase?<br/> For me, it was 2 weeks ago, and I hated every bit of it.<br/> It&#39;s cumbersome and not the easiest thing to scale, but the worst part is that it has nothing to do with any of your projects (unless your project is all about building IP proxies). Basically, it&#39;s a spaghetti tech debt, so why introduce it to the codebase? </p> <p>Hence, the Progzee: <a href="https://github.com/kiselitza/progzee">https://github.com/kiselitza/progzee</a><br/> Just <code>pip install progzee</code> , and pass the proxies to the constructor (or use the config.ini setup), the package will rotate proxies for you and retry on failures. Plus the CLI support for quick tasks or dynamic proxy manipulation.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kiselitza"> /u/kiselitza </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comment

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really use the site anymore but a friend died a while back and I&#39;m scared that with the state of the site, I would just really like to have a backup of the posts she made.

I can&#39;t seem to wrap my head around whatever guides on the internet say on how to scrape X.</p> <p>How hard is this actually? It would be nice to just press a button and get all her stuff saved but honestly I&#39;d be willing to go through post-by-post if there was a button to copy it all with whatever post metadata, like the date it was posted and everything. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/YourWitchfriend"> /u/YourWitchfriend </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webscraping/comments/1ixrq6c/how_hard_will_it_be_to_scrape_the_posts_of_an_x/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r
