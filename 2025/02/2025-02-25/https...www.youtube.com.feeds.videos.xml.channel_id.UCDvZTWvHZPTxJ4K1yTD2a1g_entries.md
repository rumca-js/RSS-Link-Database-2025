2 months ago we launched our first ever painting competition - Squidmar Open. A competition for anyone who wants Paints miniatures and Warhammer. Never in our wildest dream did we think we'd have more entries than golden demon. We're obviously massive golden demon fans, but this makes us feel amazing! Here's what went down!
