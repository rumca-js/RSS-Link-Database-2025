        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I run a job board that has been live for about a year. While it doesn\u2019t have many backlinks, it is indexed on Google\u2014I can find it by searching its name. Each individual job page is structured with job posting schema. As of today, Search Console shows only 4 Valid jobs out of over 1 million pages.</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago, the website got a significant traffic surge, which led to a spike in indexed job postings\u2014from around 200\u2013300 to nearly 60,000. However, a few weeks later, the number of indexed pages dropped down to ~100, eventually nearing zero.</p> <p>This pattern repeated recently: a smaller traffic surge led to an increase in indexed pages, but then the numbers declined again.</p> <p>Is this fluctuation normal?

I\u2019m seeing if you SEO folks might know how to reverse engineer for someone that is <em>searching</em> for specific types of websites, in this case home listings. For example, sometimes real estate agents (I am one) will have websites made specifically for their private listings that are not on the major websites (Zillow, Redfin, etc.) Sometimes the website is the property address (like 123mainst . Com) I am wondering if there could be a way to find these websites without knowing the property address. Any ideas, or other subs that might be better for this question?
