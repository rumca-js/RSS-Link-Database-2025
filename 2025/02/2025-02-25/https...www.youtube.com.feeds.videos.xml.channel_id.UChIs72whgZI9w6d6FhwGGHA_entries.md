NVIDIA's RTX 50 series GPUs in the Blackwell family now represent the worst GPU launch we have covered in our history of GPU reviews at GN. It was briefly tied with past AMD and NVIDIA launches for the worst, but now, with the missing ROPs in addition to 12VHPWR issues, fake pricing, a paper launch, unannounced loss of PhysX 32-bit support, driver issues in some scenarios, and more, we crown the RTX 5090, 5080, and 5070 Ti launches as being part of the worst we've seen. Congratulations, NVIDIA.
