Though the most recent Nobel prize in literature winner Han Kang was eligible for this year's prize with her book We Do Not Part, translated from Korean by e. yaewon and Paige Aniyah Morris, she did not make the list. Kang won the International Booker in 2016 with her breakthrough novel, The Vegetarian, translated by Deborah Smith.
