<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to use newsgroups to get audiobooks about 15 years or so ago. It was cool. You just type into the NewsRover search &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and it would find it for you. </p> <p>It looks a lot different now and I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m just not seeing it anymore.</p> <p>I don&#39;t see I don&#39;t see alt.binaries.audiobooks and pick from what they had posted. I don&#39;t see what I was used to and am wondering if it has completly changed or if I don&#39;t know how to use newsgroups anymore. I signed up for NewsHosting and I&#39;m wondering if I made a mistake. I&#39;ve got 30 days (or so they say) to cancel.</p> <p>I&#39;m cool with learning something new but don&#39;t want to waste time if the paradigm has changed. Any thoughts on how I should proceed?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jawbrace"> /u/Jawbrace </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iy82iz/getti

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just a heads up to anyone in Australia getting poor speeds or not meeting their expectations.</p> <p>I&#39;ve always used Newhosting and once I switched to fibre 1 gigabit down I could only ever receive around 65MB/s down at absolute best. My system was more than capable, with bandwidth showing 110MB/s and the rest of the hardware showing 400MB/s+</p> <p>I read countless discussions of people with similar experiences in Australia, if anything I was getting a better experience. And when I started my own discussion the verdict was I won&#39;t fully saturate a gigabit connection in Australia. </p> <p>I tried many different providers but everyone else was actually worse. I got absolutely flamed here and on other discussion boards for it being my config and hardware</p> <p>Yesterday I looked into it again and thought I&#39;d try Frugal. Instantly, I was pulling 110MB/s down with their Sydney server (I&#39;m in QLD)</p> <p>So just an FYI if you&#39;ve been

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am quite content with my rr setup that relies on public torrents, but I&#39;ve always been curious about usenet and especially automation. I am completely new to usenet and don&#39;t know anything about them outside of the fact that they&#39;re another means of file sharing. Ideally, I&#39;d like to use one to make up the defecit of when I occasionally can&#39;t find content from my usual torrent sources. What would be a good service to subscribe to and would using a usenet service get in the way of torrenting, I want to avoid downloading multiples of the same content from different sources.
