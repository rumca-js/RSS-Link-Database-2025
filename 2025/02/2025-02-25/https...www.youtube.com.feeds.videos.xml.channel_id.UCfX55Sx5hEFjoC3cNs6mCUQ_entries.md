Managing AI workloads with Kubernetes can introduce unnecessary complexity. dstack, an open-source alternative, simplifies container orchestration for AI. In this talk, weâ€™ll demonstrate how developers can leverage dstack to enhance AI development, training, and deployment, enabling seamless integration on Vultr leveraging GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD. The session will focus on use cases like fine-tuning and deploying models with DeepSeek.

## Open source is making bold moves across AI, networking, and even post-quantum security.
