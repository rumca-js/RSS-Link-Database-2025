I continue to work on my Cadian Army during January and February because Garfy and I are running some fun 40K games with our painted models. We have run games at 1000 and 1650 points, and it will all come to a head in a larger 2000-point battle this March.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com/2025/02/showcase-cadian-leman-russ-chimera-inc-battle-damage-guide/\">Showcase: Cadian Leman Russ &amp; Chimera (inc. battle damage guide)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://taleofpainters.com\">Tale of Painters</a>.</p>",
