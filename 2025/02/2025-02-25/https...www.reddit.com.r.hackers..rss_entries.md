<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I sent some anonymous asks on retrospring, (a Q&amp;A platform) then logged off and didn&#39;t use the internet for a while. When I came back I discovered the user replied to my asks, then deleted both my asks and the replies they gave, because the replies were &#39;deem as controversial&#39; and they received a lot of hate for it. Do you think those posts may still be on the website database, or they&#39;re completely gone? Do platforms like this keep deleted datas somewhere or things get wiped out once deleted? Is there any way I can find out, and read the messages now? Opinions or any type of help would be very appreciated!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/chrisherlock"> /u/chrisherlock </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iy59q8/can_old_deleted_datas_be_found_again/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iy59q8/can_old

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey, I posted here before, asking for advice in a cyberbulling case. It continues on high levels, recently I received a voice message full of insults from an unknown telegram account that was deleted soon after. I don&#39;t know the voice, it said it&#39;s a friend of the harasser. I&#39;m wondering what could be done with it. Can telegram itself help? What are the chances that telegram would reveal the data of that deleted account (attached phone number for example) to the police on request? The police previously didn&#39;t react anyhow when I provided all the anonymous emails and other things I received. Also, the account got deleted but telegram keeps the conversation with deleled accounts, so I still have the voice messsage there.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flying_starpiece"> /u/flying_starpiece </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iy1n6y/what_could_i_do_i
