So, I got myself the PSVR2. Apparently that was a mistake since Skyrim VR doesn&#39;t work with that version, which was kind of disappointing. I did try a few other games like No Man&#39;s Sky and RE4. Both of those definitely made me nauseous within 20 minutes of playing but I hear you get used to it after a while.</p> <p>I definitely see the potential. I still have time to return the PSVR2 to the store and am considering getting the MetaQuest 3 instead. As I understand, that one has a library of games you can purchase and play on it but Skyrim also doesn&#39;t seem to be one of them.</p> <p>I hear connecting the Met

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The way the human enemies function in the game plus the horror movie slasher way you can go about stealth. The open area level design, talking to npcs with minor choices to make, having a hub area they can dress as a kind of theives den with fences, crafting tables and a merchant. Realistically I&#39;d imagine it&#39;d be more stealth focused unless you play as an outright psycho. You&#39;d break into houses for stuff to steal or target items while hiding and sneaking from occupants/go loud and kill occupants for stress free stealing. Take down rival criminal hideouts to take out target npcs. The tower level in retribution really put the idea in my head even though the other levels would be better for that kind of game. Do we have a GTA clone in VR already? Is there another studio the community thinks could do better? I just feel like Skydance already has the bones ready for something like that</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hre
