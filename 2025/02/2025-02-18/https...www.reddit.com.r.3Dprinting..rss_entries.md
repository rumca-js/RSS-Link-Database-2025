<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone! I just came across some cool news about how iPhone lidar and 3D printing can help create prosthetics for dogs. </p> <p>If you have a dog with a missing limb, you can scan its body using your iPhone to create a 3D model of your dog. You send that to a company called 3D Pets, and they will 3D print a prosthetic for your pet. This process has made pet prosthetics much cheaper, faster, and more precise. The whole process can take about 24 hours.</p> <p>You do need an iPhone 12 Pro or later, as it uses a technology called lidar that was more recently introduced into iPhones.</p> <p>I&#39;ve put a link below for more details on this process which also has a really cool YouTube video of the process.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.lidarnews.com/iphone-lidar-dog-prosthetics/">https://blog.lidarnews.com/iphone-lidar-dog-prosthetics/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LidarNews-InTheScan"> /u/L
