<p>The Nvidia RTX 5090 costs <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2585806/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review.html">two thousand freakin’ dollars</a>, and the cheapest of the new cards is still $550.

It might be sooner than you think, according to some records filed by the Eurasian Economic Commission. </p>

<p>Telling them apart can be tricky, though. Thanks to a few name changes, what’s old sounds new and what’s new sounds old. If you haven’t kept up with the updates, it may not be clear which one you want — or if you actually prefer to run both. </p>



<p>To help you decide, I’ve broken down what each app does. Let’s dig in.</p>

<p>The AI chatbot ChatGPT from Open AI has triggered the hype surrounding generative artificial intelligence and dominates much of the media coverage.</p>



<p>However, in addition to the AI models from Open AI, there are other chatbots that deserve attention. And unlike ChatGPT, these are also available for local use on the PC and can even be used free of charge for an unlimited period of time.</p>



<p>We’ll show you four local chatbots that also run on older hardware. You can talk to them or create texts with them.</p>



<p>The chatbots presented here generally consist of two parts, a front end and an AI model, the large language model.</p>



<p>You decide which model runs in the front end after installing the tool. Operation is not difficult if you know the basics. However, some of the chatbots offer very extensive setting options. Using these require

<p>While Chromebooks are generally limited compared to Windows and macOS laptops, I personally <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2500763/why-i-switched-from-windows-to-chromebooks-and-havent-looked-back.html">made the switch to Chromebooks full-time</a> a while ago and haven’t looked back. One of the big reasons for that switch — and why I’m a big Chromebook advocate to this day — is just how effortlessly secure ChromeOS is for everyday users.</p>



<p>Google built ChromeOS to be as secure as possible, with features designed to limit your exposure to malware. Sure, you can find some of these features in other operating systems too, but all of these coming together in one overall package is what makes ChromeOS great.</p>



<p>Here are the core security features of ChromeOS that make Chromebooks safe and keep you protected while using your laptop.</p>
