But we provided education and support groups for mental health and disability. I&#39;m the coordinator of community engagement. Anyways, it&#39;s a Christian University, and they have policies about being in same sex relationships. I&#39;ve been dating a women for a little while now, and recently the advisor of my club (a factually member) found out. While she wants to support me, she also has policies she has to follow as an employee. Anyways, during our advising meeting today she basically told me she won&#39;t report me, but if another student does she can&#39;t be a confidential resource for me, and I am now at risk of loosing my position. I don&#39;t know what to do. This position means so much to me. I&#39;m so scared. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/commander_bo",

Naturally, I wasn&#39;t sure what to say to my roommate about the cuddling, or whether I should even say anything at all, because my roommate just seemed to act as if nothing had even happened that night. But I still had these feelings of uncertainty in my gut, so after about 3 weeks of being silent, I finally gathered the courage asked her about why she cuddled me that night, and her response had shocked me.</p> <p>At first she said she felt bad for me that night since I was terrified of the thunder, but then 2 days later, she admitted that she was bi, and also found me kind of cute, hence the forehead kiss. She apologised and asked for forgiveness, in case I thought she might have came off too strong, but I didn&#39;t mind",

Yesterday, I posted about a makeup guide I wrote for my trans friend\u2019s birthday. (She loved it btw!!) </p> <p>A few people commented saying they were interested in reading the full guide, so I have formatted it in an easily readable way. It will take some time to format the entire thing, but I will post as I go (:</p> <p>Here is what I will definitely cover: lipgloss, lipstick, blush, eyeshadow, mascara, how to remove makeup. </p> <p>Enjoy, and please ask any questions or give suggestions for future topics!! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Alina_168\"> /u/Alina_168 </a>",
