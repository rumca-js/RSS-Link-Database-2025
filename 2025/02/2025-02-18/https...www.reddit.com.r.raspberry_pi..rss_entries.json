I can&#39;t get it to work, no matter what I try. I think it might not even be turning on because the red LED isn&#39;t turning on when I plug in the micro-USB cable to the PWR in port. I hope this is a possible task (fingers crossed this works). Please Help! Thanks!</p> <p>Edit: I am trying to do this by screen sharing to the Blackberry using either a Wi-Fi hotspot or Bluetooth.
