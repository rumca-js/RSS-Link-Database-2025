<p>eBay is running some killer deals right now with unbeatable prices on refurbished laptops, like <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2603948/whoa-get-this-asus-chromebook-with-8gb-ram-for-just-109.html">this Chromebook for just over a hundred bucks</a>. But if you prefer Windows, you can get an equally amazing deal from Acer, whose official eBay account is selling an AMD-powered touchscreen laptop with 16GB of RAM <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/266889342994">for just $275.99</a>.</p>



<p>The Acer Aspire 3 offers a 15.6-inch 1080p touchscreen, a mid-range AMD Ryzen 5 7520U quad-core processor, 16GB of RAM (which is as low as I would go for Windows 11 these days), and a roomy 1TB SSD. Those specs are hard to find on <em>any</em> Windows laptop under $500 right now, but Acer is selling a refurbished one for darn near half that price.</p>

<p>PDF files are ubiquitous in this cross-platform world, making it possible to view and share documents across a range of devices. While simply viewing or commenting on a PDF can be accomplished with free software, there are times when you might need to engage with a PDF document more extensively, such as making edits, reorganizing a file, or working with others to make changes. That’s where a a full-featured PDF editor comes in.</p>



<p>The best PDF editors allows you to edit, create, alter, and convert PDF files just like you would with any other text document. Adobe Acrobat is the most well-known option for most people.

<p>Decades after Microsoft shipped Windows, there’s still no mechanism for moving <em>everything</em> from one PC to another, in much the same way Android or iOS sets up a new device. But a solution <em>may</em> be on the way: MigrationApp, a tool that is seemingly hidden within new test builds of Windows.</p>



<p>Fingers crossed that MigrationApp (or Windows Migrate) is what it seems: a one-stop, one-size-fits-all solution to move every file on your existing PC to a new PC. </p>



<p>To date, the only application that I’ve ever seen (and used) that does this is <a href="https://software.pcworld.com/p36894-laplink_pcmover_home">Laplink’s PCMover</a>, which basically allows you to clone an entire PC’s file structure on to a new PC.

<p>Microsoft and Qualcomm have been pushing their Arm-based Copilot+ laptops hard over the last year.
