It then blacklists it and moves on to the next. Annoyingly a lot of this things are stuff I\u2019ve downloaded before without an issues (my pool died and I lost everything - now I\u2019ve got redundancy!).</p> <p>Some things do work though, just not everything. I can\u2019t find a fault anywhere - short of buying a second server what are my options?
