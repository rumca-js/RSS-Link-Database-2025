Unlike the CV1, I&#39;ve been getting headaches and/or eyestrain after using the Quest . I noticed a thread from about a year ago where former Quest 2 users were complaining about the same issue when they switched to the Q3, and the thought among some was maybe it was caused by the change from Fresnel to pancake lenses. I was wondering if anyone experiencing similar problems with the 3 had better luck with the 3S, since the later also has the Fresnel lenses?</p> <p>Here&#39;s some details and things I have tried so far:</p> <ul> <li>Got a BoboVR M3 head strap to reduce pressure on my face. I definitely like it, but that didn&#39;t solve the issue.</li> <li>I&#39;m using Zenni prescription lens inserts. These seem to work well, but whether I use them or just my glasses doesn&#39;t make a difference for the problem (my Rx is about a year old, btw).</li>",

It works well and I have been enjoying it, but its old. I was thinking about getting my money back and putting it towards a quest 2 that&#39;s 100-110 on fb marketplace. I&#39;m really only using it with PCVR and the few games I want to play are golf+ and like f1 24 and maybe a couple other games I don&#39;t know I might like. Nonetheless I have a ton of people who are saying get the 3s but idk if I&#39;m ready to put 250-300 towards a VR when I have no idea how much I&#39;m going to play it. Is the Quest 2 for 100-110 worth it in 2025 or what should I do? Thanks in advance.

In a nutshell: the headset delivers on the lofty expectations we already got from seeing the headset at CES. </p> <p>I am impressed by the build-quality, it is just so good. Also the lenses are spectacular. They are much bigger than those of the Bigscreen Beyond, the competing MicroOLED PCVR headset. </p> <p>Visuals are stunning, with real OLED blacks and vibrant colors all at that very high resolution of 4k per eye. Lenses are good as well, very nice sweetspot and edge to edg",

I\u2019m currently a CV1 owner and played a lot during the first gen of game releases, however I\u2019m upgrading my computer from a 1080ti and I want to jump back in with a newer headset. </p> <p>The issue is that all of the headsets come with some kind of trade off even at higher prices. I initially thought I wanted a BSB but since I skipped index that would mean purchasing a lot of equipment, and at the price point still accepting many limitations. My thinking was that getting a quest 3 until something better that really knocks it out of the park would be the way forward. Would this sub generally agree with that thinking? would you recommend the psvr or another headset instead?</p> <p>For context I\u2019ve always played with wires, and budget isn\u2019t a huge issue, but I don\u2019t want to waste money. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/nariyana\"",

The microphone input is visible and I can click on it, but when I try to speak I get 0% when I test out the mic. I have already enabled the microphone for the virtual desktop on Steam, but it still won&#39;t work. I have tried making the virtual desktop microphone the default and it still won&#39;t work I have even tried disabling the Oculus Links microphone. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers multiple times and turned my PC and Quest on and off a few times and it still does not work.</p> <p>Any help is greatly appreciated </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/IsaacMcCracken\"> /u/IsaacMcCracken </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"ht",

I have the opportunity to get a psvr2 with a PC adapter and accessories for 350, maybe 300 bucks. I do own a PS5, and would not be bothered by the fresnel lenses or the sweet spot as much as other people. Could anyone recommend the psvr2, and if anyone has ever owned a quest 1 in the past, how does the sweet spot on that compare to the psvr2 one? Is it worse or better?

However, I recently learned that PCVR offers better graphics and performance, and I do have a gaming PC capable of running anything.</p> <p>My main question is about battery life\u2014does running PCVR (wirelessly) use less battery compared to playing games standalone, or is it about the same? I like the convenience of launching games directly on the Quest, and the extra steps with PCVR (launching Virtual Desktop (which isn\u2019t free), connecting to my PC, then starting the game) seem like a bit of a hassle.</p> <p>If PCVR significantly improves battery life, I might be willing to make the switch.

It took a bit to get the settings the way I wanted and to use vrocker effectively. I landed on having to hold the left joystick forward for the app to register any movement and a few minor adjustments elsewhere in the settings. The only thing that was not great was me not being able to stay in one spot and eventually ending up near my guardian boundary and getting the Quest grid pop up. That broke immersion. I&#39;ve been brainstorming how I can keep myself in one spot physically to stay immersed using vrocker. </p> <p>I bought the Kat Walk C2 Core that will be delivered in a couple weeks. I got impatient since my real treadmill broke the other day (my justification for the Kat Walk) and needed an exercise similar to walking/jogging from home. That&#39;s when I found vrocker.
