A new study reveals that more than 1 million interstellar objects, each larger than the Statue of Liberty, may be residing in the Oort Cloud. These objects, believed to have originated from the Alpha Centauri system, were captured by the Sun’s gravity and are now part of our solar system. Unlike fast-moving interstellar visitors, these objects remain hidden due to their vast distance and lack of illumination. The study also suggests that as Alpha Centauri moves closer to the Sun over the next 28,000 years, more interstellar objects may enter the solar system, potentially increasing detection chances and providing insights into material exchange between stellar systems.
