<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Been shopping around for public-sector-focused conferences and stumbled upon the Billington summits in Washington DC. Seems they offer a State/Local flavor in March, as well as a more all-encompassing (Federal?) one in September.</p> <p>Has anybody attended these? And if so, what did you like/dislike about them? Also, what is the level of formality in terms of dress code etc? Billington <em>appears</em> to be a bit more business-like compared to the likes of Defcon and other cybersecurity conferences.</p> <p>Any input appreciated, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CompetitionWarm6941"> /u/CompetitionWarm6941 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1isnmna/what_is_the_vibe_at_billington_summits/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1isnmna/what_is_the_vibe_at_billington_summits/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One thing I’ve learned over the years is that even if someone is a rockstar at pentesting or threat hunting it doesn’t necessarily make them a great cybersecurity professional unless they can communicate effectively.</p> <p>It’s not just about “dumbing down” the details, it’s about translating technical risks into business impacts so that management, legal teams, and other stakeholders can actually understand what’s going on. I’ve seen the best technical arguments fall on deaf ears simply because they weren’t framed in a way that connected with the audience’s priorities.</p> <p>I’m curious: what strategies have you all found helpful for bridging that gap between deeply technical knowledge and a broader business perspective? Do you rely on specific frameworks or methodologies that help outline risk in more accessible terms? Any favorite tips or resources you’d recommend for sharpening your communication skills,especially when talking with non-technica

I was an app sec engineer for past 6 years with core software development 3 years before that, I was solely responsible for pushing things in my domain. I set up the SAST, SCA, DAST in our CICD Pipeline and reviewed ASVS checklists, security readiness checklists and performed some design reviews here and there. What I didn’t particularly focus on was ISO 27001, Threat Modeling, penetration testing or mobile app security. Purely because my company never showed interest in those things, penetration testing was taken care of by an external vendor. </p> <p>Now the dilemma is, my company laid off most of the workforce last month, I’ve been applying to new jobs but there hasn’t been a lot of response, it feels like every JD out there wants an all rounder cyber security person with extensive experience in app security and penetration testing along with deep knowledge of those standa

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys.</p> <p>Currently we have a request at work from a customer who wants to use their own ceriticate signing instead of the certificate signing authority built into our application. The customer wants to use a API gateway in between and essentially use there own configuration.</p> <p>Essentially what im trying to ask is what is the risk of letting our customer use they&#39;re own CA for certificate signing which we will have to trust certificate signing externally?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lowkib"> /u/lowkib </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1irz67y/approving_external_ca_and_signing_certificates/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1irz67y/approving_external_ca_and_signing_certificates/">[comments]</a></span>
