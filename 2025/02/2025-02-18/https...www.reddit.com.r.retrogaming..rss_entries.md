The only clues are as follows:</p> <p>Played the game on the OG Playstation</p> <p>Early 2000s</p> <p>Dinosaur fighting game</p> <p>2 player</p> <p>Pink disc</p> <p>We&#39;ve already looked around online a lot but haven&#39;t found anything that seems to fit. It&#39;s not Disney Dinosaur, any of the Jurassic Park games, or Dino Crisis. Any ideas would be great at this point it&#39;s just driving us both insane. If you need anymore details I can try but this is all I&#39;ve gotten out of her thus far.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was thinking of making my stock ssd (that came in the laptop) a mini emulation library, put it in an enclosure and connec by usb. But the stock ssd is dramless and the pc usb port is slow, but I was only thinking of running it for up to ps1/gamecube era. Would it be ok ? would it be to slow for those later ones?<br/> Is it a bad idea all together?<br/> The enclosure is 10gbps max, so even if not optimal now maybe when I upgrade the laptop I can still use it, but is even that enough for the newer gen consoles (gamecube, etc) ?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ace_D_Roses"> /u/Ace_D_Roses </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ispx1x/dramless_ssd_in_an_enclosure_10gbps_in_a_usb_port/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ispx1x/dramless_ssd_in_an_enclosure_10gbps_in_a_usb_port/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I never owned this thing but I remember seeing commercials around the holidays for it. This was probably late 90s. The gimmick was it a fold-away console with a built in screen. I think the fold away part was really just these two side speakers on hinges that opened up revealing the screen. I also remember the commercial being like a stereotypical Mountain Dew extreme style thing that was even oddly sexual in parts. Like people panting the tagline which was something like &quot;wide open baby&quot;. I&#39;m not making this up. Anyways I&#39;ve been trying to find it forever. Does this ring any bells for anyone?</p> <p>** Edit - I think a few people nailed it and it wasn&#39;t a console like I thought. I&#39;m almost totally convinced it was the Samsung GX TV.

It was a simple game, your character didn&#39;t move besides aiming the machine gun, but my Google research has made it nowhere.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><em>Spoiler alert for end of game photos</em> || Man, it’s been over a decade since I last completed this game. I sort of forgot just how damn good it is. I mean, I knew it was amazing…just didn’t expect the story to make me emotional AGAIN. It really is an incredibly bittersweet story. The gameplay is about as good as Game Boy gets. It’s fun to kill monsters, use all the equipment, and the puzzles are perfectly difficult. I’ll always prefer the combat of Zelda II, but even with the manual the story isn’t near as complex as LA. I almost played it on my DMG, but decided to use my Anbernic purely for convenience. Being able to save state and sleep the device in an instant was really nice ngl. Brilliant game and one that will forever stand the test of time. I’m going to play A Link to the Past next. Well, I might try and beat Yo! Noid, Super C, or some other game beforehand but aLttP will be my next “big” game. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted
