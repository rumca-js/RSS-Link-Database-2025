Even though I&#39;m getting close to looking for internships, I feel like I don&#39;t know anything. I don&#39;t even know what I want to specialize in. Every time I try something, it feels super basic compared to the projects other people are building, and I have no idea how to &quot;level up.&quot; The biggest project I&#39;ve done so far is a website with a few functionalities.</p> <p>Honestly, I feel lost, and I know I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s gone through this. Does anyone have any advice on how to get past this?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/SilemNabibC\"> /u/SilemNabibC </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1is2bdb/i_feel_lost/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/developer/comments/1is2bdb/i_feel_lost/\">[comments]</a></span>",
