<p>In a new study, researchers at Virginia Tech <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spelled out a variety of security hazards</a> that could compromise mixed-reality systems.</p>



<p>The researchers highlighted security threats involving the manipulation of virtual objects when users collaborated via mixed reality headsets. The work involved 20 participants from the school, with most having little or no experience with mixed-reality headsets. In many cases, the participants did not know they were being attacked; instead, they blamed technical glitches or latency issues for the problems they encountered.</p>

<p>Attempts to challenge the power of Elon Musk and his DOGE team to close down government departments have hit an unexpected complication: according to the White House, the entrepreneur is not even in charge of the operation.</p>



<p>That surprising claim was made in court papers filed by the White House on Monday. Far from running DOGE, Musk is simply another “senior adviser to the president,” with no greater authority than any other advisor, according to an affidavit filed by the White House’s Director of the Office of Administration, Joshua Fisher.</p>



<p>“Like other senior White House advisors, Mr. Musk has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself. Mr. Musk can

<p>Generative AI (genAI) projects will move from pilot phase to production for many companies this year, which means the workforce will be affected in ways never before imagined. One of those ways will involve onboarding AI agents as new digital employees.</p>



<p>One of the focus areas for global staffing firm ManpowerGroup has been its proprietary platform, Sophie, which leverages AI to tackle talent screening tasks. The staffing firm sees AI agents as playing a central role in sifting through job applicant data for clients. identify market trends, and offering hiring suggestions. When Sophie provides a recommendation — either for or against a candidate — it also explains the reasoning behindi

<p>Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI has introduced Grok 3, the latest version of its chatbot model, which Musk describes as the most advanced AI system yet.</p>



<p>xAI claims Grok 3 outperforms rival AI models from Alphabet’s Google Gemini, DeepSeek’s V3, Anthropic’s Claude, and OpenAI’s GPT-4o in benchmarks for math, science, and coding.</p>



<p>“About a month ago, Grok 3’s pre-training was completed, and since then, we’ve been working hard to integrate reasoning capabilities into the current Grok 3 model,” the company said during its launch event on Monday.</p>



<p>Musk, speaking alongside three xAI engineers in a live-streamed presentation, said Grok 3 has more than ten times the compute power
