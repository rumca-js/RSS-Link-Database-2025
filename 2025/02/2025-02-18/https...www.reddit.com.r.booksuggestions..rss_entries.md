<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I realise this is an odd request. Basically, romances in novels have a strong tendency to irritate me, but I recently realised that I don&#39;t mind a romance in my novel if it&#39;s MM. Maybe I just can&#39;t stand the way women are depicted in romances, but let&#39;s not bother speculating too much.</p> <p>I&#39;d like mystery novel suggestions that are either <em>completely</em> devoid of romance, or only depict an MM romance. The latter is almost a totally new sub-genre to me, so there&#39;s a much stronger likelihood that I haven&#39;t already read most of what&#39;s out there.</p> <p>I love wit and clever banter. I have no preference as to what &quot;type&quot; of mystery or sub-genre it is; anything from high fantasty to a classic cop drama is fine with me, so long as there&#39;s an intelligent plot that I won&#39;t guess immediately as a seasoned mystery consumer. Throw in some truely nuanced characters and I&#39;ll be forever in your debt.</

He also reflects on the psychological toll of living under occupation, where the sound of gunfire, the smell of tear gas, and the sight of soldiers became normalized.</p> <p>Through his writing, Peer humanizes the Kashmir conflict, moving beyond the headlines and statistics to reveal the complex emotions, memories, and experiences of those who lived through it. &quot;Curfewed Night&quot; is a powerful and evocative memoir that offers a unique perspective on one of the most contested regions in the world.</p> <p>One sho
