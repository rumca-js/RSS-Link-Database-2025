<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So for the last few years I&#39;ve been helping run a school funded club on my campus. I won&#39;t mention the name for privacy. But we provided education and support groups for mental health and disability. I&#39;m the coordinator of community engagement. Anyways, it&#39;s a Christian University, and they have policies about being in same sex relationships. I&#39;ve been dating a women for a little while now, and recently the advisor of my club (a factually member) found out. While she wants to support me, she also has policies she has to follow as an employee. Anyways, during our advising meeting today she basically told me she won&#39;t report me, but if another student does she can&#39;t be a confidential resource for me, and I am now at risk of loosing my position. I don&#39;t know what to do. This position means so much to me. I&#39;m so scared. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/commander_bo

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>In my last post, I asked for advice as someone who took colleagues/friends on a trip.</p> <p>They don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm gay because I haven‚Äôt shared my sexuality‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something anyone needs to know. That said, I‚Äôm quite feminine, so I guess you could say I‚Äôm a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù man.</p> <p>One of my friends keeps making comments about other friends, saying things like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gay.‚Äù He does this almost daily, but never directly about me. It doesn‚Äôt seem like he‚Äôs saying it for my sake, just about others.</p> <p>Meanwhile, my friends have casually talked about their sex lives, but they‚Äôve never asked me anything‚Äîno questions about whether I have a girlfriend or anything sex-related.</p> <p>Do you think these comments might actually be directed at me in an indirect way?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Inner_Razzmatazz_412"> /u/Inner_Razzmatazz_412 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have created a new account just for this since I think he knew my reddit account.</p> <p>My boyfriend has been acting weird lately.. Especially in an online spectrum. I have been his boyfriend for 2 years and I haven&#39;t had any problems with him up until now.</p> <p>For some reason, everything went south as soon as he mentions anything about &quot;Pronouns&quot; in video games and his opinions about &quot;Non-binaries&quot; and &quot;Trans&quot; people.</p> <p>It broke my heart when I heard him say all that, I talked to him about those topics and wanted to educate him in understanding of those.</p> <p>He thinks that LGB should be separated from TQIA+ since their goals are different (I.E. LGB has always been about sexuality and goal for same sex marriage rather than TQIA+ is about gender identity)</p> <p>It pains me to hear it. It started happening since last month, and I don&#39;t know why. Ever since, he&#39;s been watching videos from Asmongol

Naturally, I wasn&#39;t sure what to say to my roommate about the cuddling, or whether I should even say anything at all, because my roommate just seemed to act as if nothing had even happened that night. But I still had these feelings of uncertainty in my gut, so after about 3 weeks of being silent, I finally gathered the courage asked her about why she cuddled me that night, and her response had shocked me.</p> <p>At first she said she felt bad for me that night since I was terrified of the thunder, but then 2 days later, she admitted that she was bi, and also found me kind of cute, hence the forehead kiss. She apologised and asked for forgiveness, in case I thought she might have came off too strong, but I didn&#39;t mind
