<p>If Bayern Munich are heavily incentivised by the return of the Champions League final to their home stadium, this was a strange way of showing it. To Celtic, all the plaudits following a heroic showing in Bavaria.</p><p>This Celtic performance ranks among the finest by a Scottish team away from home in Europe in living memory. Extra-time felt the least they deserved after taking a second‑half lead. They were denied by a horrible, scrappy goal claimed by Alphonso Davies after a Cameron Carter-Vickers clearance flew back off him from all of two yards. Just 30 seconds of stoppage time remained. Celtic have grown in this Champions League. In Munich, they came of age. This outcome was so cruel on them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/18/bayern-munich-celtic-champions-league-playoff-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>
