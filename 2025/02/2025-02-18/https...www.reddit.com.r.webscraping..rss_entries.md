<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I would consider myself an intermediate level webscraper, for most websites for my job I can scrape pretty effectively and when I run into a wall I can throw proxies at the problem and that works. </p> <p>I&#39;ve finally met my match. A certain website uses cloudfront and perimeterX and I cant seem to get past it. If I try to scrape using requests + rotating proxies I hit a wall. At a certain point the website inserts into the cookies (__pxid, __px3) and headers and I cant seem to replicate it. I&#39;ve tried hitting a base url with a session so I could get the correct cookies but my cookie jar is always sparse lacking all the auth cookies I need for later runs. I tried using curl_cffi thinking maybe they are TLS fingerprinting but I&#39;ve still gotten no successful runs using it. The website then sends me unencoded garbage and I&#39;m sol.</p> <p>So then I tried to use selenium and do browser automation - im still doomed. i need to rotate proxies

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I need help with a project involving data extraction from tables in PDFs (preferably using python). The PDFs all have different layouts but contain the same type of information‚Äîthey‚Äôre about prices from different companies, with each company having its own pricing structure.</p> <p>I‚Äôm allowed to create separate scripts for each layout (the method for extracting data should preferably still be the same tho). I‚Äôve tried several libraries and methods to extract the data, but I haven‚Äôt been able to get the code to work properly.</p> <p>I hope I explained the problem well.
