I’ve known about this one for years, glad I finally watched it. </p> <p>Tight script, great cast and just a fun movie. It even got nominated for an Academy Award (Best Original Screenplay). </p> <p>I’d give it an 8/10 which is good for an 80s cop comedy. It’s on Paramount+ for those wondering.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ItsMeBenedickArnold"> /u/ItsMeBenedickArnold </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1isgbxr/beverly_hills_cop_1984/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1isgbxr/beverly_hills_cop_1984/">[comments]</a></span>

Lol.</p> <p>For real though, Paddington 2 is not only one of the best sequels of all time, but also one of the best films of all time (period) and now tied with Spider-verse as my favorite movie of 2018, and I mean it. </p> <p>P

Think archives, indexes, databases, classified records, or any system where the way information is stored plays a key role in solving the mystery or exposing the truth.</p> <p>A great example is <em>Spotlight</em>, where journalists rely on old diocese directories and newspaper archives to identify patterns in clergy assignments. Similarly, <em>All the President’s Men</em> hinges on tracking connections through public records. I’m also thinking of <em>Zodiac</em>, where characters analyze police reports and historical newspaper clippings to trace the killer’s communications.</p> <p>I’m particularly interested in films that highlight the power of organized information—whether it’s through librari

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi guys </p> <p>I&#39;m in the mood for a good movie with a nostalgic soundtrack, and by nostalgic I mean 90s/00s. The movie can be made back then or it can be new, doesn&#39;t really matter much. But I want there to be songs from the 90s or 00s that we remember and that makes you feel nostalgic. </p> <p>Preferably something light hearted, like a romcom/chick flick, but I&#39;m open to all suggestions. And by &quot;good movie&quot; I don&#39;t mean it has to be Oscar worthy, it can be a cheesy feelgood movie that is mostly good because of nostalgia.</p> <p>Both in the mood for some 00s pop punk songs (you know good charlotte, sum 41, blink etc) and some more poppy feelgood songs like idk Natasha Bedingfield, Britney, Backstreet boys. So basically anything you&#39;d find in a playlist for the ultimate 90s/00s.

## Movies where the protagonist takes revenge after a long time or has to find the antagonist with little information?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi there! Like the title says, I’m looking for movie suggestions where either the protagonist gets revenge after a significant amount of time has passed since the original wrongdoing (think The Northman) or has to find the antagonist without much information to go on (just a face, or just a first name, or something). I look forward to the recommendations! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/UnhappyWorking2443"> /u/UnhappyWorking2443 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1is6v0m/movies_where_the_protagonist_takes_revenge_after/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1is6v0m/movies_where_the_protagonist_takes_revenge_after/">[comments]</a></span>

## The Duff (2015) - something I just realized

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When I first watched this movie and for the longest time I wondered how Bianca wasn’t into Wes and was so into Toby (since he’s not as conventionally goodlooking as Wes). I just thought it was unbelievable that she wouldn’t be into Wes.</p> <p>But now after having watched it again I think it was done on purpose to show she isn’t as superficial as a lot of people in the movie. Even though Wes is so goodlooking she didn’t care about that. It’s kind of interesting. And also sweet.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/goodandpure"> /u/goodandpure </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1is6ld2/the_duff_2015_something_i_just_realized/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1is6ld2/the_duff_2015_something_i_just_realized/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My favorite movie is Return to me. David Duchovny and Minnie Drive were so great. To me that movie seemed so real and I cry every time I see it. My wife was killed by a drunk driver and David losing his wife was so intense. I got the call to get to the hospital and the movie brought that back. When he went home I felt every scene he acted out. Simple things like going through a sock drawer had a whole new meaning at that time My wife and were soulmates. There is no way to describe it. She was my everything. When I was watching her die and only the machines were keeping her alive I kept looking at the clock. How long do I have to sit and watch her die. They did nothing because she had a Basel Skull fracture. They just kept wrapping bandages around her head and the blood would soak through. Finally they said they cant use any of her parts for donation because they were all contaminated. She was riding her bike and was hit from behind. They found her in

## What is your favorite individual shot in John Carpenter's The Thing? Mine is the dog eerily staring out the window as the others return from investigating the Norwegian base.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There are many great shots in this movie, a variety of spectacles both big and small. Those interstitial establishing shots of the American base are perfectly lit. Very showy, nicely dramatic. Particularly at night. But even the modest/unassuming shots, like that cozy image of the two watching the VHS tape and passing around a joint, have staying power. </p> <p>Why the shot of the dog? I feel like to describe it would be to reduce it somehow. It just works on a visceral level. If I was pressed to explain, I guess I&#39;d ramble about the unnerving stillness of the dog. And, just as unnerving, the steadiness of his observation. He&#39;s watching the returning crew with keen interest. He&#39;s sizing up his new circumstances. To what extent has he been &quot;found out&quot;? It&#39;s not that dogs aren&#39;t capable of close observation or calculation. But because of the context of the story, the viewer imagines an extraterrestrial intelligence at work

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So just finished watching, Flow. Without giving too much away I will say I thought it was very well animated and the storyline was interesting to say the least. The ending was kind of emotional and touching too. Definitely right up there with The Wild Robot as not only one of the best animated films last year, but that I’ve ever seen. I would probably say I enjoyed, The Wild Robot, slightly more though. Also for those others who have seen it what are your thoughts on it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LilNello1"> /u/LilNello1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1is3527/flow/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1is3527/flow/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished watching this, so I better write this before I forget what happened in it.</p> <p>This movie feels like what I&#39;d expect out of a James Bond, but he is played by someone who is 57, and in a movie was released in 1985, probally the lowest era of Bond. </p> <p>It has all the goofy stuff you would expect such as, a man getting killed by a butterfly model, a horrible French accent and a villain who kills all his henchmen because he feels like it, only letting one survive. It&#39;s not even so Bond has one more henchman to kill he just chills in a blimp for the finale. The villain whose mother was experimented on in a concentration camp, she was given steroids, and stay with me now, so he is super smart but is also a psychopath due to the steroids. This is what I want from Bond villains, by the way, just pure goofiness. </p> <p>This is one that I somehow had never seen, despite me watching these a lot when I was younger, this one I neve
