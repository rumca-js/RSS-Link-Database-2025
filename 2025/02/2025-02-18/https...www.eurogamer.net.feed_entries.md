Free-to-play hero shooter Marvel Rivals has been a huge success for publisher NetEase, smashing through the 20m player barrier just weeks into its launch and still regularly attracting over 250K daily concurrent players on Steam. But that hasn't been enough to stop NetEase from making lay offs across the US development team that helped land it a hit.

<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Pirate-Yakuza-10-go-team.jpg?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p>Anyone unfamiliar with the Like A Dragon series might assume it's the gaming equivalent of a Wetherspoons with poor acoustics: suffocating noise, confusing conversations, reused textures, and the constant, anxious threat of erupting violence. And while it's true that at least 60 percent of your problems can be resolved by hitting menacing men with bicycles, the Yakuza games actually have disarming emotional range. They're as much about reflective conversations on rooftops as they are about punching bears; the only games that let you crush an enemy's ass with a weaponised bollard <em>and</em> make you contemplate what it means to grow old in a world you no longer recognise.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Read more</a></p>

It was at this point that Don't Nod and its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> series permanently parted ways, leaving future fra
