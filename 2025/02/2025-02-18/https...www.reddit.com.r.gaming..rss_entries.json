Am I just jaded or have things changed? </p> <p>Examples I can think of are things like the physics engine in GTA IV, the way characters would dynamically react to their environment, grabbing hand rails to stop them falling. </p> <p>The Fight Night series had some seriously impressive tech when it first arrived on the scene. The deformation of the fighters faces as they were punched. </p> <p>Dead Rising was essentially a fully developed tech demo, showing off the number of enemies you could have on screen at once.</p> <p>The AI in MGS2, the way the guards carried out their searches, I remember being in awe at the destructability, the way you could interact with guards as you held them at gunpoint, how they would respond differently depending on what part of them you aimed at, it was all so different from what had gone before. </p> ",

From discovering minecraft cluelessly running around with no mission at all and being fascinated by it to playing Assassin&#39;s creed story and other games of the era. Replaying them has no effect . I sieze to have any emotion (in general) and i sometimes just consume content on yt and thats all i do on pc besides some small amount of work. So all i gained from gaming was a cool childhood but a very sad habit of trying to find the new discovery , the enjoyable again while i can&#39;t. Any tips? Its not always about not having free time.

To me and my brother&#39;s joy, the SNES games were included with the $7 for 7 videos for 7 days deal that the shop was running.</p> <p>The guy running the shop asked me really nicely what sort of games I liked and if he could recommend one. I said that I really enjoyed A Link to the Past. He said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;ll like this, it&#39;s called Illusion of Gaia. Really similar.&quot; With that my fate was sealed, and I rented the game and went home. </p> <p>Illusion of Gaia is a JRPG, but without the turn based combat.

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a &quot;polish&quot; thing or what.</p> <p>Are there other Yakuza games that I should try?

It&#39;s me first time playing a game in years, and I haven&#39;t played an RPG before, so I am not much informed about Spells, Potions and all other abilities. I would love your suggestions for a beginner like me, I tried persuasion in starting regardless of warning and it made me less charming, then I helped a guy with Imperial gold that Fargoth has hidden, and give this Fargoth guy a ring, so am getting chunks of it, how to play it, but I still want a few advises or suggestions about anything. Either quests, or spells, or scrolls, or fighting, or conversation, or traveling, or adventure, or how to eat, or how to sleep? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Irvif\"> /u/Irvif </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1is7fyz/recently_started_playing_morrowind_being_new_to/\">[link]</a></span> &#32;",
