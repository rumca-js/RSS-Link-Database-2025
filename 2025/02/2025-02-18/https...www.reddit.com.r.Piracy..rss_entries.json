So there is this game I play on my phone called Cytus 2, and a while ago I bought DLC for it, but have since lost it and support does not help at all, my question is, from using a cracked copy of the game, is there anyway I can transfer ALL the dlc (including ones I never bought) to the files of the main application from the play store?
