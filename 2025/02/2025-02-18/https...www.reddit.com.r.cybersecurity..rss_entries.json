Seems they offer a State/Local flavor in March, as well as a more all-encompassing (Federal?) one in September.</p> <p>Has anybody attended these? And if so, what did you like/dislike about them? Also, what is the level of formality in terms of dress code etc? Billington <em>appears</em> to be a bit more business-like compared to the likes of Defcon and other cybersecurity conferences.</p> <p>Any input appreciated, thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/CompetitionWarm6941\"> /u/CompetitionWarm6941 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1isnmna/what_is_the_vibe_at_billington_summits/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1isnmna/what_is_the_vibe_at_billington_summits/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I was an app sec engineer for past 6 years with core software development 3 years before that, I was solely responsible for pushing things in my domain. I set up the SAST, SCA, DAST in our CICD Pipeline and reviewed ASVS checklists, security readiness checklists and performed some design reviews here and there. What I didn\u2019t particularly focus on was ISO 27001, Threat Modeling, penetration testing or mobile app security. Purely because my company never showed interest in those things, penetration testing was taken care of by an external vendor. </p> <p>Now the dilemma is, my company laid off most of the workforce last month, I\u2019ve been applying to new jobs but there hasn\u2019t been a lot of response, it feels like every JD out there wants an all rounder cyber security person with extensive experience in app security and penetration testing along with deep knowledge of those standa",
