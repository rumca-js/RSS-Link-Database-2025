## We Found the Sucker Willing to Buy Humane, and as Promised, I’m Going to Be Insufferable, Because of Course It Was HP

<p>Brody Ford, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HP Inc. will acquire assets from Humane Inc., the maker of a
wearable Ai Pin introduced in late 2023, for $116 million.</p>

<p>The deal will include the majority of Humane’s employees in
addition to its software platform and intellectual property, the
company said Tuesday. It will not include Humane’s Ai pin device
business, which will be wound down, an HP spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Humane’s team, including founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany
Bongiorno, will form a new division at HP to help integrate
artificial intelligence into the company’s personal computers,
printers and connected conference rooms, said Tuan Tran, who leads
HP’s AI initiatives. Chaudhri and Bongiorno were design and
software engineers at Apple Inc. before founding the startup.</p>

<p>I cracked wise in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/golfo_del_gringo_loco#fn1-2025-02-17">a footnote yesterday</a> about MapQuest still being around, but it turns out they’re not only still around, and they’re not only still labelling the Gulf of Mexico by its world-recognized not-stupid name, but they’ve actually built an entire website that perfectly jibes with my closing argument — to wit, that this whole thing is objectively hilarious and that mockery is our best tool to subvert a kakistocracy. Bravo.</p>

<p>You saw the news last week, I’m sure, that both of the major mapping-app providers, Google and Apple, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-maps-gulf-of-america/">have updated their maps to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America”</a>. Microsoft’s Bing Maps, which I would describe as a minor provider, has made the change too.<sup id="fnr1-2025-02-17"><a href="#fn1-2025-02-17">1</a></sup> It’s all actually quite a bit more complicated than “they renamed the Gulf of Mexico”, but bear with me for now.</p>

<p>You’ve also seen, I’m equally sure, a lot of people angry at Google and Apple for going along with this. That anger is — to some degree — misplaced. I get where the anger comes from, but it’s still misplaced. My initial take, right in the midst of Trump’s inauguration speech on January 20, was that if he went through with it, Apple and Google and everyone else who publishes maps should just ignore it. Trump, obviously, did go through with it: the United
