Mindy Vogel (Krsy Fox), a single mother, is summoned to her basement by the ringing of a bell. A barely glimpsed monster with a lugubrious but threatening voice demands that she feed him.

She tells him she\u2019ll need to go to the hospital if this carries on much longer; the abusive relationship parallels are not accidental. This monster is dangerous, but he\u2019s also a parasite, standing in contrast to the horror genre\u2019s typical one-munch-and-you\u2019re-done type beast.</p><p>Unfortunately, from this point on the drama sags.
