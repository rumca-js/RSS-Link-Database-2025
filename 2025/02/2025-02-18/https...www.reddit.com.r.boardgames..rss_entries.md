I bought it to play with my wife, which we did twice but since we bought Cascadia it’s by far our preferred game out of the two and azul just sat collecting dust. </p> <p>People who come to my game nights are intrigued by its pretty pieces but ultimately the game just isn’t a good fit so I sold it.

But nobody at my table likes it, and we have similar ish games that end up being preferred by my groups. I tried the solo rules and it wasn’t very fun.

I&#39;m looking to add a pirate-themed board game to my collection, and I&#39;ve narrowed it down to three choices: Pirates of Maracaibo, Ahoy and Islebound: Emerald Edition.<br/> I&#39;m a big fan of Euro games with multiple strategic paths - my all-time favourite is Caverna. That&#39;s why Pirates of Maracaibo caught my eye.<br/> However, I also feel that my collection lacks interactive and conflict-heavy games, so I&#39;m considering Ahoy and Islebound as they seem to introduce more player interaction . As I don&#39;t have many games with negative interaction, I think it might be fun to try something different.</p> <p>So my main questions to you all are:<br/> Which of these games do you think best captures the feeling of a pirate adventure?<br/> Would any of these games scratch both my Euro-strategy itch and my need for a more interactive experience?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/

Very thematic. Big board with a lot of various ships, each doing its own business (NPC pirates rob merchants, NPC warships hunt pirates and ships of hostile nations, if war is declared, etc), deck of events, many thematic little rules.</p> <p>As for flaws, it feels that game is quite imbalanced: merchant has much easier time winning than pirate. And very punishing: after defeat in the battle you lose almost everything, and your chance of victory drop dramatically.</p> <p>Also Merchants &amp; Marauders is long; one of the longest sandbox games.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, Guys! My husband and I like to play board games together. I have ADHD, so that means my working memory and ability to concentrate are both really impaired. As a result, it can take me a while to take my turn - especially when I&#39;m getting used to a new game (or new mechanics or new ANYTHING). My husband and I both enjoy heavier games where there&#39;s more strategy involved, so this comes up a lot at the beginning of a new game, new expansion, etc. I&#39;d love your ideas for how to solve this issue. </p> <p>Once I understand a game, it&#39;s fine. For example, my favorite game is Ark Nova. The first times I played, I took eleventy billion years for each turn. 🤣 Now that I understand the game, it&#39;s very easy for me to remember the parts and play just as quickly as everyone else. I can plan ahead and see patterns no problem! You&#39;d never know I had impaired working memory because... well... I&#39;m not using my working memory! </p> <p>So
