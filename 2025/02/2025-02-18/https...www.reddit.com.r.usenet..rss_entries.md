<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m having an issue with downloading things at the moment, when I try to download something it starts to download for about 1 second and then stops, errors and says that download cannot be completed. It then blacklists it and moves on to the next. Annoyingly a lot of this things are stuff I’ve downloaded before without an issues (my pool died and I lost everything - now I’ve got redundancy!).</p> <p>Some things do work though, just not everything. I can’t find a fault anywhere - short of buying a second server what are my options? Or is there something I’m missing?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deegee457"> /u/deegee457 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ismram/eweka_nzbgeek/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ismram/eweka_nzbgeek/">[comments]</a></span>
