I&#39;m looking to add a pirate-themed board game to my collection, and I&#39;ve narrowed it down to three choices: Pirates of Maracaibo, Ahoy and Islebound: Emerald Edition.<br/> I&#39;m a big fan of Euro games with multiple strategic paths - my all-time favourite is Caverna. That&#39;s why Pirates of Maracaibo caught my eye.<br/> However, I also feel that my collection lacks interactive and conflict-heavy games, so I&#39;m considering Ahoy and Islebound as they seem to introduce more player interaction . As I don&#39;t have many games with negative interaction, I think it might be fun to try something different.</p> <p>So my main questions to you all are:<br/> Which of these games do you think best captures the feeling of a pirate adventure?<br/> Would any of these games scratch both my Euro-strategy itch and my need for a more interactive experience?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/",

I was pretty set in getting Season 2 since it was the only thing available but I have now realized that both Fear of the Unknown and Season 4 has hit the shelves of my available stores.</p> <p>Any seasoned &#39;gators that may have a recommendation on which one to get? Should we just keep going down the timeline or is any of the three products just better than the rest? </p> <p>Thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/m0uzer\"> /u/m0uzer </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1isd6fs/cthulhu_death_may_die_what_to_get_next/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1isd6fs/cthulhu_death_may_die_what_to_get_next/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I have ADHD, so that means my working memory and ability to concentrate are both really impaired. As a result, it can take me a while to take my turn - especially when I&#39;m getting used to a new game (or new mechanics or new ANYTHING). My husband and I both enjoy heavier games where there&#39;s more strategy involved, so this comes up a lot at the beginning of a new game, new expansion, etc. I&#39;d love your ideas for how to solve this issue. </p> <p>Once I understand a game, it&#39;s fine. For example, my favorite game is Ark Nova. The first times I played, I took eleventy billion years for each turn. \ud83e\udd23 Now that I understand the game, it&#39;s very easy for me to remember the parts and play just as quickly as everyone else. I can plan ahead and see patterns no problem! You&#39;d never know I had impaired working memory because... well... I&#39;m not using my working memory! </p> <p>So",
