The Insane Logistics Behind Building Wind Turbines. Go to https://surfshark.com/undecided for 4 extra months of Surfshark. Hearing about how massive wind turbines are built is one thing, but seeing it is another. Last year, I got to visit the Bekevar Wind Farm in Saskatchewan, Canada, months ahead of its completion in November 2024. So, what did I discover on my turbine travels? What can we learn from Bekevar? And just how do they handle the insane logistics of building such a massive project?

Special thanks to RES-Group for welcoming me onto the site.
