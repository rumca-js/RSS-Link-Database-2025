Paid content for @Prada. Whale sharks—the largest fish in the ocean—are a vulnerable species, yet these gentle giants don't feed on anything bigger than your index finger. The only way to protect them is to understand them. That’s why Prada Group has been working with UNESCO-IOC since 2019 to educate students and inspire the next generation of ocean stewards who will continue the fight against pollution through the SEA BEYOND project.
