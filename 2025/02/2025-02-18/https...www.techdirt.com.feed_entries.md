You probably saw that one of Donald Trump&#8217;s early executive orders was to demand that the Gulf Of Mexico be renamed the Gulf Of America. It&#8217;s pointless pseudo-productivity, and an obvious effort to excite his base&#8217;s nationalist and racist tendencies. Amoral cowards at Google got right to work making the change in their map products, [&#8230;]

I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb here and make a fairly wild suggestion: if you spend years calling yourself a &#8220;free speech absolutist&#8221; while decrying &#8220;government censorship,&#8221; maybe one of your first moves after taking over the government shouldn&#8217;t be demanding prison sentences for journalists who report things you don&#8217;t like. But that’s [&#8230;]

## German Prosecutors Think It’s Funny People’s Homes Are Being Raided And Their Devices Seized Because They Said Stuff On The Internet

Germany&#8217;s history informs its current laws. That much is undeniable. But it doesn&#8217;t excuse the over-correction applied by legislators in hopes of heading off another Hitler. And it certainly doesn&#8217;t excuse prosecutors who are prosecuting &#8220;hate speech&#8221; in Germany. The country&#8217;s hate speech law has been problematic since its inception. Within days of its debut [&#8230;]

Here&#8217;s a silly thing that happens sometimes: A powerful person says something obviously false, and everyone pretends not to notice. This is the plot of &#8220;The Emperor&#8217;s New Clothes,&#8221; where an entire kingdom maintains a collective delusion until one child (who, importantly, hasn&#8217;t yet learned the sophisticated art of lying to yourself) points out that [&#8230;]

Suing Elon Musk and DOGE has finally led to at least one thing: the White House now finally defining Musk’s role in government. On Monday night, in the New Mexico v. Musk, it claimed him as a “an employee of the White House Office” with only “the ability to advise the President, or communicate the [&#8230;]
