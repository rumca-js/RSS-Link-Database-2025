<p>AI hardware startup Humane has given its users just ten (10!) days notice that their Pins will be disconnected. In <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://support.humane.com/hc/en-us/articles/34374173951373-Important-Update-for-Consumer-Ai-Pin-Customers">a note to its customers</a>, the company said AI Pins will “continue to function normally” until 12PM PT on February 28. On that date, users will lose access to essentially all of their device’s features, including but not limited to calling, messaging, AI queries and cloud access. The FAQ does note that you&#39;ll still be able to check on your battery life, though.</p>
<p>Humane is encouraging its users to download any stored data before February 28, as it plans on permanently deleting “all remaining customer data” at the same time as switching its servers off.</p>

<p>Spotify is rolling out a Music Pro tier later this year that will give users access to higher-quality audio and remixing tools, according to <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-15/spotify-weighs-6-premium-for-added-features-access-to-tickets?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The tier will reportedly cost users $6 per month on top of their $12 Premium subscription, but they&#39;ll be priced differently across regions and will be cheaper in less-developed markets. Many long-time Spotify subscribers, however, will probably say that they&#39;ll believe it when they see it. The service teased a high-fidelity streaming option way back in 2017 and had <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html">confirmed</a> that it was working to provide users with access to lossless audio in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, Apple’s Tim Cook teed up a new product for launch on February 19 — that’s tomorrow. Cook’s tweet also included an animated image of a shimmering Apple logo, which made a lot of us assume the reveal could be for a second-generation AirTag. It’s been rumored for a while that Apple would introduce a second-gen tracker sometime this year, and the original AirTag landed almost four years ago. So there are plenty of tech upgrades the tracker could benefit from.</p>
<p>Rumors suggest the next AirTag may feature a more tamper-proof speaker to reduce stalking and an improved Ultra-Wideband chip with up to 3x longer tracking range. However, would the CEO of Apple tweet (and hype up) a mere accessory? Probably not. Following a barrage of leaks and rumors, <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-will-reportedly-announce-a-new-iphone-se-next-week-120006642.html">a next-gen iPhone SE seems more likely</a>.</p>

<p>Tablets have become the all-purpose gap-fillers of the gadgets world. If you’re on a plane and you want something portable but slightly bigger than your phone for reading comics or watching movies, there’s nothing better. Alternatively, if you want a shared device for the living room to control smart home stuff, do a bit of shopping or doomscrolling (it’s ok, we’re not judging), having a slim little slate that lives on your coffee table is super convenient. And if you want something sleek to carry around for work or school, tablets can totally replace laptops now, too.<br><br>That said, one change we’ve made to this guide for 2025 is adjusting some of the categories, because let’s be honest: If you’re an Android person, no amount of browbeating is going to convince you to switch ecosystems and buy an iPad. The same goes for all the Apple people or Windows die-hards out there. And that’s more than OK. So instead of crowning a best overall, we’re simply recommending the most powerfu
