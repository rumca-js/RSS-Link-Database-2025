<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://github.com/H4NM/WhoYouCalling">WhoYouCalling</a> is a Windows commandline tool i&#39;ve built to make process network analysis very easy (and comprehensive!). It provides with a text format of endpoints as well as a full packet capture per process. About 5 months ago i published the initial release to <a href="/r/hacking">r/hacking</a> --&gt; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ftvbjz/whoyoucalling_a_tool_to_get_a_pcap_per_process/">link</a>. Since then, i&#39;ve implemented: </p> <ul> <li>functionality of monitoring every TCPIP and DNS activity of every process running on the system at the same time</li> <li>DNS responses to processes (resolved IP adresses of domains) are generated as DFL filters (Wireshark filters). In other words, if you have a pcap file with lots of different traffic, and you only want to see traffic going to suswebsite[.]io, you can simply copy the generated filter into wireshark.</li> <li>A time

## Would it be possible to read a 125khz proximity card and replicate the signal with the same device?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The title really explains it all. I was wondering if there was a way to copy an rfid signal and then use that signal with the same device. Is there a device like that or is it something I could make with a raspberry pi because I also have a bunch of those laying around.
