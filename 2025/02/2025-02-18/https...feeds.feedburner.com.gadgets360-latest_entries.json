NOAA and NASA\u2019s Solar Cruiser project aims to extend geomagnetic storm alert times by 50%, reducing risks to power grids, GPS, and air traffic. The new spacecraft, expected to launch in 2029, will move beyond traditional observation points for faster data collection. Scientists believe this cost-effective advancement could revolutionise space monitoring and preparedness.",

Researchers suggest that life evolves in response to planetary changes, rather than a series of improbable evolutionary leaps. This new model, led by experts in astrophysics and geobiology, could increase the likelihood of detecting extraterrestrial life. With the understanding that life progresses on a planetary timescale, future studies could focus on identifying biosignatures in exoplanetary atmospheres to find evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.",

        "description": "A new study reveals that more than 1 million interstellar objects, each larger than the Statue of Liberty, may be residing in the Oort Cloud. These objects, believed to have originated from the Alpha Centauri system, were captured by the Sun\u2019s gravity and are now part of our solar system. Unlike fast-moving interstellar visitors, these objects remain hidden due to their vast distance and lack of illumination. The study also suggests that as Alpha Centauri moves closer to the Sun over the next 28,000 years, more interstellar objects may enter the solar system, potentially increasing detection chances and providing insights into material exchange between stellar systems.",
