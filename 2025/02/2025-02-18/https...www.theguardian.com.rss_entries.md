Despite its bare-bones production and lack of actual gore, the 1974 movie carved a new path for horror film-making, and key elements were the eerie sound design and abstract score: perfect matches for the film’s red-raw storytelling and stark imagery. But despite its enduring influence, the soundtrack has never had an official release until now.</p><p>Put out by Waxwork Records, it has been painstakingly stitched together – rather like Leatherface’s horrific mask – from the original recordings, and it is startling: a cloying series of drones, scrapes, clanks and groans that draw a jagged line to genres like industrial, noise, dark ambient and <em>musique concrè

<p>Though she didn’t support the president, the performance nearly destroyed her career. Not so for Snoop Dogg in 2025</p><p>The Grammy-winning singer Chrisette Michele keeps her phone switched off, a habit that stems from her long stint in cancellation purgatory. Her brother barely got through last month to relay the news that Snoop Dogg had been DJing at a party for Donald Trump’s second inaugural, and many in the Black community were irate. Longtime fans were calling Snoop a sellout, she learned, and were unfollowing him online by the<a href="https://afrotech.com/snoop-dogg-loses-instagram-followers-after-donald-trump-event"> hundreds of thousands</a>.</p><p>Snoop remained defiant in the face of this controversy, which really peeved the hordes who well remember when Snoop was regulating Maga support in the music industry. That defiance “was the thing that resonated with me”, says Michele when I initially reach her the week after Trump’s second inauguration. “We live in a different

<p>A single mother is terrorised by an evil entity sapping her lifeforce and threatening her child in this decent horror with a genre fan’s dream cast</p><p></p><p>This one starts very strong. Mindy Vogel (Krsy Fox), a single mother, is summoned to her basement by the ringing of a bell. A barely glimpsed monster with a lugubrious but threatening voice demands that she feed him. They engage in a dialogue from which we infer this is something of a long-term dynamic, with the grim beast nibbling from her arm on a regular basis. She tells him she’ll need to go to the hospital if this carries on much longer; the abusive relationship parallels are not accidental. This monster is dangerous, but he’s also a parasite, standing in contrast to the horror genre’s typical one-munch-and-you’re-done type beast.</p><p>Unfortunately, from this point on the drama sags. Fox’s performance is top-notch, but there are a number of plot points that don’t really stack up. That might not matter in a loopier s

Pardons can show compassion and mercy in the occupant of the Oval Office. More often, they expose venality and self-preservation.</p><p>Toobin said: “One thing you can say about Donald Trump is that his moral compass always points in the same direction, and his motives are always the same, which are transactional and narcissistic.

The Matrix went from a revolutionary cyberpunk masterpiece to an interminable slog of a philosophy dissertation in which both humans and machines alike seemed to be forever fighting a losing battle with a CGI hurricane. The Terminator franchise started out as a brutally sleek and sinuous time-travel thriller that plucked at the very heartstrings of the eternal fear of the unknown at the heart of the human condition – yet ended up as the living embodiment of what happens when Hollywood repeatedly tears the living skin off its own dead-eyed robo-franchise, as if stuck in some kind of endless corp

The way to win power, it seems, is to make Maga-style appeals to the glories of yesteryear, while the best hope of keeping it is to pursue the short-term gains that will emerge before the next election. Observers of democracy have long said such patterns are inbuilt: for the 19th-century thinker Alexis de Tocqueville, “It is this clear perception of the future, founded on enlightenment and experience, that democracy will often lack. The people feel much more than they reason.” Yet today’s politicians, rather than being oblivious to the future, seem increasingly obsessed with it.</p>

Will this change our language for ever?</p><p>When Maelle Kouman, 24, turned off auto-capitalisation on her phone as a teenager, she didn’t realise it would become a lifelong habit. “Lowercase feels like an ongoing conversational tone without a start or end,” she says. “It removes the serious tone certain texts can exude, even without trying.”</p><p>Ruweyda Hilowle, 24, has also turned her back on capitals. “I text in lowercase because it feels more relaxed,” she says. “When I start using proper capitalisation, it feels as if I’m trying to make a point stronger than it needs to be.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/18/death-of-capital-letters-why-gen-z-loves-lowercase">Continue reading...</a>

There is rather more chance of reading stern-faced stories about Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazers or Manchester City’s latest legal dispute than, say, the muddy winter joys of grassroots rugby union. It is the way of the modern world and, anyway, England playing Scotland in the Six Nations this Saturday is a bigger deal, right?</p><p>Well, yes and no. If you are counting the beans inside the Rugby Football Union’s offices in Twickenham there is barely a contest.

But the natural habitat of the cleaner fish is the reef.</p><p>On a reef, each cleaner fish has clients that visit them to have their parasites removed – sometimes much bigger fish or predators such as sharks and rays. I was intrigued to discover the cleaner fish would gently massage these clients with their fins and make sure they were comfortable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/18/im-obsessed-with-cleaner-fish-salmon-farms">Continue reading...

Originally made in 2004, and shown at a few genre-specific film festivals, it never secured distribution. Still, it found a way to get seen on alternative platforms like YouTube and homemade DVDs. Frustrated with the lack of appreciation for his work, director Eugenio Mira started sending copies of the film to directors he admired like Quentin Tarantino and Guillermo del Toro among others, exactly the right kind of guys who like to champion neglected cult classics. Meanwhile, lead actor Corey Feldman (once a child star in the likes of Stand By Me and The Goonies back in the 1980s) was conducting his own under-the-radar campaign on the film’s behalf.

<p>Trump’s orders will cause hardship but it could allow small nations to face up to their dependence on a coercive oligarchy</p><p>For generations, many in the Caribbean grew up believing that the United States was the world’s great benefactor – a beacon of freedom, prosperity and boundless opportunity. Carefully cultivated through cinema, television, magazines, newspapers and radio, this perception reinforced the idea that the US was a land where hard work could secure a better life.</p><p>It was the dream destination for countless Caribbean migrants seeking to escape economic hardship and limited opportunities. But that illusion has crumbled, as historical distortions have become clear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/18/united-states-trump-aid-freeze-opportunity-caribbean-oligarchy-small-island-developing-states-climate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When China stopped receiving the world’s waste, Turkey became Europe’s recycling hotspot. The problem is, most plastics can’t be recycled. And what remains are toxic heaps of trash</p><p>On a chilly evening in late 2016, a few miles from the Turkish city of Adana, a Kurdish farmer named İzzettin Akman was sitting on the second-floor balcony of his concrete ranch house when a construction truck backed up to the edge of his citrus groves, paused, then dumped a great load of rubbish along the roadside. Before he pulled away, the truck’s driver set a paper bag on fire and tossed it on top of the garbage, triggering an outpouring of flames blacker than the night sky into which they ascended. Akman leapt up, put on his sandals and sprinted out along his dirt driveway toward the crackling trash pile.</p><p>The trash, by the time Akman got to it, was a hissing mass of fire. Plastic is less flammable than wood or paper, though it emits more heat as it burns. It is at least as capable as ei
