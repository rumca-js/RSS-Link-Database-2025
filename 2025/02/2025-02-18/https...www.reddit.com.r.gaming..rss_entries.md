<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Figured it would be a fun side thing to do, I work in television and honestly I love gaming. This is a free offer, if you have a game that needs a trailer I&#39;d love to give it a go!</p> <p>I already am a gamer and can just make a trailer on games I already own, but if anyone out here has a video game they want to promote I&#39;d rather help them instead of big companies with already professionally made videos.</p> <p>Feel free to message me, we can figure out if I can catch the vibe of your game, and we can build a vision together.</p> <p>What&#39;s in it for me? I guess resume building (though I don&#39;t think I ever will leave my job over trailer creation) and it&#39;s fun.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Moses_Snake"> /u/Moses_Snake </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1isomto/let_me_make_your_game_a_trailer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys, I am looking for some games recommendations to play with my wife. Everything we can play together apply, be it MMOs, CO-OP etc. </p> <p>She is starting her gaming journey, she started with CS2 because of me and my brother but we are looking to play some more &quot;explore the world&quot; type of games. </p> <p>There is only one problem - it has to be some older game or well optimized because she has a PC with 4790k and 1060 6GB for now. </p> <p>What I personally have in mind: ARK Survival Evolved or some MMO, but we would really benefit if the games would not be super fast paced so she can easily get into it - like for example in ARK she would be responsible for everything around base at the start. </p> <p>What are our options? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Aheg"> /u/Aheg </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1isnaxh/games_recommendations_to_play_with_w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I was just thinking back to some of the games I enjoyed when I was younger and how many of them had innovative features. Am I just jaded or have things changed? </p> <p>Examples I can think of are things like the physics engine in GTA IV, the way characters would dynamically react to their environment, grabbing hand rails to stop them falling. </p> <p>The Fight Night series had some seriously impressive tech when it first arrived on the scene. The deformation of the fighters faces as they were punched. </p> <p>Dead Rising was essentially a fully developed tech demo, showing off the number of enemies you could have on screen at once.</p> <p>The AI in MGS2, the way the guards carried out their searches, I remember being in awe at the destructability, the way you could interact with guards as you held them at gunpoint, how they would respond differently depending on what part of them you aimed at, it was all so different from what had gone before. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So as a kid i used to really realllllly look at games as an escape and a good fun time . From discovering minecraft cluelessly running around with no mission at all and being fascinated by it to playing Assassin&#39;s creed story and other games of the era. Replaying them has no effect . I sieze to have any emotion (in general) and i sometimes just consume content on yt and thats all i do on pc besides some small amount of work. So all i gained from gaming was a cool childhood but a very sad habit of trying to find the new discovery , the enjoyable again while i can&#39;t. Any tips? Its not always about not having free time. This might not be a game type of issue but i&#39;m open to suggestions</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JokerGhostx"> /u/JokerGhostx </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1isipqh/gaming_and_getting_old/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https

A locally owned video rental shop was less than a block down from our house. We walked in, and saw that they had a Super Nintendo rental section in addition to a bunch of VHSes. To me and my brother&#39;s joy, the SNES games were included with the $7 for 7 videos for 7 days deal that the shop was running.</p> <p>The guy running the shop asked me really nicely what sort of games I liked and if he could recommend one. I said that I really enjoyed A Link to the Past. He said, &quot;Oh, you&#39;ll like this, it&#39;s called Illusion of Gaia. Really similar.&quot; With that my fate was sealed, and I rented the game and went home. </p> <p>Illusion of Gaia is a JRPG, but without the turn based combat.

## How do Yakuza games compare with each other gameplay-wise?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I like the idea of Yakuza. It sounds really good. But I tried Yakuza 0 and I lost interest a couple hours into it. The combat just didn&#39;t click with me. I&#39;m not sure why. Other beat-em-up games (like Sleeping Dogs) I enjoy. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a &quot;polish&quot; thing or what.</p> <p>Are there other Yakuza games that I should try? I know that turn-based gameplay is introduced at some point, but I&#39;m interested in people&#39;s takes on both the turn-based and the beat-em-up games.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Calor777"> /u/Calor777 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1is8img/how_do_yakuza_games_compare_with_each_other/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1is8img/how_do_yakuza_games_compare_with_each_other/">[comments]</a></span>

## Recently started playing Morrowind being new to RPG

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I recently started playing this game &quot;Morrowind&quot; and am loving it. It&#39;s me first time playing a game in years, and I haven&#39;t played an RPG before, so I am not much informed about Spells, Potions and all other abilities. I would love your suggestions for a beginner like me, I tried persuasion in starting regardless of warning and it made me less charming, then I helped a guy with Imperial gold that Fargoth has hidden, and give this Fargoth guy a ring, so am getting chunks of it, how to play it, but I still want a few advises or suggestions about anything. Either quests, or spells, or scrolls, or fighting, or conversation, or traveling, or adventure, or how to eat, or how to sleep? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Irvif"> /u/Irvif </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1is7fyz/recently_started_playing_morrowind_being_new_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32;
