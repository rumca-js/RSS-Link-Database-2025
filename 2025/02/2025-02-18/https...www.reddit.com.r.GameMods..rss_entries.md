<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m making my first attempt at modding on my new gaming laptop. The first exe. file I tried was blocked first by Windows security, easy enough to ignore, but my Bitdefender keeps quarantining it. The mod, for reference, is years old and has tens of thousands of downloads and a high user rating.</p> <p>A couple sources assure that mods from Deadlystream and Nexus are safe, but is there any way to tell? I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have to go through the code line by line to know for sure, but how do you know if it&#39;s a relatively safe bet?</p> <p>The fact that I have two separate layers of security telling me to definitely not run the file is a concerome, and as you can tell I don&#39;t have the experience to know what warnings I can ignore.</p> <p>I appreciate your input.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fabulous-Educator830"> /u/Fabulous-Educator830 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.c
