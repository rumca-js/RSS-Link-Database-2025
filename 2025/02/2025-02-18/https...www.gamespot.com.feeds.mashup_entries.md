<p>One of the original Xbox's designers, Seamus Blackley, said that computing power isn't a helpful selling point anymore when it comes to consoles.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/xbox-creator-seamus-blackley-narrative-around-being-more-powerful-not-helpful-today/">VideoGamer</a>, Blackley said that the power-first approach worked for the original Xbox back in 2001 since graphics weren't as polished as they are now. Focusing the narrative on computing power helped the Xbox stand out among Japanese hardware companies.</p><p>"We were a Western company and we were saying 'Okay, we’re going to lose money on these to make them super powerful' and take a bet on the games being awesome," Blackley explained. Back then, the original Xbox was the only console with a built-in hard drive that could handle games like Halo: Combat Evolved, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, Fable, and Shenmue 2.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-xbox-des

<p>The PS5 is currently riding high, but everyone always wants to know what's coming next. It's been reported that the PS6 is in the works, and according to former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida, the system launching in 2028 feels "right."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/">VentureBeat</a>, Yoshida the last console cycle was about seven years long, and if that holds again, the PS6 would debut in 2027, and he said that feels "a bit too early." Stressing that he has no inside information about the PS6, Yoshida said, "If the next PlayStation comes out in 2028, that feels right to me."</p><p>He added that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-console-generation-may-start-in-2028-xbox-court-docs-say/1100-6515423/">next Xbox might be planned for 2028 as well</a>, based on a leak from Microsoft, but of course, this may not be true and plans can always change.

Goro Majima, protagonist of the story and longtime character of the Yakuza series, has two wildly different combat styles, and a plethora of skills to unlock that can further extend your options with each.</p><p>In order to unlock skills, you'll need both money and Pirate Rank points. The first is self-explanatory, and you'll be progressively filling your pockets as you progress through the main campaign and tackle side activities, particularly bounties. As per your Pirate Rank, it's tied to your overall actions in the game. The more time you spend on optional tasks to tackle challenges, the faster you'll increase it. Thankfully, you don't need that many points to unlock some of the best useful skills in the game.</p><p>I

<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a> introduces itself as a spinoff in the vein of Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name. Meaning that, instead of looking at a mammoth of a story that can take well over 30 hours at minimum, it's a far smaller slice, this time placing Goro Majima as the main character.</p><p>Despite the absurdity of its premise, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is indeed canon, the story taking place after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. Majima has amnesia, however, which leads to a fresh start for a standalone tale that is progressively intertwined with the usual swings and roundabouts of a Yakuza story.</p><p>If you're wondering how much there actually is in the game, both from a main story and side activity standpoint, this guide covers how long Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is and what you can expect to find.</p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/artic

<p dir="ltr">Welcome back to beautiful Hawaii: land of golden beaches, crystal-clear waters, and The Mad Dog of Shimano roving the seas as a swashbuckling pirate. Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is exactly as it sounds, with Goro Majima returning as a fully fledged protagonist for the first time since 2015's Yakuza 0. Unlike that game--which saw Kiryu share the spotlight--the focus this time around is squarely on everyone's favorite eyepatched goofball: the perfect leading man for one of the series' more bizarre entries. No one commits to the bit quite like Majima, which is partly why Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii avoids the risk of diminishing returns, despite being the third Like a Dragon game in the past 15 months. This high-seas adventure doesn't stack up against the series' best, but the pirate theme does just enough to differentiate a jaunty return to the Hawaii.</p><p dir="ltr">Set six months after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii opens wi

"We're all so invested in where our games are; let's just allow more people to play."</p><p>Spencer said it is important to invest in Microsoft's own platforms, in part because it makes a full 100% of revenue from first-party game sales, compared to 70% on PS5 and Switch, with the other 30% going to PlayStation and Nintendo, respectively.
