<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So what the hell guys. I was led to believe that the first book in this trilogy was a rough read but that it would be worth it for the second and third ones. </p> <p>But aside from a kindof cliche start it was just great??? </p> <p>ll kinds of interesting mystery has been setup cool and brutal ass battle scenes.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I must say I have never read such a profoundly disturbing yet captivating story as The Second Apocalypse. No book series has ever, ever come close to just how fucked-up yet human this world feels. There&#39;s plenty of gore-fests out there that try to be as edgy as possible yet feel just cringy and immature more than anything. What I enjoyed about The Second Apocalypse was the depth and nuance to everything, the way nihilist philosophies were intrinsically fleshed out by making them essential to the world. It never felt shoehorned, and the slow pace and twists and bits created a fascinating and haunting depiction of a &#39;&#39;What if hell was real and was the place everyone goes when they die?&#39;&#39; scenario.</p> <p>However, the series is a challenge. It is both dense and grim as fuck. The so called &quot;last&quot; book was published in 2017, apparently to lackluster sells, and to that add some serious accusations against the author that I fee

I recently read the first 3 books of Dungeon Crawler Carl and like seemingly everyone, loved it. </p> <p>During the first book I would tell him funny things and what was going on. I told him I thought he would like it, around half way through he said he wanted to read it and not to do anymore spoilers. Well I made it around 2 weeks before I was on the 3rd and bursting to say something. So I told him he had till the end of the week just to START the book and I wouldn&#39;t spoil otherwise I&#39;d think he wasn&#39;t going to read it (he has borrowed books before and never started them). He read the first 80 pages then left the book for a week. On Sunday I was playing a video game and he grabbed the book.</p> <p>Imagine my utter surprise when he then read for about 3 hours, stopped, we watched some show

Sounds pretty evil on face value but in context Peter III was an incompetent ruler who didn&#39;t care about Russia at all and was dragging it to ruin. Catherine when she took power, she wielded it wisely ushering in a golden age for the Russian Empire.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to put together a fantasy/sci-fi themed pub quiz (tavern quiz) for my D&amp;D group next weekend, but want to venture away from general lore and trivia. You can find those quizzes everywhere online. Instead, I want to let them relive moments in films and videogames with excitement. Think of the Battle for Helm&#39;s Deep, the Mass Effect suicide mission, and other pivotal moments that are part of our nerd DNA. Can you tell we&#39;re in our 30s/40s?</p> <p>Anyway, I know there are many more great moments than I can remember (or even know of), so I&#39;d love to hear what some of your favourite fantasy/sci-fi moments are in movies or video games, and given that it&#39;s for a quiz, my only preference is that it&#39;s not from something too niche (I draw the line at novelizations and spin-offs). I would also love questions with answers that are &quot;technically correct&quot; but could still spark debate (for instance, Saruman&#39;s fate)

Now on to a few of my thoughts:</p> <p><span class="md-spoiler-text">I know everyone says the main character is a Gary Stu, but I disagree: on account I don’t know how else you write a character like this. I would say my gripe is that he is never caught by anyone doing anything. Like these people are all will-imbued (at Suus), and if Lanistia can sense people with will so can a Diidius but I digress.</span></p> <p><span class="md-spoiler-text">The whole Relucia plot line honestly loses a lot of interest from me for two reasons: them working with the military just seems unnecessary, and this new dude who can teleport. I so far do not care for the new dude and wish he had been introduced at the beginning of the next book. He just seems out of place here.</span></p> <p><span class="md-spoiler-text">Calli

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Long explanation of what I want incoming:</p> <p>I have been a fan of the Stormlight Archive for years, and to put it succinctly I love it for 3 reasons: worldbuilding (a large, fantastical world that feels magical), plotting (political plots and world ending threats) and mental health rep. </p> <p>Stormlight has, with the latest book, gone far downhill from where it used to be. Do I still love it? Yes. Is book 5 a total mess? Also yes. I haven&#39;t finished it yet though, so ig we will see. </p> <p>Anyway, I also love literary fiction. Books focused on prose and structure with a strong emphasis on character and often social commentary. Stormlight is far from this, but it offers something I haven&#39;t found in other popular fantasy stories: strong themes around mental health. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking for an epic fantasy on the scale of Stormlight that takes a more literary approach to its writing and focuses on mental health and sociology.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It had its moments, but overall I was left feeling like the writing was very, very simplistic (YA fantasy at best) and the characters were almost comically cliche. I also simply do not understand investing so much time in the first half of the book in Momoru’s potential only to kill him off. Didn’t hit home for me, just felt like a waste of time to start to get to know him. Misaki and Takeru were utterly cliche. While I enjoyed reading their redemption “duel” it was all perfectly predictable. Also, the Empire apparently doesn’t let people honor and bury their dead if they die in a natural disaster? The justification for the mass grave made absolutely no sense. Changing increments of time and distance to another language within the text was so corny, added nothing, and left me confused as to what times and distances people were talking about. Sorry, wanted to love it, truly. But it felt like a teenager wrote it and no one edited it. </p> </div><!-- SC
