The mod, for reference, is years old and has tens of thousands of downloads and a high user rating.</p> <p>A couple sources assure that mods from Deadlystream and Nexus are safe, but is there any way to tell? I&#39;m sure you&#39;d have to go through the code line by line to know for sure, but how do you know if it&#39;s a relatively safe bet?</p> <p>The fact that I have two separate layers of security telling me to definitely not run the file is a concerome, and as you can tell I don&#39;t have the experience to know what warnings I can ignore.</p> <p>I appreciate your input.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Fabulous-Educator830\"> /u/Fabulous-Educator830 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.c",
