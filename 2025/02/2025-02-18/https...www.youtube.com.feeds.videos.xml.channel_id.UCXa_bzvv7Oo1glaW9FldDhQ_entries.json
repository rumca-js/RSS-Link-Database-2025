        "description": "Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii benefits from great execution of an absurd premise that the game never questions, and just goes with; it benefits from being a good enough Like A Dragon game, and a good enough pirate game, even though it never quite gets aigret at either as you\u2019d hope for. \n\nAnd it even benefits from foregoing the serious crime drama and high stakes stories that previous RGG Studios games have gone for, opting for, instead, a rip-roaring swashbuckling outing that barely attempts to justify or contextualize the things it says or does, and instead chooses to focus on the moment-to-moment fun of the adventure. \n\nIt\u2019s an extremely unexpected outing for the series, but the developers have largely stuck the landing, and delivered a fun pirate adventure that I am sure will remain a fan favourite for many years to come.",

        "description": "Resident Evil Zero is one of several Resident Evil projects supposedly in the works right now, if reports are to be believed, and if that is indeed the case, the developer needs to make sure that on its second go around at taking the spotlight, the game does much better than its original attempt. \n\nThe original RE Zero had plenty of interesting ideas that it failed to implement in satisfactory fashion, but the hope is that with its remake, the game will finally be able to flourish. \n\nReports have claimed that the project is being led by the external teams that handled the RE3 remake, which might be cause for concern for some, though our hope is that the RE Zero remake will be able to reach the same heights as Resident Evil 2 remake in spite of its source material being much less highly acclaimed.",

        "description": "Lost Records: Bloom and Rage is, in some ways, DON'T NOD coming full circle. The developer rose to fame with the success of Life is Strange, and though it's branched out into other genres, narrative adventure truly runs through its blood. Tape 1: Bloom features those same story-telling chops, albeit with intriguing evolutions.\n\nPlaying out between 1995 and 2022, the story is told from Swann's perspective as she meets and becomes friends with Autumn, Nora, and Kat over the Summer. Something happens, though, and they eventually split up. About 27 years later, a mysterious package arrives, prompting Autumn to reconnect with Swann.\n\nDespite occasional rough dialogue and technical issues, Lost Records: Bloom and Rage offers a compelling mystery with gorgeous art direction and hard-hitting themes. While Tape 2 is where things will come to a head, Tape 1 is still a good reason to dive in.",
