It provides with a text format of endpoints as well as a full packet capture per process. About 5 months ago i published the initial release to <a href=\"/r/hacking\">r/hacking</a> --&gt; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ftvbjz/whoyoucalling_a_tool_to_get_a_pcap_per_process/\">link</a>. Since then, i&#39;ve implemented: </p> <ul> <li>functionality of monitoring every TCPIP and DNS activity of every process running on the system at the same time</li> <li>DNS responses to processes (resolved IP adresses of domains) are generated as DFL filters (Wireshark filters). In other words, if you have a pcap file with lots of different traffic, and you only want to see traffic going to suswebsite[.]io, you can simply copy the generated filter into wireshark.</li> <li>A time",
