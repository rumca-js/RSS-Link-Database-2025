<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been playing around with various self hosted music servers. Most of my music is classical, tagged with musicbrainz. This generally causes two problems for music servers (and players): first, musicbrainz will often put multiple artists in the artist or album artist field (separated by commas and semi-colons). And second, the composer is usually the track artist (and in the composer field) but often neither are supported by searching.</p> <p>Ultimately, I&#39;d like my music sortable and searchable by composer, conductor, performing ensemble / artist, etc. It would also be nice if all of the album / track / artist information was shown in a way similar to musicbrainz. I&#39;ve got about 10k audio files, so it needs to be able to handle that.</p> <p>Does anyone have a good setup that works? I&#39;m totally open to redoing how my music is tagged, if that helps. My latest attempt was navidrome + symfonium, but that has a lot of the problems menti

Yes, Glance recently added label detection, making things more dynamic, but my issue is that I run multiple servers and just spread the workload across them like a caveman. And honestly? I can’t be bothered to do it another way—it just works. I know, I know… I&#39;m lazy.</p> <p>So, I’m building my own dashboard that <strong>periodically checks my servers, grabs the running containers, and displays everything in a simple (ugly) webpage</strong>. This makes it easier to:</p> <ul> <li>See what’s running on each server.</li> <li>Figure out where to deploy

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi folks, I am setting up docker swarm on a couple of VM&#39;s in my Proxmox cluster. I have 3 manager nodes and 3 worker nodes all with an NFS share mounted to the same path via fstab. I am trying to setup some stacks and it seems like Portainer is just ignoring my volume specifications and putting the volumes in the local /var/lib/docker/volumes folder on the node the container is running on which obviously breaks if that container moves. I am trying to deploy ryiot.io and the stack file is below. The path of the nfs share on all the nodes is /swarm.</p> <p>Before a ton of people jump in the comments to tell me to use Kuberenetes because it&#39;s so much better, save the keystrokes. I know. I am also learning to use that but in my homelab environment docker swarm is also a good thing to have and know how to use. Kubernetes has a higher learning curve and I don&#39;t know enough about it yet to have it run my production apps.</p> <p>Thanks!</p> <pre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;m setting up a self-hosted music streaming server using Docker containers for Sonarr, qBittorrent, Navidrome and Nextcloud. The first three services are working fine, thanks to various guides and posts I&#39;ve found. However, I’m struggling with integrating <strong>Nextcloud</strong> into the mix.</p> <h1>What I’ve Tried So Far:</h1> <p>I mounted Nextcloud at <code>/mnt/nextcloud</code> and then configured Sonarr, qBittorrent, and Navidrome to use <code>/mnt/nextcloud/username/files/Torrents/Music</code>.</p> <p>However, I ran into permission problems, and I also realized that Nextcloud doesn’t properly recognize files written directly to disk.</p> <p>I’m unsure how to make this work properly. My goal is to have a seamless integration where downloaded music is accessible through both Navidrome and Nextcloud.</p> <p>Has anyone successfully done something similar or have any suggestions on how to achieve this? Any advice would be greatly
