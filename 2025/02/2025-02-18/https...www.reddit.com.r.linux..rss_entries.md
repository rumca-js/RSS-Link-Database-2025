To me, it seems like it&#39;s a huge waste of storage. Just right now, I tried to install Telegram. The Flatpak version was over 700MB to download (just for a messaging app !), while the RPM Fusion version (I&#39;m on Fedora non atomic) was 150MB only (I am including all the dependencies in both cases).</p> <p>Seeing this huge difference, I wonder why I should ever use flatpak, because if any program I want to install will re-download and re-install the dependencies on my disk that could have been already installed on my computer (e.g. Telegram flatpak was pulling... 380MB of &quot;platform locale&quot; ?)</p> <p>Also, do the flatpaks reuse dependencies with each other ? Or are they just encapsulated ?</p> <p>(Any post stating that storage is cheap and thus I shouldn&#39;t care about storage
