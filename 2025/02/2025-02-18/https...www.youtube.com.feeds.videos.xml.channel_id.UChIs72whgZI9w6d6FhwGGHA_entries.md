In this video, we talk about the fake prices on NVIDIA's RTX 50 series, including the RTX 5090, 5080, and apparently, the inbound 5070 Ti. We'll see about that one soon. The video covers not only the scalper situation, but the first-party sellers forcing attachment of unwanted, old inventory with NVIDIA's GPUs.
