<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Have a friend who claims 2 android phones (one samsung and one moto 5g), computer (pc) and 2 Tvs (one fire tv and the other a cheapo 24 inch model) have been hacked. Claims that on the phones they can &quot;hear everything&quot; even when the phone is not being used (but still on). That the settings on the phone keep getting changed back when the owner resets them. Did a full factory reset on the Moto and claims its still being hacked. Also believes that the hackers are listening and photographing through the TVs. Curiously, when spam mails come in, thinks this is &quot;secret code&quot; to do things...like sign financial papers (got an email trying to sell a PDF program with abiliity to sign docs online&quot;. This person is totally convinced that another person can control the phones from their phone (keeps babblinig about regenrative AI). I dont really know how to help, any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://
