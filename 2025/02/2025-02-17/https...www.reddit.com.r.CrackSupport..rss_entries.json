I&#39;m usually quite adequate in getting these projects going but this one has stumped me. Currently using the dodi repack. I get it going to install but about 4% to 6% it pops up the unarc error. -1, unarc error -11and unarc -12 error. I&#39;ve have tried multiple fixes out there. Including one supplied by both fitgirl and dodi Except one that I cannot find or apply. That one being the 2gb limit. Just no tab or checkbook to enable it. Hopefully.
