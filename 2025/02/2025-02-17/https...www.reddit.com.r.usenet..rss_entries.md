<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anybody use this indexer anymore? I got an invite. Initially quite impressed by the layout but then looked at features being locked behind donations. </p> <p>The donations themselves are very expensive. There is a forum but this is locked behind donations. So I contribute the bare minimum $3 to see if the forums are active. </p> <p>Rather disappointing, the site forums are pretty dead. There was some recent posts but these were December 2024 and basically a guy scamming for invite trading to the most desirable trackers. The guy that runs it is known as King Cat and was last online in June 2024.</p> <p>So my question is. Does anybody actually use this indexer? How is it still online after all this time?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/balboain"> /u/balboain </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1irc385/nzbcat/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.re
