I used the Pico originally before realising the chip itself has more gpio that the pico doesn&#39;t use! So now you can get 27 touch pins, a chain of neopixel leds to use as indicator lights PLUS 2 spare gpio that I&#39;m going to add a stemma connector for i2c connections, daisyc",

I am planning on using 8 12V solenoid valves. From what I understand, the negative side of the power supply would be run in parallel to each relay, then a wire would go from the relay to the valve, then the positive side of the valve would all be run in parallel back to the power supply. Please see below for a (poorly drawn) wire diagram which hopefully is clear. </p> <p>Also, when choosing a po",
