## New to RSS, do webcomics not post the comic to RSS or am I missing something?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Thanks for your help! Totally new to RSS but was trying to add penny arcade and/or Dumbing Of Age, but in both feeds I don&#39;t actually see the comic, just the name of the comic?</p> <p>I tried in both TinyTinyRSS and in FreshRSS but don&#39;t actually see either comic.</p> <p>Is there something I&#39;m missing? Some setting to download images? Or are the images not in the RSS at all? </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Novel-Put2945"> /u/Novel-Put2945 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iru656/new_to_rss_do_webcomics_not_post_the_comic_to_rss/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rss/comments/1iru656/new_to_rss_do_webcomics_not_post_the_comic_to_rss/">[comments]</a></span>

## I made an extension to turn your browser into an RSS reader with zero config.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone!</p> <p>When browsing the web, I often come across amazing independent blogs that I’d love to subscribe. However, I didn’t want to go through the hassle of installing a dedicated RSS reader or managing RSS feeds. I thought, wouldn’t it be great if all of this could be done directly in the browser? So, I built a browser extension to make it happen.</p> <p>If you&#39;ve ever bookmarked articles from a blog, you&#39;ll likely want to stay updated with its new posts. FeedPal works out of the box with zero configuration, effortlessly turning bookmarks into subscriptions—ensuring you never miss valuable content that matters to you.</p> <p>Since high-quality content often updates less frequently, FeedPal intelligently adjusts notifications based on update frequency, minimizing distractions and only alerting you when it truly matters.</p> <p>Check it out: <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/feedpal-auto-subscribe-to/dmflnkbellbkdbg
