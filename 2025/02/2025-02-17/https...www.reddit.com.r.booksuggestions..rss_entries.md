I love reading physical copies or e-books but I haven’t been able to find the time to read as much as I want to. Sometimes i really get into a book and then i have to feed my baby or do house chores and all I can think about is continuing the book i just put down! I feel like audiobooks would be a good solution to my problem but i don’t have the means financially to buy all the books i want to read, so any suggestions on how to get my hands on free/cheap audiobooks would be very much appreciated!

I just want a good book with an interesting plot that is explicit and explores romantic relationships. </p> <p>I just wanna try something new from my usual reads that are more “”””intellectual”””” (and I use the word very loosely) in nature.

Not necessarily a second chance but I love those types of books as well. Could be time travel or transmigration, I’m looking for anything lol. The main character can be male or female as long as it has a compelling plot. Same with the genre, I’m not a big fan of romance but if it’s a small part of the story that’s fine too. I appreciate all suggestions.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Impossible-Fan4374"> /u/Impossible-Fan4374 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1irdq3f/reborn_characters/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1irdq3f/reborn_characters/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m looking for recommendations for my tiny book club. My bf(23) and I(23) decided to start reading the same books at the same time so we can discuss and learn together. I’m not a reader by any means, but he is. His favorite author is Cormac McCarthy and I can’t say I really have one. I’m open to anything; however I’m definitely not a McCarthy level reader yet lol. I am interested in reading more of the classics, but don’t know where to start. I’m also really interested in readers all time favorite books/ recommendations, so I would love to hear your suggestions! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/megaboo1206"> /u/megaboo1206 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ir9mop/books_for_my_partner_and_i/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ir9mop/books_for_my_partner_and_i/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I’m desperately looking for chapter books/novels for my young child.</p> <p>The problem is that their reading level is advanced (5th grade) while they are in 1st grade. Additionally, my child is sensitive and doesn’t like stories with scary elements or violence.</p> <p>The situation makes it difficult to find reading material because the age appropriate books are too simplistic while the longer well written books are a little too scary. This child refuses to go near the second Library of Ever book because the forces of darkness are too scary. They also put Wild Robot down because of the robot accidentally kills the egg’s family.</p> <p>I’ve also avoided some of my childhood favorites like Hatchet, Charlotte’s Web, and Where the Red Fern Grows because characters die.</p> <p>Examples of books that have worked out are: Ruth Chew’s old witch books, Lotus Island Series, Area 51 Files, Katie Kazoo, Sophie Mouse, Zoe and Sassafras, Kiki’s Delivery Servi

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I&#39;m excited to be in this group. I&#39;ve been an average reader for as long as I can remember. I came across an interesting title recently called The Silent Symphony: Conversational Jujitsu and the (Sort of) Art of Tuning Out, by Akshayjit (thank God I don&#39;t have to say their name, because I wouldn&#39;t butcher it! Haha). I was wondering if anybody else has read the book and had an opinion/thoughts on it as well?
