<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for over a year and he loves warhammer. I know he has Age of Sigmar as one of his quests (?). I‚Äôve been trying to google what warhammer is and information around it for a while and none of it clicks really. </p> <p>I was hoping someone could explain warhammer to me and how I can show interest/ any good (affordable as possible) gifts that I could get him. </p> <p>For context, I‚Äôm not a game player really so I won‚Äôt get any technical terms, I have played DnD before though. </p> <p>Thank you in advance everyone :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Pick9338"> /u/Ok_Pick9338 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1ira1pk/explanation_for_a_confused_girlfriend_please/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1ira1pk/explanation_for_a_confused_girlfriend_please/">[comments]</a></span>
