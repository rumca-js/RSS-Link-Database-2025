About Emma Gregory Emma is a highly experienced, 5-star audiobook narrator and is well known for her performances within the Warhammer audiobooks and audio dramas by Games Workshop. Emma has gathered a large fan base for her work across Warhammer 40k, and especially for her role as Minthara in the multi-award-winning game, Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 for which she was put forward for BAFTA consideration.
