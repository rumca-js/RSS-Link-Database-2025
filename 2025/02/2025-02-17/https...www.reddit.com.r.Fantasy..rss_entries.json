However, I&#39;ve always found it a bit disappointing that in all the best-known and most highly regarded animal fantasies, the most interesting and substantial characters have been male. I put this down to the old tradition of &quot;male as default&quot;: characters are only female when the plot demands it, and characters whose gender is irrelevant to the plot or to the roles they play &quot;default&quot; to male. More recently written animal fantasies -- most notably the Redwall series, but also books like Clement-Davies&#39; The Sight -- have mounted challenges to the &quot;male as default&quot; idea, but even now, as far as I&#39;ve been able to observe, when female characters are included they tend to be the &q",

But I rewatched the LOTR trilogy recently and now it&#39;s really gotten me into the mood for a long, dense and truly epic series. I&#39;m talking 3 or more books, doorstopper tomes, lots of characters and world building and magic, the whole shebang.</p> <p>I feel like I&#39;ve already read, at least partially, all the big ones. My feelings on the ones I&#39;ve gone through already:</p> <p><strong>Lord of the Rings:</strong> not much else to be said about LOTR. It&#39;s an all-time GOAT classic for a reason. 10/10</p> <p><strong>Realm of the Elderlings:</strong> Maybe not epic in terms of stakes but definitely in emotional scope. May bey favourite long-running fantasy series. No one does character depth and emotional turmoil like Robin Hobb. This series destroyed me. 10/10</p> <p><strong>Wheel of Time:</strong> DNF&#39;d after book 7 or 8 I think.",

I&#39;m down for any fantasy or sci-fi recs, but I trend a lot more towards the fantasy novels. I don&#39;t like Urban Fantasy or whatever. Unless it&#39;s sci-fi, don&#39;t want any guns or anything. I like swords and animal companions and shit. I can do grim dark, but sometimes it gets a bit much. </p> <p>Song of Ice and Fire is my all time favorite. Kinda basic, I guess, but I try and search out books that give me that kinda vibe. Houses, banners, that whole medieval vibe, big swords, cool helms, and shit. </p> <p>Next tier probably Realm of the Elderlings. All the Riyria, World of Elan books, I just read through those, but loved that it was a little lighter and some of the books were shorter to get through.

I looked through the sub for a while but haven\u2019t found a post describing what I\u2019m looking for, so maybe this can help me (and others in the same situation in the future)</p> <p>Basically, I\u2019m looking for a Hurt/Comfort book/series that isn\u2019t too heavy on the Hurt, but focused on the comfort. The comforting character (in my mind) would be a bit older than the MC, wiser, and stronger. I don\u2019t want it to be a romance thing necessarily, ideally a platonic/mentor relationship. The comforting character should also not be too serious/dark/gruff, but rather open, warm, kind, and even whimsical.
