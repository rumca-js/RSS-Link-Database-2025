I am mainly looking for first hand experience with devices coming well equipped with a firewall and at least two LAN ports for those of us who only use wifi when left with no other option. I am currently running a GL-MT1300 and while it has most of the features I require, I find the performance lack luster as well as having a host of intermittent bugs and various &quot;issues&quot;. It&#39;s the GL-iNet Beryl (Non-AX model) just fyi. I appreciate any input you may offer. Bonus if it can block Youtube Ads (Adblock home isn&#39;t cutting it for me) and I can&#39;t get the NordLynx protocol setup regardless of how many guides I follow or videos I watch. I have both my private and public Keys but can&#39;t get the Wireguard Configuration file to function correctly. I even bought a month of service with one of the two VPNs ",
