I like the air quality monitor in our finished basement, good for keeping tabs on the VOC and CO2 levels in our downstairs living room. There\u2019s also a Google Nest Hub in our kitchen that displays family photos, while an Amazon Echo Dot in my daughter\u2019s bedroom occasionally blurts out the weather.\u00a0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while those devices certainly come in handy, they\u2019re also expendable.
