Sam Altman's  goal is to hoard AI technology for himself he will not stop until OpenAI is an absolute monopoly. 

OpenAI doesn’t yet have that monopoly. It’s biggest enemy is not Google but open source AI. Today, thanks to Meta’s Llama models, DeepSeek, Mistral and many other projects, there is plenty of open source AI out there that’s just capable. Sam Altman wants to stop it and he will fear monger about them. He is already doing it to DeepSeek. But don’t let him make that decision for you. Use open source AI. If you can run it locally on your device, do it. If you can’t, running it in the cloud is still more beneficial in the long run, even though it’s not private.
