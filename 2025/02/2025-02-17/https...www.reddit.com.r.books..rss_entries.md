## The popularity of a book isn't in how many sales it's had or how long it runs

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a fan of a house name author who has various book series. One series has gone on for over 20 years and has over 80 books. The publisher also have a few other series under the house name.</p> <p>I often see fans of the most popular series say that the others are &quot;failures&quot; and &quot;sold poorly&quot;, or that they &quot;have no fans&quot;. I get frustrated when I see that.</p> <p>For one, we can&#39;t <em>find</em> the sales anywhere. People just assume they sold poorly because they only ran 1 or 2 arcs (mainly consisting of 7 to 8 books in total), compared to the 5+ that the main franchise has.</p> <p>I&#39;d rather they end on a high than go on for years in a &quot;zombie&quot; state. What&#39;s so bad about a series ending after the writer or a publisher decides enough is enough? How is that a mark of shame?</p> <p>When it comes to books, it can be hard to tell what&#39;s popular and what isn&#39;t, especially with books that are 

## Hindu mythology seems dramatically underrepresented in popular fiction (in the US at least)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished reading Roger Zelazny&#39;s <em>Lord of Light</em> and found myself awestruck at how I&#39;ve been interested in mythology-based fiction for nearly two full decades now and haven&#39;t once accidentally fallen upon a piece inspired by Hinduism until now. I&#39;ve come across ancient Greek/Roman, Norse, Sumerian, Egyptian, Aztec, Mayan, and probably plenty more that I&#39;m failing to rattle off the top of my head, but Hindu was never one that came up. Granted, I also didn&#39;t go out of my way to look for it, but that&#39;s kind of the point. I didn&#39;t really go out of my way to look for any of the others either, they just kind of fell into my lap for one reason or another.</p> <p><em>Lord of Light</em> isn&#39;t explicitly an accurate representation of Hinduism (or Buddhism as is also included), but even the basic inspiration it draws from to craft its story is incredibly interesting as somebody with a general fascination with my

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In <em>Remains of the Day</em> (Kazuo Ishiguro), Congressman Lewis is represented as being antagonistic towards Germany (sounding the alarm on several occasions). As a nation, the US leaned toward neutral. Did Ishiguro derive inspiration for this character from any historical figures?</p> <p>I say this because, while some such as Roosevelt clearly knew the risks involved, most of Congress was opposed, seeing this as a European problem. Why was Lewis specifically chosen to go? Isn&#39;t it much more likely that the US would have sent someone who was pro-neutrality?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cobaltjacket"> /u/cobaltjacket </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1irldf8/remains_of_the_day_congressman_lewis/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1irldf8/remains_of_the_day_congressman_lewis/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I thoroughly enjoyed the book despite being someone who typically does not love unreliable narrators. The differing timelines (Theo in present day at the Grove trying to “treat” Alicia vs. past Theo finding out that Kathy was cheating on him) was interesting and definitely threw me for a loop. I also thought Alicia’s character was quite flawed and complex, and I felt a lot of sympathy for her. </p> <p>On the other hand, I totally understand that there were some plot holes and unfinished plot points (Max inheriting Gabriel’s assets/ Jean-Felix paying a visit to Alicia the night of the incident). But is that where most of the gripes are coming from? The fact that this book was laden with red herrings that serve no other purpose than to confound or mislead the reader? </p> <p>I’ve seen countless Reddit posts completely eviscerating the book and the author’s writing but i thought the writing was well done. In my opinion, it was vastly better than a Freid

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><strong>There&#39;s much more to Jack London than Call of the Wild and White Fang</strong></p> <p>Prior to coming across some of his short stories, American writer Jack London (1876-1916) was only familiar to me only as the author of the famous novels &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; and &quot;White Fang&quot;. What I didn&#39;t realize is that in literary circles he&#39;s even more well-regarded for his genius as a writer of short stories, of which he wrote almost 200. Like his popular novels, many of these are set in harsh landscapes of Alaska and the Yukon during the gold rush era, but some reflect other settings, even Hawaii. More than one of his stories reflects his interest in boxing, and several fall even into the science fiction genre.</p> <p>I&#39;ve just finished read ing about 20 of what are regarded as his best stories, and these are my personal favourites:</p> <p><strong>&quot;To Build a Fire&quot;</strong> (5 stars).

I wasn’t prepared for it. As I sit here in tears feeling so deeply - I’m just shell shocked really. </p> <p>A few chapters in, I was telling my husband that I wasn’t sure what the fuss was about. I started reading it for a brand new book club that I decided to join. And I was trying to figure out how I would be able to discuss a book that seemed to be all hype without substance. </p> <p>I knew who was behind the plot from the get go. It didn’t seem like a well thought out twist. Almost lazy. </p> <p>But, in all honestly, I don’t think that was even the point. None of the brutality and destruction and violence really even mattered. The division lines were really just distractions from the heart of everything. </p> <p>I don’t really even know how to end this post. Except to say to love one another and

I’m also in the middle of his biography, which is adding a ton of richness to all of his novels since they are so closely linked to his personal experiences. </p> <p>My personal favorite so far is How long the Train’s Been Gone with Giovanni’s Room as a verrrry close 2nd. </p> <p>His overall style seems very unique. I really enjoy his lack of chapter breaks in his novels and how he jumps into flashbacks abruptly but somehow so seamlessly. The subject matter in all his novels are also so closely related and pretty obviously lived experiences of his or loved ones. As a white man living in 2025, the depth of experiences that he shares on such an emotional level is just so compelling and reall
