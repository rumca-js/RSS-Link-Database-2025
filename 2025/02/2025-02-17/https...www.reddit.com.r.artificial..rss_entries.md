It’s quite popular on YouTube and looks genuinely fun, but after checking out their website, I noticed a few red flags.</p> <p>For one, AI interaction is handled server-side, and there’s no option to run it on a local LLM. They claim in their FAQ that running it locally is &quot;impossible,&quot; which seems off to me, given the current capabilities of modern PCs. The game also uses a token system, with the initial 10,000 tokens provided with the game, which is said to allot approximately 40-50 hours of playtime. Additional tokens aren&#39;t currently available for purchase, though their FAQ suggests they plan to offer them
