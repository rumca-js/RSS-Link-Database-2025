<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve tinkered for a while with RISC-V in a QEMU virtual machine, mostly working on software projects built in C and RISC-V assembly. First it was for a course on computer system organization/architecture, then a subsequent course on operating systems, and then for fun. Now I want to build a RISC-V mini-PC to tinker with and to support RISC-V development with what money I can as a university student. I know that nothing comes close to even the perf of a Raspberry Pi 5 quite yet as far as consumer grade hardware, but I would like something as close as possible. I am aware that this question has been asked several times before, and I’ve read through the past threads. But I have to ask for a 2025 update because it seems like the answer has changed pretty drastically over only a couple of years, and the most recent thread I could find on this was unanimous on the Milk-V Jupiter being the best available but couldn’t account for the release of the Milk-V Me
