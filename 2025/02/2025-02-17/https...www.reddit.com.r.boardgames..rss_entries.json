It has resource conversion, hand management, drafting and tableau building. It has a bit of &#39;take that&#39;, but honestly the biggest way to screw your opponents is through hate drafting, being the &#39;take that&#39; part mostly useful to clear some space on your own board.

Years ago, I was gifted a mysterious board game, one that promised intrigue and secrets untold. And yet\u2026 fate was cruel. I never played it. I never even opened it. Now, it is lost to the sands of time (or possibly a basement purge), and I am haunted by its memory.</p> <p>I have scoured the land\u2014Google, ChatGPT, my own hazy recollections\u2014but no answer has surfaced. If I do not uncover its name soon, I fear I shall descend into a madness from which there is no return. Please, wise and seasoned board game sages, help me reclaim this lost relic!</p> <p>The Clues: \u2022 The box was almost entirely black\u2014a sleek, dark design that whispered mystery. (Super sleek and minimalist)</p> <pre><code>\u2022 It had a mystery/escape room vibe, possibly involving puzzles or deduction. \u2022 The theme felt 19th-century English\u2014perhaps",
