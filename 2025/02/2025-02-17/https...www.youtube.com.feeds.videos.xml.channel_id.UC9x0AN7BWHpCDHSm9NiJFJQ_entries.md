I just bought 5 Mac Studios to replace my video editing PCs‚Ä¶ but before I hand them over to my editors, I had to play with them first. So, I did something crazy‚Äì I clustered them together to build a super powerful AI cluster. My goal? Run Llama 3.1 405B, one of the biggest AI models out there. Normally, you‚Äôd need an AI server that costs more than my HOUSE to run something like this. In this video, I‚Äôll show you exactly how I clustered my Mac Studios together using Exo Labs.
