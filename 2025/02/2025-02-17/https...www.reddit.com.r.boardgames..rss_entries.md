<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I usually play with my wife. She is a good sport and we enjoy lots of games. Jaipur, cascadia, lost cities, arboretum, Azul, codename, etc... we tend to gravitate towards lighter/medium games.

Are there any games that can allow us to do both? I have to reel myself in and not spite draft in Azul, or avoid looking at her stuff while playing splendor, or avoid taking over her cities in Carcassonne.

It has resource conversion, hand management, drafting and tableau building. It has a bit of &#39;take that&#39;, but honestly the biggest way to screw your opponents is through hate drafting, being the &#39;take that&#39; part mostly useful to clear some space on your own board. Really recommend for people who like games like games like <strong>Res Arcana</strong>, <strong>Race for the Galaxy</strong>, <strong>Furnace</strong> or even <strong>Magic The Gathering</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Forest Shuffle</strong> on the other hand is a hand management game in the same vein as games like <st

I’d love to get some recommendations on which games to stock!</p> <p>Should I focus on popular classics like Catan and Ticket to Ride, or go for more niche strategy games? Are there any hidden gems that don’t get enough attention?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been playing through the achievements in Cascadia in order and I&#39;ve found them pretty fun so far.</p> <p>I made it through the first six in one sitting -- I had to play each scenario 5 (fully score foxes 3x + get 85 points) and scenario 6 (play four of each wildlife + get 85 points) twice before I conquered them, but still managed to get through.</p> <p>Now... Scenario 7 feels impossible to the point that it&#39;s not really fun. It requires you to play 20 hawks and get 90 points, but there are only 20 turns in the whole game, so if you don&#39;t have a hawk wildlife token available to play, or a place to play it, or a nature token, you automatically lose. I gave myself an advantage and used the starter tile with the hawk keystone but used it and lost on turn three.</p> <p>I&#39;m not sure how to win this unless you just have perfect luck. The game of course requires a bit of luck in every playthrough, but it also relies on strategy (the

So, we want to check other games before we burn it out a we have done with other games in the past (if that&#39;s energy possible with Ark Nova). I&#39;ve been doing my research and in between these: - Great Western Trail 2nd Edition - Castles of Burgundy - Beer &amp; Bread - Lost Ruins of Arnak - Agricola All Creatures Big and Small The Big Box (w has the full game but had to sell it when we had to move to an apartment, that&#39;s the reason why only one... for now). I&#39;m looking for a game that plays great for two players and don&#39;t care about higher player count, I have a tendency for medium heavy to heavy games. We didn&#39;t enjoy wingspan or cascading. We have enjoyed 7 wonders duel, rivals for Catan, carcassone, fields of arle, dominion, civilization (at least me). Stunting that pays in one t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Splendor: Duel is terrific. It&#39;s tense, cut throat, easy to follow, with three different scoring conditions. Meeting the Royals requirements are easy to follow and any path to victory can take advantage of them. Certain cards have powers which helps balance and give value to them. I feel all of the values and point bonuses on cards are clear and make sense. I never scratch my head at the value tradeoffs.</p> <p>I see people playing Splendor fairly often, but I had never tried it. I decided to sit down and try it a few times and while it&#39;s familiar, it&#39;s not the same. I also was doing terrible following my Splendor: Duel strategies. The game is a lot more basic, so after a few playthroughs and studying I adjusted my strategy. But still - no success. I&#39;m not being blown out or anything, but I&#39;m not finding myself doing well. I&#39;ve learned to reserve any middle row 3 pointers and to focus on larger value cards instead of grabbing
