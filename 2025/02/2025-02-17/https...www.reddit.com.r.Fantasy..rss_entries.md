## Female characters in animal fantasy

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Animal fantasies were my introduction to the genre as a whole -- works like Grahame&#39;s The Wind and the Willows, Kipling&#39;s The Jungle Books, and (a bit later) Adams&#39; Watership Down -- and I have never outgrown my love for them. However, I&#39;ve always found it a bit disappointing that in all the best-known and most highly regarded animal fantasies, the most interesting and substantial characters have been male. I put this down to the old tradition of &quot;male as default&quot;: characters are only female when the plot demands it, and characters whose gender is irrelevant to the plot or to the roles they play &quot;default&quot; to male. More recently written animal fantasies -- most notably the Redwall series, but also books like Clement-Davies&#39; The Sight -- have mounted challenges to the &quot;male as default&quot; idea, but even now, as far as I&#39;ve been able to observe, when female characters are included they tend to be the &q

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really enjoyed this book.</p> <p>The main character being on the spectrum was very interesting. I feel like the author did a great job highlighting both the positive and negative aspects of being on the spectrum, and the way he took so long to understand he wasn&#39;t &#39;defective&#39; was very realistic.</p> <p>The magic system was very unique and cool. Though it wasn&#39;t explained particularly thoroughly, and it&#39;s a bit difficult to understand the scope/scale of what magic is possible. But it was still very fun to see as Aram gradually built his own understanding.</p> <p>Markus was great, I loved him. The protective way he had for Aram, and the gentle ways he helped him cope with interactions was great. The other characters didn&#39;t get as much characterization. They were kinda one-note. And the romance was kinda tacked-on and barely there. It seemed like the jump from having a crush to love was a little fast for a race of people that c

Which means reading more proper high literature and classics on the one hand, and getting over my distaste and giving some genre romance and YA an honest try on the other. This was checking 1/2 boxes for the latter – it showed up on a bunch of recommendation lists I’ve absentmindedly scrolled through here and there as (to paraphrase) YA for people who hate YA, which seemed promising. Having read it, I absolutely see what they meant, and if I read this when I was young enough to be part of the demographic I would have absolutely adored it. But the marks of the genre are <em>very</em> obvious on it, and having given it a try the appeal of reading this stuff as an adult is still a bit beyond me.</p> <p>The book stars Nita, a 17-year-old girl with a somewhat unusual upbringing – her moth

But I rewatched the LOTR trilogy recently and now it&#39;s really gotten me into the mood for a long, dense and truly epic series. I&#39;m talking 3 or more books, doorstopper tomes, lots of characters and world building and magic, the whole shebang.</p> <p>I feel like I&#39;ve already read, at least partially, all the big ones. My feelings on the ones I&#39;ve gone through already:</p> <p><strong>Lord of the Rings:</strong> not much else to be said about LOTR. It&#39;s an all-time GOAT classic for a reason. 10/10</p> <p><strong>Realm of the Elderlings:</strong> Maybe not epic in terms of stakes but definitely in emotional scope. May bey favourite long-running fantasy series. No one does character depth and emotional turmoil like Robin Hobb. This series destroyed me. 10/10</p> <p><strong>Wheel of Time:</strong> DNF&#39;d after book 7 or 8 I think.

I got a physical edition of the book for christmas, but away from home I started reading a digital version from the library. I only got through part of the prologue with the digital edition. When I returned home I started the story over with the physical edition and noticed differences in the text.</p> <p>According to both Libby and Bloomsbury the digital edition was released July 6, 2023. While the physical edition published by Bloomsbury (under their imprint Head of Zeus) was Jan 9 2024. Also important to note, it was originally published by Leadstart in India in 2022. From what I can tell it was originally published in English so there isn&#39;t a translation situation. So okay, that means someone made changes between the release of the ebook and the physical edition. Possibly because it was being released under a new publisher. Some of the changes mak

Whether through sprawling epics or intimate character-driven tales, the genre offers endless ways to question fate, power, and the nature of humanity itself.</p> <p>In my book, <em>Freedom’s Chaos</em>, I wanted to push those ideas further, blending dystopian elements with fantasy to explore a world on the edge of transformation. Magic, control, and rebellion all collide in a struggle not just for survival, but for the right to define reality itself.</p> <p>What’s your favorite aspect of fantasy—the rich worlds, the grand themes, or the way it reflects real-world struggles in unexpected ways?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ihor_Bleik"> /u/Ihor_Bleik </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1irfnwx/the_power_of_fantasy

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just a little background on what my tastes are to help with the recommendations. I&#39;m down for any fantasy or sci-fi recs, but I trend a lot more towards the fantasy novels. I don&#39;t like Urban Fantasy or whatever. Unless it&#39;s sci-fi, don&#39;t want any guns or anything. I like swords and animal companions and shit. I can do grim dark, but sometimes it gets a bit much. </p> <p>Song of Ice and Fire is my all time favorite. Kinda basic, I guess, but I try and search out books that give me that kinda vibe. Houses, banners, that whole medieval vibe, big swords, cool helms, and shit. </p> <p>Next tier probably Realm of the Elderlings. All the Riyria, World of Elan books, I just read through those, but loved that it was a little lighter and some of the books were shorter to get through. I also really loved Memory, Sorrow and Thorn and Last King of Osten Ard. Lord of the Rings, no real explanation necessary. </p> <p>Next tier, but still really gre

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>First of all, DO NOT READ <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/214152226-the-unkillable-princess">THE BLURB</a> IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED BOOK 1!!! IT HAS SO MANY SPOILERS!!!</p> <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60321139-the-immortality-thief">The Immortality Thief (book 1) info</a> - this is safe to read!</p> <p>It is REALLY hard to review this book without spoilers for book 1, but I am going to do my best.</p> <p>I&#39;ve been looking forward to this book since 2022 when I picked up <em>The Immortality Thief</em> on a whim because I thought the title was cool, so I was both excited and also a bit nervous whether it would hold up to my expectations. I&#39;m happy to say it 100% delivered!!</p> <p><em>The Unkillable Princess</em> continues right after where <em>The Immortality Thief</em> ended up, and we follow the characters you&#39;d expect us to follow if you know the ending of book 1. And just like book 1, there&#39;s a spli

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Repost because the original post had a typo, my bad! Hope this is okay!</p> <p>Hey everyone! I looked through the sub for a while but haven’t found a post describing what I’m looking for, so maybe this can help me (and others in the same situation in the future)</p> <p>Basically, I’m looking for a Hurt/Comfort book/series that isn’t too heavy on the Hurt, but focused on the comfort. The comforting character (in my mind) would be a bit older than the MC, wiser, and stronger. I don’t want it to be a romance thing necessarily, ideally a platonic/mentor relationship. The comforting character should also not be too serious/dark/gruff, but rather open, warm, kind, and even whimsical. Not sure if I’m alone in this specific feeling I’m trying to describe, but Elodin from the Kingkiller Chronicles and especially Eithan Arelius from the Cradle series gave me this feeling of security and comfort.</p> <p>Other than that, I’m very open to different plots, worlds
