## What if BSD law suit never happened, and BSD succeded Linux?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For people who doesn&#39;t know the history, you know BSD&#39;s had a lawsuit because of Unix stuff at 1991, which BSD team didn&#39;t deserve for. Because of the lawsuit, they couldn&#39;t continue developing BSD kernel for 2 years until the case ended at 1992 or so. From this space, Linux emerged and succeeded BSD. And in turn it blown up, to this day.</p> <p>But even Linus Torvalds said had the case about BSD&#39;s was resolved back then, he wouldn&#39;t ever create Linux, and contribute to BSD instead. Where would we be if this BSD case never happened and Linux was never created? Would companies have more foothold over us citizens, with their BSD license allowing them to close their source their code? </p> <p>I don&#39;t think any companies wouldn&#39;t voluntarily contribute any code back. Open source would greatly suffer, I think. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cryptobread93"> /u/cryptobr

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think the main issue about all linux distros is troubleshooting. I&#39;ve used many, many distros. Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE, ElementaryOS, PopOS, Arch, Manjaro, KDE Neon, Nobara, Vanilla OS, Silverblue, SteamOS 2 even RHEL. I&#39;m using linux long before kernel 4. Every single time, when something breaks, i find myself in stackoverflow, reading shit that i dont know, trying to learn it, trying to improvise it and every single time i spent hours just to install the fucking os again.</p> <p>Yeah operating systems are fragile, linux distros even more fragile. Therefore issues can be expected. But troubleshooting in linux is just an hot mess. For example, you are trying to install some shitty app for your project. In windows, if app is not working, it might be a missing dll, so just find it and place the correct folder. Maybe you need some dependencies, .NET probably. Find the exe, next next next and you are done. Its that easy.</p> <p>In linu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I&#39;m a linux noob and one of the things I find great about linux is that any problem I have, I can just google it and find the answer... or so I thought.</p> <p>Sure most of the time I can find some forum or reddit post with the solution I need, but I feel like google just sucks at giving me the information I want. Although forum posts are useful, most of what appears after a google search is just a frequently asked question related to my problem, but it&#39;s not exactly what I&#39;m looking for. There&#39;s also the issue that most forum posts are many years old and have outdated information.</p> <p>I think it would be a lot more useful - and sensible - if the top results also contained documentation or articles from reputable sources that explain how linux works so that I can actually understand and learn the tools I&#39;m using instead of copying random commands from forums.</p> <p>There is also the option of asking LLMs, but this usually

Turn it on and then boot from the USB instead of the SSD. This is just so that I have a backup plan in the event something goes haywire with my Windows, but the laptop is still in working condition to run an OS stored on a USB stick.
