The new reprojetion method used by ps5 pro completely removes the most annoying aspect of the base ps5 GT7 vr, which is the double image effect. That means when you are overtaking a car or a car going around you, won\u2019t have that duplicate image shimmer that you would see on a base Ps5. In other words, the visual quality feels closer to what you would see on the flat screen. </p> <p>Other aspects of the game also gets a boost, such as navigating menus is a lot faster, the game loads quicker and overall it feels like you have a bigger fov and feels more immersive due to higher resolution picture. Combined with all the improvements mentioned above, the game is now a lot more comfortable for long sessions. </p> <p>It is not all sunshine roses with the pro btw.

Feeling very mixed / let down about VR in overall. It seems i wont be able to utilize my pc in the future that much for VR</p> <p>I wanted to upgrade my rig to fully utilize VR resolution, as i hate aliased edges in VR, the flickering objects (especially tree leaves, pole cables, grass) are really really immersion breaking for me. I cant understand how could ppl enjoy VR back then, when im even struggling to enjoy the good old golden pcvr era titles on my current rig (RTX4070). Back then there were even worse resolution available.</p> <p>On the other hand, i&#39;m running out of titles to play. I mean metro is a mobile port clearly, also behemoth...
