If we want humans to thrive in a world where AGI is everywhere, we&#39;ve got to make it available to everyone. That way, no matter where you are, you can use this to achieve your dreams. We should let people have a go at using this tech, and then reward those who make something brilliant out of it, something that changes the world for the better.</p> <p>Some might say, &quot;Why would the tech giants give this away for free&quot;? I believe it is the government&#39;s responsibility to step up, not just businesses. In a world where AI can do more and more of the work, we need to give people reasons to keep going. If the government just starts handing out money, like with UBI, it could do more harm than good. What really matters is purpose, having something to work towards, something that makes getting up in the morning worthwhile.</p> </div>",

With this dataset I hope to accomplish 2 things:</p> <ul> <li>Reduce token usage</li> <li>Increase model strength in reasoning</li> </ul> <p>So how does this dataset accomplish that? By Adding a &quot;system_prompt&quot; like reasoning tag to the beggining of every data line that tells the model whether it should or shouldnt reason.</p> <p>In the &quot;rombo-nonreasoning.json&quot; model the tag looks like this:</p> <pre><code>&lt;think&gt; This query is simple; no detailed reasoning is needed. &lt;/think&gt;\\n </code></pre> <p>And in the &quot;rombo-reasoning.json&quot;</p> <pre><code>&lt;think&gt; This query",
