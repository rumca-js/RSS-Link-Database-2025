<p>I’ve been covering smart home and security products for years, and I’ve written about and reviewed scores of smart devices. Yet I can count on one hand (plus an extra finger or two) the number of smart devices that my family and I actually depend on. </p>



<p>Sure, I have plenty of smart gadgets in my house that are nice-to-haves. I like the air quality monitor in our finished basement, good for keeping tabs on the VOC and CO2 levels in our downstairs living room. There’s also a Google Nest Hub in our kitchen that displays family photos, while an Amazon Echo Dot in my daughter’s bedroom occasionally blurts out the weather. </p>



<p>But while those devices certainly come in handy, they’re also expendable. If something went wrong with the Google display (which we really only use for its photo frame abilities), we could probably live without it. Same goes

<p>Working from home has gone from being a growing trend to a full-scale phenomenon. There are many perks to a work-from-home arrangement, to be sure, but there can also be downsides: For example, there’s a good chance you’ll need to supply your own monitor. Fortunately, there are many great home office monitors to choose from, as I’ve discovered through extensive real-world testing.</p>

<p>I’m a standing desk evangelist. I believe in standing desks so much that if you and I were to meet and get talking and I were to find out you work at a desk, I’d try to convince you to <em>stand</em> at it instead.</p>



<p>I stand almost all day, swaying and rocking on my two feet like a silly person to keep my posture upright and to keep my deep veins from thrombosing. You’d never find me in an office chair, let alone one of those premium office chairs that cost upwards of a grand.</p>



<p>So, when Sihoo asked me to check out their <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SIHOO-Doro-C300-Pro-Ultra-Soft/dp/B0CW1JKB4F/">Doro C300 Pro office chair</a> with a $700 MSRP, I told the lovely PR rep not to bother. I wouldn’t use it, I told them. But they insisted, so I acquiesced… and now here I am.</p>



<p>I’m sitting in Sihoo’s Doro C300 Pro as I write this. A chai

<p>This might be one of the dorkiest articles I’ve ever conceived. My editor even made fun of me for it! But it’s true and I’m not afraid or ashamed to say it — I actually do have a favorite hard drive from 20 years ago that taught me about tweaking and optimizing my PC.</p>



<p>I’m not talking about frames per second or CPU clock rates or sensor temperatures or wireless network speeds, which is what usually comes to mind first with <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/1793414/make-windows-pc-run-faster-better-tips.html">modern PC optimizations</a>. Nope. I’m talking about optimizing HDD boot times, back in the days before blazing-fast SSDs. The hard drive in question? <strong>A 36GB WD Raptor.</strong></p>



<p>It’s 2005 and a young Jon is building a game-changer of a PC. It was a different time — AMD hadn’t even acquired ATI yet! — but I was forging

<p>The notorious “Blue Screen of Death” — or BSOD for short — is the biggest disaster that can befall a Windows user. The system shuts down with a cryptic error message on a blue background and is only ready for use again after a restart.</p>



<p>Unsaved data is lost. After the restart, Windows runs for a while until the error occurs again. In some instances, the BSOD can re-occur immediately and perpetually every time Windows is started. The system is then unusable and repairs are only possible via a second or rescue system.</p>



<p>This article shows several ways to access a system that no longer shows a desktop.</p>



<p>The causes of the complete crash are varied and not always easy to discern. We describe how the error can be investigated in more detail and what measures can be used to repair a defective Windows system.</p>
