<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I’ve been locked in to Apple’s ecosystem by choice for quite some time now, but the pricing tiers are becoming onerous. We’re currently paying for a family sharing service to store photos, and it’s extremely expensive considering I’m running a home server with terabytes of space free.</p> <p>Is there a workable solution that decouples Apple photos and stores / syncs in the same way to your own backend? I like the way Apple photos does compute on device, syncs and works seamlessly, so am looking for a similar UX. It seems with the EU working on allowing consumer choice there should be a way to switch out the backend storage and keep a similar user experience. Does that exist?</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/boodleberry"> /u/boodleberry </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1irwg1j/alternative_to_icloud/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre

Many guides included using another container to restart unhealthy containers, but my problem was the containers that had issues were not the ones that went unhealthy. Ultimately, what worked best (and was simplest) was adding a healthcheck to just ping the vpn hostname from those containers; then exit the container if it fail

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Kind of a weird question, but years ago I came across some sort of project, I think it was aimed at Raspberry Pi, for quickly setting up a local WiFi hub with self-contained services for VoIP, BBS, and local messenger. It was intended for large events without meaningful tech infrastructure, such as festivals or disasters.</p> <p>I know I can probably set up a bunch of these things by myself, but from what I recall, this project was packaged and documented nicely. Unfortunately I can&#39;t recall what it was and I can&#39;t seem to find it anymore. Anybody happen to know, or can point me at similar types of projects that would be easy to deploy on something like a Pi?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cardboard-kansio"> /u/cardboard-kansio </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1iri5wq/festivaldisaster_standalone_communications_hub/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking for blocklists. Ones that will produce the least amount of false positives and allow me to add most of them through few files instead of having to add 50+ files.</p> <p>I used search on Github, and sorted by most recently updated. I figured the most recent ones will be the most updated, and I came across <a href="https://github.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall/tree/main/blocklists">https://github.com/Aetherinox/csf-firewall/tree/main/blocklists</a></p> <p>It is a good blocklist and the file called master allows me to block most everything with a single file with no issues. But the blocklist lists ip addresses for each server I want to block.</p> <p>But if you look at Pihole, it uses blocklists with DNS / names of websites instead of ip addresses. I assume Pihole does not handle ips, only domain names. One example of a blocklist I use is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts">https://raw.githubuserc

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, yesterday I tried multiple approaches to access my Jellyfin instance from outside and the only ones that worked were:</p> <p>1 - Exposing port 8096 on my router and using IP address:port</p> <p>2 - Exposing the port, but using a DDNS because I don&#39;t have a fixed ipaddress, therefore I accessed with ddnsaddress:port</p> <p>3 - Running a Tailscale Funnel on the server that hosts my Jellyfin docker container. This created an address like server.cool-name.ts.net and I was able to access it from outside.</p> <p>I want to watch Jellyfin on a tv outside my home, onto which I cannot install tailscale or a VPN for example.</p> <p>Option #3 doesn&#39;t expose ports, but still allows anyone to brute force their access to my Jellyfin container. What are the security issues with this appproach??</p> <p>Should I get a domain + VPS and setup a reverse proxy to get more security?</p> <p>My ISP doesn&#39;t allow opening port 80 and 443.</p> <p>Thanks

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Dear community:</p> <p>I have learnt a lot from this place over the years. Some days ago, I received an email from the Let&#39;s Encrypt Foundation notificating subscribers and users that they are discontinuing their certificate expiry email alerts. This is a potential security risk, so I have been wandering the web in search of a solution to this. I have checked the recommended Red Sift certificate monitor, but it does not convince me. I wanted a selfhosted solution and Uptime Kuma came across. I knew the app, as it is quite a popular monitoring software, but I didn&#39;t know it had a certificate expiry tracker. Nevertheless, I think it is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</p> <p>So, I wanted to ask you guys if you knew about any programs that worked like a data aggregator from certificate monitoring sources like CloudFlare and Google for certificate emission and transparency and also served as an expiry and tracker of issued TLS certs. And
