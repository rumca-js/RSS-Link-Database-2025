<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey - just wanted everyones opinions please on video card choice.</p> <p>First and foremost my Amiga Desktop is off being converted to a 4000TX (its gonna be a couple of months) til i get it back. Ive also got a PicassoIV with the conceirto sound module. I got this from a family friend last month ( i did post with pics at the time ) - i did have a Ariadne card but ive sold that (im getting rid of the stuff that i dont need) - question was....is the picasso a good choice to keep using or, should i go for something like the ZZ9000? after all it has ethernet, hdmi out and (please correct me here) it can push every signal out through it....space is a thing that i dont have so i really really dont want to run a second monitor if i can avoid it.</p> <p>Or for that fact is there another video card that would be better suited or is the Picasso still the one to have..?</p> <p>Looking forward to opinions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr
