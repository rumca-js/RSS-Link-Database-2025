Starting several months into Israel\u2019s bombardment and continuing right up until the recent ceasefire, London-based directors Jamie Roberts and Yousef Hammash made their documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone by remotely instructing two local cameramen, Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba, as they captured life inside the \u201csafe zone\u201d \u2013 an ever-changing, ever-dwindling area in the south-west of Gaza, designated by Israel as the place where displaced Palestinians should reside. That the cameras predominantly follow children has an unexpected double effect: it makes the film\u2019s many deeply distressing moments all the more unbearable, yet it tinges them with some sort of hope.</p><p>The kids are led by 13-year-old Ab",

While it waits in the fridge, in a small saucepan over a medium heat, bring the vinegar and agar-agar to the beginning of a boil \u2013 just until the agar-agar has dissolved. Let this mixture cool, remove the oil from the fridge, and use a pipette to drop balls of the agar-stiffened vinegar into the oil to form the pearls.

Reserve the oil for another use.</p><p>I remember making these, my first and only foray into what is known as \u201cmolecular gastronomy\u201d, in 2013.

Plus: unbearable holidaygoers check in at the White Lotus. Here\u2019s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><br>\n A teenager narrates this absolutely vital film about what life has been like for young people in Gaza since 7 October 2023. Abdullah, 13, is incisive, quick on his feet and at times alarmingly indifferent as he shows the horrors around him. We also meet cooking TikToker Renad, 10, who stops whisking when a bomb hits nearby: \u201cWe\u2019re not afraid, we\u2019re used to it.\u201d And Zakaria, 11, who dreams of being a paramedic, is determined to \u201cfind a way to fit in\u201d by helping casualties; it is a relief to see him enjoy a moment in the sea. Most haunting still, following news of Donald Trump\u2019s intentions for Gaza, are Renad\u2019s words after the ceasefire is announced: \u201cIf Gaza goes back to how it was before, I\u2019ll stay for sure.\u201d <em>Hollie Richardson</e",

It somehow depicted a character pooping into a suitcase \u2013 and didn\u2019t instantly lose all of its viewers. In terms of astonishing television, The White Lotus is right up there, and now it\u2019s back for a third season.</p><p>It\u2019s also a show where having watched previous outings is really going to pay off, with former characters making a comeback. This, of course, means only one thing: hours spent combing the internet trying to remember what on earth happened all those years ago, right? Not if you read on \u2013 we\u2019ve prepared a primer of all the key info you need to be ready to dive right in.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/feb/17/the-white-lotus-seaso",

Swimming with a group of friends, he was hit in the head and blacked out. He was pulled from the water, and when he came round, it was clear the injury to his spinal cord meant he had lost all movement below his shoulders.</p><p>A committed Christian, Arbaugh has dealt with his changed circumstances with patience and good humour, the journalist <strong>Jenny Kleeman</strong> tells <strong>Helen Pidd</strong>. However, the opportunity came along to have an implant fitted into his brain that would allow him to directly interact with a computer. He jumped at the chance. The operation carried real risk, but he says the thought of being able to move things on a screen with his mind pushed him on",
