It\u2019s biggest enemy is not Google but open source AI. Today, thanks to Meta\u2019s Llama models, DeepSeek, Mistral and many other projects, there is plenty of open source AI out there that\u2019s just capable. Sam Altman wants to stop it and he will fear monger about them. He is already doing it to DeepSeek. But don\u2019t let him make that decision for you. Use open source AI. If you can run it locally on your device, do it. If you can\u2019t, running it in the cloud is still more beneficial in the long run, even though it\u2019s not private. \n\nSOURCES [references available in the transcript]\n[0] https://www.ft.com/content/48eb53a1-67ca-4509-8c62-401f0cf8b099\n[1] https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/openai-",
