<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>i am building a ml model which will utilize deep autoencoder to classify benign and malicious apk .i have been looking for a prebuild dataset which will contain info such as system calls,network activity etc .I need the data to be sequential so the autoencoder can learn from the actual progression of events during app execution. I&#39;ve looked into CICMalDroid 2020, but its dynamic data is mostly provided as aggregated snapshots rather than continuous, time-ordered sequences. If anyone knows of a dataset that meets these requirements, please share!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SpecialistJelly6159"> /u/SpecialistJelly6159 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1iruy7s/dataset_for_dynamic_malware_analysis/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/1iruy7s/dataset_for_dynamic_malware_analysis/">[comments]</a></span>
