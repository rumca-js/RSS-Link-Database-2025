<p>This often-distressing BBC documentary follows astonishing kids working as TikTok chefs and hospital porters – and shows their determination to smile in the face of unimaginable horror</p><p>The children of Gaza will be its future, if they are able to remain there. Starting several months into Israel’s bombardment and continuing right up until the recent ceasefire, London-based directors Jamie Roberts and Yousef Hammash made their documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone by remotely instructing two local cameramen, Amjad Al Fayoumi and Ibrahim Abu Ishaiba, as they captured life inside the “safe zone” – an ever-changing, ever-dwindling area in the south-west of Gaza, designated by Israel as the place where displaced Palestinians should reside. That the cameras predominantly follow children has an unexpected double effect: it makes the film’s many deeply distressing moments all the more unbearable, yet it tinges them with some sort of hope.</p><p>The kids are led by 13-year-old Ab

<p>The 52,888-seat ground in Bramley-Moore dock impresses as 10,000 fans flock to test event – even if Everton lose</p><p>The clue is in the name, yet it is hard to imagine now that Bramley‑Moore dock was an abandoned, neglected body of water 1,303 days ago. Twelve unexploded anti-aircraft shells from the second world war still lurked in the depths, waiting to be removed by the Royal Navy, when Everton took possession of the site on 26 July 2021. Less than four years later a magnificent, imposing, futuristic stadium has opened on the banks of the River Mersey. A torturous journey decades in the making has been worth every step.</p><p>It was July 2019 at the nearby Titanic Hotel when the architect Dan Meis unveiled his grand plans for Everton’s new home. Tonight it welcomed its first guests, the 10,000 fortunate Evertonians selected via a ballot to attend the first test event and game at Bramley-Moore dock. A friendly between Everton’s and Wigan’s under-18s has never felt so significa

It was a January morning in Pamplona, cold and wet, and the taxi that was supposed to take her to hospital hadn’t turned up. Standing in the street watching time and traffic pass but no cabs, she was getting a bit worried when she saw a young man she thought she recognised. She, after all, is an Osasuna supporter and he is their striker. Although, like her, he wasn’t having the best of times back then; he was halfway through the season, well into the winter, and had scored just once, when she approached. “Excuse me,” Mari Carmen said. “Are you Ante Budimir? Could you do me a favour? Could you take me to the hospital?”</p><p>So he did, and there was the selfie to prove it. Mari Carmen knew her family would never believe her but, originally from tiny Carcastillo 50 miles south, recently widowed and having moved to the capital for health reas

<p>Recordings of fighters’ wiretapped phone calls are juxtaposed with images of wartime destruction in Oksana Karpovych’s compelling war documentary</p><p>Vietnam saw the advent of the visible war, documented by TV cameras; but the Russia-Ukraine war perhaps represents the moment we also get a fully audible one. With two relatively affluent belligerents involved, mobile phone coverage is ubiquitous on both the civilian and soldier sides. Juxtaposing intercepted calls back home from frontline Russian troops with shots of the devastation they have wreaked in Ukraine, this film is a bleak and searing wiretap into Putin’s warping effect on his people and the psychology of power.</p><p>“A Russian is not a Russian if they don’t steal something,” jokes one woman when she hears her brave boy has looted some makeup for her. Set against the shots of ransacked living rooms, wrecked petrol stations and dimly lit bomb shelters, such casual banter hammers home a chilling normalisation of imperiali

<p>Spurs are on the slide, Terland and Shaw show scoring prowess and Chelsea confirm they are mentality monsters</p><p>Arsenal will steal the headlines, with five goals, a clean sheet, Chloe Kelly making her second debut and a 56,784 crowd, but the plight of Tottenham is the bigger talking point. Spurs have lost as many games as they did across the whole of last season (seven) and only bottom-placed Crystal Palace have conceded more goals. Last term they were a team full of promise, an FA Cup final the reward for the progress made under Robert Vilahamn. This season they look a shadow of that side. The loss of the loanee Grace Clinton and Celin Bizet, both to Manchester United, has weakened their midfield but does not justify the apparent aimlessness of the players that remain. Vilahamn said they needed to stay true to the way they want to play – building out from the back – without conceding as many goals (31 in 14 games). He said he wanted to “make sure we have an identity that we f

It brought damaging winds of 130mph and heavy rainfall, with 440mm of rain falling in two days. Prior to landfall, Zelia affected southern Indonesia, including Bali, with winds of more than 45mph. The storm weakened into a tropical low by Saturday, but continued to cause widespread flooding, particularly near the Pilbara rivers and the Great Sandy Desert.</p><p>Zelia intensified rapidly because of the record-warm Indian Ocean temperatures, which were 1-2C above seasonal average, providing increased energy and moisture to fuel the storm.

<p>Yes, I’ve made balsamic vinegar pearls and sous-vide swede – but trial and error still produces the most delicious food</p><p>To make pearls of balsamic vinegar, first chill a good amount of olive oil in a tall glass. While it waits in the fridge, in a small saucepan over a medium heat, bring the vinegar and agar-agar to the beginning of a boil – just until the agar-agar has dissolved. Let this mixture cool, remove the oil from the fridge, and use a pipette to drop balls of the agar-stiffened vinegar into the oil to form the pearls. Drain into another container using a small sieve to catch the pearls. Reserve the oil for another use.</p><p>I remember making these, my first and only foray into what is known as “molecular gastronomy”, in 2013. It was already a bit passe at that time, but the science experiment aspect of creating a simple acidic garnish for a chocolate and strawberry cupcake that Valentine’s Day was undoubtedly fun. The lesson influenced how I’d go on to use agar-aga

<p>This courageous, melancholy memoir, about the author’s struggle to reconcile his faith with his sexuality, argues that homophobia is a cultural phenomenon, not a religious edict</p><p>A few years ago I wanted to write about gay life in Algiers, where homosexuality is illegal and, if you’re not careful, can get you killed. There is, however, a busy, if well-hidden, gay underground in the city, as there is in most Arab countries. I found it relatively easy to make a few contacts, who all insisted that we meet in a “neutral” restaurant in the embassy district of Hydra, which is well guarded by government and foreign soldiers and a difficult place for hardline Islamists to penetrate. The watchwords for being gay in Algiers, I learned, were secrecy and discretion. There were no clubs or bars to go to, but rather invite-only private “parties”, along with the riskier, potentially lethal business of cruising the port area and main boulevards. Significantly, everyone I spoke to was upper-m

 A teenager narrates this absolutely vital film about what life has been like for young people in Gaza since 7 October 2023.

We also meet cooking TikToker Renad, 10, who stops whisking when a bomb hits nearby: “We’re not afraid, we’re used to it.” And Zakaria, 11, who dreams of being a paramedic, is determined to “find a way to fit in” by helping casualties; it is a relief to see him enjoy a moment in the sea.

<p><strong>Stone Nest, London<br></strong>Vivaldi and Handel shadow-boxed with Caroline Shaw and Joanna Ward in this ambitious, punchy concert by the string ensemble Figure</p><p>‘Phil, do we have clearance?” A thumb shot out from the gallery above the stage. The musicians of period-performance outfit Figure giggled, then plunged into Vivaldi’s Concerto for Strings in D minor (“Madrigalesco”), its opening gestures drawn out in fierce, even bowstrokes. Not a hint of vibrato to warm the tone. They tightened the screws on the concerto’s already weird harmonies with some artfully dissonant pitching. In the fast movements, the ensemble clicked together like a mechanical device, Vivaldi’s passagework suddenly animated by fizzing energy and punchy attack.</p><p>Then a scramble to swap bows – out with baroque curves, in with the modern – while Figure’s co-artistic director, Frederick Waxman, introduced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/feb/02/caroline-shaw-composer-pulitzer-win

<p>As the film that caused havoc at its Paris premiere resurfaces, the great French actor looks back on an extraordinary career, from the furore of Meetings With Anna to the meltdown of Apocalypse Now</p><p>‘People stood up and started to yell,” says Aurore Clément, remembering the day Les Rendez-vous d’Anna premiered at the Paris film festival and caused havoc. This glacial, disquieting film, which appeared in English as Meetings With Anna, follows the titular director on an odyssey around Europe that climaxes with her singing an Edith Piaf song to her lover. And that, apparently, was the final straw. “They wanted to attack me,” says Clément, who played Anna. “The journalist sitting next to me put his trenchcoat over me and got me out of there.”</p><p>The film was the third feature from Chantal Akerman, who loosely based Anna on herself. It was undoubtedly a challenging, elusive film – a series of haunted confessions heard by this film-maker protagonist from lovers, family and wayfa
