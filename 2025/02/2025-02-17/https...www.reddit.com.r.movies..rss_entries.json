This means scenes like when the banks start running out of cash, phone lines get cut, there are massive traffic jams, and people start to argue about if they should stay or leave. Life is still pretty normal, but it&#39;s on the brink of falling apart.</p> <p>This is very similar to the &quot;Great Panic&quot; section from the book &quot;World War Z,&quot; but I&#39;m looking for something cinematic.</p> <p>If anyone knows of anything like this, please let me know!
