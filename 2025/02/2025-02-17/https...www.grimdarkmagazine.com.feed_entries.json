When we signed on to partner with W.F. Howes to produce the audio version of\u00a0In the Shadow of their Dying by Anna Smith Spark and Michael R. Fletcher, the authors and I were incredibly excited about what W.F. Howes could create from Anna and Mike&#8217;s work.

About Emma Gregory Emma is a highly experienced, 5-star audiobook narrator and is well known for her performances within the Warhammer audiobooks and audio dramas by Games Workshop. Emma has gathered a large fan base for her work across Warhammer 40k, and especially for her role as Minthara in the multi-award-winning game, Baldur&#8217;s Gate 3 for which she was put forward for BAFTA consideration.
