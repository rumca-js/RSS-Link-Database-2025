<p>Some days, like today, I just can’t believe how cheap mini PCs have gotten. Right now, you can snag this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computers-Windows-Display-Desktop-Bluetooth/dp/B0BQHBWPYX/">Acemagician AM06 Pro for just $249 on Amazon</a>, the lowest price we’ve ever seen for it. (This is a Prime-only deal, but if you don’t have Amazon Prime, you can still score this special price by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime">signing up for a free 30-day trial</a>.)</p>

<p>Having a power bank in your bag is the smart thing to do because you don’t want to end up with a dead battery on your phone, especially when it will be a while before you reach home.</p>



<p>Thankfully, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Charger-Charging-Battery/dp/B0CZ9M6X8Q/">Anker’s super cute Zolo power bank is only $14.48 at Amazon</a> right now. Since you can normally get it for $26, that’s an amazing discount. You do have to remember to add that extra 10% off coupon to get the price we mentioned above. Otherwise, it’s “just” a 38% discount.</p>
