<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wish I could go to price charting, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a listing. Any way is 65 bucks a fair price for a spanish pal version of pokemon sapphire? I&#39;m cuban and know the spanish is gonna be hard for me, mainly want it to have sapphire without paying 100 bucks as I&#39;m content with playing my copy of ruby. Also just think a spanish copy is a cool collectable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Suaremente"> /u/Suaremente </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ir8rhn/fair_price_for_spanish_pokemon_sapphire/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ir8rhn/fair_price_for_spanish_pokemon_sapphire/">[comments]</a></span>
