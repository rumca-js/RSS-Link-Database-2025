<p>Olga Chernykh’s portrait of life in war-torn Ukraine, based on home videos, examines how bonds and memories persist through trauma, loss and distance</p><p>Formally inventive and emotionally resonant, Olga Chernykh’s documentary feature debut highlights the power of cinema as a guardian of memories. Using a wealth of archival footage to act as a bridge between the past and the present, the film views the war in Ukraine through a family lens. Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 is contextualised, not as a lone event, but within a history of aggression and generational loss.</p><p>Known locally as the “City of Million Roses”, Donetsk was where Chernykh grew up in a loving family. Traces of her happy childhood – birthday celebrations, weddings, school trips – are imprinted all over Chernykh’s old home videos, yet her diaristic voiceover casts a dark shadow over these images. Since the Donbas war in 2014, parts of Donetsk are now Russian-occupied territories. Chernykh and her parents
