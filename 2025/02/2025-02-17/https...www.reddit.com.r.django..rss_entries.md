Can anyone suggest the most up-to-date and least stressful way ( or resource) to add a UUID field to a Django model after multiple migrations with the default integer fields? The solution should not involve deleting the database and migrations that rely on the former field. I am using Postgresql. I have come across some resources in the official Django documentation but I am not sure they apply to my case.
