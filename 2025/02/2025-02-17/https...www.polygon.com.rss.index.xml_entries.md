<p>It’s a short week (if you’re in the United States and enjoying the holidays, anyway) but a big TV one. Last night was the new season of <em>The White Lotus</em>, which, unsurprisingly, makes a getaway look like a nightmare; can’t wait to watch more! Also returning is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/523309"><em>Severance</em></a>, which continues to build the dread and anxiety (and after such a successful melon party too).</p>

<p>But on to new TV. For myself, I’ll be watching <em>Reacher</em> season 3, which puts him in a scen

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the “An Untimely End” main story quest in <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/avowed/444453">Avowed</a></em>, you’re tasked with finding the Watcher to learn more about your near-death experience.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Runyd, the Watcher, can be found in the northeastern section of Dawnshore. However, the path to Runyd’s house is not as straightforward as it seems. To reach the Watcher, you’ll need to find a hidden path, but you can forge a new one with a little ice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that it owns Activision Blizzard and Bethesda as well as the Xbox Game Studios portfolio of developers, Microsoft is a game-publishing behemoth with a <em>lot</em> of projects in development. Some of those games were announced years ago and have now been in development for a very long time with little to show for it — for instance, Rare’s <em>Everwild</em> and Undead Labs’ <em>State of Decay 3</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new game releases this week are bold. Obsidian’s massive RPG <em>Avowed</em> launches for everyone early in the week and is followed up by the first part of <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em> and <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/456484/an-early-hands-on-with-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-was-absurd-and-delightful">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a></em>.
