I was wondering if I should just go for the Rad2X cables (the Nintendo and the PlayStation ones) combined or just get a 2x Pro since they are about the same price and I know they will be in stock more often.</p> <p>I don’t want to spend more than 150$ on an upscaler since I don’t have that many systems that need to be upscaled.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last time I had a N64 was in college, before I sold it ;-( Anyway, my favorite game was Rush 2049. If you’ve ever played that game then you know one of the most memorable parts of it is the iconic music. I recently bought a n64 on EBay &amp; had to buy Rush first. I have it and it works great! ButI noticed that I can’t hear the music only when I play the maps. The music and sound effects all work in the menu and everywhere else, except when I start a race. I also noticed I don’t hear the sound effects of the cities, like the San Fran cable car &amp; it’s only the environment sounds but I can hear my own vehicle, the other cars &amp; crash/coin effects. It’s really weird. The N64 I thought was missing a Jumper Pak so I had to order that too, I know there’s a more expensive Expansion Pak for better effects. I’m wondering if that’s the issue?
