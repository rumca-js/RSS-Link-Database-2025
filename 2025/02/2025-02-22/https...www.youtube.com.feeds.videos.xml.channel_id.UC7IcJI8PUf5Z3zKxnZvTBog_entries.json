        "description": "Alain de Botton sits down with Jaime Laing on the @GreatCompanyPodcast. Together they dive into such subjects as: What is love? How do we navigate heartbreak? Why is our childhood so critical in shaping the rest of our life? And what does it all mean, anyway? Along the way, Alain walks Jamie through some of the reasons why we experience the \u2018ick\u2019, the typical emotional burdens parents project onto their children, and why breakdowns often lead to breakthroughs. They also explore ways of understanding our own relationships \u2013 and how our attachment styles and past experiences can shape the way we love.\n\n\nGreat Company is an original podcast from JamPot Productions uploaded with their permission to The School of Life.\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on the Great Company podcast, links below:\n\nYouTube |  \ufffc @greatcompanypodcast\nInstagram |  \ufffc @greatcompanypodcast  \nTikTok |   \ufffc @greatcompanypodcast  \n\n--\n\nEnjoying our Youtube videos?
