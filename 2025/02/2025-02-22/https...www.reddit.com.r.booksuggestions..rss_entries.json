They had such great chemistry and I loved reading their interactions and when Oskar would question and confront her about being a vampire and when he would make jokes out of some of her vampire characteristics. I also really like this novels take on vampires and Eli&#39;s character and backstory of a 200 year old vampire who was turned when they were a child and lived to the modern day.

Things to note is the book is something I haven\u2019t read before, which is easy to find because I\u2019m a fairly new reader and the only fantasy books I\u2019ve read is \u201cThe Name Of The Wind\u201d by Patrick Rothfuss and \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d by Tolkien, i\u2019m currently reading \u201cThe Fellowship of The Ring\u201d by Tolkien as-well. He likes action and morally grey characters, such as Arthur Morgan from the video game \u201cRed Dead Redemption 2\u201d. After my searches i\u2019ve come across two books to read, \u201cMistborn\u201d by Brandon Sanderson and \u201cThe Blade Itself\u201d by Joe Abercrombie, Both books seem right up both of our alleys. If you guys have any other recommendations for us it is deeply appreciated, thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/yukaahh\"> ",

I also really like this novels take on vampires and Eli\u2019s character and backstory of a 200 year old vampire who was turned when they were very young and lived to the modern day.

It needs to be something that either has a specific element throughout that could be analyzed or something that could be related to when compared to real life. For example, the last books I did for this class were Watchmen and World War Z. Fiction only, novels or graphic novels. Not YA. Also needs to be pretty short, preferably under 100,000 words.

And they moved at a weird pace. I don\u2019t want to elaborate or else I\u2019ll ramble on, but I can answer specifics if needed.I like a bad boy/bad situation, but it just was a weird story.
