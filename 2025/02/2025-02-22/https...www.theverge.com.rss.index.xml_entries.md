<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">There are so many people here that nobody can tell where the end of the line is. New people arrive, ask if there&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a line, shuffle into a blob of bodies idling and waiting for someone to give them instructions. The hallway is horribly warm &acirc;&#128;&#148; unclear if it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s from the bodies or the heat &acirc;&#128;&#148; and it&acirc;&#128;&#153;s a little smelly, which could just be me but I don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t think it is. I estimate between 100 and 150 people are hanging around, waiting for 2:15PM to roll around, their anticipation building. This is not a club with a strict bouncer, though it feels like it.

<p class="has-text-align-none">AT&amp;T has <a href="https://about.att.com/blogs/2025/splitpay.html">introduced SplitPay</a>, a new payment option that lets those sharing a phone plan with others split their payment line-by-line, so no one person has to pay the entire bill. The company says the program is available for “select postpaid wireless plans,” and that those using SplitPay can still get multi-line discounts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It sounds like a nice idea, especially if you’ve ever had the experience of bothering people you’re sharing a plan with for their part of a bill that you pay. As for what happens if not everyone pays up, AT&amp;T says the account holder is still responsible for the bill, and lat

<p>It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good of a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing. The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">The fuzz of the cathode-ray tube (CRT) monitor, alongside static grains and flickering scanlines, is a touchstone for &acirc;&#128;&#153;90s-era nostalgia. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s shorthand for those halcyon days when technology was predominantly analog and millennial kids spent their summers shoving bulky tapes into VHS players, recording favorite bits of their after-school television shows, and making their own home videos with camcorders. It&acirc;&#128;&#153;s this vignette that developer Don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t Nod Montr&Atilde;&copy;al leans heavily into in <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage. </em>The game follows a blossoming friendship &acirc;&#128;&#148; and appar

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Die in the Dungeon</em> is a new roguelike deckbuilder that pulls some ideas from <em>Slay the Spire</em>, one of my favorite games, but adds some dice-based twists that have me hooked.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>Dungeon</em>, your goal is to survive through progressively harder maps of enemies by building a deck &acirc;&#128;&#148; but instead of collecting cards, you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re collecting dice. During every hand, you  have a certain amount of energy you can use to play your dice. And since you can see every move your enemies will make on the next turn, the game is mostly about strategizing how to attack the baddies while defe
