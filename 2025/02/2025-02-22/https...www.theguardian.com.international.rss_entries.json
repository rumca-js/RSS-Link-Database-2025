After finding a photo of a woman smiling in a tree, he started to notice this was a recurrent theme, especially popular between the 1920s and 1950s. Over the years he accumulated 91 such photos, now collected into a book, <em>Women in Trees</em>. \u201cA number of the photographers have created images that possess a remarkable depth and beauty,\u201d he wrote in the book\u2019s introduction. \u201cThe women exert a great effort to hold on to these trees without losing their balance. Their Sunday dresses and fashionable shoes stand in stark contrast to the nature around them.\u201d</p><ul><li><em><a href=\"https://www.hatjecantz.com/products/76648-women-in-trees\">Women in Trees </a></em><a href=\"https://www.hatjecantz.com/products/76648-women-in-trees\">by Jochen Rai\u00df and Johanna Adorjan is out now (Hatje Cantz, \u00a318)</a></li></ul> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/feb/22/a-n",

We\u2019ve just lived through a few weeks like that. We\u2019ve known for decades that some American tech companies were problematic for democracy because they were fragmenting the public sphere and fostering polarisation. They were a worrying nuisance, to be sure, but not central to the polity.</p><p>And then, suddenly, those corporations were inextricably bound into government, and their narrow sectional interests became the national interest of the US.
