## What if a throwaway account you created is hacked later and used to commit a crime?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The idea here is that the government thinks that <strong>you</strong> are the person who committed the crime because they have records from your ISP that shows you created the account but <strong>don&#39;t</strong> have records of you logging in the account and using it to commit the crime.</p> <p>In this scenario, can the government claim that you are the culprit and say that you used a VPN, especially if one is already installed in your PC. </p> <p>(btw this is a crosspost from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/1ivuqna/what_if_a_throwaway_account_you_created_is_hacked/">this</a> thread, I tried to crosspost it normally but this subreddit bans crossposts and I think that thread does pose an interesting hypothetical imo) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CowIcy20"> /u/CowIcy20 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ivuzx8/what_if_a_throwaw

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I have a website ( originally created from my web designer ). But he&#39;s kinda dissapeared and not answering for a while now and I need some changes on my website.. So the question is what is the most practical and easiest solution to &quot;clone the website&quot; to get all the neccesery data and code to do the changes that I need?? Also If I clone the site will I get just frontend or backend awell? </p> <p>any options to get both front and backend or when I clone it I&#39;ll just get frontend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/833_768"> /u/833_768 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ivrjn4/cloning_a_website/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1ivrjn4/cloning_a_website/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a battery that uses RoyPow&#39;s Bluetooth BMS to provide battery data to their aptly named RoyPowFish iphone/android app. Data from the BMS appears to be one way. There is no user interaction required to confirm you are connecting to the BMS. The App just &quot;sees&quot; the BMS and asks if you&#39;d like to connect. Once connected you get an array of data SoC, individual cell voltages, temperature, current in/out, etc.. I&#39;d like to build a bridge with either an ESP32 or a PiZeroW to log, and send wherever I want. </p> <p>Is attempting to interact with sensors like this BMS more effort than it is worth? I don&#39;t really have a full understanding of the lower level BT protocol(s) but would like to learn. If you can point me to any resources or have any insight I&#39;d appreciate it. </p> <p>I&#39;m an older guy and back in the day I had a workbench full of tools to analyze and interrogate this type of communication over wired connection
