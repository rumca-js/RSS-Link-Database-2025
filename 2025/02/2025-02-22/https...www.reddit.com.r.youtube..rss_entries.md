## The time stamp comment thing is so dumb

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When watching a video on your phone, comments that include the time stamp show up in the limited comment view under the video when you reach that time stamp in the video. However, Youtube has made it so that if you click on that comment in the viewer, it does not actually take you to that exact comment but back to the start of the comment section. I find this so frustrating as sometimes these comments are at the bottom of the comment section for which you have to scroll all the way down as it shows you like half of the comment in the viewer irrespective of how many likes it has or how new it is but still makes you do the all the work to find the comment after like teasing it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I pay for youtube premium because youtube is by far my most used streaming service and i am so fed up with how awful the algorithm is. auto play always seems to play the exact same videos i do not want to see no matter what i do. If i’m on my subscription page and play a video from a certain channel, it will play an entirely unrelated video next which is so annoying when i’m trying to go to sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night frequently to the same annoying loud cartoon video which has nothing to do with the commentary channels i interact with. and you can’t hide videos or block channels? for almost $20 a month youtube’s algorithm absolutely blows. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/orangefishy33"> /u/orangefishy33 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1ivokqq/why_is_the_algorithm_so_bad/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/

## Do you think (at least some) YouTubers will ever get the last straw with YouTube at one point? Can you keep earning money from Google if they also keep screwing you up (morality vs. economy).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A lot of YouTubers are advocate of values that Google is starting to throw in the trash, just like when they got rid of the motto &quot;Don&#39;t be evil&quot;.</p> <p>Got me thinking if there&#39;s a specific thing that could make a lot of YouTubers go away from the site, massively and try to find luck in a new site. I do understand a lot of &#39;em don&#39;t do it just because they earn money with Google and they don&#39;t want to lose that but at the same time, as the title suggest, you might be acting againts your morality. Think it like this: would you buy a cereal that has no controversies or would you buy a cereal full of controversies but is cheaper? Maybe that cereal is from Nestlé.</p> <p>It would be pretty easy to create a YouTube alternative if Mr. Beast just moved there forever, that&#39;s for sure.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FixedFun1"> /u/FixedFun1 </a> <br/> <span><a href="ht

COOKING GIGANT PIZZA UNDERGROUND COOKING ENTIRE CAMEL GIGANT BURGER ect. Are these channels competing with each other? Are they part of a company or being paid by the Azerbaijani government to promote their country? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yoonyu0325"> /u/yoonyu0325 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/ow1odmh9slke1.jpeg">[link]</a></
