I particularly like that he has this hobby as I enjoy playing the games. We&#39;re pretty evenly matched in games like Obsession, Wingspan, and Seven Wonders Duel. We&#39;re also really good at cooporative games--we have yet to lose a game of Sky Team. On trick taking games (Fox in the Forest, Scout) or pattern games (Azul), I regularly beat him.</p> <p>The problem: my husband is a HUGE Cole Wehrle fan. I bought him Root and all the available expansions for his birthday. He&#39;s gone out and bought Ahoy, Fort, Oath, and Arcs. When he talks about these games, his whole face lights up and he can go on about them for ages.</p> <p>I struggle with these games big time (except Arcs--I really liked that). I get frustrated and unhappy playing them. When my husband talks about them he makes them sound so cool. We watched an hour long vide",

I don&#39;t think the box organization is too bad, but spinning the board isn&#39;t the easiest, especially depending on your table. We ended up using a lazy susan that just barely fits the board so it&#39;s spins pretty slick now. Kind of a weird thing to keep in our game room, but it works!

Eg. timer is set to 5 minutes, player 1 takes the turn for 3 minutes and taps the buttong (similar to a chess timer) and the timer resets back to 5 minutes for player 2 to start their turn, if the timer finishes it buzzes. We tried with regular hourglass timers but because there is no sound we kept missing it and found we were just watching the hourglass over the actual game.</p> <p>Any advice would be great, thank you in advance </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/TastyPoop13\"> /",

I hope you can help me decided if KoR is good fit for me due to my bad experience with the previous game.</p> <p>I love video games and few years ago got into board games with &quot;Dominion&quot; as well as few smaller games. However due to lack of interest from friends I haven&#39;t been able to play these +2 player board games.</p> <p>Most recently a friend of mine invited me to play &quot;Fall of Avalon&quot;, he&#39;s fanatic about it and told me it can be played singleplayer, he let me borrow the game for sometime and helped me start a campaign but I had to learn things on the fly and was constantly confused by everything. It took us an hour to set up stuff then an hour of actual game, few weeks later I returned the game without actually touching it at all.</p> <p>I&#39;m checking KoR and it looks insanely interesting, I love singleplayer dark fantasy games, like souls series and high fantasy novels.
