I don&#39;t want anything that is going to send my footage to Google (or Ring or any other big tech company.)</p> <p>I&#39;ve been searching for an alternative but every time I think I find one that will work, I find a post saying it&#39;s awful for some reason.</p> <p>I want something that we can monitor the live video or recordings from our phones or computers. I&#39;d also like something where we can communicate with whoever is at the front door remotely. We have a light at the front door that automatically comes on when it is dark so night vision isn&#39;t strictly required. Our main door is away from the road so there wont be anyone walking or driving by regularly but there are a lot of trees so we&#39;d need something that can detect them. I&#39;d wire it in to my existing doorbell but wifi would be needed because I wont be able to run ethernet to the location eas

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been looking for solutions to sync calendars &amp; tasks between my phone &amp; (newly installed linux) desktop, ideally free of Google and such. I discovered /e/ OS, and was particularly intrigued by the murena workspace, and wanted to try to figure out self-hosting with davx5 &amp; nextcloud. Unfortunately my particular S9 model isn&#39;t compatible with /e/, though i was intending on getting a new phone anyway. While looking I heard about GrapheneOS, and was intrigued even further. I hear graphene is more secure &amp; private, but more involved to set up. I&#39;m pretty tech literate so I dont mind that, but is there any other key differences between the two to be mindful of? I&#39;m wondering whether murena workspace will integrate with graphene as well as it does for /e/, or if there is a comparable alternative? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChunderSmash"> /u/ChunderSmash </a> <b
