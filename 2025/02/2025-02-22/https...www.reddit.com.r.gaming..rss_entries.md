Today is the first day since I&#39;ve been back on the computer. I can just <em>barely</em> use my wrist and hand, <em>juuuust</em> enough to grab the mouse and press its buttons. I&#39;ve tried playing some FPS&#39; like Avowed (which i bought but never got a chance to play yet) but while i can use my hand enough to play, its difficult, uncomfortable, and even a little painful. It&#39;s going to be like this for another couple of weeks or even months. </p> <p>in the meantime id like a game i could play in the meantime. I can still sort of use the mouse, i press its buttons, but i can&#39;t be precise. </p> <p>I play primarily on PC and PS5.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ComManDerBG"> /u/ComM

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>I&#39;ve been reading the Murderbot Diaries series by Martha Wells and something about it scratches an itch for me. However, it is also making me itch to play a game. I just don&#39;t know what game.</p> <p>I am a constant Support player. In any sort of MOBA, or FPS, or RPG, I gravitate towards the support/strategist/healer tropes. Heck, I even made a pacifist Skyrim character that is all Illusion and Restoration magic so I can force enemies to fight each other while healing my companion lol. I am wondering if there is such a thing as a single player game that fulfills that fantasy. In the Murderbot Diaries, the protagonist is a SecUnit who is tasked with keeping their humans alive.</p> <p>I know this is very specific but wondering if there&#39;s anything out there.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JustBronzeThingsLoL"> /u/JustBronzeThingsLoL </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.re

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw a video recently comparing Avowed to Oblivion. Aside from NPC interactions, the main thing that stuck out to me was how Oblivion would allow you to pick up most things and even attack items, causing them to be pushed around, get knocked off the table, and they would stay where they were moved. Forever. Same if you shot an arrow into something. That arrow would have physics and fall with gravity based on how it was drawn back, etc, and that arrow would land in the world, staying where it was shot until you maybe pick it up.</p> <p>Now Avowed probably doesn&#39;t have ammo, so that can be handwaved I guess. But it makes me wonder why so many games don&#39;t seem to try and apply interaction physics with their items like in Skyrim and Oblivion. I&#39;d imagine it would be a matter of each item having an physics class built out and applied to all items with a weight parameter. I&#39;d also think that would maybe be someone common or maybe even easy
