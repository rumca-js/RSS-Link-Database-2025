However, it is also making me itch to play a game. I just don&#39;t know what game.</p> <p>I am a constant Support player. In any sort of MOBA, or FPS, or RPG, I gravitate towards the support/strategist/healer tropes. Heck, I even made a pacifist Skyrim character that is all Illusion and Restoration magic so I can force enemies to fight each other while healing my companion lol. I am wondering if there is such a thing as a single player game that fulfills that fantasy. In the Murderbot Diaries, the protagonist is a SecUnit who is tasked with keeping their humans alive.</p> <p>I know this is very specific but wondering if there&#39;s anything out there.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JustBronzeThingsLoL\"> /u/JustBronzeThingsLoL </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.re",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I saw a video recently comparing Avowed to Oblivion. Aside from NPC interactions, the main thing that stuck out to me was how Oblivion would allow you to pick up most things and even attack items, causing them to be pushed around, get knocked off the table, and they would stay where they were moved. Forever. Same if you shot an arrow into something. That arrow would have physics and fall with gravity based on how it was drawn back, etc, and that arrow would land in the world, staying where it was shot until you maybe pick it up.</p> <p>Now Avowed probably doesn&#39;t have ammo, so that can be handwaved I guess. But it makes me wonder why so many games don&#39;t seem to try and apply interaction physics with their items like in Skyrim and Oblivion. I&#39;d imagine it would be a matter of each item having an physics class built out and applied to all items with a weight parameter. I&#39;d also think that would maybe be someone common or maybe even easy",
