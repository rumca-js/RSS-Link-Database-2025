Iconic horror novelist Stephen King has had a ton movies adapted from his work -- and that's not counting TV shows and miniseries. And there's simply no sign of slowing down, what with the recent Salem's Lot movie, Osgood Perkins' The Monkey, and more adaptations in the pipeline like The Dark Tower.

With so many films to choose from, what are the best Stephen King adaptations? We've whittled this massive catalogue down to 13 movies. From ghosts to psychics to... ghosts wanting to feed on psychics, these are truly the movies that not only captured the best of King's work, but also became cinema classics in their own right.

But what lands at the top of the heap? The Shining? The Dead Zone? Carrie? It? It Chapter Two!? There are so many Stephen King movies to choose from, and The Monkey is certainly worthy of this list as well, so watch the full video and then let us know what your list would look like!
