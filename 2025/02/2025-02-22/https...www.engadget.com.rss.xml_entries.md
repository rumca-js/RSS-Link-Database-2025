<p>It’s not every day that we get to see a glimpse of what a mysterious space plane is up to in orbit. This week, the US Space Force shared a picture it says was snapped last year by the X-37B, showing Earth in the distance and a bit of the craft itself. X-37B <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3628417/united-states-space-force-launches-seventh-x-37b-mission/" data-original-link="https://www.spaceforce.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/3628417/united-states-space-force-launches-seventh-x-37b-mission/">launched</a> on its seventh mission at the end of 2023, though not much is known about what that mission entails. Its previous flight, which wrapped up in 2022, set a new endurance record for the space plane, logging 908 days in orbit.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to take in in the announcement trailer for <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/"><em>Shotgun Cop Man</em></a>: the wide-bodied, thumb-headed protagonist; Satan in the style of <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/9/96/The_Two_Faces_of_Squidward_174.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20200923005328" data-original-link="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/9/96/The_Two_Faces_of_Squidward_174.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20200923005328">Handsome Squidward</a>; a demon boss with a lethal fart(?) stream; intense, action-heavy platforming with shotgun-based movement. The upcoming new game from DeadToast Entertainment, the solo developer behind <em>My Friend Pedro,</em> looks absolutely unhinged. Its hero’s core mission? “Go to Hell, arrest Satan.”</p>

We don&#39;t know why you&#39;d want a mouse that&#39;s also an oil diffuser, but, well... the option (for some reason) now exists. If you want to change scents, you can just wash the vial and refill it with a different one. Just take note that the vial is in a bottom compartment, so you&#39;ll have to take care not to accidentally damage it and smear aromatic oils on your desk. You also cannot use 100 percent pure essential oils and will have to refill the vial with oils for reed diffusers, ultrasonic diffusers and aroma stones.</p>
