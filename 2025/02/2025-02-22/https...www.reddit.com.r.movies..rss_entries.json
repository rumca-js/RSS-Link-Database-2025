As they follow the power lines they are being hunted by aliens (or people can&#39;t remember). They come across this HUGE (human if I recall) derelict crashed ship (near the power lines) and end up restoring the power (while fighting off aliens or those hunting them) through the ship to those lines to give power back to the colonies. It takes place on another planet and it was a fairly recent movie. I remember the town being pretty run down too.

A lot of my friends haven\u2019t see this and I just neeeeed to discuss it with people! I loved the representation of queerness in it as well. As a queer girl with separated parents from childhood this movie was devastating! It was so well done with its use of subtly and subtext I just love it. It was also visually stunning and there was so much symbolism within its shots. Having to watch it over and over because of my paper I just picked up on more and more. I was sobbing the entire time. I know it wasn\u2019t anything revolutionary, but god I haven\u2019t seen a film that I loved this much in a long time. It was obviously very touching to me because of the conte",

We talk about god\u2019s existence so where is it? Is god so cruel? Becz the man who killed them so brutally died due to natural causes by living his life happily. I mean how? It only leaves me to the conclusion that the more bad you\u2019ll do to others the more peaceful &amp; grateful you will be but if you try to do good, bad will Come to you.

Jason Statham is just goddamn marvelous in it. His greatest performance I have ever seen. </p> <p>I&#39;d always thought Statham&#39;s best performance was in Snatch. That may be the best movie he&#39;s starred in - but Crank has to be the best performance for me. It seems like he&#39;s up for anything.

Those within a limited space tend to get creative in ways that I just really enjoy, wondering if there are any out there that I have been missing out on?</p> <p>A few I\u2019ve already seen and enjoyed: Exam, The Killing Room, Hunger, Cube (trilogy), The Platform (&amp; sequal), Panic Room, The Menu</p> <p>Bonus if the film has an underlying societal critique. I typically don\u2019t like a huge amount of gore or cheap jump scares, I like the ones that make me think. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/proxyprodiiigy\"> /u/proxyprodiiigy </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iv82fd/any_recs_for_psychological_thrillers_in_limited/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iv82fd/any_recs_for_psychological_thrillers_in_limited/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I&#39;m 27 so I&#39;ve followed her current work more closely and had only seen Eyes Wide Shut from her older filmography. </p> <p>I ended up watching To Die For (1995) last month and ever since, I&#39;ve seen it three times, I&#39;m completely obsessed with it. Nicole was perfection as Suzanne, she was so charming and charismatic, I loved her mannerisms and she had me rooting for her in a few moments and also feeling bad for her at the same time for not being able to pursue her career. Everyone was great, especially the actress who played Larry&#39;s sister, Joaquin and the actress who played Lydia. </p> <p>I also loved the little Easter Eggs I noticed on my rewatch, like when they first show the abandoned house while Suzanne screams in the background and when she goes to the station to drop her curriculum and she&#39;s talking to Ed ",
