<p>This fun, gory tale of women trying to set up a nightclub in the 1918 Soho underworld is lively – even if it tries to cram too much in. Shame about the ropey vocal affectations …</p><p>The Peaky Blinders comparisons have been flying around ever since filming on Dope Girls began, so it sounds as if the BBC was hoping that it might have a successor on its hands. Certainly, there are some superficial similarities between the two. Dope Girls is set in 1918 and deals with the aftermath of the first world war, as the surviving men return. But here, it’s the women who are in the spotlight, as the female workforce of the past four years suddenly find their newfound social status has been relegated once again. In mood and tone, however, it is less a return to Small Heath, and more of a predecessor to Cabaret.</p><p>Kate Galloway (Julianne Nicholson) is a businessman’s wife and wartime butcher, who falls on hard times after a family tragedy.

<p>Unai Emery recently graded Aston Villa’s season as a seven out of 10 at best, acknowledging while their progress in Europe has been eye-catching, they needed to kick-start their Premier League campaign. Just as it seemed they would extend their winless run to six matches, the Chelsea goalkeeper Filip Jörgensen made a mess of a routine save, inadvertently giving Villa the leg-up they had been looking for, allowing Marco Asensio’s side-foot volley from Marcus Rashford’s cross after a short corner to slip through his gloves. Rashford’s half-time arrival proved inspired given he also laid the ball on for Asensio to cancel out Enzo Fernández’s opener.</p><p>Thousands of Villa fans had spent the previous 24 hours plotting their second trip to Brugge in four months but for all of its pluses the Champions League has undoubtedly damaged their league form. Unai Emery has highlighted as much, unable to hide his mixed feelings on their season so far. Villa won six points from a possible 24 af

Never in the previous 153 years of this fixture had Scotland managed five successive wins over the auld enemy and another tartan triumph really would have had them dancing in the streets of Galashiels in Bill McLaren’s memory. This was a desperately tight old battle, though, with a second gripping home victory in consecutive games only secured right at the death.</p><p>In the end it all hinged on whether Finn Russell could land the angled conversion following Duhan van der Merwe’s 79th-minute try. Up went the ball, end over end, and for the first half of its flight it seemed Scotland might be celebrating once more. Agonisingly for the visitors, though, it then curved just wide of the left-hand upright to leave England, to their immense relief, still alive in the title race.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport

After weeks of bubbling along in touch, the gap to safety is now five points and survival is becoming an ever more distant prospect.</p><p>There was no sense in which this was an undeserved win for Spurs, some sort of smash and grab to offend notions of dignity and propriety, but equally it wasn’t entirely convincing. Not for the first time this season, there was a sense that if only Ipswich had been able to seize their opportunity, it might have been very different.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/22/ipswich-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen delivers major blow to Arsenal’s title hopes

<p>So it turns out Arsenal should have signed a striker. Fourteen months after they last put a major dent in Arsenal’s title aspirations, a goal from Jarrod Bowen secured West Ham’s second successive Premier League away win over their north London rivals as Mikel Arteta’s side saw their hopes of maintaining the pressure on leaders Liverpool evaporate.</p><p>To compound Arteta’s misery, substitute Myles Lewis-Skelly was shown a straight red card in the second half as Arsenal – who had toiled with Mikel Merino again filling in as a makeshift attacker – struggled to find an equaliser against a defence that would have done Graham Potter’s predecessor, David Moyes, proud. Yet while this was a welcome triumph for Potter, it also laid bare the deficiencies in Arsenal’s squad caused by so many injuries to forward players that has made their task of overhauling Arne Slot’s side almost impossible. A first defeat in 15 games – a run that had stretched back to the start of November – almost leav

Our boiler has packed up, the new one won’t be installed for a week, and though it’s only the central heating that’s down (the cooker’s fine), the freezing cold has turned me into a toast monster. It’s all I want, a feeling I haven’t had since I was a student and living in a house that was so badly insulated, we sometimes had to break the ice on the water in the loo.

<p>As the Austrian capital honours the legacy of its dance king, the race is on to attract the most punters</p><p>The music of Johann Strauss streams through Vienna like the stately Danube. Even the syllables of the composer’s name beat out the rhythm of a waltz, as all Austrian dance teachers know. In their lessons, the words “Jo-hann Strauss” are often swapped in to replace the conventional “one, two, three” step count.</p><p>Viennese children learn to waltz just like they learn to ride a bike, so the muscle-memory never leaves them. Just as well, because the city is still famous as the home of a 19th-century dance craze that shaped its international image. In this 200th anniversary year of the birth of the “waltz king”, there are rival bids jostling to become the focus of the swirling celebrations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/feb/22/waltz-this-way-rival-venues-in-vienna-compete-to-celebrate-johann-strausss-200th-birthday">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Islington Assembly Hall, London<br></strong>The twentysomething singer-songwriter brings classic Motown rhythms with a touch of hip-hop to a resounding set of anti-anxiety anthems</p><p>Joy Crookes is only 26, but the south Londoner’s music already feels omnipresent. One song in particular, at least: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLFCcnYSCyE">Feet Don’t Fail Me Now</a> seems to be absolutely everywhere. I hear it in cafes and bars, trendy boutiques and grimy off-licences and, when I forget to turn it off, the autoplay function on my streaming app of choice. The song only came out in 2021, as a single from Crookes’s acclaimed debut album, <em>Skin</em>, and even if it doesn’t yet feel canonical, it has at least thoroughly saturated certain pockets of the city.</p><p>Which makes it all the more remarkable that, when Crookes plays it at Islington Assembly Hall this evening – an “intimate”, or intimate for <em>her</em>, show at only 890 people – one of the <a href="

<p>Gathering data used to be a fringe pursuit of Silicon Valley nerds. Now we’re all at it, recording everything from menstrual cycles and mobility to toothbrushing and time spent in daylight. Is this just narcissism redesigned for the big tech age?</p><p>I first heard about my friend Adam’s curious new habit in a busy pub.

He had a furtive look around, then took out his phone and showed me the product of his burning obsession: a spreadsheet.</p><p>This was not a record of his annual tax return or numbers he was crunching for work (Adam is a data scientist).

Everyone except, it seemed, Sarina Wiegman. Jess Carter had replaced Lucy Bronze as a precaution at half-time but the head coach felt no need to make another substitution until the 84th minute. By then, the damage was done, and the Lionesses were hit by an all-too-familiar feeling of frustration after a game they knew they should have won.</p><p>In isolation, a draw away against a Portugal team ranked 22nd in the world would be a touch disappointing but not cause for great alarm.

<p>Ukraine’s lithium deposits are among biggest in Europe and the US is looking for ‘payback’ for previous military assistance</p><p>Drawing in the snow with his finger, Mykola Hrechukha sketched out how Ukraine’s new lithium mine might look. It would have a deep central shaft, with a series of side tunnels, he said. “The lithium is good everywhere. The biggest concentration is at a depth of 200-500 metres,” he said. “We should be able to extract 4,300 tonnes a day. The potential is terrific.”</p><p>For now, though, there is little sign of activity. The deposit is buried under a large sloping field, used in communist times to grow beetroot and wheat. The mine’s proposed entrance is in an abandoned former-Soviet village, Liodiane, today a scruffy grove of acacia and maple trees. The only inhabitant is a security guard, who lives on the 150-hectare site in an ancient Gaz-53 truck. Wild boar and even a wolf sometimes wander past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/2

<p>How do you follow up an Oscar winner like Parasite? If you’re the South Korean auteur, you make a sci-fi satire where Robert Pattinson dies over and over again. The director discusses the inspirational Loach and Mike Leigh and why it’s hard being a ‘middle-aged film-maker’</p><p>We are in the run-up to the release of Bong Joon Ho’s latest, Mickey 17, and Warner Bros has got the Oscar-winning Korean director stashed away in what appears to be some kind of basement storage room, with grey-painted brickwork and exposed wiring. In fact, this room could pass for one of the “gritty and kind of nasty” cargo-container-packed cabins of his film’s spaceship setting.</p><p>Not that anyone is complaining. Bong, who speaks good English but prefers to conduct interviews via his longtime interpreter Sharon Choi, appears cheerful throughout our conversation, taking occasional sips from a takeaway coffee cup, while dressed in his usual&nbsp;arthouse auteur uniform of a slate-grey blazer over a bla

Thankfully, lots of wildlife is grateful for it</p><p>Have you ever noticed that ivy eventually takes over everything? All up the trees. All over the floor. In the winter, it makes the grey trees look full of life again. It comes in different shapes, different colours, but it all does the same thing: takes over the woodland. The vines snake along the ground, taking everything in their path.</p><p>This all came to my attention during a frosty walk through my local woods with my family.

My goal is to give the reader the feeling that you – and by you, I mean me – have when you’re going for a long walk with a close friend, and the friend says: “The craziest thing just happened to me.” <em>What?!</em> You think and possibly say. <em>Tell me immediately! </em>And then what happened, and then what happened?

The most delicate of vegetables, such as peas, are picked at peak ripeness, plunged briefly in vinegar, then stored in oil to preserve them until desired. I’ll admit that my recipe wantonly uses frozen petit pois, which are then in part pickled and in part whizzed up to make a stock in which to cook the orzo; nevertheless, eating it brings its own warm and welcome Italian sunshine to my English kitchen in cold, dark February.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/22/vegan-recipe-peas-orzo-risotto-peazotto-pickled-peas-meera-sodha">Continue reading...</a>

Or does it do something more solidly material, standing as evidence of the times in which it was produced – the cost of paint, the politics of patronage, the whirls and waves of the original wooden frame as with, say, a Rembrandt?
