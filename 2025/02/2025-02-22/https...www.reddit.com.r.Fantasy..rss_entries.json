However, it&#39;s pretty low fantasy and as such doesn&#39;t have magic (so far). Despite that, I deeply love it. I was wondering if there were other fantasy books out there similar to it that have lots of espionage? Especially if there&#39;s magic involved.</p> <p>(Scifi elements are fine, but no pure scifi).</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Vincent_Schau\"> /u/Vincent_Schau </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ivvt9o/any_fantasy_books_out_there_focusing_on_espionage/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ivvt9o/any_fantasy_books_out_there_focusing_on_espionage/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Was looking around on the internet and stumbled on a post about the best fantasy warriors. i&#39;m a fan of warhammer fantasy as well as 40k and have been looking at respect threads on warhammer 40k primarchs. Also came across on the post a guy called logen ninefingers. So i&#39;m looking for universes with medieval or dark age weapons and that are like warhammer fantasy maybe, or more like tolkiens middle earth or the elder scrolls Anything like the time of legends sigmar heldenhammer series or tolkiens middle earth would be nice, but anything would do. Also stuff like the first law with the first northern war in the book would be nice.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Both-Paramedic-2847\"> /u/Both-Paramedic-2847 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ivutao/best_heroic_fantasy_universes_with_lots_of_great/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <spa",
