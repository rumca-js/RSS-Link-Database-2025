It&#39;s a simple CLI tool that provides real-time information about the current <strong>active</strong> window (focused window) or <strong>pointer</strong> window (under the mouse cursor) on Wayland and X11. It&#39;s (mostly) written in Rust.</p> <p>It&#39;s not very useful on its own, but it makes it much easier for programs and scripts to work with windows. For example, you could create hotkeys that only work in specific apps, or change your mouse scroll speed when the cursor is in a browser window, or turn your monitor brightness up when it has a fullscreen window.</p> <p>You can of course already do these things, with a bit of effort. The main advantage of wctx is that it works across multiple desktop environments, which means programs and scripts using it will too. It&#39;s also dead simple to use, with several CLI output ",
