We&#39;re really proud of it but there&#39;s a problem for me, I can&#39;t tell my family about it. </p> <p>The reason why I can&#39;t is because they&#39;re against it and often make jokes about it and it really hurts me. I just want to be myself and I&#39;m trying to stay strong as much as I can. </p> <p>The online friends from me and my bf know about us being gay together and they support us and it makes us really happy.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Evil Queen (Chelsey harwood) describes herself as an “insult comedian” however it’s become very apparent it’s not an act it’s just her. Last night she publicly outed another trans woman and verbally abused and bullied her for a good 30 minutes. I felt so sorry for the poor lady. She stayed calm and classy whilst being absolutely humiliated. She’s then reduced to tears. You can watch the video on YouTube on The observers page on a video titled “Canadian Angie - 22nd February 2025. The attack starts at 40.04 minute mark. This is not the first time Evil Queen has attacked the lgbt community. She has been transphobic and homophobic. She’s also been racist, doxed many people, mocked cancer, revenge corn and so much more over the last 10 years. I just think the lady she abused last night deserves love and support from the lgbt community and also needs to stand up to Evil Queen. She’s a bully and she thinks she can do or say whatever she wants to people and
