Then Exfil Zone comes in, this game actually seems to have the genuine tarkov feel I\u2019ve been looking for, atleast from looking at some videos on it. But I\u2019m just not sure if it\u2019s worth throwing my money away on in its current state because it does seem to have its fair share of problems.

Sure, there\u2019s <em>Resident Evil Village</em> or <em>Resi 7</em>, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and a few others, but not enough to justify a purchase for me\u2014especially since I\u2019m afraid support for it will dwindle over time.</p> <p>How big is the VR game library on PC that <em>officially</em> supports VR? <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> is something I\u2019m interested in trying.</p> <p>For those who own a VR headset or the Meta Quest, do you use it often, or does the novelty eventually wear off?</p> <p>Also, are there any games that offer scenic experiences, such as roller coasters or virtual underwater worlds where you can simply enjoy the views?
