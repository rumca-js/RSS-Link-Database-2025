        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>A lot of you are likely aware of Microsoft&#39;s recently announced Majorana 1 Topological Core quantum computing chip. This has re-ignited my interest in Quantum Computing and I&#39;ve recently been wondering what dangers would arise if malicious &#39;hackers&#39; gained access to a quantum computer. How easy would it be to completely break through most security systems, with the sheer processing ability that a quantum chip would have? How difficult would it be to counter such a thing? All kinds of questions honestly, I just need like a general gist of what might happen. (Also sorry if they&#39;re dumb questions, I&#39;m not the most knowledgeable in Cyber or Quantum Computing fields)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Sea_373\"> /u/No_Sea_373 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1ivcp66/quantum_computing_vs_cybersecurity/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hre",

We have an esports team - windows machines are domain joined and on a separate vlan but still have access to network resources. They play Marvel Rivals and an update came out today that Cortex blocked. The reasoning was both that it was trying to install WinRing0.sys (can be exploited but can be legit is my understanding) and also trying to HIDE that driver as powershell. Would you allow it through on esports endpoints? Cortex support showed us how but said to be very cautious. Any advice?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/leaker929\"> /u/leaker929 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1iv7dc6/esports_headache_at_university/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"htt",
