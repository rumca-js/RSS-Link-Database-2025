        "description": "Germany\u2019s once stable and drearily predictable politics are in disarray. At the end of last year, Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s coalition government collapsed, triggering the country\u2019s first early elections in 20 years. Then, in late January, Friedrich Merz, the head of the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the leading candidate for chancellor, pushed a hard-line motion tightening Germany\u2019s immigration policies through parliament. To do so, he relied on the support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), breaking for the first time a federal \u201cfirewall\u201d imposed by Germany\u2019s centrist parties against working with the AfD.",
