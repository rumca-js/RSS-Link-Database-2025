The classic 90’s Amiga shoot ‘em up returns in a newly enhanced remaster for Steam, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. The novel underwater theme stood out at the time and still delights to this day thanks to fun levels and a wealth of customization. 

The shop is even better in this remaster, with explanations of each weapon and a new preconfigured loadout option. Besides some cheats and a new mirror mode, X-Out: Resurfaced doesn’t add features common to many modern remakes. 

There’s no online co-op and the omission of new game+ is felt. Still, this is a solid shoot ‘em up that will challenge and entertain fans of the genre, but $20 for 8 levels may turn others away.

It would be unfair to say that Assassin’s Creed is struggling right now, with Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Mirage both having been undeniably successful games from a commercial standpoint. 

And yet, both titles also saw reception that was at best muted, and at worst outright divisive. Looking at recent years, it’s not unfair to say that Assassin’s Creed has hit a bit of a lull, even if it isn’t quite down in the dumps the way it was, say, immediately in the aftermath of Unity’s disastrous release. 

That, in fact, is exactly why there’s so much riding on the upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows (among other reasons). Will the action RPG be up to the task? Here, we discuss just that.
