I.e. prob never used Linux CLI or docker or networking beyond their ISP&#39;s router.</p> <p>So basically step by step how to do it. Proxmox. Docker. Backups. Networking. Reverse proxy. Etc. There are ton of ytube videos that already do this in seperate parts but I was more thinking using words and screenshots rather than a video (crazy, I know). I find it easier to refer back to etc.</p> <p>It would be free. Not needed you guys think?

Now I want to give access to other people without sharing RDP detail to them, so what I am currently doing is that, I log in the RDP users myself, and for each user, I run an Ultraviewer instance (each instance will have the same ID, but different password), and share with them. But the problem is that, sometime one person might need to access 2 or more users. This is impossible for Ultraviewer because when they try to use Ultraviewer for the second session, it will show &quot;You already connected to this partner&quot;</p> <p>I have tried other remote desktop apps like AnyDesk, Nomachine, TightVNC, UltraVNC, ... and they didn&#39;t work well with RDP sessions.

I\u2019ve never actually build a true nas setup or anything like a media streaming device. But I\u2019m trying to save money. I\u2019m fairly tech savvy and have built a few pc\u2019s on my own and currently have my Amazon cart filled with my NAS building parts.

A 4060 ti 16gb or a A770 16gb. My goal is 4k streaming with at least 7 devices at the same time. Has jellyfin seen enough development to warrant me to choose that platform over paying for the perm plex pass?</p> <p>My current build idea is:</p> <p>Ryzen 7 9700x 64gb of ram ddr5 6400 24tb of hard drive storage And either t",
