Just take note that the vial is in a bottom compartment, so you&#39;ll have to take care not to accidentally damage it and smear aromatic oils on your desk. You also cannot use 100 percent pure essential oils and will have to refill the vial with oils for reed diffusers, ultrasonic diffusers and aroma stones.</p>\n<p>The ASUS Fragrance Mouse has three adjustable DPI levels at 1200dpi,",
