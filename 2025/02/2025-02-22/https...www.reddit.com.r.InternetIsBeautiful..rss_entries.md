<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m building a catalogue of websites for my new iOS app, a bit of an homage to Stumbleupon, it’s called WebWanderlust if you’re interested. </p> <p>I have over 1200 sites including all the typical “weird sites” that come up on every topic about weird websites. What I’m looking for though are great websites that passionately focus on a special interest or niche. For instance I’ve found a great site on lost varieties of apples, all you need to know about sausages (linked) and things like that. </p> <p>What are your favourite sites that focus on your hobbies or interests? Everything need to be SFW</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Confident_Draft9882"> /u/Confident_Draft9882 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://sausage.com">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/1ivfwhm/what_are_your_favourite_special_interest_or_niche/">[comments]</a></span>
