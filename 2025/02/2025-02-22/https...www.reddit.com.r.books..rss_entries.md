<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This book to this day remains the most fascinating recounting of the escalation of daily life under a fascist regime. Born and raised in Austria, i grew up learning about the 3rd Reich in school, college and my work life, but this book offers a perspective that deals with the mundane over the big events, which makes it all the more bleak. Especially volume 1 which deals with the pre-war years of the nazis fresh in power.</p> <p>With the global rise of anger, nationalism and hate as political core messages, i think it would behoof us all to read books like this one and become more aware of what is happening around us.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hazimaller"> /u/hazimaller </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ivv4eb/i_will_bear_witness_volume_1_by_victor_klemperer/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ivv4eb/i_will_bear_w

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Whenever watching movies (often 90’s or older) a common sight in the end credits used to be something like “read the Bantam book,” often placed by the soundtrack credits.</p> <p>It felt like every movie had a book alongside it, even ones you wouldn’t expect such as action movies like Terminator and Predator. Often they’d even expand on the lore, like the Home Alone novel which finally explains why the McAllisters are so rich.</p> <p>So whatever happened to these? Did the increasing accessibility of home media make them obsolete? Did they ever sell that well in the first place?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This was actually the first Stephen King novel I read in full, and I finished it in a day. I thought the first 2/3rds of it were actually fantastic. Suspenseful, intriguing, genuinely chilling in some parts, and all the characters were written well, but the whole time I was reading it, I was PRAYING that there wouldn’t be a supernatural element, coz I always thought that was just lazy, and I was actually excited to see how the killer pulled it off. [I thought it was Terrys dad somehow for a good bit, honestly] and the whole section with Holly [ my favourite character in this book] investigating in Dayton, and finding the connection between Heath and the previous murders was SO SO good. But when they brought up the El Cuco stuff, I just groaned so loud. But honestly they did rlly draw me in when they way were more subtle about it, like the John dude having burn marks, and going crazy, or the unexplained pants with semen found by the boy in the barnyar

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This can theoretically be applied to any work, or just the ones which become successful and popular enough by some arbitrarily defined metric. Its purpose would be stimulation and protection of art development.</p> <p>What I propose is simple - once an author fails to deliver a book a certain amount of time after a predefined deadline (for example, 3 or 4 years), and one or more interested ghostwriters petition directly to the publisher in the meantime, the publisher should have jurisdiction to legally force the original author to either hire the ghostwriter(s), or sell their IP entirely.</p> <p>In case of an author failing to deliver a novel during the allotted time period while in the midpoint of a multi-part series, the duration of deadline extension for each upcoming title until the series&#39; completion should be only a third of the initial one.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DangerCloseTu

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>(huge trigger warning for SA and suicide) </p> <p>I was suggested this book after finishing the masterpiece (imo) Stoner by John Williams. Two books about living a supposedly mundane life. </p> <p>While Stoner sees the beauty in the everyday, No Longer Human finds the evil in a life where everything is handed to him. Where people show him unconditional love that he in turn refuses and mocks. He judges human actions as vial and fake while creating an entire persona that he uses to fit in. He&#39;s then disgusted if anyone falls for this fake persona, as they&#39;re just impeccciles laughing at his fake jester act.</p> <p>The only ones truly suffering in this book are the women who make the mistake of falling for him. He plans a double suicide with a woman, where only she drowns to death. He pawns the clothes of the woman who took him off the street for booze money. He watches a girl he admires for her innocence get raped, then asks was her trust the s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I recently read A Thousand Splendid Suns, and I couldn’t complete it in one go because it just became too painful. I had to take a 2-3 day break and watch some happy TV series before I felt brave enough to pick it up again. Khaled Hosseini has done a phenomenal job portraying the two women protagonists, Mariam and Laila, capturing their resilience and suffering with heartbreaking authenticity.</p> <p>Some of the most striking moments in the book for me were:</p> <p>The moment when Mariam is made to wear a burqa by Rasheed. Initially, she feels a sense of safety under it and even interprets Rasheed’s gift of a shawl as an act of care. This perfectly encapsulates how control and abuse often begin—even in real life, victims can mistake oppression for affection.</p> <p>The horrific scene where Rasheed forces Mariam to chew on pebbles because she didn’t cook the rice properly, causing her molars to fall out. The sheer cruelty of this act was difficult to
