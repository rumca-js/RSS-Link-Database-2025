They are scheduled with cron so everytime they run, they check all the matches of the current matchday, check if they&#39;re already in the database, if so they update the predictions using the new betting odds from various bookmakers. The text article does not change, the Gemini API writes the introduction and conclusion of the article only the first time (when it was not yet stored in the db), the rest of the content is static and only the data and team names change. Then I automatically update the sitemaps (one for each league) and index all the urls of the current matchday with Google Indexing API (i hope that&#39;s not against google guidelines, since these are short-living pages: once the match ends they&#39;re basically uselesse) and Bing IndexNow api. </p> ",
