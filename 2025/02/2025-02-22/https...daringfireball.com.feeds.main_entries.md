<blockquote>
  <p>But lately, one meaning has become trendier than the rest. Close
ties to artificial intelligence have led to a surge in “deep”
being used for AI-related endeavors, to the point that the word is
fast becoming shorthand for “cutting-edge tech” — and is already
starting to feel derivative. In 2025, “deep” is to the tech world
what the plus sign (+) became a few years ago to streaming
platforms such as AppleTV+, Disney+ and Paramount+.</p>

<p>It’s been confusing keeping track of the various <em>deep</em>s, just in the AI space alone:</p>

<p>File this one under “precise words matter”. Remember the whole thing a few weeks back, where AltStore PAL — an EU alternative app marketplace for iOS — published Hot Tub, a hardcore porno app, and billed it as “approved” by Apple because that’s the word Apple used for apps that were merely notarized for distribution? <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/hot_tob_hardcore_porno_app_eu">I wrote then</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we want to get nitty-gritty over verbs, I’d argue that Apple
<em>accepts</em> apps — like Hot Tub — for notarization, not
<em>approves</em>. Begrudging <em>acceptance</em> is more of a thing than
begrudging <em>approval</em>.</p>

<p>AltStore’s Riley Testut today <a href="https://mastodon.social/@rileytestut/114043540322770608">noted</a> a change in Apple’s notarization confirmation emails.</p>

<li>February 11: “The following app has been approved for distribution”</li>
<li>February 19: “The following app is ready for distribution”

  <p>Forty years ago today the doors opened for the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/oursf/article/Photos-of-the-first-Macworld-in-1985-and-why-15880682.php">very first
Macworld Expo</a> in the Brooks Hall basement in San Francisco.
For most of you this event probably seems like ancient history,
somewhere back in the mists of time. But for me this was a very
real and exciting event that I participated in as an exhibitor,
the start of my amazing journey with the Mac community, a journey
that continues on today.</p>

<p>As I recall there were two or three dozen software booths that
first year. Some of the software on display included
