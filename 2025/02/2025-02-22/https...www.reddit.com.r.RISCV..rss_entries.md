## How much does process node impact RISC V performance? (e.g. 12nm vs 3nm)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As process node size has decreased we&#39;ve seen an increase in efficiency and performance. Modern ARM and x86_64 CPUs are on the 3nm process (2022) whereas the smallest process node a RISC V CPU has been built on is a 12nm node (roughly 2015 technology). How much is this impacting performance? </p> <p>I get why no one would invest in building a RISC V chip on a 3nm process. 3nm fabs are in short supply and very high demand. It doesn&#39;t make sense for RISC V, but hypothetically, if RSIC V ICs were rebuilt for 3nm what type of performance uplift would we be seeing? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/greysourcecode"> /u/greysourcecode </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1iv7doq/how_much_does_process_node_impact_risc_v/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1iv7doq/how_much_does_process_node_impact_risc_v/">[comments]</a></spa
