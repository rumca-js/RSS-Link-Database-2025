And of course I have the most broken from factory HP laptop that has an Nvidia GTX 1660Ti graphics card, that just loves to cause trouble all the time.

Got me thinking, maybe i can get around some of the KDE weirdness with nVidia as well as the Steam GPU accel if i could do desktop via iGPU and gaming via 4080. Went back and enabled the 770 in bios and connected display port cable to the mobo (as opposed to GPU). The result is awesome, desktop uses iGPU and gaming uses my 4080, no extra options required (e.g. no extra steam params it just works). Not sure if this is because 4080 is GPU0 because i installed when this was only enabled GPU (intel 770 is GPU1). The additional benefit here is i can enable gpu accel in steam and no more artifacts in UI and bigpicture (as its using the iGPU). But desktop experience super smooth and gaming still works like before, with no noticeable difference to my eyes. OS=CachyOS, CPU=Intel 13700, GPU0=Nvidia 4080 (open 570",

The issues stem from said games start taking up all VRAM (and RAM and swapspace soon after) and eventually crash. </p> <p>I&#39;ve tried doing it on another computer in which I&#39;ve also installed linux, but these games that crash in this computer work in this laptop. The only difference (besides an older CPU, but I don&#39;t think that should cause the issue) is that this laptop has an integrated graphics card.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried both nvidia and nvidia-open and both cause the same issue. I&#39;ve looked for similarities in these games (such as game engines) to see if I should look up somewhere else, but it seems to just be random for which games it works and which games it doesn&#39;t. Has anyone experienced these same issues, and if so, have you found any fix for them?</p> <",

I just was curious if within proton emulating windows files would it do anything I guess is my question.

It&#39;s all good but I can&#39;t seem to find a way to use trainers on games when I get stuck(no enough free time/will to get through some parts...). I tried a bunch of launchers, protontricks guides etc. and nothing seems to work. Is there a way to launch them together so it works without much hassle? The closest thing I found was LaLa, but it was last updated last october and it doesn&#39;t work.
