We have an esports team - windows machines are domain joined and on a separate vlan but still have access to network resources. They play Marvel Rivals and an update came out today that Cortex blocked. The reasoning was both that it was trying to install WinRing0.sys (can be exploited but can be legit is my understanding) and also trying to HIDE that driver as powershell. Would you allow it through on esports endpoints? Cortex support showed us how but said to be very cautious.
