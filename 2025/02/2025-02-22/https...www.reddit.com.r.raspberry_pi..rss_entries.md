<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hiya friends-</p> <p>I&#39;m trying to figure out how to set up a wifi hotspot on the pi 5 but having some trouble with the desktop interface. My project will bet to have a plex server up in my cabin in the woods where I don&#39;t have internet. Idea here is that we could just start up a wifi hotspot, anyone can connect to it, and the pi will serve movies via plex to anyone who wants entertainment.</p> <p>I have everything figured out except the wifi bit!

Only problem is, I have no idea how i&#39;m going to solder at the base of these pins (nor do i really care if they stick out above the pi. there&#39;s a set of solderless female headers below the DAC+). </p> <p>So i was curious if I could trim these pins (and if so, how) to make soldering easier? I&#39;m worried about potentially putting stress on the pins themselves if i clipped them with side-cutters, but maybe that&#39;s okay? </p> <p>and i&#39;m also curious if anyone had any great reasons not to go this route (aside from it being relatively permanent). </p> <p>thanks all! </p> <p>i&#39;ve never seen anyone mounting a zero like this on the DAC+, and googling about cutting pins yields results more related to unsoldering and removing header pins entirely. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr

The camera needs to capture a live video and run YOLO in real-time.</li> <li>The YOLO algorithm must detect when a person&#39;s face is seen in the camera. Once it detects a face, it should take a screenshot of the live video with that person&#39;s face in it, and save it in the Raspberry Pi.</li> <li>The DeepFace algorithm must then compare that aforementioned screenshot with a database containing images of people authorized to enter through the door. If the detected person is in the authorized persons&#39; database, the door should unlock; if they are not, then the door should remain locked.</li> <li>The materials that I am currently us
