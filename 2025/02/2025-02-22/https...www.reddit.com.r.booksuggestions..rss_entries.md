<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hypothetical situation: let’s say someone was to buy 50 copies of <em>On Tyranny</em> with the intent of clandestinely distributing them in public in a red state that desperately needs the information inside. While doing so they would want to include a brief list of similar books, both fiction and non-fiction, as suggested reading. What would you put on that list? Books for children and young adults would be appreciated as well. </p> <p>Keep in mind that said hypothetical red state has a garbage education system(shocker, I know), so we want to avoid being too opaque. Marcus Aurelius is probably not an ideal recommendation here unfortunately. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SpecialistReading119"> /u/SpecialistReading119 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ivvwib/resistancefascism_101_reading_list_suggestions/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:/

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’ve been feeling quite frustrated with global events, largely those with socio-political consequences, for many years now. This has led me to view the world and humanity with ever-deepening pessimism and skepticism. While I am decidedly not a nihilist (yet), I feel next to no hope for the future or the attainment of any meaningful progress. Not that humanity shouldn’t strive for progress, but that it can never truly be achieved, despite the most noble efforts, as we are our own worst enemy.</p> <p>That said, I’d like to learn to understand these feelings on a deeper level rather than reject them outright or fall into total despair. I’m open to fiction but might prefer non-fiction to start with.</p> <p>TL;DR I hate everything but would rather I didn’t and am turning to philosophy to help sort out my brain.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ProperLineweights"> /u/ProperLineweights </a> <br/> <span><

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So a little backstory for this post, recently it was my 18th birthday and my good friend told me that he would do anything I ask once, so I told him to sit down and read a fantasy book with me. Things to note is the book is something I haven’t read before, which is easy to find because I’m a fairly new reader and the only fantasy books I’ve read is “The Name Of The Wind” by Patrick Rothfuss and “The Hobbit” by Tolkien, i’m currently reading “The Fellowship of The Ring” by Tolkien as-well. He likes action and morally grey characters, such as Arthur Morgan from the video game “Red Dead Redemption 2”. After my searches i’ve come across two books to read, “Mistborn” by Brandon Sanderson and “The Blade Itself” by Joe Abercrombie, Both books seem right up both of our alleys. If you guys have any other recommendations for us it is deeply appreciated, thank you!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/yukaahh">

I like fantasy,urban fantasy, historical, and suspense and want a romance subplot (spicy is fine but it needs to have a plot lol). I recently read:</p> <p>Kelley Armstrong’s “Cold a Hell” Grace Burrowes’ “A Gentleman of Sinister Schemes” And did probably my 100th reread of Ilona Andrews’s Hidden Legacy</p> <p>I like Nora Roberts, SJ Maas, Ilona Andrews, C.S. Harris and a lot more….i read 200+ books a year so I feel like I need to expand my author list because rereading isn’t doing it for me anymore. I really need a distraction from doomscrolling. When I was a kid, my favorite authors were Robin McKinley and Mary Stewart and I’ve been trying to recreate that feeling ever since </p> <p>I’d like some angst or tension/ not really wanting comedies. No YA antagonists please - my rule is they must be old enough to go into an American bar haha (yes, Maas breaks that rule but it is an exception)

She&#39;s never tried historical fiction but I think she might enjoy it if she tried a good one. So, I&#39;m looking for anything she might like. Something she can unwind her days with and/or read while she waits at the hospital. Thank y&#39;all in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jasori"> /u/Jasori </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iv6o64/book_recommendations_for_my_mom/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iv6o64/book_recommendations_for_my_mom/">[comments]</a></sp

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone! Just as the header says, I want a book that will absolutely wreck me mentally. I need a good cry and I find that sometimes books can do that for me. I’m talking something that will leave me in tears for page after page and just wreck my soul. (It’s insane I know, please don’t judge, but this is the only way I can cry rn is through reading) </p> <p>I’d rather there be nothing with major sex parts, some are okay. I’ve read through my entire collection of books and I’m at the end now! Any suggestions are appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Altruistic-Cash-607"> /u/Altruistic-Cash-607 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iv6h1w/i_need_something_that_will_absolutely_wreck_me/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iv6h1w/i_need_something_that_will_absolutely_wreck_me/">[comments]</a></spa

Slight spoilers in my pros and cons</p> <p>Jurassic Park- amazing book, was drawn in immediately. The type of book I’d like to continue to find. The horror element and unease I had while reading was something I’d like to gravitate towards. </p> <p>Toxic/Unworthy- I don’t mind smut (👀), but these story lines were unrealistic to me. And they moved at a weird pace. I don’t want to elaborate or else I’ll ramble on, but I can answer specifics if needed.I like a bad boy/bad situation, but it just was a weird story. I felt like I only finished them because I don’t want to dnf so soon. </p> <p>Pucking revenge- I’m sorry, the mfc annoyed tf out of me. I liked the guy most of the time.
