<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve been playing GoT since day one and I loved it for a long time but it just doesn’t really have its spark anymore, the bros don’t play anymore, players aren’t as friendly as they used to be, and imo it’s just gotten a bit repetitive and boring. Then Exfil Zone comes in, this game actually seems to have the genuine tarkov feel I’ve been looking for, atleast from looking at some videos on it. But I’m just not sure if it’s worth throwing my money away on in its current state because it does seem to have its fair share of problems. If anyone has any similar experiences or just some input in general I’d be very grateful.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/poiuytrdfv"> /u/poiuytrdfv </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ivv9k8/is_exfil_zone_actually_an_upgrade_from_ghosts_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comment

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A bit of background context: I&#39;ve played and used the first PSVR at a mate&#39;s place before and found it fun and quite immersive for what it is. However, I never got around to purchasing one or the PSVR2 for my PS5 due to the limited number of games available. Sure, there’s <em>Resident Evil Village</em> or <em>Resi 7</em>, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, and a few others, but not enough to justify a purchase for me—especially since I’m afraid support for it will dwindle over time.</p> <p>How big is the VR game library on PC that <em>officially</em> supports VR? <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> is something I’m interested in trying.</p> <p>For those who own a VR headset or the Meta Quest, do you use it often, or does the novelty eventually wear off?</p> <p>Also, are there any games that offer scenic experiences, such as roller coasters or virtual underwater worlds where you can simply enjoy the views? The PS4 had some titles like that, which I really enjoyed.
