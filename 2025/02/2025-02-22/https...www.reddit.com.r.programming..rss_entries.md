<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>COBOL, developed in the 1950s through a public-private partnership, was designed as an English-like programming language for business applications. </p> <p>The SSA currently uses COBOL. According to reports from Wired, one reason for the supposed 150-year-old people in the Social Security system is COBOL&#39;s lack of a date type. Because some implementations of SSA databases default missing or incomplete birthdates as a reference point, often May 20, 1875, this means that records without proper birthdates could incorrectly display ages far beyond human lifespans. </p> <p>While most private-sector businesses have moved away from COBOL because of its maintenance costs and lack of compatibility with modern systems, it remains widely used in government and regulated industries.</p> <p>Reported by Newsweek in February 2025</p> <p>°°°°°</p> <p>In your assessment what would be the most practical language to replace COBOL?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub
