<p>Southern Ocean waves are growing larger and faster, threatening coastlines. But some scientists think they could help turn the tide in the climate crisis</p><p>In his remarkable memoir of his life chasing breaks in far-flung corners of the globe, Barbarian Days, the writer William Finnegan describes the “spooky duality” of waves, the way that, “when you are absorbed in surfing they seem alive. They each have personalities, distinct and intricate, and quickly changing moods, to which you must react in the most intuitive, almost intimate way – too many people have likened riding waves to making love. And yet waves are of course not alive, not sentient, and the lover you reach to embrace may turn murderous without warning.”</p><p>This idea of duality is difficult to avoid when thinking about waves. In them we see energy and matter collapse into each other, find fluidity with structure and form, and the eternal in the transient, apprehend both beauty and symmetry and violence and terr

<p>For 25 years, Hamburg-based collector Jochen Raiß scoured flea markets for historical amateur photographs. After finding a photo of a woman smiling in a tree, he started to notice this was a recurrent theme, especially popular between the 1920s and 1950s. Over the years he accumulated 91 such photos, now collected into a book, <em>Women in Trees</em>. “A number of the photographers have created images that possess a remarkable depth and beauty,” he wrote in the book’s introduction. “The women exert a great effort to hold on to these trees without losing their balance. Their Sunday dresses and fashionable shoes stand in stark contrast to the nature around them.”</p><ul><li><em><a href="https://www.hatjecantz.com/products/76648-women-in-trees">Women in Trees </a></em><a href="https://www.hatjecantz.com/products/76648-women-in-trees">by Jochen Raiß and Johanna Adorjan is out now (Hatje Cantz, £18)</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/feb/22/a-n

<p>The tech firms’ efforts to change copyright laws and gain free access to intellectual property is patently wrong</p><p>There are decades when nothing happens (as Lenin is – wrongly – supposed to have said) and weeks when decades happen. We’ve just lived through a few weeks like that. We’ve known for decades that some American tech companies were problematic for democracy because they were fragmenting the public sphere and fostering polarisation. They were a worrying nuisance, to be sure, but not central to the polity.</p><p>And then, suddenly, those corporations were inextricably bound into government, and their narrow sectional interests became the national interest of the US. Which means that any foreign government with ideas about regulating, say, hate speech on X, may have to deal with the intemperate wrath of Donald Trump or the more coherent abuse of JD Vance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/22/creative-industries-are-among-the-uks-crown-jewel

Busola Evans speaks to those in the know</p><p>Whether it’s the crisp white sheets, plush rugs, luxurious finishes or serene feel, there is always something deliciously inviting about a boutique hotel bedroom. So it is hardly surprising many of us attempt to recreate that same warm and inviting look in our own homes. In fact, according to Pinterest, in the last three months alone, searches for “hotel room aesthetic” have risen 30% from the previous quarter and “modern luxury bedroom” has jumped 25%. And yet we still somehow fall short: the bed never looks quite as plump, furnishing appears less harmonious and clothes are constantly spilling out of wardrobes.</p><p>“People can find it difficult to design bedrooms because it is such a sacred and personal space,” says Minnie Kemp, interior designer and design director for <a href="https://www.firmdalehotels.com/">Firmdale Hotels

<p>A rousing fightback does not camouflage the extent to which Ruben Amorim and Manchester United were reprieved at Goodison Park.
