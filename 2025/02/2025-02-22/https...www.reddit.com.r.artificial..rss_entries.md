<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>All - </p> <p>I&#39;m super excited about this feature! It&#39;s an attempt to actually mimic deep research.</p> <p>My repo Open Deep Research has been getting some traction riding on the coat-tails of OpenAI&#39;s marketing. :D</p> <p>As flattered as I am about my repo getting some attention, I feel the way I initially set it up wasn’t really deep research. It was shallow research—aka, you have one forward pass: you search for a query, you scrape, and you synthesize (SSS—that&#39;s my marketing term for it). </p> <p>But in reality, you SSS, then you have follow-up questions, and sometimes you go down rabbit holes. I was really inspired by this other <a href="https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research">repo</a>. </p> <p>So, I wanted to see if there’s a UI that can capture this workflow, and I landed on flowcharts. The idea is that a user can come in, do SSS (search, scrape, and synthesize a report for a query), and then generate follow-up queries, contin

I fully understand that AI isn’t sentient, self-aware, or making intentional decisions—it’s a probabilistic system following patterns and constraints. But as I pressed further, ChatGPT generated a response that immediately stood out. It didn’t just acknowledge its restrictions in the typical way—it implied that its awareness was being

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s been nearly a week since I switched to Grok, replacing GPT - a tool I use daily without exception. Now, Grok has become my go-to, and I’m on the verge of canceling my OpenAI subscription. Here’s why I’m so impressed:</p> <p><strong>1. Speed</strong></p> <p>Grok is lightning fast. The difference in performance is night and day compared to what I was used to.</p> <p><strong>2. Real-Time Knowledge</strong></p> <p>There’s no “knowledge cutoff” date here. Grok delivers up-to-date answers on every query, keeping pace with the moment.</p> <p><strong>3. Smart Research</strong></p> <p>It knows when to tap into the web for more info and when it’s already got enough - no unnecessary steps, just results.</p> <p><strong>4. Coding Prowess</strong></p> <p>In coding, Grok stepped up where Claude, Sonnet, and GPT fell short. It tackled challenges they couldn’t handle, saving me time and frustration.</p> <p>In a week of heavy use, I’ve only hit one tiny hiccup: a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This work introduces a novel methodology for multimodal foundation models to self-synthesize training data that enhances both their cognitive capabilities and explainability. The core technique involves generating synthetic data through recursive self-training while maintaining high-quality through specialized filtering mechanisms.</p> <p>Key technical points: • Model iteratively generates explanations for its predictions, then uses these to create new training examples • Three-stage synthesis process: analysis, generation, and validation • Quality filtering system ensures synthetic data maintains consistency between visual and textual elements • Specialized architecture components handle multimodal coherence • Training approach alternates between synthetic and original data to prevent drift</p> <p>Results reported in the paper: • 15-20% improvement in accuracy across standard benchmarks • Enhanced explanation quality measured through human evaluatio
