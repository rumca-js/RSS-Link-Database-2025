I&#39;d like to switch to a new search engine, but I&#39;m looking for a very specific feature. When using Google, if you search a company, it brings up the contact information, reviews, directions, etc. Is there another search engine that also gives that result at the top?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ExtraRedditForStuff\"> /u/ExtraRedditForStuff </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1ivg3iu/search_engine_most_similar_to_google/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/searchengines/comments/1ivg3iu/search_engine_most_similar_to_google/\">[comments]</a></span>",
