The company Boom Supersonic recently completed the first test flight of the prototype for their supersonic passenger jet. It was the first time since the Concorde flights were discontinued that a civil aeroplane crossed the Mach barrier. According to people who watched the event, no supersonic boom was audible on the ground. Are we close to seeing the return of supersonic passenger flights?
