I still want something decently competitive but I&#39;m just avoiding armies that I have absolutely no interest in the models for.</p> <p>First is sylvaneth. I love kuronoth hunters and trees, but I see lists go 2 ways.... 21-30 kuronoth hunters, or like.... 15 of them plus other stuff. I want a list centered around Belthanos and treelords. So I&#39;m thinking, general idea I&#39;m thinking: </p> <pre><code>* Belthanos + 6+ kuronoth * Durthu + 6+ kuronoth, maybe another treelord or 2? * Gossamid archers, revenants, spitelancers because they&#39;re cool </code></pre> <p>Questions: 1. Is there any easy way to get more kuronoth? They&#39;re expensive and hard to find any stock in Canada. 2. Is drycha decent? Love the model but I never see her. </p> <pre><code>----------- </code></pre> <p>Option 2. Seraphon. I&#39;ve always loved lizardmen. And I loooooove the models and painting opportunit

## How good is Warhammer Fantasy compared to 40k? Are the as many quality books in fantasy compared to 40k? Is there as much fantasy lore to delve into compared to 40k? I’ve only just recently became interested in the fantasy side and I was wondering if it’s as good as the 40k side?
