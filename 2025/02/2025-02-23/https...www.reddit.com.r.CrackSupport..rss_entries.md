<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t get it to load. No black screen, nothing, the exe just quits after about a second. </p> <p>Blocked in firewall, cracked the game, installed the redist... nothing. I&#39;ve tried launching it from both exe files as well, both with and without admin.</p> <p>I&#39;m wondering if this is similar to the issue with the Empress crack for Hogwarts Legacy. Apparently the crack doesn&#39;t play well with one of the newer Windows updates. For that to work I had to download a newer crack.</p> <p>Does anyone have any experience with getting this release of Borderlands 3 to load?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/layziegtp"> /u/layziegtp </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1iw1dak/borderlands_3_codex_crack_not_working/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1iw1dak/borderlands_3_codex_crack_not_working/">[comments]</

## My friend owns the steam version of Elden Ring and the pirated version of Elden Ring with online-fix and seamless coop and it keeps opening the legit version

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So me and 2 other friends wanted to play Elden Ring so we downloaded it from Steamrip and added online-fix to it. However, one of them had purchased the legit version of Elden ring on steam before pirating the game. <strong>When he uses the Pirated Elden Ring Seamless Co-op launcher it opens the legit version of the game instead of the pirated one.</strong></p> <p>Things we tried to fix it and it <strong>didn&#39;t work</strong>:</p> <p>- Delete the legit steam version of Elden Ring in hopes for the seamless coop launcher to launch the pirated game instead.</p> <p>- Hide the legit game in steam</p> <p>- Use an alt steam account and use Steam Family to block the legit Elden Ring for the alt account</p> <p>What else should he try? It seems like the only option for him is to completely remove the legit version of Elden ring which seems like a waste of $40</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bartholemule
