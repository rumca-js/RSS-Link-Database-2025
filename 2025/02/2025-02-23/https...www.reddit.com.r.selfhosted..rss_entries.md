The reason is my main workload is going to be containers on 1 node that is always on and also temporary workloads inside a kubernetes cluster when testing. I dont need HA anywhere outside of kubernetes. My first naive attempt was to set disable Proxmox HA and set the quorum votes to 0 on the 3 that could be powered off. I know this is not the recommended upset for Proxmox and I know I could just run 4 instances and manage them in separate tabs. But like so many other things hacked together.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been experimenting with Mattermost&#39;s Copilot plugin. It has an option to enable vision. I set up an OlLama container, and pointed the Copilot to that, but the response fails when &quot;tools&quot; is enabled, or when sending an image with &quot;Vision&quot; enabled, and it won&#39;t generate images while &quot;Vision&quot; is enabled. I know the &quot;Vision&quot; setting is in beta. I&#39;m just wondering if this is something that anyone has been able to get working on their own? If no one has done it with OlLama, has anyone gotten it working with another compatible tool(preferably available on Dockerhub, as I am a noob at this)? Or am I misunderstanding what this option is for, or is it too early to be trying to incorporate these features into my Mattermost Server.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LinkingYellow"> /u/LinkingYellow </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/se

It would be even better if I could write some text to it because I also have described details of the parts. For example if my client brought me an o-ring I would take the picture, measure the length and put it all in the AI and it would give me the 3 most accurate parts.
