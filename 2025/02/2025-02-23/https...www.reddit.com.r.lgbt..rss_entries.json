I plan on transitioning in college (which is only a few months away right now!), but in the meantime, I crossdress to help relieve my gender dysphoria. My favorite outfit - which I&#39;m wearing right now - is a pair of pink flared leggings with a black puffer jacket, white spaghetti strap, and rainbow tutu.</p> <p>I&#39;ve gotten tired of hiding this fact from my dad, so I told him last night. I was nervous and scared the whole time, but he took it well. He didn&#39;t seem upset or disappointed - he respected it and left me feeling accepted. To celebrate, I bought a golden choker with stars, a white blouse, a white and blue petticoat, and purple tutu on Amazon. They&#39;re arriving on Tuesday and I am so, so excited!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/DearMyFutureSelf\"> /u/DearMyFuture",
