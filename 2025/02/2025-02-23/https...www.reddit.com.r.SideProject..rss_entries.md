This is particularly useful for teams using SonarQube Community Edition, which lacks built-in PDF report generation.</p> <p>With RedCoffee for GitHub Actions, this process is further streamlined. By integrating RedCoffee into CI/CD pipelines, developers can automate report generation without worrying about manual execution. Simply add a block of code in your GitHub Actions YAML file, and the PDF report will be available in the artifacts section of GitHub Actions.</p> <h1>My motivation behind building this project</h1> <p>I&#39;ve talked about RedCoffee quite a few times on this sub before, and the response from developers has been pretty good. Many reached out with feature requests, and one of the most common was GitHub Actions integration. A developer + product owner pointed out that devel

It&#39;s designed to be scalable for the future, but right now, I&#39;m in the initial testing phase. I want to validate my product-market fit before investing heavily in infrastructure.</p> <p>The server handles some complex data operations, and I&#39;ll eventually need it to work seamlessly with both my Expo mobile app (Android and iOS) and a Next.js web application. My main question is: What&#39;s the best way to deploy my Express server for this initial testing phase? </p> <p>Cost-effectiveness is key right now, but I also need something that can scale easily as my user base and data load grow.
