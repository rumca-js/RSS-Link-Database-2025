Welcome to Aigues-Mortes, a hidden gem in the heart of southern France, located between Montpellier and the Camargue. This medieval town invites you to step back in time and explore its rich heritage. Its iconic ramparts encircle the town like a stone embrace. These walls, built in the 13th century under the reign of King Louis IX, stretch for nearly a mile. The ramparts once served as a defense, and today they remain as a testament to the strategic importance of Aigues-Mortes during the Crusades.
