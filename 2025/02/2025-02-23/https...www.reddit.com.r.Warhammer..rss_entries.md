I spoke to a guy briefly and he said it was a great example of how beautiful models can look with just a perfectly applied basecoat, oilwashes and minimal layering on the edges. Does that mean anything to any of you? Is there a name for this clean style? I would love to see a tutorial on this but can&#39;t find anything.

## Kharadron Overlord Flying stand and alternatives height discrepancy

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Im looking for alternative flying stands for my Ironclad, Frigate and Gunhauler and I see that Magnet Baron comes recommended on this sub. I checked their website and they offer 2 height sizes, one is 40mm and one is 100mm. However, looking at <a href="http://Warhammer.com">Warhammer.com</a>, it seems that the length of the flying stand coming with the original box is 50mm.</p> <p>So I was wondering if the 40mm would work the same as the 50mm (since the 50mm is curved while the rod from magnet baron is straight up from the base)?</p> <p>Also, I was wondering what&#39;s the use case for the 10mm? Unless the idea is to cut it in 2, isn&#39;t it going to mess with the proper LOS?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Candy2981"> /u/No-Candy2981 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer/comments/1iw9gnm/kharadron_overlord_flying_stand_and_alternatives/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><
