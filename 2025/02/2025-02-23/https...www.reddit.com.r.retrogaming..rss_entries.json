I also don&#39;t need something special like upscaling, since I can always do this in my recording software. What I am asking for is essentially a 1:1 output, whatever that may be for said console/game.

These types of games can take a lot of time to play, especially if you&#39;re main goal is to 100 % beat it instead of playing it &quot;for fun&quot;, as you&#39;re not treated to the help you get in more modern games. You need maps, strategies, and notes too if you were to beat the game without cheats or help from online. So, with little time in my day, and when I don&#39;t play more then once every 2 weeks or so, I get lost easily in the game and I have a tendency to move on to another game, and in the end, never actually end up beating a game.</p> <p>Bit of a stupid question, but does anyone els",

Like it was the Cold War and all, but this is 1984, not 1954. Soviet-Western relations were at the highest since WW2 and it seems weird to leave it out. Even the songs used in place don&#39;t make sense to me. The Internationale at least makes sense to me, because it was the anthem of the USSR until 1940 iirc, but even then it makes no sense to replace a communist song with another (arguably more) communist song. Then there&#39;s Ode to Joy... Why?!? If it was a Russian song this one would make the most sense to me (even though censoring the anthem doesn&#39;t make much sense to me), but this song is from Germany? Not even the national anthem of anything either (It is now the anthem of the EU but that wouldn&#39;t exist for another 10 years).</p> <p>I don&#39;t kno",

My parents gave me a bunch of stuff that I was keeping at their house including my old Xbox 360 and all its games. I was playing old games on it occasionally and having my friend come over to play zombies on split screen as well. Today I had the urge to play again and when I went to play, this particular game asked me to login to my account again. I got an error code which lead me to a Microsoft page that explained that the code meant the account was locked. Turns out, Microsoft deemed my account being logged into, in a city only 2 hours away from my parents house, was \u201csuspicious activity\u201d and locked it. Which meant I had to recover the account, after filling out a form which included, my birthdate, the region I made the account in, the Xbox username, my Xbox\u2019s console ID, and my parent\u2019s postal code, Microsoft sent me an email stating that the a",
