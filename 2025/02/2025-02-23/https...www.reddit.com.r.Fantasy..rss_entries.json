I don\u2019t particularly care for the plots, the characters are pretty much cardboard cutouts, but I rather liked the bits about Dudes (non gender specific) Walking in the Woods.</p> <p>A couple of years ago I went on a long cross-country train journey, and I figured I wanted something simple and long, so I reached for The Elfstones of Shannara.

Some i&#39;m looking for a heroic fantasy series set with medieval and dark age type weapons, which puts an emphasis on close combat with axes, swords and other weapons. Something i liked about about warhammer fight scenes was its emphasis on melee duels, and warriors in the setting which are better than the other warriors around them (which isnt really how it works in the real world, i think). For example for anyone who&#39;s read the horus heresy books, the fight with the outcast dead and the babu dhakal (or whatever), where one of the characters kills a fighter and then steal his weapon from him, before turning it on the rest of his buddies.</p> <p>Another example of this would be an excerpt from the space wolves first omnibus with a young ragnar blackmane:: &quot;<em>Somewhere in the madness a blow from a Grimskull axe split his shield.

I&#39;m not really into epic fantasy, as i just find it confusing. I&#39;m mostly someone who enjoys middle grade fantasy. Though I feel like books like Percy Jackson just don&#39;t work for me.

I&#39;ve read this series so many times.</p> <p>I&#39;ve read a few other series, such as the Abhorsen series by Garth Nix and currently reading WaT from Stormlight Archive. Although I had somewhat enjoyed Stormlight, there&#39;s just something about it I don&#39;t like and I can&#39;t pinpoint what.</p> <p>I found the way romance was done in Abhorsen and Stormlight a bit grating, but maybe that&#39;s because they&#39;re trying to stay a bit PG to maintain a YA audience?? Whereas ASOIAF is designed for adults so even though the sex/violence than be OTT at times, I just prefer the way GRRM does it. I also love how GRRM does politics and the way magic is gradually introduced. I also like historical fiction - last historical fiction I read (but DNF for a number of reasons) was the Saxon Stories by Bernard Cornwell.</p> <p>Any recommendation",
