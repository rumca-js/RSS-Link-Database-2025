We&#39;ve taken an existing open-source implementation and are looking for ideas to add new features or improve performance. We are students, so we may not be able to implement highly complex features like out-of-order execution, but we would love to work on manageable enhancements that make the processor more efficient or add useful functionality. Some areas we are considering: Performance optimizations (ex improved hazard handling, better forwarding) New instructions or extensions Better debugging &amp; test features Basic caching or memory optimizations If you&#39;ve worked on similar projects, where do you recommend looking for inspiration or feature ideas? Are there any common missing features in student-level RISC-V designs that we could add?(We are new to this filed and have 8 months time)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a hr",
