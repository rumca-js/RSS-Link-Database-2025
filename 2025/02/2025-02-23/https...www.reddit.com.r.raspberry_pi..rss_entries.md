On rebooting pi, the adv flow control becomes “Transmit only” and poor speed is observed. All the tests are using speedtest-cli. The rpi is being used as VPN exit node hence affecting the overall throughput, which is 50mbps in this case!!!

So the whole thing is a chunky plug that has the Pi inside, no extra wires just leave it in the wall.</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen references to &#39;plug and pi&#39; or &#39;pi plug&#39; cases, but I&#39;ve only found these with a US plug.</p> <p>Thanks</p> <p>Edit to clarify: I&#39;m talking about something you plug in to a wall socket. Imagine a wireless range extender, but instead of that it&#39;s got a power supply and a Pi inside. I have a TP-Link AC750 plugged in elsewhere and it occurred to me that it would be very possible to fit a Pi and its power supply into something a bit bigger than that so that it would be plug and play, no wires to tidy.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/us

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working with the Raspberry Pi Zero W for a while now and noticed that it&#39;s very sensitive to static electricity. After some trial and error, I designed a special case to protect it. This case not only helps prevent static damage but also keeps the Pi secure and looks great.</p> <p>I&#39;m sharing the model here in case others find it useful: <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/882765#profileId-837247">https://makerworld.com/en/models/882765#profileId-837247</a></p> <p>What do you think?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I apologize in advance since this question was probably asked a million times, but i cant find anything conclusive. So what is currently the best camera for raspberry pi that is compatible with libcamera out of the box? I currently have v3 camera, and while it’s solid i found photos to be quite blurry when zooming in even a little, also edges seem to always be blurry no matter what. Am i missing something? I am using manual focus with lens position set to 0( infinity), currently in hdr mode. Are there any setting recommendations so i could get the most out of this camera? Or do you guys recommend a better camera( if there is any) thanks in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Federal-Platypus-793"> /u/Federal-Platypus-793 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1iw60x9/best_quality_camera_for_raspberry_pi_currently/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a

It has VIN, SDA, SCL and GND, in which i assume VIN is power and GND is ground. Otherwise I have no clue how much voltage it requires and what I should do (in programming) for SDA and SCL. Any info would be much appreciated. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ConstantWater602"> /u/ConstantWater602 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1iw5cuh/control_of_broken_rpi_5_fan_connector/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1iw5cuh/control_of_broken_rpi_5_fan_connector/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I want to integrate a pi inside an amplifier. The pi will have its own power source and I want to shut it down using the main switch of the amp. The main switch powers 230V AC, I thought about using a relais and a pulldown resistor to do this but I can only find relays that switch 230V with 5V instead of the other way around. It might be more elegant to use an optocoupler, but I‘m not quite sure how I‘d realise this. Any ideas? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BeezyPineapple"> /u/BeezyPineapple </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ivwzvv/shutdown_pi_with_ac_power_switch/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1ivwzvv/shutdown_pi_with_ac_power_switch/">[comments]</a></span>
