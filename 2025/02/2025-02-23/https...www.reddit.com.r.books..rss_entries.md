<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I really want to DNF. I am about 40% through. The writing isn’t anything special. Occasionally there are some insightful observations or sentences but in general the writing is bland. The characters have no depth. It’s just not an interesting story. (I don’t even need plot as long as the characters are good and the writing is delicious.)</p> <p>In general, I have no problem DNFing a book but because this book is so highly recommended, I wonder if I’ll be glad I finished. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/eightchcee"> /u/eightchcee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iwkqfg/a_tree_grows_in_brooklyndnf/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iwkqfg/a_tree_grows_in_brooklyndnf/">[comments]</a></span>

## Which translation of "The Count of Monte Cristo" should I read?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last Christmas I asked for a copy of the Count of Monte Cristo and thought nothing of it. The issue of translation didn&#39;t even occur to me because I just wanted to read the book, with my Mom getting me the Barnes and Noble Hardcover version from 2011. Unfortunately, I had to put it down so I could focus more on school, stopping only after reading about 70 pages. Well, I have recently been doing more research and found that the translation for the version I have is most likely the Chapman- Hall one from 1846. This distressed me a bit because from what I have read the Robin Buss translation by Penguin is considered the best one. </p> <p>While a part of me wants to buy the Robin Buss translation because that is considered the best translation to read, I also don&#39;t want to disregard the copy I already have since it was a gift, and is also one of the better looking books I own. Not to mention that my slight OCD can&#39;t handle having two versions

## Why do you think apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic settings are so lastingly popular?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Rephrasing this post, since the mods apparently think this is some kind of homework question that I&#39;m trying to crowdsource. However, I&#39;m genuinely curious in what people think (and what&#39;s been written) about end-of-the-world as a setting, and why it&#39;s been so persistently popular through history. </p> <p>From the Ragnarok myth to Mary Shelley to practically half of the modern YA section, we keep returning to stories of the end. What&#39;s so compelling about the apocalypse, from a narrative perspective? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cedarvan"> /u/cedarvan </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iwj2gq/why_do_you_think_apocalyptic_and_postapocalyptic/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iwj2gq/why_do_you_think_apocalyptic_and_postapocalyptic/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone.</p> <p>I was just wondering if anyone else had the same experience with &quot;A hundred hears of solitude&quot; by Garcia Marquez. </p> <p>All the childs having sexual relationships with adults just made me sick honestly. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Garcia Marquez and I have read most of his work, but this book was way too much with all the sex between grown ups and children.</p> <p>I made it to the part where Aureliano marries Remedios and, it clearly states, that she barely made it to womanhood for the wedding. And I just sat there with the book wondering why I was reading this to begin with.</p> <p>So, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever finish this book.</p> <p>Anyone had a similar experience? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SebaWDK"> /u/SebaWDK </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iwgqdw/i_had_to_drop_a_hundred_years_of_solitude_because/">[link]</a>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw this book at a local bookstore and was so intrigued by it, but didn’t have the money to get a copy. Thankfully my library had it available on Libby so I read it on my Kindle!… But man, am I happy that I didn’t spend my money on it. </p> <p>Between Goodreads and StoryGraph, it has a rating (on average) of 3.9-4.1 stars. For me? It was my first one star review of the year. </p> <p>My Death by Lisa Tuttle is marketed as a mysterious and uncanny book about a widow writing a biography about a mostly unknown painter and writer. She ends up finding all these strange parallels between their lives that horrify her and change the course of her writing and researching process altogether. </p> <p>It’s been described as chilling, bizarre, strange, uncanny. In my opinion, it was none of those things. </p> <p>One of my biggest gripes from the get go was how the writing style was very bland. I found it boring and transparent, and it lacked any true substance.
