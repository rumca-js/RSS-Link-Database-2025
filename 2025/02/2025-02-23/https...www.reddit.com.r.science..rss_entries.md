## Scientists developed new blood test for pancreatic cancer that has up to 85% accuracy in detection, even in early stages. Pancreatic cancer doesn’t have many obvious symptoms in its early stages, so it’s rarely diagnosed until it has spread to other organs. It has a 5-year survival rate of just 13%.
