Turns out that up to 97% of vulerabilities in acontainer can be just due to bloatware, code/files/features that you never use [1]. While there has been a few efforts to develop debloating tools, they failed with many containers when we tested them. So we went out and developed a container (file) debloating tool and released it with an MIT license.</p> <p>Github link: <a href=\"https://github.com/negativa-ai/BLAFS\">https://github.com/negativa-ai/BLAFS</a></p> <p>A full description here: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04641\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04641</a></p> <p>TLDR; the tool uses the layered filesystem of containers to discover and remove unused files.</p> <p>Here is a table with the results for 10 popular containers on dockerhub:</p> <table><thead> <tr> <th align=\"left\">Container</th> <th align=\"left\">Original size (MB)</th> <th align=\"left\">Deblo",
