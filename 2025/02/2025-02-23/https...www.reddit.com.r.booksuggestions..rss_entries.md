<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I’ve been reading Dark Romance for a long time and I’m in a bit of a slump. I cannot find any new DR books!! And by any I mean GOOD ones. I find that a lot of them (in my opinion) are written in such a cringey way that i just DNF. Or my other problem is that it’s not dark at all or enough. For reference, I think (not even sure because i’ve read so much and literally forget the contents most times- horrible memory) but i’m pretty sure The Edge Of Darkness Trilogy by Leigh Rivers has been the darkest i’ve read so far. Really enjoyed that trilogy. Some other books i’ve read for reference (not super dark but just to get an idea on what I enjoy) is Devils Night, Cat &amp; Mouse duet, Green Light, That Sik Luv, and The Ritual Series. Those are probably my top reads that I can name off my head. Please give me recs 😭🙏</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/evilfaejay"> /u/evilfaejay </a> <br/> <span><a href=

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello fellow readers. So I recently got into reading and somehow came across Debbie Macomber. I have read a few of her books and so far find her to be a bit of problematic writer, using a lot of stereotypes about people with tattoos, race etc. One thing I like about her books is that she has multiple in a book series so it mentions the same people but focuses on different people each book. There’s nothing super dramatic happening so when I need a book that’s more calm and there’s no suspense or crazy mystery, I read hers. The first series I read had about 4-5 books. This new one seems to have more than 8. If you have come across similar but less problematics authors please share.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My question pertains to romance but I like books where romance is more of a subplot in the book so that’s why I tagged it fantasy. </p> <p>Getting to the point, I don’t like when books like immediately tell you in the beginning of the book or the description who the main character ends up with. It kinds of makes me feel like I’m “forced” to like that character in a way. Throne of glass would kind of be an example of where there was romance but it wasn’t the main plot device and I had to guess who she’d end up with. </p> <p>In the same thread, I’m also looking for books where the plot also isn’t super obvious and is well thought out. </p> <p>I would appreciate any recommendations that fit this description :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OldOrchid2309"> /u/OldOrchid2309 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ivx2sl/need_more_mystery/">[link]</a></span> &#32
