<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello!</p> <p>Yeah essentially, I want to upgrade the server I have from like 8 tb to 96tb, but, to simply summarize, the prices of refurbed hdds have blown to effectively become way more expensive.</p> <p>Personally, I wanted to buy 12tb hdds for $99, but that seems impossible atp. I found a model I’m satisfied with for $111, but no where NEAR close to the all time lows we had a few months ago.</p> <p>So here’s the question: do you PERSONALLY think the market will get better or worse? I think it’ll lean towards the latter because of current events in my country (U.S.), AI hype driving every computer related thing up, and known refurb sellers receiving less supply… unless there’s something I’m completely missing here, then pls inform me.</p> <p>Tl;dr: Will refurb enterprise HDD Prices be more affordable or more expensive in 2025 IYO?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WaningBloomWasTaken"> /u/Waning
