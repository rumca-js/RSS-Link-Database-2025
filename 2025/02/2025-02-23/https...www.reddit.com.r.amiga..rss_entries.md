Arild â€˜mcleppaâ€™ Aarbakk has done a great job.<br/> After a long break, I have finally found the time again to not â€˜justâ€™ write a news item, but to write a detailed experience report about it.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I recently set up WinUAE with Octamed and have a few of the st-xx lha&#39;s from Aminet.</p> <p>I have everything running sweet on WinUAE with hard drives etc but I was wondering if there were any programs I could use to be able to preview the *.med / *.iff files on win 11.</p> <p>I can see the files on a Harddrive I set up with Audacity and VLC (using this path G:\Amiga\WinUAE\Hard Drives\Sample-Packs\ST-01) but can&#39;t seem to get them to open yet those seem to be the only options given to me via a Google search so I&#39;m a little lost.</p> <p>As I say they are all working on Octamed but as I&#39;m very new to it and still working my way through YT Vids etc the only way I seem to have found is by loading up an instrument one at time making it a very long winded way to preview the sounds so any help appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Old-Skool-2023"> /u/Old-Skool-2023 </a> <br/>
