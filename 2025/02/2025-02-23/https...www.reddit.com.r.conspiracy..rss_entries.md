<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m of the opinion that the cost of living is being artificially, and speedily, ramped up. I&#39;ve got no hard data to prove this, but I question why <strong>everything</strong> in the supermarket appears to be going up in price every week. Prices aren&#39;t increasing by a few cents either, but by 5, 10 and 20% at a time. I&#39;m fortunate that I&#39;m not on the bones of my arse, but how do families put decent food on the table any more? Nearly the entirety of the stock on the shelves, and the supermarkets those shelves sit in, are owned by Blackrock and Vanguard.

More to come against the New York Times and the Pullitzer board. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ricincali"> /u/ricincali </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1iw2xn6/leftist_msnbc_settles_30_million_fake_news/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/
