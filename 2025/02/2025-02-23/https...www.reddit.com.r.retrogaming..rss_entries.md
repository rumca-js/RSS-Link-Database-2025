<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently started collecting and playing retro games (N64 and Wii) and plan on investing into NES collecting. I have an NES mini, but as you know, it&#39;s not the same as the real deal. </p> <p>I really enjoy retro gaming, especially NES and SNES titles, but I don&#39;t have a lot of time in the day to play these games, except for the odd weekend. These types of games can take a lot of time to play, especially if you&#39;re main goal is to 100 % beat it instead of playing it &quot;for fun&quot;, as you&#39;re not treated to the help you get in more modern games. You need maps, strategies, and notes too if you were to beat the game without cheats or help from online. So, with little time in my day, and when I don&#39;t play more then once every 2 weeks or so, I get lost easily in the game and I have a tendency to move on to another game, and in the end, never actually end up beating a game.</p> <p>Bit of a stupid question, but does anyone els

Like it was the Cold War and all, but this is 1984, not 1954. Soviet-Western relations were at the highest since WW2 and it seems weird to leave it out. Even the songs used in place don&#39;t make sense to me. The Internationale at least makes sense to me, because it was the anthem of the USSR until 1940 iirc, but even then it makes no sense to replace a communist song with another (arguably more) communist song. Then there&#39;s Ode to Joy... Why?!? If it was a Russian song this one would make the most sense to me (even though censoring the anthem doesn&#39;t make much sense to me), but this song is from Germany? Not even the national anthem of anything either (It is now the anthem of the EU but that wouldn&#39;t exist for another 10 years).</p> <p>I don&#39;t kno

Anyone know of any other great vintage game hubs in AZ?
