Specifically, the researchers examine whether these models warn developers about security vulnerabilities in code snippets taken from Stack Overflow, a common source for coding assistance. The study raises concerns about the ability of LLMs to proactively identify and communicate security risks in developer interactions. </p> <h3>Key Findings:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Limited Security Awareness:</strong> The study found that LLMs rarely warn developers",
