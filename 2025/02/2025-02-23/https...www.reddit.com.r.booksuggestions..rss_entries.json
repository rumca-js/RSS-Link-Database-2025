I need good book recommendations please!! </p> <p>She really enjoyed &quot;Firelight&quot; by Sophie Jordan, as well as the following two books in the series. (As I understand, the female protagonist is some kind of dragon that can transform into a human). She also loves the &quot;H2O: Just add water&quot; show and books/movies where the protagonist has some kind of secret identity. She basically only reads books with female protagonists. She absolutely hates Twilight.</p> <p>Any recommendations along those lines? Thanks for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/im_sold_out\"> /u/im_sold_out </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iwdlrb/searching_for_a_good_fantasy_romance_book_female/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iwdlrb/searching_for_a_good_fa",

And by any I mean GOOD ones. I find that a lot of them (in my opinion) are written in such a cringey way that i just DNF. Or my other problem is that it\u2019s not dark at all or enough. For reference, I think (not even sure because i\u2019ve read so much and literally forget the contents most times- horrible memory) but i\u2019m pretty sure The Edge Of Darkness Trilogy by Leigh Rivers has been the darkest i\u2019ve read so far. Really enjoyed that trilogy. Some other books i\u2019ve read for reference (not super dark but just to get an idea on what I enjoy) is Devils Night, Cat &amp; Mouse duet, Green Light, That Sik Luv, and The Ritual Series. Those are probably my top reads that I can name off my head.

I have read a few of her books and so far find her to be a bit of problematic writer, using a lot of stereotypes about people with tattoos, race etc. One thing I like about her books is that she has multiple in a book series so it mentions the same people but focuses on different people each book. There\u2019s nothing super dramatic happening so when I need a book that\u2019s more calm and there\u2019s no suspense or crazy mystery, I read hers. The first series I read had about 4-5 books. This new one seems to have more than 8. If you have come across similar but less problematics authors please share.
