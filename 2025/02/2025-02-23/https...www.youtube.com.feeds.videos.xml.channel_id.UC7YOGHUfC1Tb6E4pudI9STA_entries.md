In this video I discuss how the Investigatory Powers Act in the UK is causing tech companies to stop providing End to End (E2E) encryption for their services for fears of legal action being taken against them for violating provisions of the act that force them to provide access to encrypted data for law enforcement.  I also show you a FOSS solution for keeping your files encrypted in the cloud despite this legislation.
