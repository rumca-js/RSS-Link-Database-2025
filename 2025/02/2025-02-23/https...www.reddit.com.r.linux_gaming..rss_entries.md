Make sure your video card has the minimum required memory, try lowering the resolution and/or closing other applications that are running.

## Is there a way to limit / define VRAM usage in game (Nvidia), so that it doesn't max out..

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Assisting someone running an 8GB Nvidia GPU, Tina&#39;s Wonderlands in Windows 1440p sees around 6.5 - 7gb VRAM usage. In Linux (Bazzite KDE, GE or bleeding edge), as soon as you get in game it rockets to 8GB, opening a menu or turning on subtitles pushes it just above 8GB to the point the game is unplayable stuttery as its swapping VRAM. No one on protondb seems to mention the issue, even those with older gen 8GB cards.. It reads like they are having a perfect experience. Lowest possible settings and textures don&#39;t make any difference, DX11 and DX12 also don&#39;t make a difference, it shoots right up to 8GB+ on world entry.</p> <p>So my question relates to ways to mitigate this. I assume this might come up in other titles too, I wouldn&#39;t be too knowledgeable as to why VRAM usage is considerably higher than Windows, nor launch commands in Linux. Assume I know nothing, what can we throw at the problem?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hallo Leute, ich bin in letzter Zeit immer unzufriedener mit meinem Windows System geworden. Daher hab ich angefangen mich mehr mit Gaming unter Linux zu beschäftigen, was am Anfang ziemlich schwer war.</p> <p>Ich hatte während meines Umstiegs auch nach einer Art Komplettanleitung gesucht, aber sowas konnte ich leider nicht finden.</p> <p>Ich habe mich daher zusammen mit ChatGPT dran gemacht eine ebensolche Anleitung zu entwerfen.</p> <p>Ich habe diese gestern Abend soweit fertig bekommen, das man die auch mal präsentieren kann und möchte daher eure Meinung, Ideen und Verbesserungen hören (generell ob das so was taugt oder eher nicht)</p> <p>Das hier ist mein ersten großer Post auf Reddit. Und ich bin noch relativ neu in der Thematik.</p> <p>Danke vorab.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Heronii"> /u/Heronii </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/personal/dcf2f14c71f09900/_layouts/15/D

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So i was trying to find a GPU for my proxmox server, to handle VM and other stuff, trying to find an NVIDIA p40 but was tired to see that old piece of dirt at crazy prices for the value.<br/> Then i remembered there was another player in the GPU space, I just bought for 100 euro the AMD Instinct MI25. If someone wants to game on a budget, i tested it at 1440p but it will probably handle 1080p very nice (tweaking settings better than I did).<br/> Probably putting it in the right PCIE x16 would give even higher performance or using it without having video output coming from another GPU (I tested PCIE , I just love the VRAM and the performance for less than 200W). I think that, putting it to PCIE 3.0 x16, you would get performance similar to the AMD 6600XT, while having twice the VRAM.</p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsgZ8BrAppc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsgZ8BrAppc</a></p> <p>Now I have to try the actual intended use, pytorch :D<
