I’m planning to buy my first VR setup, and I originally had my eyes on the <strong>HTC Vive Pro 2</strong> along with <strong>Valve Index Controllers</strong>.

Are these still solid choices?</li> <li>Should I swap out the goggles or go for something else?</li> <li>Any better controllers I should consider or is the Index still top-tier?</li> <li>Is it worth just waiting for upcoming releases, or should I jump in now?</li> </ol> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Krysiz592"> /u/Krysiz592 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1iwmk4c/hows_the_set_looking_going_into_2025/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1iwmk4c/hows_the_se

## VR Wireless Super Laggy all of a Sudden

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I play VR frequently, but today when I went to go play a game it was ridiculously laggy. It was working fine the last time I used it a few days ago but now Virtual Desktop is telling me that the encoding is &gt;400 and I&#39;m getting around 15 fps, and I have no idea why! </p> <p>I started with Virtual Desktop, then used Steam Link, then used Air Link. All of them were extremely laggy. I tried all the normal things I could think of: I restarted my modem/router, restarted the computer, made sure the drivers were up-to-date, changed various settings on the streaming software (such as lowering the bitrate, changing resolutions, etc), made sure my computer was plugged in through ethernet (intead of WiFi), and made sure my headset was connect to the 6GHz setting from my router. I also plugged it into my computer to use Quest Link and that ran flawlessly, but the wireless seems to just not work anymore. No matter what I do, it&#39;s always laggy. </p> <p>

However, as obvious, paying the subscription for that thing is WAY more than I can afford. I have heard some talk from both the discord and some posts on here of a one-time fee to &quot;unlock&quot; the headset for lifetime use (also saw unlocked varjo headsets for sale from opemBCI). Tried reaching out to a varjo sales rep to ask about It but got no reply, so just wondering if anyone here knows about it and how much the fee would &quot;run me&quot; so to speak (not that it would be cheaper than just paying the subscription, just wanting to know).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>At the moment I own an original Oculus Quest. It is (in my opinion) quite rubbish, the compression for pcvr is so annoying, the latency, the tracking and the screen door effect all really bother me.</p> <p>Because of this, I am looking into buying a new (or second hand headset). My budget is roughly 1.5k, and I don&#39;t want to get the big screen beyond, because I am not the only one that will use this headset. I also considered pimax cystal super, but I dont want to risk their bad customer support, and it is also more expensive than a second hand varjo aero.</p> <p>Therefore, I came to the conclusion that the Varjo Aero could be right for me. The eye tracking is a huge bonus (I play MSFS and DCS so any performance increase is brilliant). Also apparently the headset is quite light and well balanced? </p> <p>I do have some concerns though:</p> <p>- Is 90 Hz enough, Beat saber is a potential game that I love playing</p> <p>- Varjo are dropping support

## How does the IPD measured by an optician translate to a VR headset?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I finally went to an optician to measure my IPD. Unfortunately the gadget to measure the IPD forced you to look at a point in the middle and not to look straight. Now the IPD is about 3-4 mm lower than what I measured with a ruler and a mirror (which is obviously not that accurate).</p> <p>Is there a rule of thumb for translating the optician value to a VR headset where you look straight and not to a point in the middle?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mugendon"> /u/Mugendon </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1iw6otk/how_does_the_ipd_measured_by_an_optician/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1iw6otk/how_does_the_ipd_measured_by_an_optician/">[comments]</a></span>
