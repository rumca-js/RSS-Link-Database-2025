I own an e-commerce company that is transitioning from being primarily Amazon-focused to also targeting Walmart. The challenge is that Walmart\u2019s available data is alarmingly poor compared to Amazon\u2019s, and I\u2019m looking to scrape Walmart data\u2014specifically reviews, stock data, and pricing\u2014on an hourly basis.</p> <p>I\u2019ve considered hiring virtual assistants and attempting this myself, but my technical skills are limited. I\u2019m seeking a consultant (I\u2019m happy to pay) who can help me:</p> <ol> <li>Understand the limits of what is technologically possible.</li> <li>Evaluate what\u2019s feasible from a cost perspective.</li> <li>Identify which virtual assistants possess the necessary skills.</li> </ol> <p>Any tips, advice, or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
