A&nbsp;little bit of wine, honey, soy sauce, fresh thyme, some star anise – I&nbsp;bring that to the boil, strain it, reduce it, finely chop the soaked porcini and add them back to the pan.

<p>An argument about Rishi Sunak’s identity reveals how ideas of ethnicity and race have become conflated</p><p>‘They think they’re English because they’re born here. That means if a dog’s born in a stable it’s a horse.” That was a staple of the comedian Bernard Manning’s routine back in the 1970s. Enoch Powell had, a decade earlier, <a href="https://www.enochpowell.net/fr-83.html">expressed the same</a> sentiment in more refined language: “The West Indian or Asian does not, by being born in England, become an Englishman.

<p>Photographer Ewen Spencer captures the energy of a garage music night for working-class kids</p><p>Ewen Spencer took this picture at a Sunday club night called Twice As Nice at The End in London’s West Central Street in 1999. He’d been a regular there back in the days when it was held at the Colosseum in Vauxhall, south of the river. The move to the West End signalled that its garage music was becoming more a mainstream part of culture. Spencer, who grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne, had been documenting underground party nights for a decade by then for magazines such as the <em>Face</em> and <em>i-D</em>. He was a soul boy at heart, and saw in garage culture similar attractions: “It was working-class kids dressing up for a big night out,” he recalls, “quite different from acid house, for example.”</p><p>Spencer’s picture is included in a new Hayward Gallery touring exhibition <em>After the End of History: British Working Class Photography 1989-2024</em>.

<p>If you’ve got no time to make it to the salon, the latest leave-in hair treatments are the only answer</p><p>My hair is desperate for a salon treatment. But I have no time. In an ideal world, I want something I can use at home that gives me close to salon results. But it can’t take up too much time, because, well, no time. When I find myself in such situations – alas too often – a leave-in hair treatment is the answer. Leave-in conditioners are super easy; they seal in moisture without weighing down the hair and double up as a detangler, making hair easier to manage. But recent developments in the leave-in category mean it covers even more extensive hair needs. Ouai, Virtue, Aveda and Briogeo have serums for healthier scalps, thus promoting healthier hair. There are treatments to counteract hair thinning: Living Proof, Phillip Kingsley and The Ordinary all have serums that decrease shedding and increase density. For damaged, chemically (over) processed hair, you need a bonding tre
