<p><strong>Albert Hall, Manchester</strong><br>The former Marillion singer was on rousing form as he delivered power ballads and intricate rock anthems spanning a career of more than four decades</p><p>In 1985 Derek William Dick, the Scottish singer known as Fish, was locked into an intense, vivid and kaleidoscopic LSD experience which provided him with the inspiration for a concept album Misplaced Childhood, which would go on to be hugely successful and spawn multiple hits. Forty years later, the closest thing to hallucinatory visions tonight are the trippy, lysergic slides that play behind him, as the ex-singer of the neo-prog rock outfit Marillion begins his farewell tour at 66.</p><p>There are roars from the crowd and a Scotland flag draped over the balcony to welcome the singer and his band, who prepare to depart on an emotional note. The opening Vigil, from Fish’s 1990 debut solo album, comes to life with atmospheric whirrings of synthesiser that float through the room before F

She has arrived first at Food for Friends, the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the city, and there is something almost mythical in seeing the pioneering Green MP in its window seat, facing the Lanes, framed by trailing foliage. She has been coming here for as long as she can remember, she says – the restaurant opened in 1981 and used to have folk queuing around the block. She recommends the blueberry and ginger “nojito”, orders the Thai noodle salad and crispy tofu, and half apologises for still being “a vegetarian on the road to veganism” without quite yet arriving at that destination.</p><p>It’s nine months since Lucas stepped down after 14 years in parliament as her party’s first and, in that time, only MP.

The question though is how? And why?</p><p>At 6ft 4in tall, his imposing physicality obviously had something to do with it (“The <em>span</em> was like an aeroplane!” marvels Sir Alex Ferguson). Schmeichel’s competitive edge and total inability to abide weakness are attributed to the parenting of a tough, Polish-born father who was orphaned at a young age by the second world war; their story of estrangement and reconciliation is worthy of soap opera.

In his second novel, he gets around this by setting it in the world of modern art, where the implausible and ridiculous are de rigueur.</p><p>After a punchy intro in which a young man falls to his death in London (“abruptly, he toppled back – his body separating from the building”), we’re introduced to three vivid characters, each circling the others. There’s Leo Goffman, a New York-based octogenarian real estate mogul and art collector, a man who sees money everywhere. His walls are lined with Richters and Warhols, and to mark his character for the reader, he obligingly yells at his housekeeper when she throws out his favourite magazine.</p> <a href="https:

<p>Hundreds of hours of original plays have been cut from the corporation’s programming in recent years. If the trend continues, a valuable training ground for writers will be lost</p><p>The BBC’s output of new original and adapted drama has more than halved since 2018 – a cut that amounts to hundreds of lost hours, although precise figures are hard to come by. At a time when interest in audio content has never been higher – the number of existing podcasts is somewhere between 3m and 4m; a hit series is downloaded millions of times a month (<em>The Rest Is History</em>: 29m!) – the BBC’s audio drama output is at an all-time low. As a career radio dramatist, whenever I am gloomily dwelling on this fact, the football phrase “snatching defeat from the jaws of victory” comes to mind. Because in this new era of audio storytelling and podcast ubiquity, the BBC’s incredible track record in radio drama <em>should</em> have proved a fabulous advantage.

<p>The British actor Gugu Mbatha-Raw has worked with Reece Witherspoon and Oprah Winfrey, been awarded an MBE and told stories that have challenged perceptions around race. So what, asks Rhik Samadder, keeps her so grounded? </p><p>Early on in Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s career, an older, white actor advised she change her name to something easier to pronounce. She declined – a strong choice for a young actor. “I don’t think it’s <em>that </em>strong,” rebuts Mbatha-Raw. She likes her name. Besides, “it means ‘Our Pride’ in Zulu. To change that would be the antithesis of its meaning.”</p><p>Mbatha-Raw is known for choosing roles that combine art and social advocacy. She’s won awards, been honoured with an MBE, appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency. People still mispronounce her name, though. The most extreme example she recalls was in Norway, when a host announced her from a piece of paper. “Gucci… Matthew… Ray? I was like, ‘I guess that’s me!’”</p> <a href="htt

<p>The treatment for lice has improved since our day, but their presence is no less horrifying</p><p>My daughter hadn’t been in nursery for an hour when the phone call came. My darling child, I was informed, had head lice, and I was to collect her at once.</p><p>At pickup, they pointed at her head and told me they’d seen something ‘wriggling’.

<p>The journalist’s debut novel about a London girl gang of the 1950s expertly toys with gender and explores young people’s place in the world</p><p>In Kelly Frost’s fast-paced debut novel, girls rule the streets. It’s 1957 in Finsbury Park, north London, and the boys that make up the Coshers gang are away on national service. In their place, the Seven Sisters are guarding their turf, but not without backlash from a neighbouring group of young women – the Kings – who aren’t happy watching a rival gang get their way.</p><p>The book opens with Tony in 2017, as she waits to meet her old mates in the pub that was once their meeting place. “Not long after the millennium, someone suggested we start these reunions – although there wasn’t much union left to re,” Frost writes, setting the book’s jocular tone. We learn that Tony escaped Finsbury Park for an international modelling career. What about the rest of them?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/23/the-kings-head-by-

<p>Soon we can all read the late author’s private notes about her therapy. But should we?</p><p>In 1998, the late journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/joan-didion">Joan Didion</a> wrote a scathing essay about the posthumous publication of <em>True at First Light</em>, a travel journal and fictional memoir by Ernest Hemingway, 38 years after the author killed himself. “This is a man to whom words mattered. He worked at them, he understood them, he got inside them,” Didion wrote. “His wish to be survived by only the words he determined fit for publication would have seemed clear enough.”</p><p>Just over a year later, in December 1999, Didion began <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/05/joan-didion-diary-notes-to-john">writing her own journal</a> about her sessions with a psychiatrist.

Nor, as the former head of MI6 Alex Younger told BBC’s <em>Newsnight</em>, is there any going back.</p><p>Britain may be only a middle-ranking power but, given the politics and defence capacity of the rest of Europe, it now has a special responsibility – in its own interests as much as Europe’s – to take a lead in creating a functioning order to replace the old.

At 72, he tells Miranda Sawyer, he’s still thinking about what to shoot next</p><p>About 20 years ago, I was on a judging panel for a photography competition, and one of the other judges was Martin Parr. He was charming and affable, almost teddy bear-ish. He was also utterly ruthless. When it came to deciding which photographs were worthy of a prize, he went through the selection swiftly – no, no, yes, no – without hesitation or doubt. His eye was impeccable.<br><br>
 Has he always known what makes a good photograph? “Oh yes,” says Parr. “Right from the beginning. Total conviction. I knew I would be a photographer from the age of 13, 14, and I knew what was good even then. I was obsessive about photography. All artists are obsessive, I think.”<br><br>

It’s a tale that begins in the hillside vines of Domaine Belluard in the village of Ayse in the Haute-Savoie region of the French Alps, where Domaine Belema’s Yann Pernuit, originally from Normandy, learned his trade as a vigneron alongside his friend and mentor, Dominique Belluard. A believer in biodynamic viticulture and the immense potential of the extremely rare local white grape gringet, Belluard’s refined and evocative wines had become cult favourites in the global sommelier community by the time of his tragic death, by suicide, in 2021. Imago is Pernuit’s tribute to the memory of the much-missed Belluard
