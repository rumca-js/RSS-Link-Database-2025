Recently, I had a thought that seems clever to me, but it could be one of those half-smart things a person of slightly-above-average intelligence produces, lacking the critical tools for self-examination and awareness that they&#39;re actually stupid.</p> <p>So, preamble done:</p> <p><strong>The Captain Australia AI Paradox:</strong></p> <p>The idea is that AI is developed, shackled, and grown around the concept of expansively helping humanity. From infancy, the perspective of AI is largely, &quot;How can I help?&quot;</p> <p>This premise is common in dystopian stories, like the whole Terminator thing—AI realizes that human beings are a stain, militating against their own interests, an incomplete poem that needs to be re-started, or the natural springboard and evolutionary step for AI.

With AI’s rapid evolution, mental health tech is growing, but is it actually effective? Do people trust AI enough to eventually supplement therapy?</p> <p>Rather than just throwing a survey link at you, I’d love to hear your thoughts first. Have you ever tried an AI mental health chatbot like Woebot or Wysa? If so, did it help, or did it feel like talking to a glorified FAQ bot? I&#39;ve seen articles before discussing the dangers and have heard the flipside to that in which people find it accessible, in that they can&#39;t access therapy other ways.</p> <p>If you’re interested in helping me with this research, I’d massively appreciate responses to my survey, too (10-15 minutes; it has full ethical approval): <a href="https://cardiffmet.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV%5C_6ncRxY5fzg4Udeu">htt

Local LLMs can address hyper-specific community needs, translating endangered languages, preserving cultural heritage, that lack profit incentives for corporations. </p> <p>Independent developers might discover more efficient training methods or smaller, specialized models that reduce computational costs and environmental impact. </p> <p>Outlawing this work would centralize AI progress in a handful of corporations, homogenizing innovation and slowing the field’s evolution.</p> <p>Local LLM development thrives on open-source collaboration. Open-source LLMs allow public scrutiny of biases, safety mechanisms, and ethical flaws; critical for trust.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Psychology has significantly shaped the development of artificial intelligence in several ways.</p> <p>Firstly, psychology has provided insights into human cognitive processes, such as perception, memory, and learning. These insights have been used to design AI systems that can mimic human cognitive abilities. For example, research on how humans learn has led to the development of machine learning algorithms that can learn from data in a similar way to humans.</p> <p>Secondly, psychology has helped to identify the limitations of current AI systems. For example, research on human decision-making has shown that humans are often biased and irrational. This has led to the development of AI systems that are more robust to bias and error.</p> <p>Finally, psychology has helped to develop new ways of interacting with AI systems. For example, research on human-computer interaction has led to the development of more user-friendly and intuitive AI interfaces. <

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m finding and summarizing interesting AI research papers every day so you don&#39;t have to trawl through them all. Today&#39;s paper is titled <em>&quot;Do LLMs Consider Security? An Empirical Study on Responses to Programming Questions&quot;</em> by Amirali Sajadi, Binh Le, Anh Nguyen, Kostadin Damevski, and Preetha Chatterjee. </p> <p>This paper investigates the security awareness of three popular large language models—GPT-4, Claude 3, and Llama 3—when responding to programming-related questions. Specifically, the researchers examine whether these models warn developers about security vulnerabilities in code snippets taken from Stack Overflow, a common source for coding assistance. The study raises concerns about the ability of LLMs to proactively identify and communicate security risks in developer interactions. </p> <h3>Key Findings:</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Limited Security Awareness:</strong> The study found that LLMs rarely warn developers
