Since they are different providers I am trying to understand why I shouldn&#39;t max out all of the connections from both providers, 100/100 and 50/50. </p> <p>Information suggest that more connections equals to more overhead not necessary more speed, but based on that, what would be the sweet spot? </p> <p>Also, I have 1.5 Gb symmetric connection at the moment, I have been trying different numbers like 75/100 45/50 but in general I don&#39;t get stable speeds they can go from 60 MB/s to 135 MB/s up and down, I am just trying to have the best/reliable set up. </p> <p>Sorry, if I am not clea",
