Whereas a movie like Commando purposely hit you with funny one-liners, Stallone&#39;s sleepwalking expressions through this movie allows his one-liners to come across with a more serious intention. We learn absolutely nothing about Stallone&#39;s character other than the fact that he means business when taking out bad guys. And the main henchman in this flick, I swear was a bad guy in every other 80s and early 90s movie. At times, this movie reminded me of a horror version of Robocop. Looking it up, looks like it came out a year before Robo. There were some serious horror vibes in this movie, especially the hospital chase that reminded me of Halloween 2 with Michael Myers. C",

One of the kids has a special connection with nature and animals, able to communicate with them. They try to convey a message about how the world is being hurt by technology, with a key focus on a tree that symbolizes nature\u2019s power and connection to the world. The kids had Southeast Asian traditional golden necklaces that stacks up to make their neck look longer\u2014They also met this boy from America who had father in the government and they were trying to warn him about technology. Eventually the technology was taking over the planet and the special kid was able to communicate with this tree to tell others to unplug everything to help earth heal",

I&#39;ve read the complaints and I must agree, people who have seen the first two movies don&#39;t wonder if it&#39;s all real because they know they really have powers, and fans of the trilogy just find the end underwhelming.

Is the little blonde girl the same little blonde girl that took over Karolines apartment with her mom? I think it is. Why else would they cast two little girls with such memorable white blonde hair? I think the mother from the apartment gave her up (she did smack her across the face) because she didn&#39;t want her. Then Dagmar kept her because she wasn&#39;t an infant and could help her/keep her company. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Difficult_Regular779\"> /u/Difficult_Regular779 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ivxc5d/the_girl_with_the_needle/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ivxc5d/the_girl_with_the_needle/\">[comments]</a></span>",
