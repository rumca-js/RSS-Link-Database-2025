However, his laptop is ancient &amp; we\u2019d still like the portability of gaming when going on vacation.</p> <p>I\u2019m looking for recommendations for laptops he can put Linux on &amp; that can run FFXIV (his favorite game we currently play). He doesn\u2019t really play anything more intensive so I don\u2019t think the hardware specifications need to be too crazy.

I was in middle of actually shopping for some extra brand new USBs to replace my old ones when I encountered this for the first time. It looked like there were quite a good number of people on marketplace platforms like eBay and Mercari selling bootable USB flash drives with a Linux distro pre-installed on it. Majority of the ones I saw were Ubuntu (like what I had pictured) on there, but I also saw a good amount of ones with Kali and different versions of Linux Mint as well. </p> <p>Seems like you get the USB according to said listings with instructions on how to properly boot it or install it on your computer, and in some cases even provide contact information for support if needed. The prices on some of these are slightly in the higher side when compared to those I had screenshots of in the examples, and the sellers all had a large amount of sal",

It&#39;s a serious DE that will get out of your way like modern GNOME, but with the traditional and functional desktop metaphor. This leaves us with minor DE&#39;s such as Cinnamon, XFCE, Unity, LXQT and of course, MATE. Cinnamon is basically MATE but more modern. It uses GNOME apps by default, still, you can use MATE apps but Cinnamon feels right on par with GNOME apps, at least GTK3. XFCE is still arguably more modern than MATE, but the default looks are kinda bad, but you CAN customize it though. Both have little differences in performance but I&#39;d say MATE is getting a slight upper hand here. Unity is buggy and glitchy last time I tried it on Ubuntu 22.04, it was a pretty great DE but it&#39;s been falling apart lately. As for LXQt, I&#39;ve never used i",
