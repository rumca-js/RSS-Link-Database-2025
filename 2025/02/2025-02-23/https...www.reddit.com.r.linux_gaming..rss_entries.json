In Linux (Bazzite KDE, GE or bleeding edge), as soon as you get in game it rockets to 8GB, opening a menu or turning on subtitles pushes it just above 8GB to the point the game is unplayable stuttery as its swapping VRAM. No one on protondb seems to mention the issue, even those with older gen 8GB cards.. It reads like they are having a perfect experience. Lowest possible settings and textures don&#39;t make any difference, DX11 and DX12 also don&#39;t make a difference, it shoots right up to 8GB+ on world entry.</p> <p>So my question relates to ways to mitigate this. I assume this might come up in other titles too, I wouldn&#39;t be too knowledgeable as to why VRAM usage is considerably higher than Windows, nor launch commands in Linux.

I love this function, as it allows me to reduce/increase the volume of my game or chat. Very handy when you&#39;re chatting and suddenly the game music goes through the roof!</p> <p>I tried to install the Steelseries Engine software via Wine, without success. I switched to Lutris, which supports assisted and automatic installation of Engine, also without success. The software installs and starts, but the headset is not detected. </p> <p>Has anyone managed to get it to work? If not, do you know of any software that adds a kind of \u201cwidget\u201d to mix the computer volume so that I can manually manage the volume of my game/chat without having to go through the settin",

If someone wants to game on a budget, i tested it at 1440p but it will probably handle 1080p very nice (tweaking settings better than I did).<br/> Probably putting it in the right PCIE x16 would give even higher performance or using it without having video output coming from another GPU (I tested PCIE , I just love the VRAM and the performance for less than 200W). I think that, putting it to PCIE 3.0 x16, you would get performance similar to the AMD 6600XT, while having twice the VRAM.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsgZ8BrAppc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsgZ8BrAppc</a></p> <p>Now I have to try the actual intended use, pytorch :D<",
