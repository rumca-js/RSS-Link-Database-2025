        "description": "The new issue of White Drawf includes two new Combat Patrols: Imperial Knights and Chaos Knights - and I REALLY want to paint the Chaos Knights. They're sold out online of course, and my local shop is out as well, but I'll figure it out. We'll talk about what I want to do with them and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!\n\nVince Venturella and I made another game! Check out Deth Wizards - miniatures-agnostic necromantic skirmish combat at http://www.dethwizardsgame.com\n\nI'm a member of The Army Painter Factory Team - and I'm passing the savings on to you! Use code 'FactoryUncle5' at checkout to get 5% off of your entire order at http://www.thearmypainter.com or check my favorite Army Painter products at https://thearmypainter.com/tabletop-minions\n\nI'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions\n\nOfficial Tablet",
