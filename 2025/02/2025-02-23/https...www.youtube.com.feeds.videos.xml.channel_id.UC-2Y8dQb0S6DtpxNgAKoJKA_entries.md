Infinity Nikki version 1.3 [Eerie Season] will be available after the update on February 25 (UTC-7)! 

Miraland is under the spell of strange happeningsâ€”full moons lingering for days, Queen Philomi's Palace Ruins blooming with eerie purple flowers, and the once-mighty Bullquet now sluggish... Something dark lurks in the night. 
While most would steer clear of these eerie events near Queen Philomi's Palace Ruins, for brave adventurers, this is the perfect chance to seek thrills and uncover secrets.

Join Nikki and Momo after the update on February 25 (11pm PST) to explore the depths of Queen's Palace Ruins and uncover the mysteries!
