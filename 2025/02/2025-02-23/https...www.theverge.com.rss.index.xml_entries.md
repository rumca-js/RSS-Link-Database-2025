<p class="has-text-align-none">Grok, Elon Musk’s ChatGPT competitor, temporarily refused to respond with “sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation,” <a href="https://x.com/ibab/status/1893778039634563094">according to</a> xAI’s head of engineering, Igor Babuschkin. After Grok users noticed that the chatbot had been given instructions to not respond with those results, <a href="https://x.com/ibab/status/1893774017376485466">Babuschkin blamed</a> an unnamed, ex-OpenAI employee at xAI for updating Grok’s system prompt without approval.</p>
