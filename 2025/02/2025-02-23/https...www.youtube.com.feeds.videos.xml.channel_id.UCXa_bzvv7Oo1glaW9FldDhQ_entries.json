        "description": "When you're new to Monster Hunter, there's that enthusiasm and thrill for the hunt. As you progress from one entry to another, the dread grows with each conquered challenge. Which monster will be the one that traumatizes you next with its difficulty?\n\nIt may seem like hyperbole, but the series is renowned for its monster design and excruciating challenges that push even the most seasoned veterans to the limit. You have Elder Dragons like Fatalis in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne with its world-ending damage, Alatreon with its elemental requirements, and the Hyper and Deviant monsters from Generations Ultimate. And whatever you do, don't mess with the single-horned Diablos in Freedom Unite.\n\nThe sheer range and breadth of rage-inducing monsters are terrifying, but who deserves the crown? Who is the toughest in the franchise, and which ones deserve a mention? Find out here.",

        "description": "We get plenty of Soulslikes these days, which means it takes something really special for a game to stand out in a genre, if you\u2019re not a FromSoftware game- something like Lies of P or Black Myth: Wukong. \n\nWhether or not The First Berserker will similarly widely well received remains to be seen, but in all that we have seen of it so far, Neople and Nexon's action RPG has looked quite impressive. In particular, it's the game's promise of a hardcore action RPG experience that has turned so many heads. \n\nFrom brutal combat and gruelling boss fights to its emphasis placed on progression and customization, there's plenty of promises that The First Berserker: Khazan has made in the lead-up to its release that genre fans should be excited about.",
