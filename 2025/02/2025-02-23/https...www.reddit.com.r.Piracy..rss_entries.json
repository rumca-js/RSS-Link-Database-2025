I already know how to play a copy-protected EXE by using a batch file that mounts an image and then runs the game, but I want to save additionally on space (and on time, even if it&#39;s a little, but it adds up over time) by forgoing the use of mounted images altogether, yet I haven&#39;t been able to find decryption mechanisms when using various older programs to write a new CD image. I may be wrong, but they seem to rely on the user having an actual CD reader/writer present on the PC, which it&#39;s not, given how modern mine is. I want the same for games released at that time and in the 2000s on DVDs. Is there a way to do that?</p> <p>Also, could it happen that official patches released later for those games may fail to execute or woul",
