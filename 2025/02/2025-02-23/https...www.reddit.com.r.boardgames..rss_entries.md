This meta of playing bad cards began to develop and it was working very well. Made the game not fun for obvious reasons. Before this meta uncovered everyone really tried to convince you they werent the conspirator and that was fun! But it doesnt seem like the game encourages that. I feel like Im missing something because its such a huge flaw in the game. I&#39;m Considering house ruling that for every person that choses you when you are NOT the conspirator you lose a point. That way there are stakes and you really want to do a good job of convincing people that you are not the conspirator. Would make much higher tension.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/0rphan_crippler20"> /u/0rphan_crippler20 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.co

Colonizing worlds for resources would be cool too, though battle is preferable. I remember playing a game in high school that mostly consisted of color-coded cards (red, blue and green I think) that was kind of like this, though I can&#39;t remember the name of it for the life of me, and any suggestions in the genre are fine.</p> <p>Second, a good racing game. I want to rip around a track and try to outrace the competition. I know of pretty much no games in the genre besides Raceway 57, which I enjoyed as a kid.</p> <p>Thanks for your suggestions!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LokiOfZygarde"> /u/LokiOfZygarde </a> <br/> <s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I remember playing this pirate themed board game back in around 2012. It was 4 players max and each player controlled a ship on the board. The board was a grid that resembled the seas and had trade winds? To move your ships you rolled two dice. For example, if I rolled 1 6, that means I can move 1 square in any direction and then 6 squares in any other direction. Iirc the goal of the game was to get booty and bring it back to your own cove? When a player has booty all the other players try to intercept that players ship to “sink” the ship and steal the booty? I was checking BGG and I thought I found it but didn’t seem right. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OutsideSuitable5740"> /u/OutsideSuitable5740 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1iw47fc/help_with_name_of_the_boardgame/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1

I love that film to death and there&#39;s a very relatable board game moment in the movie and it may be the only moment where I side with Carell&#39;s character, who is a perfectly hateable antagonist. Carell, Collette&#39;s character and her kids are playing Candy Land. Collette draws a color that allows her to move past a shortcut on the board, but she takes the shortcut anyway. Carell challenges her that you can only take the shortcut when you land exactly on the space that begins the shortcut. The tension in the room escalates and Collete storms out exclaiming through tears, &quot;It&#39;s f*****g Candy Land, Trent!&quot; Truthfully she&#39;s upset because she suspects he is cheating on her, so it was never really about the game, but every time I watch that scene, I&#39;m like, &quot;The man has a point...&quot; Any other

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello,</p> <p>I consider all of the board games sitting on my shelfs to be a part of the &quot;social entertainment&quot;. I have a high preference for games that require interaction between people. I don&#39;t mean that I will not enjoy solitairing, but I would rather have more socializing if given a choice, otherwise I can always play a video game (solo/multiplayer).</p> <p>Recent reorganization in the apt that involved relocation and shortly after &quot;analyzing&quot; and culling of my collection, reignited my interest in updating my collection.</p> <p>Given my restrictive approach to the size of my board game collection... and my &quot;unrestrictive&quot; approach to digitals, I have recently bought a few games on Steam - Root, Scythe and Spirit Island (on sale of course). I already had some other titles for a while, like Ticket to Ride.</p> <p>FYI I started with Root, and still wrapping my way around it.</p> <p>So, I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m

Shown here is a drawer I made to hold the large faction sheet for Twilight Imperium, plus the Prophecy of Kings expansion&#39;s sheet. Underneath the drawer slides open to reveal compartments for organizing your ships and for holding your cards and tokens. The outer Lego drawer is studless. I love Lego, but I abhor the studs. </p> <p>Fans of TI can appreciate how busy one&#39;s table, and plethora side tables can quickly clutter up the gaming room. This, I believe, is an elegant DIY solution.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Back before Twitter went shit, I had a feed that was almost exclusively boardgame content. Some was content creators linking their latest video or review (which I found valuable as a surrogate RSS feed), some was genuine discussion, some was just people posting photos or whatever. I stopped using Twitter when it banned 3rd party apps.</p> <p>I find myself missing that lately. Is Bluesky something that could fill that hole? Does anyone have anything (platform or individual accounts) they can recommend?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ax0r"> /u/ax0r </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ivxaxn/boardgame_social_media_outside_of_fb_and_xitter/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ivxaxn/boardgame_social_media_outside_of_fb_and_xitter/">[comments]</a></span>
