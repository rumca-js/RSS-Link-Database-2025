<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Last night, I told my dad that I&#39;m a crossdresser. That&#39;s not entirely true, as I&#39;m also a trans girl. I plan on transitioning in college (which is only a few months away right now!), but in the meantime, I crossdress to help relieve my gender dysphoria. My favorite outfit - which I&#39;m wearing right now - is a pair of pink flared leggings with a black puffer jacket, white spaghetti strap, and rainbow tutu.</p> <p>I&#39;ve gotten tired of hiding this fact from my dad, so I told him last night. I was nervous and scared the whole time, but he took it well. He didn&#39;t seem upset or disappointed - he respected it and left me feeling accepted. To celebrate, I bought a golden choker with stars, a white blouse, a white and blue petticoat, and purple tutu on Amazon. They&#39;re arriving on Tuesday and I am so, so excited!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DearMyFutureSelf"> /u/DearMyFuture

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>recently I was talking with my dad at the table and he told me that because im an only child I had to have children and that he was sorry for that. He doesnt know im a lesbian and that really hit me. They think I&#39;ll be having kids in my 20&#39;s and other things (even though im not even finished with highschool). I don&#39;t know how to cope with the fact all my plans for my future have really just crumbled and ive never felt guiltier for being a lesbian than now. i&#39;ll never be able to bring myself to marry a woman or spend the rest of my life with one after hearing those words come out of my dads mouth, i dont know what to do</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/LiaisntLia"> /u/LiaisntLia </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ivx1fi/does_anyone_else_experience_lgbtq_guilt/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1ivx1fi/does_a
