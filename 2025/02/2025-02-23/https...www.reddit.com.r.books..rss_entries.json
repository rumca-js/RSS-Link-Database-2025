The issue of translation didn&#39;t even occur to me because I just wanted to read the book, with my Mom getting me the Barnes and Noble Hardcover version from 2011. Unfortunately, I had to put it down so I could focus more on school, stopping only after reading about 70 pages. Well, I have recently been doing more research and found that the translation for the version I have is most likely the Chapman- Hall one from 1846. This distressed me a bit because from what I have read the Robin Buss translation by Penguin is considered the best one. </p> <p>While a part of me wants to buy the Robin Buss translation because that is considered the best translation to read, I also don&#39;t want to disregard the copy I already have since it was a gift, and is also one of the better looking books I own. Not to mention that my slight OCD can&#39;t handle having two versions",
