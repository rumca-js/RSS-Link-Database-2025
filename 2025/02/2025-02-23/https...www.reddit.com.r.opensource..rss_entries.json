Requires a muscular PC to run, since the whole terminal is updated 60 times a second. I have currently got into a phase, where it has on top of normal pong mechanics, a multiplayer over network feature and a few game enchancing features such as boosting. I would like to see the pong get a TON of features from different kind of developer personalities. The game has currently also a JSON file to configure all the settings for the game. Therefore it opens endless possibilities to turn on and off features and tweak values. In my opinion it is a VERY fun game, and it has competitive nature, so it could grow even a small community around it. If you are interested, go check ",
