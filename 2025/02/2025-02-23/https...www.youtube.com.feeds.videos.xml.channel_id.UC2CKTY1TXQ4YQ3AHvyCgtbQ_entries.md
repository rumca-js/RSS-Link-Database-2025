The new issue of White Drawf includes two new Combat Patrols: Imperial Knights and Chaos Knights - and I REALLY want to paint the Chaos Knights. They're sold out online of course, and my local shop is out as well, but I'll figure it out. We'll talk about what I want to do with them and of course, I'll answer your wargaming-related questions. Come have fun!

I'm now a partner on Twitch! I paint minis every Friday morning and Monday night, and sometimes take paint breaks (play video games poorly). Follow me: http://www.twitch.tv/tabletopminions
