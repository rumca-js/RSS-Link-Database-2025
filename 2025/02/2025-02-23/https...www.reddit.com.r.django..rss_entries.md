<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m working on a web app using Django and Celery, with PostgreSQL as the backend. I recently deployed the app and Celery workers on Kubernetes but encountered a strange issue. Some specific tasks are being duplicated in the forked workers, each with different task IDs.</p> <p>For example, I have a task that triggers a DAG in Airflow, but I noticed that the DAG is being triggered twice. I&#39;ve searched around for solutions to this problem but haven&#39;t found anything that addresses it directly.</p> <p>Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any ideas on what might be causing this or how to fix it?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Miserable_Law3272"> /u/Miserable_Law3272 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1iwno0q/celery_task_execution_duplication_running_on_k8s/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.redd

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to create a complicated form set up that has the user authenticate with google as part of the steps to the form.</p> <p>I&#39;m currently using django-formtools library and what I want is:</p> <ol> <li>User fills out data in form 1 </li> <li>Based on data filled in form 1, have them authenticate with google on step 2. </li> <li>Once authentication is done, redirect them back to the form, but on to the next step.</li> </ol> <p>I&#39;m currently using the SessionWizardView, but what is happening is that after Google auth is done, it redirects back to the form page but its back on Step 1 of the form, and not the correct 3rd step that I would want it to be on, and it doesn&#39;t seem to have record of what the user has already submitted. </p> <p>Is there a better way to do this without using the django-formtools library? Seemed like a match for the workflow I want, but I need a way to get back in the form flow after the redirect is done. </p>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi <a href="/r/django">r/django</a>!</p> <p>A group of friends and I built a platform to share, search and find blogs and independent websites. We have discussion features, a newsfeed and a very rudimentary profile. </p> <p>We have a Django backend with a React frontend. Our database is Postgres. </p> <p>The issue we are running into is the deployed site is very laggy and slow. One of our developers thinks it has to do with the Django Rest Framework serializers we are using on the backend but none of us are experienced enough in Django to know. We are using pagination for our api calls.</p> <p>What are the best ways of figuring out if the way we are handling serializers is the issue? If this is the problem, what is the best way to optimize performance?</p> <p>Anyone have any ideas?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tired of coding CRUD endpoints over and over?</p> <p>Recently, I faced this challenge at work—spending too much time writing CRUD APIs for quick tests. A colleague suggested automated routes, which led us to build a fully customizable tool in Node.js. That experience inspired me to create something similar for Django, and thus, <strong>Lazy Ninja</strong> was born</p> <p>Lazy Ninja automates API generation for all your Django models, eliminating repetitive CRUD work. With just a few lines of code, you get:</p> <ul> <li>Auto-generated endpoints &amp; schemas</li> <li>Custom hooks to tweak route behavior</li> <li>Schema customization for specific models</li> <li>Interactive OpenAPI docs (powered by Django Ninja)</li> <li>Simple config to include/exclude models</li> </ul> <p>It&#39;s still in early stages, and I&#39;m looking for feedback to refine it further.</p> <p>Check it out on GitHub along with the installation instructions: <a href="https://githu
