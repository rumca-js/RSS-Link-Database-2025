<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all! I’m looking to buy a budget friendly gaming laptop for my husband for his birthday. He uses Linux on all his devices but I’m not super familiar with it yet. My only experience so far has been my steam deck &amp; he has stated he doesn’t want one at this time. However, his laptop is ancient &amp; we’d still like the portability of gaming when going on vacation.</p> <p>I’m looking for recommendations for laptops he can put Linux on &amp; that can run FFXIV (his favorite game we currently play). He doesn’t really play anything more intensive so I don’t think the hardware specifications need to be too crazy. I’m looking to spend under 1000 &amp; if possible somewhere between 400-600.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/littlebeeX0"> /u/littlebeeX0 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1iwkfdc/budget_friendly_gaming_laptop/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https:

I think it was early 90,s when my journey began but back then I was also running a garage and relied somewhat on AutoData for accounts and pricing jobs so I was forced to use MS at that point.<br/> I will be honest since 2005 after i stooped working at the Garage I have done my fair share of Distro hopping, I think I have tried most distros and some were suitable and others were just not for me.<br/> I have always maintained that there is no hard and fast rule to what distro you choose and why you like it or rather why it works for you.<br/> In that case the distro that makes your life easy and is productive is always the one for you.<br/> I thought Debian was my chosen one recently until I bought my new / used laptop<br/> The Dell ( The one I am on now ) did not like Debian on UEFI but would work fine on legacy boot.I was a bit peed of with this and believe me I have tried numerous Bios settings to try an

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recent dramas involving some developers and the Fedora Project have raised important questions about application distribution, especially with regard to Flatpaks. Topics discussed include the importance of close collaboration between upstream and downstream, the security and control of Flatpak repositories, and the need for transparency and accountability in the maintenance of these repositories. However, one point that cannot go unnoticed is the democratization of these repositories, especially with regard to their creation and maintenance.</p> <p>One of the suggestions made to the Fedora Project was to completely close its Flatpak repositories. While it is acknowledged that there are serious problems with these repositories, this measure seems extreme and anti-competitive. It goes against the spirit of Flatpak (unlike similar <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">solutions</a>), which seeks to facilitate the distribution of software universally, and also

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Admittedly someone who&#39;s relatively newer to the Linux space, so please bear with my question here. I was in middle of actually shopping for some extra brand new USBs to replace my old ones when I encountered this for the first time. It looked like there were quite a good number of people on marketplace platforms like eBay and Mercari selling bootable USB flash drives with a Linux distro pre-installed on it. Majority of the ones I saw were Ubuntu (like what I had pictured) on there, but I also saw a good amount of ones with Kali and different versions of Linux Mint as well. </p> <p>Seems like you get the USB according to said listings with instructions on how to properly boot it or install it on your computer, and in some cases even provide contact information for support if needed. The prices on some of these are slightly in the higher side when compared to those I had screenshots of in the examples, and the sellers all had a large amount of sal

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>DISCLAIMER: This is my opinion.</p> <p><strong>How it competes against other desktops:</strong> It&#39;s not as flashy as GNOME or KDE, not limiting like GNOME yet not overpowered like Plasma. It&#39;s a serious DE that will get out of your way like modern GNOME, but with the traditional and functional desktop metaphor. This leaves us with minor DE&#39;s such as Cinnamon, XFCE, Unity, LXQT and of course, MATE. Cinnamon is basically MATE but more modern. It uses GNOME apps by default, still, you can use MATE apps but Cinnamon feels right on par with GNOME apps, at least GTK3. XFCE is still arguably more modern than MATE, but the default looks are kinda bad, but you CAN customize it though. Both have little differences in performance but I&#39;d say MATE is getting a slight upper hand here. Unity is buggy and glitchy last time I tried it on Ubuntu 22.04, it was a pretty great DE but it&#39;s been falling apart lately. As for LXQt, I&#39;ve never used i
