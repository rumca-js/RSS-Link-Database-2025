The plan all along was to create a highly addictive environment where people without any background can learn quantum the same way you learn the name of the fish you catch in Subnautica. It feels like a Zachtronics game and is as complex as Turing Complete. The reviews are excellent so far and we are growing our community on Discord. </p> <p>I&#39;m bad at marketing, sorry if I don&#39;t do it justice. Check our Steam page for more and why not go and buy it. Your $ goes into supporting this unique project grow, we are pretty bootstrapped rn.
