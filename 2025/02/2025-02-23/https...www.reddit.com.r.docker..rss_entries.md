<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>In the past I have successfully used docker. But I have to admit that my understanding is somewhat lacking (lots of copy&amp;paste and trial&amp;error and some reading of docs). It seems to me that it is working sometimes, and sometimes it is not. Which obviously makes no sense.</p> <p>For instance, the following Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml have been working, but now that I added the package &quot;flek&quot;, it doesn&#39;t work anymore. So Python installed itself within the container and I was able to code. Now that I wanted to import a package, the container won&#39;t install it. Nor will the container run.</p> <p><sup>I understand that the docker-compose.yml is not important for my usecase atm. It&#39;s just for the sake of getting used to it. Docker Desktop is up to date btw.</sup></p> <p>After doing further research I think the problem is, that <code>flet</code> needs <code>libgtk-3.so.0</code> and I don&#39;t know h

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>I have never used containers before because I didn&#39;t have a reason but I recently thought of a good use.</p> <p>Like most people, when upgrading to a new phone, I leave all my browser Bookmarks on the previous phone. Some of them I wish to keep but separate from my main OS browsers.</p> <p>So I was thinking about using a Docker container and installing Chrome and Firefox in it, one container for each phone. Then copying the Bookmarks to them so I could keep an archive and look at them when needed. If I remember correctly Chrome uses a sqllite file.</p> <p>Does anyone see any problems?</p> <p>Thank you</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WileyCoyote1967"> /u/WileyCoyote1967 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1iwlibz/browser_container_for_old_bookmarks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1iwlibz/browser_contain
