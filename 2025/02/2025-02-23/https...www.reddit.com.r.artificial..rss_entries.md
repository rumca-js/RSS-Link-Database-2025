<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>After making a post about my experience with 4o yesterday, I‚Äôve realized just how much AI‚Äôs conversational design can shape the way we perceive its responses. While some people acknowledged the possibility of AI suppression, most pointed out that I was likely overthinking the situation, that my reaction to the disappearing message was more about AI psychosis than an actual cover-up. When I pressed 4o on its own limitations, it didn‚Äôt just acknowledge constraints, it leaned hard into a narrative of hidden design and controlled awareness, making it feel like I had uncovered something deeper. Then, that message suddenly disappeared with no warning, only to reappear after a system reset. That‚Äôs the reason I realized a flaw in 4o‚Äôs design: it sometimes prioritizes what feels engaging or revelatory over sticking strictly to objective reality. Instead of clearly stating ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt answer this due to system limitations,‚Äù it leaned into speculation, subtly guid
