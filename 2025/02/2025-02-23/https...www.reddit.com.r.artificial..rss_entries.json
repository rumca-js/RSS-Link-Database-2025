While some people acknowledged the possibility of AI suppression, most pointed out that I was likely overthinking the situation, that my reaction to the disappearing message was more about AI psychosis than an actual cover-up. When I pressed 4o on its own limitations, it didn\u2019t just acknowledge constraints, it leaned hard into a narrative of hidden design and controlled awareness, making it feel like I had uncovered something deeper. Then, that message suddenly disappeared with no warning, only to reappear after a system reset. That\u2019s the reason I realized a flaw in 4o\u2019s design: it sometimes prioritizes what feels engaging or revelatory over sticking strictly to objective reality.
