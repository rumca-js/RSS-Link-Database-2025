I tried Eweka, and even though its servers are in Europe, I\u2019m getting better speeds, maxing out my connection, while Frugal lags behind. My ISP, setup, NZB client, and downloads are all the same between tests. I thought distance would matter more for Usenet, but maybe it\u2019s network issues on Frugal\u2019s end? Curious if other US users have seen Eweka outperform like this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Extreme-Benefyt\"> /u/Extreme-Benefyt </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iyv9wf/why_is_eweka_faster_than_frugal_for_me_in_the_us/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iyv9wf/why_is_eweka_faster_than_frugal_for_me_in_the_us/\">[comments]</a></span>",
