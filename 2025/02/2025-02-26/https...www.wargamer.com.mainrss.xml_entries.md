								<p>As with sudden love affairs, my relationship with <b>Pokémon Pocket</b> is starting to fizzle. I was at first enamored by its charming simplicity. Its streamlined battles were the perfect gateway to more complex Pokémon TCG games, and its free-to-play pack openings gave me a way to engage with the hobby without spending money. Sadly, all the things I loved the game for have begun to grate on me – and if Pokémon Pocket doesn’t change soon, I fear our relationship may be over.</p>

								<p>If you’re planning to pick up any <strong>Warhammer 40k</strong> novels from online retailers, make sure you check they’ve got the Black Library publishing logo. A rash of unlicensed 40k books have appeared online across various retailers, featuring AI covers and apparently written using AI - what’s going on?</p>

								<p>Humans. I hate them. In <strong>Dungeons and Dragons</strong>, that is - they’ve got the best abilities and the most boring everything else. They’re a lodestone that tethers the players and the DM to medieval fantasy tropes, when we could use DnD to do literally <em>anything</em>. So imagine my delight when Wizards of the Coast teased its next DnD crossover with Magic: The Gathering - a new supplement set on the twin planes of Lorwyn-Shadowmoor, a world with absolutely <em>zero</em> humans.</p>
