So sorry for the long and probably useless post.</p> <p>I used Slackware Linux as my main OS back when I was in my teens and 20&#39;s, I stopped because I wanted to play games and drink beer and Windows was easier. I later ended up becoming a Windows SysAdmin for over a decade and leaned in heavy into PowerShell (which I still love and prefer). So I know my way around Windows, I was always able to roughly lock down and customize Windows to what I prefer. Ever since I only used Linux as a tool more than a desktop OS. After the news of Recall I set myself out to build a new custom Linux PC, because no fucking way I want my shit near that, and this weekend I migrated over.</p> <p>I can now say it&#39;s now become easier to configure Linux than it is to continuously update and modify my system after Microsoft decides they what to change things, like moving my shit",
