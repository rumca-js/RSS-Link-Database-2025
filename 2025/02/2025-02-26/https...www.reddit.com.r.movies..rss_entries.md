<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As a child, I adored this movie, and upon rewatching it last Sunday, I found it even more hilarious than I remembered.</p> <p>This time, the famous Gauls embark on a new adventure in Egypt, tasked with helping an architect construct a grand palace for Cleopatra who was in a dick mesuring contest with Cesar—in just three months. Naturally, their mission is far from simple, as adversaries lurk in the shadows, ready to thwart their efforts.</p> <p>What makes this film truly exceptional is its relentless humor, with an impressive density of jokes per minute. The clever wordplay in the characters&#39; names—Numérobis, Amonbofis, Itineris, Feudartifis, Antivirus—adds a layer of wit, while the visual comedy is equally remarkable. The inventive animated sequence set in total darkness, the martial arts-inspired fight between Jamel Debbouze and Gérard Darmon, and the slow-motion chase of a Roman soldier by Idéfix are just a few examples of the film’s brilliant

As usual, he knocked it out of the park, and it made me reflect on how he is easily one of the best character actors of my generation (I&#39;m Gen X and I&#39;m 5 years younger than him). </p> <p>Boardwalk Empire, American Hustle, Perry Mason, Wristcutters: A Love Story, True Detective...he can do no wrong in my book. Looking forward to seeing him in the final Mission Impossible film. </p> <p>What are some of your fave roles of his? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/king_of_the_rotten"> /u/king_of_the_rotten </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iz00y2/shea_whigham_appreciation_post/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1iz00y2/shea_whigham_appreciation_post/">[comments]</a></span>

A Ghost Story is ofc the most perfect example. Calm, moving, pulls you in. Well atleast me. Ammonite, loved the surroundings and overall a fan of Kate and Saoirse, and so I also loved The Outrun. I would love some recs for more movies like this. I&#39;ve seen quite a few of the &quot;real life movies&quot; already, The Straight Story, Wild, you know the drill. The first ones I mentioned have a bit of a gloomy feel about them. Calm, gloomy, real people. Yes, a sheet with holes is a person in my universe.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished watching <em>Up in the Air</em>, and I’m completely overwhelmed. I initially thought the film was glorifying corporate culture, but as it unfolded, it revealed a much deeper commentary on its toxicity—both for those who enforce it and those who suffer from it. I loved how it emphasized the importance of human connection. </p> <p>One thing that stood out to me was the contrast between Clooney’s and Kendrick’s characters. He’s a loner who avoids attachment yet insists on conducting layoffs face-to-face (perhaps because it allows him to keep traveling). Meanwhile, she values connection but prefers to handle things remotely, through a screen. It almost feels like the movie is making contradictory points. </p> <p>And Vera’s character—that completely took me out. I still don’t know how to process that revelation.</p> <p>Idk if anyone else has seen this movie. It was released in 2009, and Im just seeing it NOW! How’d I miss it? What do you g

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Tom Cruise seems to be winding down his death-defying era, if the rumors around MI:9 being the last one with Ethan Hunt are true. But I don&#39;t think hanging off cliffs or holding his breath for 10 mintues are his true forte. </p> <p>For me, Cruise&#39;s best roles have always been men who are deeply broken and fight vigorously and belligerently to deny that reality. Collateral, Magnolia, Minority Report, Eyes Wide Shut, War of the Worlds, all of these performances, I find to be the most compelling in his career, because they all carry that contradiction of an emotionally and psychologically broken and stunted man, fighting vigorously to maintain a facade of having it together.</p> <p>If Cruise is hanging up the parachutes and helicopters for good, now, I think he should look past Xenu and revive that Seminarian guilt, and maybe finally get that Oscar.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Somnambuli

## Some Personal Thoughts About My Favorite Movie: Memento (2000) by Christopher Nolan

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just saw a really good <a href="https://youtu.be/g3hQaX5S8-w?si=Rv7GFOUwDns3hhCX">video</a> about Memento which finally gets into something I find deeply resonating about the film. People often talk about the premise and specifically the tragedy of Leonard forgetting and manipulating himself but I also always thought that it served as an examination about how we interpret art in a way. Leonard is quite literally shifting his own information and using his condition to essential information that may contradict his purpose to kill this guy when either he has already done so long or he never got the guy in the first place. Notice how Leonard always keeps himself motivated by the fact that his wife was killed by the robbers and also reminds himself of his identity and purpose through Sammy, someone who is revealed to be a con man. It gives him something bigger, correlative to what he should do with himself. To make his goal the correct one to strive for

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I really like the movie, I think it does a good job translating some very challenging source material. It’s got its flaws, but I think overall it’s an entertaining movie.</p> <p>I do see a lot of people claim it misses the point of the book, specifically in how the heroes are portrayed, but I think that’s a little unfair.</p> <p>In my opinion, the heroes are still very much portrayed as incredibly flawed individuals. Rorschach is still a homophobic psychopath (I’ve seen a lot of people say that was cut out of the movie, but he definitely still says bigoted stuff), the Comedian is still a douche, Dr Manhattan is increasingly apathetic, and Nite Owl has to fight crime just to get hard rather than out of the goodness of his heart.</p> <p>I think a lot of it comes down to how people perceive Snyders style in the movie. The main argument is that the way he frames action and the camera makes the heroes look too badass. I can kind of see that criticism,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I love these two movies by Claude Berri, which were filmed back to back and both came out in the same year. </p> <p>Adapted from the two-part novel by Marcel Pagnol, <em>Manon des Sources</em>, the overall narrative is about how Ugolin (Daniel Auteil) and his uncle, César (Yves Montand), conspire against a family, led by Jean (de Florette) (Gerard Depardiu), who own the land they want, so they purposefully take advantage of Jean&#39;s ignorance to make his and family harder so he&#39;d end up quitting and selling it back to César but things take a turn into tragic circumstances. </p> <p>First, the music by Jean-Claude Petit is gorgeous and iconic, it&#39;s sad and weirdly cheerful at the same time, like the usage of Verdi as well, and the characters are well-drawn and not entirely one-dimensional. César&#39;s greed turns him into a cold psychopath but by the second movie, he&#39;s more human and you see that as dismissive as he is about Ugolin, he do

## Apparent Plagiarism in Non-Stop (2014) Starring Liam Neeson

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few years ago when I watched Non-Stop (2014) starring Liam Neeson, the plot seemed very familiar to me. Then I realized that it was almost a clone of one of the episodes of John Doe, a decent TV series from 2002 which was sadly cancelled after just one season. Here were some of the commonalities:</p> <ul> <li>The entire story takes place on a long flight between Europe and an eastern American city.</li> <li>Someone on the flight is a murderer and begins killing passengers one by one.</li> <li>A metal spike coated with poison is used as the weapon for one of the murders.</li> <li>The main character is a law-enforcer in Non-Stop, and a police-consultant in John Doe. He goes around the plane trying to locate the passenger who is secretly the murderer.</li> <li>A programmer (in Non-Stop) or engineer (in John Doe) uses his technical skills to help the main character find the murderer.</li> <li>At one point, the passengers suspect that the main character

## THEORY: The little girl that Garland Greene plays with in Con Air is a ghost

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In Con Air, there’s a really weird scene where Garland Greene, the creepy serial killer, sits down to have tea with a little girl at an airstrip. At first, it seems like maybe this is a turning point for him, like he’s showing he’s not all bad. But if you look closer, something feels off. No one else ever interacts with the girl—she’s only ever seen with Garland. In a movie full of loud, chaotic characters, she’s this strangely quiet, almost ghostly presence. And where are her parents? If she were a real kid, wouldn’t there be an adult around keeping an eye on her?</p> <p>Then there’s the setting itself. The airstrip has a trailer park, but it’s completely deserted. No adults, no movement, nothing. The whole place feels weirdly empty, like it’s frozen in time. And the girl doesn’t act like a normal child would—she’s way too calm, even though she’s sitting across from a guy known for wearing people’s heads as hats. It’s almost like she doesn’t belong

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Little Giants was my favorite children&#39;s sport film in the 1990s. Most children&#39;s film involving sports were usually focused on boys, be it The Mighty Ducks or Rookie of the Year or The Big Green, yet when Little Giants came out, I was struck by Becky (Icebox)&#39;s character, a girl who&#39;s great at playing football yet gets passed over for a position in the team because she&#39;s a girl, so her dad, Danny O&#39;Shea (Rick Moranis), decides to create a team of outsiders, including his daughter, who gradually become rivals against the team his older brother, Kevin (Ed O&#39;Neil), created. </p> <p>I enjoyed Little Giants, it&#39;s empowering for girls without being &quot;in your face&quot; about it, you can&#39;t go wrong with Rick Moranis and Ed O&#39;Neil as squabbling brothers, it gives you the agreeable entertainment of the genre and a positive message about inclusion. </p> <p>A film worth recommending for families.
