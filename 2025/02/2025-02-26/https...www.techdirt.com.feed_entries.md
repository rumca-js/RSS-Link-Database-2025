Every day Donald Trump seems to implement yet another of the key schemes of Project 2025, despite claiming last summer that “I know nothing about Project 2025.” According to the Project 2025 Web site, it is organized by the Heritage Foundation, which is also working on what it calls its “Oversight Project”: The Oversight Project [&#8230;]

California taxpayers are now on the hook for $345,576 in legal fees to… Elon Musk. Why? Because Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta ignored warnings about the obvious Constitutional problems with AB 587, their social media &#8220;transparency&#8221; law. The law, which Google and Meta actually supported (knowing full well that they could comply [&#8230;]

This stupid state. These stupid legislators. This goddamn constituency. This is my current home state. And it is painful to be here. Kristi Noem is now the head of the DHS, presumably because she never asked what this country could do for her, but instead asked &#8220;what can I do for Donald Trump?&#8221; She kept [&#8230;]

At least when he isn&#8217;t busy attacking FCC civil rights reforms or dismantling whatever&#8217;s left of [&#8230;]
