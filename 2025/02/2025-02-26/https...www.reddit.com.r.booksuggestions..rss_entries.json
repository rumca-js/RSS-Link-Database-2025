I&#39;ve been very interested and curious about fantasy books in the past, I&#39;ve read a lot of them and I love fantasy universes. But nowadays I&#39;m really interested in Stephen King and I finished his book Carrie; it was a really beautiful and well written book. When I did research, people recommended the Dark Tower series a lot, I would be happy to hear if you have other suggestions.</p> <p>note: I have seen The Shining, It, The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption on the big screen, but Kubrick is my favorite director.

I have access to lots of 40K and Battletech ebooks from Humble but there&#39;s so many I don&#39;t know where to start. Enjoyed- Hitchhikers, Dune 1-3, Hobbit, LotR, Enders Game, Brave New World, F451, Ready Player 1, SW- Rise of Darth Vader Meh- Hunger Games and HP were fine but got annoyed with some characters and choices.

The characters\u2019 stories interconnect as they grow from childhood through to old age. The reader gets a sense of how people lived their lives and how everyday things were once accomplished. The ambitions and aspirations of the diverse array of characters are explored in depth; each with a sense of personality. Their stories are both fantastic and tragic; thrilling and full of sorrow; enthralling and profound; heartbreaking and regretful. Ken Follet takes his readers on a journey of both scandal and humility in a novel that touches to the core of human achievement. Pillars of The Earth is master stroke of triumph.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/JollyDefinition9786\"> /u/JollyDefinition9786 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iyibop/pillars_of_the_earth_by_ken_follet/\">[link]",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m looking for any books about two women falling in love. Could be YA, contemporary, fantasy, sci-fi, historical, mature, etc. My one request is that it&#39;s not the sugary-sweet, PSA-style that seems to be really popular right now among queer fiction. I want the characters to be interesting and the love story compelling. </p> <p>My favorite book series (with lesbian characters/romances) is The Locked Tomb. I didn&#39;t really care for Traitor Baru Coromont, which felt very dry and boring, but I know that&#39;s the next series that&#39;s always recommended if you&#39;ve read TLT. </p> <p>I&#39;ve also heard some good things about Priory of the Orange Tree, so I purchased that recently and will begin reading soon, but I&#39;m still on the search for more lesbian stories. </p> <p>(And don&#39;t be afraid to recommend more fluffy and light stuff, just so long as it&#39;s not after school special-y!)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32",
