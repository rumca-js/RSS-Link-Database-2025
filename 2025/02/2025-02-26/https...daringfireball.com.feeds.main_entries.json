The gimmick is that guests are asked to name eight songs, a book, and a \u201cluxury item\u201d they\u2019d take with them if stranded on a desert island, and those picks\u2009\u2014\u2009including playing the songs\u2009\u2014\u2009are sprinkled throughout the interview. This week\u2019s guest is Jony Ive, and it\u2019s one of the best interviews with him I\u2019ve ever encountered. Incredibly thoughtful and inspiring, and Laverne covers a lot of ground without ever seeming the least bit hurried.</p>\n\n<p>A few highlights, from Ive:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think that one of the struggles I have, though, is in some ways,\nI think ironically, I struggle with being present in the now\nbecause I spend so much of my life in my head in the future. The\nway I try to understand the future is I\u2019m obsessed with the past.\nAnd so the bit that often gets missed out is right now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I know that feeling.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding h",
