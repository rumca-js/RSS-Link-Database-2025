<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just got into US and I said I should get Frugal since it’s US-based, figuring it’d mean faster speeds for me here. I tried Eweka, and even though its servers are in Europe, I’m getting better speeds, maxing out my connection, while Frugal lags behind. My ISP, setup, NZB client, and downloads are all the same between tests. I thought distance would matter more for Usenet, but maybe it’s network issues on Frugal’s end? Curious if other US users have seen Eweka outperform like this.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Extreme-Benefyt"> /u/Extreme-Benefyt </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iyv9wf/why_is_eweka_faster_than_frugal_for_me_in_the_us/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iyv9wf/why_is_eweka_faster_than_frugal_for_me_in_the_us/">[comments]</a></span>
