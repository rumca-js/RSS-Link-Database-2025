<p>Chinese cloud provider Alibaba has released four versions of its video-generation AI model as open source, allowing users to download and run them for free on capable PCs.</p>



<p>The Wan2.1 text-to-video model “excels at generating realistic visuals by accurately handling complex movements, enhancing pixel quality, adhering to physical principles, and optimizing the precision of instruction execution,” <a href="https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-cloud-open-sources-its-ai-models-for-video-generation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company said in a blog post</a>.</p>

## Signal will exit Sweden rather than dilute message security

<p>The CEO of Signal said Tuesday that the service will leave Sweden rather than comply with a rule that will require vendors to capture all secure messages and save a plain text copy, in case authorities later want to subpoena that data.</p>



<p>But the issue goes far beyond one secure messaging company and one government’s regulators. The European Union is considering similar regulations (many of them requiring backdoors to the data, which is even more problematic than simply saving a copy), as are the UK, France, and several other jurisdictions, including the US. If enough of those regulators insist on being able to access secure communications, it raises the issue of whether encrypted commun

<p>The US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) appears to have a new chief after the White House appointed a little-known official, Amy Gleason, as its “acting administrator.”</p>



<p>Such administration appointments don’t normally attract a lot of attention, but these are not normal times and, as commentators keep reminding everyone, DOGE is not a normal department.</p>



<p>Even the news of Gleason’s appointment was made in unorthodox style through comments to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/25/doge-leader-elon-musk-00002670">media outlets</a> by an anonymous White House official, rather than through an official press announcement.</p>

<p>Microsoft and Apple were once the yin and yang of the tech world. Microsoft was dull and plodding, milking buggy, barely-good-enough-for-prime-time Windows for tremendous profits, thanks to a worldwide operating system monopoly. The company was incapable of creating new, innovative products, and relied on sharp-elbowed (and potentially illegal) business practices to stay atop the tech world.</p>



<p>Apple was its polar opposite. Under Steve Jobs’ out-of-the-box thinking and obsessive attention to the smallest details, it released what seemed an unending stream of beautifully designed products that changed the way the world uses technology: the Mac, iPhone, iPod and iPad. </p>

<p>Ahem: I have two separate confessions to make, both equally embarrassing.</p>



<p>Confession #1 is that I love email. I’m totally not kidding, either. It’s about as uncool of a thing as possible to adore, I realize — I mean, <em>everyone</em> hates their inbox, right?</p>



<p>For me, though, email is a brilliant communication system. It’s a refreshingly versatile and direct way to reach both anyone <em>and</em> everyone, whether we’re talkin’ individual messages for personal and professional purposes or full-fledged publications like the titillating tech newsletters I send through my ever-evolving knowledge-sharing collective, <a href="https://theintelligence.com/" target="_blank" rel="nore
