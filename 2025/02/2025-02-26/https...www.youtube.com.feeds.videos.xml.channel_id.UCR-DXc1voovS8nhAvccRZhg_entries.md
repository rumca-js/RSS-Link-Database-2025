DeskPi's RackMate T2 is 12Uâ€”it's quite tall!

They sent me this T2 for test and review, though I might not make a 'full' video on it.

Here are links to their T0 (4U), T1 (8U) and T2 (12U) mini racks (as an Amazon Associate I earn for qualifying purchases):

T2: https://amzn.to/3Qxa6rY

And here's a link to Project MINI RACK, with tons of inspiration (and links to many OTHER racks you can buy cheaper than DeskPi's): https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com
