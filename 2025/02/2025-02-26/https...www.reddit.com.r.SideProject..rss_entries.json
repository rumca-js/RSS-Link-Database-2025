As a 17-year-old dev who&#39;s been coding for 4 years, I wanted to create something that actually makes people&#39;s lives easier.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the deal: You snap a photo of the receipt, and the app does all the heavy lifting. It breaks down each item, calculates individual shares, handles tips and taxes, and makes sure everyone pays exactly what they owe. No more calculator arguments or that one friend who &quot;forgets&quot; to include tax.</p> <p>Key features:</p> <ul> <li>Instant receipt scanning</li> <li>Automatic item breakdown</li> <li>Easy tip and tax calculation</li> <li>Works for restaurants, group trips, anything</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;ve been testing it with my friends, and it&#39;s already saved us from some pretty heated &quot;who ordered what&quot; debates. \ud83d\ude02</p> <p>Would love to hear what you think!
