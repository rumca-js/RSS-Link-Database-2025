But I prefer it to offer a one time purchase over subscription.</p> <p>I see two apps the most that seem to get more praise than others. Cdisplayex is one of them but a lot of folks say it never gets updated. The next is comicat. Perhaps it has lacklustre updates? Not sure. </p> <p>What I&#39;ve enjoyed about Panels is I can arrange and file my comics any way I like and even use my own pictures for folders etc. It makes it a really nice looking app that&#39;s also simple and fast to use. If any app that is similar to this I would love it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AllHailThePig"> /u/AllHailThePig </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1iyoyp9/leaving_ios_to_android_and_looking_for_a_panels/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been pirating for like 20 years now, since the days of XP and eMule. I&#39;ve always pirated on home PC with the same ISP with no problems, but recently decided to get a dedicated server for downloading and seeding stuff. </p> <p>Point is, my usual daily downloads is ~100GB to 350GB, and so far, not a single problem happened with ISP.</p> <p>However, since the server will be on 24/7, I expect my daily downloads to increase significantly, possibly to around 600-800GB/day, and I&#39;m sort of kind of worried ISP might do something about it.<br/> Last week I learned there&#39;s this thing called Usenet, and as far as I understand it it&#39;s some distributed network of...data. Allegedly it&#39;s more secure or something, but since I only just learned about it, I&#39;ve got no clue what exactly does that mean.</p> <p>The question is: do I need to learn Usenet and use it instead of my regular 1337x, TPB, TorrentGalaxy etc. to hoard massive amount

Some say you can just install a few drivers and be done with it, others say drivers and such can be a real pain in the ass. </p> <p>Personally, I am very enthusiastic about getting rid of all the bloat and all the data-gathering. Yes, I <em>do</em> know that there are scripts and stuff for this on &quot;regular&quot; versions. I have never used things like the Microsoft store, and considering the sub, you can probably guess where most of my gaming comes from.
