<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Let me be very clear, the ending of this book is deeply upsetting, and it&#39;s supposed to be. The methodically dehumanizing manipulation of everybody of lower class than the inner party is a brilliant and diabolical dystopian nightmare. This post is not an analysis of the entire novel and society as a whole, but simply a reflection upon one very specific unexpected response I had to one very specific passage.</p> <p>The below passage from my copy&#39;s page 275 really caught me off guard relative to the rest of the emotions running through my body for the entire 3rd part of the novel.</p> <blockquote> <p>Even when he was awake he was completely torpid. Often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown used to sleeping with a strong light on his face. It seemed to make no difference, except that one&#39;s dr

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>Last year my maternal grandmother died. And she had a lot of books which I inherited. The thing is, most of these books weren&#39;t really in the genres that I like and a lot of them aren&#39;t in English (which is the language I primarily read in). She also had a giant book case full of them and I live somewhere very small, so I just don&#39;t have the room to keep them either.</p> <p>That being the case, I&#39;d like to sell them but I&#39;m not sure where or how to sell them. Can anyone give me some information? Preferably somewhere online and in bulk.</p> <p>For the record, I live in Belgium.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OneOnOne6211"> /u/OneOnOne6211 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iynu8s/where_can_i_sell_books/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iynu8s/where_can_i_sell_books/">[comments]<

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m struggling to describe a sensation and I’m really curious if other readers can relate. </p> <p>It’s when you read a nuanced book to quickly. You keep up with the main plot points but after putting the book down you can’t focus so easily on the present. It’s like my brain is still processing everything I’ve been reading. </p> <p>Like literary gluttony? When you find out what you’ve just consumed is much heavier than you realised and you need extra time to digest the content?</p> <p>Is there a proper word for this? Is this sensation relatable to other readers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Feline_Shenanigans"> /u/Feline_Shenanigans </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iyn08s/relatable_book_digestion/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iyn08s/relatable_book_digestion/">[comments]</a></span>

## Convenience Store Woman is one of the most interesting books I've read so far

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been wanting to get into Japanese literature for some time so when I saw Convenience Store Woman at my university&#39;s library I didn&#39;t hesitate to get into it. Needless to say this won&#39;t be my last Japanese novel, nor my last book by Sayaka Murata. </p> <p>From the very beginning, the book captured my interest. I was invested in Keiko and her lifestyle. Keiko is your average person, she is not famous, she works at a convenience store, she is not married and she doesn&#39;t have any ambitions. She feels content with her life but that changes when she feels the pressure from the expectations that are projected to her - the expectations to become normal. </p> <p>Keiko finds herself struggling to fit in society&#39;s standards about women. She ought to get married, have kids, find a better job, be more sociable...She&#39;s torn between her own wants and the expectations from her close people. At times, I saw myself in her for I too hav

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m autistic, and so I have a strong need for boundaries: It&#39;s very easy for me to get overstimulated, and so I need to carefully ration sensory input, and I build my daily life around this fact. For instance, being touched unexpectedly is basically a form of pain to me. Consequently, I can&#39;t stand intrusive people, who out of either cluelessness or indifference ignore people&#39;s boundaries, and push their company onto others. I guess nobody likes this in real life, but seeing this behavior in a character tends to majorly turn me off a work of fiction.</p> <p>What about you?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Jerswar"> /u/Jerswar </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iyi2pg/what_personal_eccentricity_of_yours_can_make_it/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iyi2pg/what_personal_eccentricity_of_yours_can_make_it/"

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently been working on Ursula K Le Guin&#39;s &quot;Always Coming Home&quot; and have never experienced a novel like this. Instead of a traditional narrative, Ursula has used an anthropological journal/ survey of a fictional, future tribe of humanity to drill in on her ongoing question/ theme of, &quot;What kind of world do you want to live in?&quot; Or at least, that&#39;s the question she always seems to be evoking in her literature.</p> <p>So, have you read or come across this sort of novel before? Where traditional use of narrative is actively eschewed or presented via different means? I&#39;m not looking for suggestions on what&#39;s similar to Always Coming Home, instead just if you&#39;ve had a non-traditional novel cross your path, and what did you make of it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/amadeus451"> /u/amadeus451 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/com
