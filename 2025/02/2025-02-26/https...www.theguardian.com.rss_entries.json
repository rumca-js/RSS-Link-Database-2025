Arsenal have no chance of bridging the gap. Liverpool appear to be improving.</p><p>A first-half goal from Dominik Szoboszlai and a fine second half strike from fellow midfielder Alexis Mac Allister sufficed against Eddie Howe\u2019s team, who must hope injured assets and confidence recovers when the two clubs meet again in the Carabao Cup final in 18 days\u2019 time. Liverpool were simply too strong and too solid for their challenge at Anfield. A run of five games in 15 days was portrayed as a defining period in the title race. Liverpool have strengthened their grip on title number 20.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/26/liverpool-newcastle-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>",

Analysis of atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements show that Earth\u2019s plants and soils reached peak carbon dioxide sequestration in 2008 and absorption has been declining ever since. Passing this tipping point increases the chances of runaway climate breakdown.</p><p>Plants and trees have had it good for the last century or so. Rising levels of carbon dioxide helped to spur growth and warmer temperatures gave rise to a longer growing season. But at some point these benefits start to be outweighed by the negatives of a warming climate: wildfires, drought, storms, floods, the spread of new pests and diseases and plant heat stress all reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that plants absorb.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/26/plants-losing-appetite-for-ca",
