C++ Data Structures That Make Video Games Go Round - Al-Afiq Yeong - CppCon 2024
---

Modern video games are complex beasts that contains multiple systems interacting with one another storing, transferring and processing large sets of data in real time. While some data structures from the standard library such as the std::vector gets you by 90% of the time you need to store and process data, there will be the occasional 10% that requires a unique take. 

This presentation aims to discuss the unique data structures that are commonly used in video games / game engines that caters to the occasional 10%. We will go over several systems outlining their requirements, constraints and present custom data structures that gets the job done.
