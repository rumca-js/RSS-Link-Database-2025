After years of silence on Monolith Productions' Wonder Woman and reports of troubled development, Warner Bros. Games has announced the project's cancellation. It also confirmed that the studio will shut down alongside Player First Games (MultiVersus) and WB Games San Diego.

If rumors of Wonder Woman's massive budget, 2024 reboot and failure to "coalesce" are true, it makes some sense that WB Games would pull the plug. However, seeing such a renowned studio unceremoniously shut down in this fashion after delivering some of the most memorable first-person shooters and action-adventure games is just terrible.

Player First Games' predicament is no better, especially since MultiVersus servers will go down in May. WB Games San Diego's situation is also dismal since it was established to develop free-to-play mobile titles and hasn't really delivered. All these decisions reportedly trace back to the terrible leadership, but it's the developers who have to pay for it.
