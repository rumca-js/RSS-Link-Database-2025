        "description": "Last week I published an article looking at the power efficiency of 5th Gen AMD EPYC \"Turin\" using the modern AMD P-State driver and the Power Profile options. The AMD P-State driver being used by default now for the EPYC 9005 series processors on Linux 6.12+ and paired with Power Profile option tuning can deliver a nice boost to server energy efficiency with only modest impact to the performance. Today's article are some complementary numbers I carried out recently on a Supermicro server looking at more of the Power Profile Selection options.",
