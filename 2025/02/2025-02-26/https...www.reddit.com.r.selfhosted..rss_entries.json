You host your own Jellyfin instance and share it with family and friends, but not all content is available in their native language. Or maybe you simply want to filter content by its audio language.</p> <h3>The Solution</h3> <p>My newly open-sourced plugin, LanguageTags (very creative name, I know), automatically analyzes all movies, series, TV shows, and collections, adding language tags based on their audio tracks. This enables: - A) Filtering content by language via tags. - B) Using parental controls to restrict content based on available audio tracks, preventing disappointment when users find something that doesn\u2019t support their language.</p> <h3>Link</h3> <p>Check it out here: <a href=\"https://github.com/TheXaman/jellyfin-plugin-languageTags\">https://github.com/TheXaman/jellyfin-plugin-languageTags</a></p> <h3>Features</h3> <ul> <li>Automatically scan the library with a scheduled job",

It happens once a day to every few days and on every restart one of the drives is not automounting. When I manually mount it with mount -a everything works without a problem. On every restart some docker apps are also not starting, which is probably also related. On the old hardware I never had these problems.
