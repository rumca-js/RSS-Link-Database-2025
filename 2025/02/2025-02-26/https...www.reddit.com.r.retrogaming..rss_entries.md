## How well has the PS1 aged?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I hear a lot about how the fifth generation/early 3D era hasn’t aged well, but this was always something I wanted to challenge. Particularly with the PS1. For the sake of argument, I want to ignore the 2D games that the system had, and focus on the 3D games people like to say have aged poorly.</p> <p>I will concede that there are games on the system that are definitely hard to go back to, but from my experiences, all of them are very early games. Ridge Racer, Tekken, Crash Bandicoot 1 are all early 3d games that feel like early 3d games, but all of them have sequels on the same console that are timeless classics. I struggle to think of a PS1 classic released in 1997 onwards which I’d consider to be poorly aged.</p> <p>However I grew up with the system. I like to think I’m not blinded by nostalgia, but I’m also more used to mechanics and control schemes that risk annoying other gamers. For instance, I’m not bothered by moving the camera by using the s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Seaching things on internet and seeing the Game and Watch with Super Mario and another one with Zelda made me remind of an older dedicated device that had a few Mega Drive games on it.</p> <p>It makes me wonder why this didn&#39;t existed back then with original games.</p> <p>I mean, it would be like a downgraded, portable device with one or more games built into it, it would have more hardware to run these games.</p> <p>Example: a 1992 dedicated console to play a Sonic game and a few minigames. It would have hardware built on it that the original console didn&#39;t have, like it could borrow a few Arcade hardware but really just a few to not make it expensive.</p> <p>So you would have a relatively cheap Sonic game on a cheap yet stronger hardware.</p> <p>Maybe yall won&#39;t find this cost benefit but i disagree. Firstly because it could reuse existent chips, so you wouldn&#39;t need to create new stuff, maybe 1-3 chips but nothing beyound that. </p

Then once you&#39;re in the game, you&#39;re playing for keeps. No saving your state, no rewinding mistakes. </p> <p>It beats modern systems where you likely have to wait for various updates and downloads. </p> <p>Staying on topic though, one of my favorite aspects of many retro games is first, that most of them aren&#39;t very long, at least not the platformers; and second, that the life system means you have to learn the preceding world well enough to proceed to the next area.<br/> Many worlds follow a similar structure of 2-3 levels and then a boss.

And to be honest I never get the &quot;hate&quot; for the game. Do people think a RE game on a 8-bit handheld console should look and play different? Yeah, the GBC version of the first RE looks interesting, but not in a good way. I think Capcom did a good job with this one.</p> </d
