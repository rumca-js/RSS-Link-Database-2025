In today's Fix of entertainment news:
President of Lucasfilm Kathleen Kennedy is reportedly stepping down. Kennedy has been the head of Lucasfilm since 2012, and oversaw the famed movie studio during the current Disney ownership era. Kennedy oversaw the sequel trilogy, which earned billions at the box office but was not well-received by fans, and Lucasfilm's slate of Disney+ shows like The Mandalorian and Obi-Wan Kenobi. In related news, Disney+ announced the release schedule for the highly-anticipated Andor Season 2. The show will drop three episodes at a time, for four weeks, totaling 12 episodes.

In today's Daily Fix:
Warner Bros. Discovery made the painful announcement that they were canceling work on the long-in-development Wonder Woman game, and closing three studios. The Wonder Woman game was first announced in 2021, but was stuck in development hell for years. WB reported spent around $100 million on its development. The three studios being closed or Monolith (who also developed the Shadow of Mordor games), Player First Games, and WB San Diego. In other news, Microsoft dropped a new teaser for the next Fable game, and the unfortunate news that the game is delayed until sometime in 2026. And finally, Bloober Team has signed another deal with Konami for a new game. The developer behind the Silent Hill 2 Remake did not announce what game this would be, but it will be based on an existing Konami IP . Another Silent Hill, perhaps? Or Castlevania?
