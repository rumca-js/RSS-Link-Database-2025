<p>I built a bot that plays Pokémon FireRed. It can explore, battle, and respond to game events. Farthest I made it was Viridian Forest.<p>I paused development a couple months ago, but given the launch of ClaudePlaysPokemon, decided to open source!</p>

## Show HN: I got laid off from Meta and created a minor hit on Steam

<p>I was at FB/Meta from late 2013 to early 2023, mostly working in the compiler/runtime spaces. I got hit in the spring 2023 layoff wave. I immediately started making games in my newfound free time (a lifelong interest, and I even worked in AA(A?) back ca. ~2000), and in October 2023 I stumbled upon the idea of a roguelike pachinko/plinko game inspired by Luck Be A Landlord. Things snowballed quickly, I started talking to publishers, then worked like crazy through all of 2024, almost the hardest I've ever worked in my career, and launched the game in December 2024. It's sold ~200,000 units in its first 10 weeks on Steam. So it's no Balatro, but I'd still say it did very well :) AMA?<p>(my game is Ballionaire: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2667120/view/526461473225965590" rel="nofollow">https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2667120/view/5264614...</a>)</p>

## Launch HN: Maritime Fusion (YC W25) – Fusion Reactors for Ships

<p>Hey HN, we’re Justin and Jason, co-founders of Maritime Fusion (<a href="https://maritimefusion.com/">https://maritimefusion.com/</a>). We’re working on putting fusion reactors on ships—specifically, large container ships and defence applications. Should be easy!<p>Yes, we know: fusion has been the energy source of the future…and it always will be. But high-temperature superconductors (HTS) have changed the game for magnetic confinement, and we believe we’ll witness Q > 1 within a few (say 3) years. That’s huge.<p>(Side note: Q is the ratio of input power divided by output power. Q> 1 means the reactor is producing more power than it consumes, achieving ‘breakeven.’)<p>However, getting to breakeven is just the first daunting challenge. Making the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) reactors cost-competitive on the grid? That might be even harder than achieving breakeven.<p>That’s why we’re taking this soon-to-be breakthrough in fusion and applying it to the first market we believe makes sense:

## ForeverVM: Run AI-generated code in stateful sandboxes that run forever
 - [https://forevervm.com](https://forevervm.com)

 - date published: 2025-02-26T15:41:44+00:00

<p>Hey HN!<p>We started Jamsocket a few years ago as a way to run ephemeral servers that last for as long as a WebSocket connection. We sandboxed those servers, so with the rise of LLMs we started to see people use them for arbitrary code execution.<p>While this works, it was clunkier than what we would have wanted in a first-principles code execution product. We built ForeverVM from scratch to be that product.<p>In particular, it felt clunky for app developers to have to think about sandboxes starting and stopping, so the core tenet of ForeverVM is using memory snapshotting to create the abstraction of a Python REPL that lives forever.<p>When you go on our site, you are given a live Python repl, try it out!</p>

## Ask HN: Ethical VC Funds?
 - [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43183450](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43183450)
 - RSS feed: $source
 - date published: 2025-02-26T13:30:54+00:00

<p>Are there any ethical VC funds? This is a genuine question. It feels like the majority of venture firms can rationalise away their position as doing good for the world but when you start to dig into it, the sole goal is making money and who they make money for isn't always the most righteous of people or entities. Even then many of the individuals at firms can be questionable, involved in scandals. And the things invested in, while there can be a thematic preference, often everything is thrown out the window in the pursuit of greed or missing out on a deal.<p>Are there ethical VC funds out there? Is there room for a more altruistic form of investing? Is the sole goal just making money for them?<p>Could cooperative syndicates (like angel syndicates) be a good way to do it instead? Or is it the lack of follow on funding that's really going to kill a company?</p>
