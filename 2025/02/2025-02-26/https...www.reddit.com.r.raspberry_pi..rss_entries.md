<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I bought a PowerHD 9001MG servo, but I don&#39;t know which wire is VCC, Ground, or Signal because all the wires are black. One of the outer wires has a white-colored side. How can I determine the wiring configuration?</p> <p>I searched on forums and checked the manufacturer&#39;s website, but I couldn&#39;t find any information about it—only a possible pinout. However, I don&#39;t want to accidentally connect it incorrectly and risk damaging the servo.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/404DeadPixel"> /u/404DeadPixel </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1iz0yvu/servo_wiring_help_all_wires_are_black/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/1iz0yvu/servo_wiring_help_all_wires_are_black/">[comments]</a></span>

I want it to generate and display the classic Weather Channel graphics locally and output to a CRT TV.</p> <p>Most projects I’ve found use the web-based emulator, but I want something standalone.</p> <p>What’s the best Raspberry Pi model for this? How would I generate the graphics without relying on the web? What’s the best way to connect a Pi to a CRT?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi,</p> <p>Not sure which flair to use since I&#39;m just looking for information but I did do research. Ah well.</p> <p>I have a Raspberry Pi 3 that I don&#39;t use. I was asked if it&#39;s possible to use it to pull all the images from a Facebook album and show it as a Digital Slideshow that would just play the images forever. I thought maybe something like MagicMirror could do this, but I didn&#39;t find a plugin for that. I searched online but also didn&#39;t find anything so am hoping I just overlooked something.</p> <p>Does anyone know of a way that this can be done? I found a Chrome Plugin that can do it, but then found that Chrome isn&#39;t natively supported on a Raspberry PI.</p> <p>I may have to just use something else, but wanted to check here in case there is a way that I&#39;m just not finding.</p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kelemvor33"> /u/kelemvor33 </a> <br/> <spa
