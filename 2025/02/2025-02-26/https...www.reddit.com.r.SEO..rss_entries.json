I&#39;ve been working alot over the last week or so and I was able to bring up my ranking in a number of keywords searches I was focused on. I was tracking these by Googleing the keywords and see what position my business ranked compared to other businesses. I would do these in my home offers.</p> <p>Last night I was at a friend&#39;s place who lives about 20 mins away and I decided to check those keywords. My ranking was very different and these kinda reinforced my theory that the area of the google search would effect the rankings . </p> <p>I was wondering if there is an easy way to track regional rankings without needing to travel to those areas. </p> <p>Thanks </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Still-Number-786\"> /u/Still-Number-786 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO",
