The thing is, most of these books weren&#39;t really in the genres that I like and a lot of them aren&#39;t in English (which is the language I primarily read in). She also had a giant book case full of them and I live somewhere very small, so I just don&#39;t have the room to keep them either.</p> <p>That being the case, I&#39;d like to sell them but I&#39;m not sure where or how to sell them. Can anyone give me some information?
