## Can anyone please tell me any Operating Systems that officially support RIS-V Architecture on bare metal?

If one of the processors produces anomalous results, it is considered faulty and isolated.</p> </blockquote> <p>Technically it is a &quot;Xilinx Artix-7 200T FPGA with an operating temperature of -40C to +100C. This commercial off-the-shelf FPGA is fabricated using a 28nm process node.&quot;.</p> <blockquote> <p>NASA’s explanation of RadPC’s healing powers states: “In the event of a radiation strike, RadPC’s patented recovery procedures can identify the location of the fault and repair the issue in the background.”</p> </blockq

## How many registers does a RISC-V processor need to be Turing complete?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>For example, I assume if there&#39;s only one register, it cannot carry out necessary basic computations. What if there is one 0-register and two other registers? Or is the 0-register needed; what if there are three regular registers?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DumplingLife7584"> /u/DumplingLife7584 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1iya30a/how_many_registers_does_a_riscv_processor_need_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1iya30a/how_many_registers_does_a_riscv_processor_need_to/">[comments]</a></span>
