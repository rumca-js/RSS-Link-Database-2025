<p>After more than a year out of sight, Alexa+–the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2617852/a-new-alexa-ai-is-coming-what-it-will-cost-and-when-you-can-try-it.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2617852/a-new-alexa-ai-is-coming-what-it-will-cost-and-when-you-can-try-it.html">new Alexa with its AI-powered revamp–</a>took center stage at a crowded coming-out party in New York City on Wednesday, and I got a first-hand look at what this turbocharged voice assistant can do. </p>



<p>Following the big unveiling, we were all led to a demonstration hall with about a half-dozen break-out rooms, where we were able to see and hear—but not participate in—Alexa’s new conversational tricks, from controlling smart home devices and researching sports tickets to suggesting recipes and dialing up tunes on Amazon Prime Video. </p>

<p>Will Framework ever build a laptop based upon a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor? If history holds, then yes… but not now.</p>



<p>At the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2620784/hands-on-with-the-framework-desktop-and-laptop-12.html">launch of the Framework Desktop</a> (and the Framework Laptop 12 and updated Laptop 13), I asked Framework chief executive Nirav Patel about the possibility of a Snapdragon X-based Framework Mainboard. After all, performance isn’t just the force driving PCs. Battery life matters more than ever, too.</p>



<p>Patel, unfortunately, was non-committal as the company was only there to talk about what it had just launched. Some products, like the gaming-oriented <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2215545/framework-laptop-16-review.html">Framework Laptop 16</a>, didn’t receive any significant updates save for the inclu

<p>We expect USB-C cables to perform a specific task: transferring either data or files between devices. We give little more thought to the matter, but malicious USB-C cables can do much more than what we expect.</p>



<p>These cables hide malicious hardware that can intercept data, eavesdrop on phone calls and messages, or, in the worst cases, take complete control of your PC or cellphone. The first of these appeared in 2008, but back then they were very rare and expensive — which meant the average user was largely safeguarded.</p>



<p>Since then, their availability has increased 100-fold and now with both specialist spy retailers selling them as “spy cables” as well as unscrupulous sellers passing them off as legitimate products, it’s all too easy to buy one by accident and get hacked. So, how do you know if your USB-C cable is malicious?</p>

<p>While Apple’s Time Machine provides users with an effective, set-it-and-forget-it recovery system, Microsoft users aren’t so lucky. Instead, users are stuck deciding the best way to keep their data safe with a patchwork system of restore points, recovery discs, and file backups. Thankfully, there are a number of great third-party backup options for Windows. </p>

<p>Framework’s modular, upgradeable laptops have made it a darling of PC fans, making some of the best elements of desktops portable. So, why would Framework design a desktop PC? To find out, PCWorld’s Mark Hachman went to the company’s reveal event in San Francisco, where he got his hands all over the new <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2618197/frameworks-first-desktop-pc-leans-into-its-diy-roots-and-amds-radical-strix-halo.html">Framework Desktop</a> and the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2618070/framework-12-reinvents-budget-laptops-with-new-amd-cpus.html">new 2-in-1 Laptop 12</a>.</p>

<p>After years of watching—and paying for—so-called “peak TV” on the likes of Netflix, Apple TV+, and Max, my eyeballs were starting to glaze over. </p>



<p>Sure, I love <em>The Crown</em>, <em>Mindhunter</em>, and <em>Hacks</em>, but true streaming gems tend to be few and far between. (Yes, I know, I need to stream <em>Severance</em>. I’ll get to it!)  </p>



<p>All too often, the latest prestige shows with those marquee stars and the terrific, glossy trailers turn out to be bloated bores, and they’ve all started to feel the same. Life is too short.</p>



<p>Worst of all, I was throwing away $20 or more a month on streaming services I wasn’t really enjoying. Couldn’t I put that cash to better use? </p>

<p>The release of Windows 11 24H2 has been anything but flawless, and now another problem has surfaced. If you have a specific older version of Autodesk’s AutoCAD software installed on your computer, you’ll be blocked from upgrading to Windows 11 24H2.</p>



<p>Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-24h2#3488msgdesc">recently confirmed</a> that AutoCAD 2022 may result in bootup issues on PCs running Windows 11 24H2. In response, the tech giant has decided to block automatic delivery of Windows 11 24H2 on affected systems, meaning those that have AutoCAD 2022 installed. Other versions of AutoCAD should still work as usual and shouldn’t prevent you from upgrading to the latest version of Microsoft’s OS.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to make your desktop background more visually engaging, you should try embedding a video with the open source app Lively Wallpaper. This app comes with some free videos for your wallpaper, but you can also use it to add your own videos to your desktop.</p>



<p>Here’s how it works. First, install <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ntm2qc6qws7?amp%3Bgl=US&hl=en-us&gl=IN" data-type="link" data-id="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9ntm2qc6qws7?amp;gl=US&hl=de-de&gl=IN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lively Wallpaper</a> from the Microsoft Store.

It probably doesn’t have to be as fast as you think (especially if you’re <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2254813/why-pc-gamers-shouldnt-waste-money-on-a-pcie-5-0-ssd.html">building a gaming PC</a>).

<p>There’s no denying that ChatGPT and other AI chatbots make impressive chat companions that can converse with you on just about anything.</p>



<p>Their conversational powers can be extremely convincing too; if they’ve made you feel safe about sharing your personal details, you’re not alone. But — newsflash! — you’re not talking to your toaster. Anything you tell an AI chatbot can be stored on a server and resurface later, a fact that makes them inherently risky.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-are-chatbots-so-risky">Why are chatbots so risky?</h2>



<p>The problem stems from how the companies that run Large Language Models (LLMs) and their associated chatbots use your personal data — essentially, to train better bots.</p>

<p>You might think you’re proficient with Word. But there are so many small-yet-useful features that you might’ve glossed over, and those features can boost your productivity further if you let them.</p>

<p>One of my tech dilemmas is that I’ve somehow accumulated a disparate group of laptops with integrated GPUs. That means they’re great to write on but when it comes to graphics processing power — without using expletives — let’s just say they can’t play any big-name PC games.</p>



<p>My work laptop, for example, can handle just about any work app or program I need to run and is as compact and portable as heck, but will it let me potter for even a minute in Bethesda’s <em>Starfield</em>? Nope — not a chance.</p>
