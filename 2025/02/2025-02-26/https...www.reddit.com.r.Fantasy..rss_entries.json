While the series was still coming out, there was nary a thread that did not recommend it, even when it was not a good recommendation\u2014in that sense, it was like Malazan! And yet, since the release of the final book in the series, Waybound, I&#39;ve not seen <em>as much</em> discussion here about it (possibly because, in part, the progression fantasy hype train seems to have moved onto Dungeon Crawler Carl). So I&#39;m wondering what people think about it now that it&#39;s over?</p> <p>For me, I liked the ending, but it was not quite as awesome as I was hoping for it to be. Ultimately Cradle sticks in my mind less well than I expected it too. That book 6-10 sequence is amazing, but outside of that, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s as good as I felt while reading it\u2026</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Udy_Kumra\"> /u/Udy_Kumra </a> <br/> <span><a h",

So much filler and slowness. I was wondering if it was worth it to read the hemlock queen. 17 hours of a second book I just don\u2019t know if it is worth it. Some honest inputs please bc my goodness btwn this and onyx storm. I just don\u2019t know haha onyx storm was a rough start and don\u2019t get why there\u2019s 24 hours worth of a third book in a five book series just wanna make sure. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Liapasquale\"> /u/Liapasquale </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1iz0inf/worth_it_to_read_the_hemlock_queen/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1iz0inf/worth_it_to_read_the_hemlock_queen/\">[comments]</a></span>",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Recently events had me musing on different apocalyptic fantasy that I have read and began thinking about revisiting some of it. Many years ago I read Armegeddon&#39;s Children. I could only recall vague bits of it. The apocalyptic feel of it and the family of kids, magic ect. I don&#39;t know if the whole Genesis series had been written then but for some reason I didn&#39;t go any further than the first book. So I decided to begin there. </p> <p>I am now almost done with The Gypsy Morph. I&#39;ve very much enjoyed it. For some reason I&#39;ve stayed away from fiurther Shennara books. I haven&#39;t yet decided to go further into them. What do those of you who have, have to say about them? Are they worth the read? Or in this case are they worth the listen as I much prefer audio books these days? But I may have to purchase them because they&#39;re probably not all in my library and they&#39;re not cheap. Should I go further and if so what books should I",

I&#39;ve just finished the Shepherd King duology (One Dark Window and Two Twisted Crowns) and while I overall loved it, it leaned a tiny bit too much into the romantasy genre for me. So now I&#39;m seeking recommendations for books that have the elements which I really enjoyed in this series, which were: - found family - unique magic system - very well written, wouldn&#39;t mind if it went even more into beautiful, almost poetic writing - a romance subplot would be much appreciated, but nothing with really detailed smut </p> <p>I know it&#39;s a lot to ask but if anything comes to mind, please let me know so I can fill the void!

However the same moment I learned about Jones I also learned that he sadly passed away last month due to brain cancer. Because I&#39;m so new to his work I have no idea if the Hanuvar series is a continueus narrative that follows from book to book, or is each of the books a self-contained story that can be read separately?</p> <p>Big fantasy book series are such a huge time investment, that I usually tend to avoid starting a series if I know that it will never be finished (which is why I still haven&#39;t started reading ASOIAF) and I was wondering which category does the Hanuvar series fall into? Can I start reading it knowing that I will get either a satisfying conclusion or individual stories, or was the series left unfinished due to Jones&#39; untimely passing?</p> </div>",
