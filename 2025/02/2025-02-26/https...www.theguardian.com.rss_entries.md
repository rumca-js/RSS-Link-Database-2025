<p>Liverpool are disappearing over the horizon, leaving so-called title rivals to fight it out for second place. Arne Slot’s relentless team stretched their lead at the top of the Premier League to 13 points with 10 games remaining with an assured defeat of Newcastle. Arsenal have no chance of bridging the gap. Liverpool appear to be improving.</p><p>A first-half goal from Dominik Szoboszlai and a fine second half strike from fellow midfielder Alexis Mac Allister sufficed against Eddie Howe’s team, who must hope injured assets and confidence recovers when the two clubs meet again in the Carabao Cup final in 18 days’ time. Liverpool were simply too strong and too solid for their challenge at Anfield. A run of five games in 15 days was portrayed as a defining period in the title race. Liverpool have strengthened their grip on title number 20.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/26/liverpool-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Readers express dismay at the government’s decision to cut the foreign aid budget to pay for increased spending on defence</p><p>When Rishi Sunak cut the aid budget during the Covid pandemic from 0.7% to 0.5% of GDP, it was described by Larry Elliott in the Guardian as an act of “wilful political vandalism” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/29/cutting-uk-overseas-aid-in-the-name-of-covid-fiscal-prudence-is-pure-nonsense">29 November 2020</a>). This was partly because the amount saved, £3bn-£4bn, was “chickenfeed” in the context of a budget deficit running at 20% of GDP, but mostly because it completely undermined “the idea of aid as global public investment for the common good”.</p><p>Keir Starmer’s aid cut is even more cynical, as your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-starmers-aid-cuts-they-wont-buy-security-but-they-will-undermine-it">editorial</a> (25 February) correctly identifies, because it is self-impo

<p>Joe Wright’s new drama gives a theatrical take on the dictator’s flaws but there is so much more history viewers need to know</p><p>On 3 January 1925, Benito Mussolini delivered the most important speech of his life to the Italian parliament.

The body of the socialist deputy and his bitter foe, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/08/hero-giacomo-matteotti-lucy-hughes-hallett">Giacomo Matteotti</a>, had been discovered in a shallow grave near Rome and mounting evidence pointed to Mussolini’s responsibility for his murder. With the king, the old liberal democratic elite, the left and many of his own party pressing for his dismissal, Mussolini declared that everything – the fascist violence, the immorality, the turmoil into which Italy had sunk – was his fault, “because I, I alone, created it”. By the same token, he alone was the man “capable of dominating the crisis”. Parliament, stunned, sat silent. There was no voice of protest. The

<p>After serving time in Paris, Rome and Brussels, the Malian star is ready to perform again – and planning a book and a stage show about her fellow inmates and her own prison experiences</p><p>‘It’s been like a kind of military training,” says Rokia Traoré of the nine months she has just spent in European prisons. “It was very hard. I was in a bad psychological state because I was separated from my children, but at the same time it was a kind of privilege because I was learning things it’s not possible to learn without being in that situation. Everything is much more intense. Sharing a small space with someone – in a week you know more about them than their mother. You know everything: when she is happy, when she cries, when she goes to the toilet, when she has a shower. You see everything.”</p><p>Born and based in Mali, she is one of the most inventive and adventurous female artists in Africa; a singer who can switch from delicate acoustic styles to rock, powered by her bluesy elec

<p>It’s chaos as small jobs become big jobs, tools disappear and distractions lead to furious frustration. Then you spot spring’s first flower ...</p><p>There’s no such thing as gardeners’ block, I once read. This from, I believe, a famous writer who was making the point that if you’ve got writers’ block, you should just go and do something else for a bit. Point taken. There is no such thing as gardeners’ block because if you get stuck doing one job, even in the smallest garden, there are roughly 10m other jobs you can be cracking on with. Which is quite right. And this is what makes gardening either the worst thing for you if – like me&nbsp;– you have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or possibly the best.</p><p>I stride into the garden full of purpose and ambition, with a smile on my face.

<p>‘The community had 11,000 chickens and every able-bodied person helped out during the two days of butchering’</p><p>The Hutterites are an Anabaptist movement – they believe in adult baptism and pacifism. Like the Mennonites and the Amish, they emerged from the Radical Reformation in central Europe in the 1500s, but unlike them they live communally, with all goods and property shared among members of the community. Today, Hutterite colonies mostly exist on either side of the US-Canada border, where there are more than 500 of them.</p><p>In 2009, I was driving through Canada’s Manitoba prairies in search of interesting photos for the newspaper I work for, <a href="https://www.brandonsun.com/">the Brandon Sun</a>, when I spotted some women working in the garden at Deerboine Colony. I knew a little about the Hutterites but not a lot, and pulled over to ask if I could make some pictures. The women were friendly and agreed, and I spent the afternoon chatting and photographing them.</p>

<p><strong>The Place, London<br></strong>Carlos Pons Guerra turns Puccini’s tragedy into the story of a Cuban sex worker who completely transforms himself to win the love of a sailor</p><p>This reimagining of Madame Butterfly turns Puccini’s orientalist opera into a queer tragedy, and relocates it from 1904 Japan to post-revolutionary Cuba and a world of sex work and Santería goddesses. Butterfly, the girl who gives up her religion and ultimately her life for the love of a western sailor, becomes Mariposa, a young male sex worker who transforms himself completely to try to win the heart of Preston (the Pinkerton character). It’s a strong idea – the sacrifice of the self in the desperate desire to be loved – but this production by UK-based, Gran Canarian choreographer Carlos Pons Guerra still needs some honing in the execution.<br><br>
 Poor Mariposa (Harry Alexander) is lost from the very beginning, wandering the Havana docks. Alexander is a tall, exquisite dancer best known for work

<p><strong>Tron theatre, Glasgow<br></strong>Jemima Levick’s superb production sets Arthur Miller’s tale of family, immigration, poverty and passion in the modern-day Brooklyn docks</p><p>Is it an innocent domestic moment or a portent of something more ominous? It happens early enough in Jemima Levick’s thrilling production – her debut as the Tron’s artistic director – to leave some doubt. But when Mark Holgate’s Eddie Carbone emerges from the onstage shower, his torso glistening as he steps out in his boxers, you do fear for his niece’s safety. Should they really be alone together?</p><p>Excellently played by newcomer Holly Howden Gilchrist, Catherine is a complex jumble of vulnerability and assurance, at once naive and sharp, a teenager bursting with youthful energy and adult ambition. Sharing close quarters with the decent-but-flawed Eddie in Arthur Miller’s classic, she is an unwitting catalyst for his tragic downfall. In the words of Nicholas Karimi’s lawyer Alfieri, “there is t

<p>Photographs from across the globe capture the impact of people on the climate – and of the climate on people</p><p>The word <em>anthropocene</em> has been proposed to denote an ongoing epoch in which human activity is a primary driving force of geological change. Although the word has caught on like wildfire in a colloquial sense, it was ultimately rejected as a descriptive scientific term, not so much because it was inaccurate but because of disagreements over when exactly it would have started – 1945, marking the unlocking of nuclear power; 1610, which may be the first time human activity affected the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; 1964, when the so-called Great Acceleration may have begun – or some other date altogether?</p><p>These questions point to deeper challenges in understanding just what the Anthropocene is: do we think of it in terms of nuclear fallout, the composition of the atmosphere, the size of the human population, or so many other worthy metrics?

<p>The meticulous high-risk work carried out by hospital surgeons is shown in unflinching detail. Plus: is love hiding close to home in Amandaland? Here’s what to watch this evening</p><p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>Not one for the faint-hearted: it’s the return of the fly-on-the-wall hospital series that doesn’t flinch from showing every detail of the remarkable work carried out during high-risk surgeries. We’re in Edinburgh this time, where 21-year-old law student Sania has an inflamed pancreas and needs an auto-transplant – which involves removing it and reconstructing her digestive tract. It’s a complex procedure that has only been conducted in Scotland three times. Edge-of-your-seat stuff, if you can stomach it. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/feb/26/tv-tonight-return-of-gripping-surgeons-at-the-edge-of-life-series">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thousands of seafarers are left on board their vessels in foreign waters, unpaid, with scant supplies – and no way of getting home </p><p>When Vihaan* set off from his home in Tamil Nadu, south India, to work on a vessel crossing the Bay of Bengal into neighbouring Bangladesh, he told his family he would be gone a few months. After delivering his cargo of stone to Bangladesh’s Kutubdia Island, the marine engineer was due to head home in March 2024 to disembark at Thoothukudi port, India.</p><p>But that month, the rusting tug, the Navimar 3, which was being operated by Middle East Marine (MEM), was detained by the authorities in Bangladesh due to unpaid fees. For almost a year, Vihaan has become a virtual prisoner on board, he says, forced to work without pay to keep the vessel safe, amid strong currents where it is anchored off the island in the cyclone-prone bay.

<p>Three times in the postwar era Germany made strategic choices that benefited Europe – with the US at its side. Now it must do it in opposition to Trump</p><p>Three times in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany, its chancellors have made strategic choices that opened the door to a better future for Europe. Today there’s not just an opportunity but an urgent need for a fourth such historic moment. If the country’s new coalition government under Friedrich Merz manages to seize the chance of this crisis, both Germany and Europe will go forward. If it fails, then by the end of the 2020s both may have fallen backwards farther and faster than most of us could have imagined in our worst nightmares.</p><p>The big difference with those three earlier pivotal moments is this: in 1949, 1969 and 1989 the Federal Republic’s policy was fundamentally aligned with that of the United States.

<p>Earth’s plants and soils reached peak carbon dioxide sequestration in 2008 but  proportion absorbed has been declining since, study finds</p><p>Our planet is losing its appetite for mopping up carbon dioxide. Analysis of atmospheric carbon dioxide measurements show that Earth’s plants and soils reached peak carbon dioxide sequestration in 2008 and absorption has been declining ever since. Passing this tipping point increases the chances of runaway climate breakdown.</p><p>Plants and trees have had it good for the last century or so. Rising levels of carbon dioxide helped to spur growth and warmer temperatures gave rise to a longer growing season. But at some point these benefits start to be outweighed by the negatives of a warming climate: wildfires, drought, storms, floods, the spread of new pests and diseases and plant heat stress all reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that plants absorb.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/26/plants-losing-appetite-for-ca
