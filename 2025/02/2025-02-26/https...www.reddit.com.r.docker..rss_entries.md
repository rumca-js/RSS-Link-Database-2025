That the host system will from time to time automatically reboot for things like kernel updates, and the containers are running from a compose file with restart policies set to &quot;always&quot;. The part I&#39;m struggling to figure out is what happens when that reboot occurs if new images have been pulled - does Docker just restart the containers with the old images or does it run the new ones?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I am not super tech savy, so I apologize if the title sucks. </p> <p>The long story short is I am using an open source program to create character sheets for a ttrpg I am developing. The program uses docker and I have successfully got it up and running on the mini pc I use as a plex server, and am able to do what I need to do with it. </p> <p>What I am looking for, is a solution to where I can host this and the people who will be testing this with me can connect, build their own characters, etc... </p> <p>So like web hosting, online VM, etc...? I don&#39;t know what to do at this point., so some input would be appreciated. </p> <p>Thanks. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kazelob"> /u/Kazelob </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/1iydwy1/how_to_make_docker_open_to_more_people_to_connect/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comment

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Back in November, DH announced new plan limits for all users, including paid subscribers. And today they have posted this, about three days before those limits (and overage charges) were supposed to kick in:</p> <p><a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/revisiting-docker-hub-policies-prioritizing-developer-experience/">https://www.docker.com/blog/revisiting-docker-hub-policies-prioritizing-developer-experience/</a></p> <p>SUMMARY: &quot;yeah we&#39;re not gonna do any of this.&quot; </p> <p>Really wish they&#39;d announced this before I wasted a day on trying to unsuccessfully build a mirror for our two measley images that we use for CI/CD. (Hat tip to ChatGPT for insisting it would be easy, even after I rigorously challenged that notion. Got me again! Fool me a hundred times, shame on me.)</p> <p>On the plus size, the new tool to delete old/unused images works great. About dang time for that, imo. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I made Local Ingress, an opinionated stack aimed at making it easier to run multiple containerized projects and services locally. The Local Ingress stack provides an ingress proxy (traefik), DNS, and optional TLS certificate enrollment. Local Ingress is designed to be used with the <code>.test</code> TLD (a special purpose, reserved TLD) to avoid conflict with other TLDs. When properly configured on your host, the DNS resolver will provide seamless DNS resolution for both the host as well as any container.</p> <p>The main advantages of Local Ingress:</p> <ul> <li>100% containerized</li> <li>Minimal host configuration</li> <li>Expose services on standard ports (80, 443) with FQDNs</li> <li>TLS certificate management + wildcard certificate support (ACME DNS-01)</li> <li>DNS resolution on the host and in all containers</li> <li>Works with any language or runtime</li> <li>Decoupled service enrollment and routing rules</li> <li>No commands or binaries to
