<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/cybersecurity">r/cybersecurity</a> and <a href="/r/tech">r/tech</a> enthusiasts!</p> <p>I’ve been exploring how SIEM systems are evolving, and it’s incredible to see how much they’ve transformed. SIEMs are no longer just about log collection and correlation. Modern platforms are now leveraging AI, machine learning, and advanced tools like XDR and SOAR to detect threats in real-time and automate responses. This shift is reshaping how organizations approach cybersecurity.</p> <p>One of the most significant trends is the rise of cloud-based SIEM solutions. Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud-native platforms for their scalability, faster deployment, and cost-effectiveness. For smaller and midsize businesses, this is a game-changer, as it allows them to implement robust security measures without the heavy upfront costs of traditional on-premises systems. However, larger enterprises still face challenges with high data ingestion
