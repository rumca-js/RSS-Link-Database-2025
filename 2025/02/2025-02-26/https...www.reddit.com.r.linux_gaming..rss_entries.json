If I start the X11 session I have no problems with games but I have problems with screen brightness, and oversaturated colors. I can more or less fix it, but I would prefer to use Wayland.</p> <p>If I start the session with Wayland, the monitor looks much better, and I get back desktop gestures and so on, but the problem I have in games is quite strange:</p> <p>For example in CS2, the game launches normally and I can put it in fullscreen at 144Hz on High without problem.

If I want to play games like cod, fortnite, apex, etc I am going to be forced into a dual boot environment. Which I am prepared to sit and partition all my drives between ext4 and NTFS to have space for both boots. Is there a way of setting up a quick button in Linux to fast boot to windows without needing to shutdown and use the boot menu? And what securities do I have when playing multiplayer games to not be banned from some over reaching anti cheat? </p> <p>And just so I don&#39;t make multiple posts, do I really not need any drivers or downloads when running full and?</p> </div><",

It&#39;s good but it&#39;s difficult to set up gaming on it (for me). I normally use my PC not so often but when I use it, then mostly I only play games on it. In an earlier post my question was which Distro the best for Gaming is, now my question is which ist the best: Nobara, Pop! OS or Bazzite? I heard good things from all of them, but I want an distribution which ist the best for Gaming (especially for AMD), which is also easy to understand and is safe and reliable. </p> <p>PS: I don&#39;t have an GPU, my GPU is integrated in my CPU which is from AMD (GPU = AMD Radeon Vega Graphics or something like that).

Rocket League is my main game and I play it on a relatively high level, so I notice very easily if something is off with the game. The game runs perfectly on linux, no input lag or fps drops, but for some reason when I play online the some touches and boost grabs appear to come like half a second late, and often the ball will suddenly change directions unexpectedly appearing like the server is not communicating 100% with the client. I have checked the network performance graphs while playing and they appear fully the same as on windows, but this issue does not occur when I swap to windows.</p> <p>So generally what possible differences are there between a fresh install of windows and mint, that would change the networking for this to happen? I use Gufw Firewall on linux if that matters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/koredae\"> /u/koredae </",

I won\u2019t be able to upgrade to windows 11 so I was wondering which build of Linux I should get that allows me to still play Fortnite through my epic games app, Yakuza 0 on my Xbox app, and all emulators like yuzu, Ryujinx, citra, dolphin, cemu, duckstation, PCSX2, project 64, mGBA, and Retroarch on Steam.

But my experience now that I\u2019ve upgraded and have access to fancy features I\u2019ve been facing issues. If I want to use HDR with my new monitor, I have to use nested gamescope sessions, which means a launch option on every game I want to use HDR with. There\u2019s no alternative to AFMF 2 for when I already have 60+ fps and just want some extra smoothness to fill out my refresh rate. Ray tracing performance on AMD isn\u2019t too bad for just reflections which make a big difference but on Linux ray tracing performance is noticeably slower. I like using my dualsense for a lot of AAA games for the haptics, but for some reason the rumble doesn\u2019t work and my troubleshooting has led nowhere.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/June_Berries\"> /u/June_Berries </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1iyp70q/possi",

When I launch the game in Gamemode (the SteamDeck interface), I am only getting 50-55 fps. The game is only using like 5W-7W total, even though I have my max TDP set to 18W. I know the ROG Ally X is easily capable of 60fps, and even 120fps if I use the DSCSModLoader (which I am, and it&#39;s log is created, so I know its loaded). It does so under Windows with very little struggle. If I run the game in Desktop Mode with MangoHUD, I can see the game getting a solid locked 120fps (it&#39;s has more stable frametimes than it did under Windows). If I go in and add gamescope to the parameters, I am back down to the crappy 50fps. It is a OpenGL game, if that matters. Does anyone have any ideas on things I can try, or am I just stuck launching this game in Desktop Mode?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &",

But if I try to run a program in Bottles and set Wine as the runner it fails in under a second, like instantly. Usually when switching runners it takes like 10-20 seconds to process, but when switching to sys-wine-10.2 it processes suspiciously quickly, like 2 seconds, even tho it used to take 10-20 seconds like everything else, and then nothing ever launches.

Basically I\u2019ve been running Linux Mint on my Ryzen 3 3200G with the integrated graphics. Several months now. Someone gave me a GTX 960 in the meantime. I installed it, got the drivers installed, (driver 550) immediately noticed a massive performance boost in Skyrim SE. Went from 27fps at best to 60fps capped nearly all the time. Seemed to be working fine. Decided to run Subnautica and The Forest. Subnautica ran at 27-35fps on average. The Forest ran at 5 FPS. Immediately I knew something wasn\u2019t right. So I installed the 470 version drivers in Driver Manager, and also disabled my iGPU in the BIOS for safe measure. </p> <p>Subnautica performance shot up dramatically, got about 50-60fps on low. However The Forest only improved to around 20-30fps. Still, could tell something wasn\u2019t right. Switched over to the 535 drivers, and The Forest shot up dramatically to 60-70fps on average\u2026.until SUBNAUTICA BROKE A",

My self and a buddy noticed today that the WoW retail client isn&#39;t capturing any mouse or keyboard input when starting the game. mouse clicks go through the application and register on what ever is behind the game window. I have personally tested it on 2 systems, both Fedora 41 but one with an AMD RX 6800 and the other with a RTX 4080. For the Nvidia systems are both using Nvidia propitiatory drivers (he&#39;s using 470.256.02-5 from RPM Fusion and I&#39;m running the latest driver form the Nvidia installer) and running fedora 41. We are both launching the game from Lutris, and using GE-Proton9-25. I&#39;ve tried several other versions of wine with no different results. I have the logs form my AMD system if anyone wants to take a look at them, although nothing really looks out of place.</p> <p>Has any other WOW players ran into this as of today?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com",
