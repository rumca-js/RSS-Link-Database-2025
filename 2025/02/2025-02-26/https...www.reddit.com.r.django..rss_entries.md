<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not much a poster so please don&#39;t be rough on me. I enjoy this subreddit and the community built/building within here. I think most the comments here are extremely helpful and nice to most of the posts, even when they ask the same questions over and over (ie what front end should I use with Django?). But because of this community Iâ€™ve been building a lot of my APIs with Django Ninja now. I&#39;m making this post to crowdsource opinions and since this is a new thing for me to work on I would appreciate feedback/opinions on what I should think about/consider and features that could be cool.</p> <p>With that being said, Iâ€™ve decided to create my own <a href="https://github.com/mattjaikaran/django-matt">Django framework</a>. For now it will be a personal project for internal use. My overall idea was to create something challenging for fun and things I would add in my own personal API development workflow. Before LLMs I wouldnâ€™t have considere

Now I want to integrate ML to WEB so I&#39;m going for django even though flask is popular in ML world. Because Django is better for landing jobs I think. Is django enough?

However the last 6 monthly bill we received was over $1,600 and Meetup is proving pretty limited in terms of its functionality and VFM.</p> <p>Some of our best events have been around Django Conferences getting people to socialise the night before the conference starts.</p> <p>In all, we have almost 2,000 members across 7 groups in 7 countries and want this to grow further but without having to charge members or the groups having to find sponsors. </p> <p>We have a discord channel with a handful of users and not much activity which would be an obvious place to host the community and then publicise events using free tools like eventbrite. </

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello good people of Django-land!</p> <p>I need some help with designing my models.</p> <p>I&#39;m building a web app where people can submit structured poetry called &quot;pantun&quot; where the number of lines must be even. So you can submit poems having from 2 up to 16 lines.</p> <p>My question is which design is better?</p> <p>My interests are keeping the database size as small as possible for as long as possible, ease of adding features and also ease of code maintainability.</p> <ol> <li>Have a BasePantun model and then create descendants inheriting from it?</li> <li>Have a monolith Pantun model where you keep fields named &quot;Line10&quot;, &quot;Line11&quot; etc. empty? (This is my current implementation)</li> </ol> <p>My current observation from users using the app is that most of them tend to submit mostly 4-line pantuns.</p> <p>Another question I have is that I&#39;m planning to implement an award system.
