Typically, when I click on an expander, it opens and loads the data, making an API request in the backend. However, when I open Chrome DevTools and click on the expander, it doesn\u2019t open, and the API response is empty. Does anyone know what might be happening?</p> <p>The reason I am talking about Chrome DevTools is because I started using <a href=\"https://seleniumbase.io/\">selenium base</a> in <a href=\"https://seleniumbase.io/help_docs/uc_mode/\">UC mode</a> and the same behaviour is happening: most of the pages load, except those expanders and when I click on it, nothing happens: basically it makes some api requests but the result is empty. </p> <p>Any suggestions on how to overcome that?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/dimem16\"> /u/dimem16 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r",
