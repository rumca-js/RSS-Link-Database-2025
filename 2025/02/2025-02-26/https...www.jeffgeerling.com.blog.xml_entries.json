(It's certainly easier to stomach $10 in parts for a DIY mini rack instead of paying $150+ for a premium mini rack like DeskPi's!)</p>\n      <span class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><span>Jeff Geerling</span></span>\n<span class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">February 26, 2025",
