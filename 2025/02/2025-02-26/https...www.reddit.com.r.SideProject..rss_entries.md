<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A few months ago, I came across this (now deleted) post about someone who worked at a hotel and noticed a flaw in the hotel’s software. They ended up building a plugin to fix it... and made a nice side income from it. That got me thinking: How many other tiny or overlooked software issues are lurking out there, waiting for a solution?</p> <p>I wanted to help skip the guesswork so looking at negative reviews would highlight problems users would be having. If a solution was prominent enough, these users would likely convert or at least use a plug in to make their life easier.</p> <p>I basically analyzed over 150k negative reviews across around 8000 companies on G2 to find specific improvements that can be made on existing software that can potentially be made into a competitor for existing SaaS.</p> <p>I then used AI to analyze the negative reviews and find user problems and provide potential improvements to the existing software as a competitor or eve

I am simply sharing something that worked for me in the hopes that it might help someone else :)</p> <p>I am currently working on a gamified productivity tracker and was trying to generate early interest before launch. My goal was to have a group of early users to test the app and provide feedback. I posted on reddit, expecting people to signup immediately and praise my app, but instead my best post only got one upvote (the default one from me)</p> <p>A couple of days later, I changed my approach and posted again. Suddenly, I was receiving thousands of views and over 100 signups overnight.</p> <p>What changed?</p> <p>My old posts were uninteresting. The title was dull, something like &quot;need testers for my app,&quot; and the text was a plain explanation of the app’s features. There was no engaging image in the preview to catch anyone&#39;s eye. Befor

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I built an app called &quot;What Do You Owe?&quot; that basically solves the most awkward part of group dinners - splitting the bill. As a 17-year-old dev who&#39;s been coding for 4 years, I wanted to create something that actually makes people&#39;s lives easier.</p> <p>Here&#39;s the deal: You snap a photo of the receipt, and the app does all the heavy lifting. It breaks down each item, calculates individual shares, handles tips and taxes, and makes sure everyone pays exactly what they owe. No more calculator arguments or that one friend who &quot;forgets&quot; to include tax.</p> <p>Key features:</p> <ul> <li>Instant receipt scanning</li> <li>Automatic item breakdown</li> <li>Easy tip and tax calculation</li> <li>Works for restaurants, group trips, anything</li> </ul> <p>I&#39;ve been testing it with my friends, and it&#39;s already saved us from some pretty heated &quot;who ordered what&quot; debates. 😂</p> <p>Would love to hear what you think!

I&#39;ve experienced almost all the hardships of life at a young age. We have a broken family and we don&#39;t even have our own house. My mom is the only one who supports me in life. My siblings have their own families and my mom is getting old, weak, and doesn&#39;t have a job. I&#39;m her only hope. I remember suffering from headaches, which I thought were normal because I was always up late working. I often had shortness of breath and bruises would appear in different parts of my body, some big, some small, but they weren&#39;t painful. I felt extremely tired all the time, and I still feel it now, even worse. You know that feeling of being over-fatigued? That&#39;s how I feel.

To keep the energy high and the sleep deprived contestants laughing, we created <strong>Social Roast -</strong> an AI that generates personalized roasts based on Twitter handles. This became a <strong>fun activity throughout the hackathon</strong>, and honestly, we had an amazing time interacting with everyone. </p> <h1>How It Works:</h1> <ul> <li><strong>Enter any Twitter handle</strong> - Get a custom roast tailored to that person’s online presence.</li> <li><strong>Pick a ‘roaster’ handle</strong> - The AI mimics their tone &amp; style to craft a roast.</li> </ul> <p>For example, imagine getting roasted by your favorite comedian, a rival brand, or even a corporate social media account. Without objective morality, everything is permissible (just kidding guys, the roasts were all within limits :P) </p> <h1>Why We Built It:</h1>

I’d plunk money into them, but it never kept me in sync with what’s actually happening out there—market shifts, trends, all that stuff. I got hooked on this idea of mimicking what ETF managers do: figuring out proportions, deciding what to cut or add to keep things balanced. To me, that’s the heart of asset management, but I wasn’t glued to the news or tracking stocks daily. I’m no day trader.So I started thinking, what if I could adjust my own portfolio like that, maybe every month or six months? Not tweaking it constantly, but when I did, doing it right. And maybe it could double as a way to learn for people like me who aren’t all-in on Wall Street. I landed on this concept I call “copy trading

We’re not scanning your entire mailbox; we only see the emails you choose to forward. This means you get robust protection without giving up your privacy.</p> <p><strong>How it works:</strong><br/> MailArmor offers a free tier so anyone can benefit from scam protection, and for those with heavier usage needs we’ve got a paid plan with an even bigger one coming up soon to monitor multiple addresses (right now each account can only forward emails from the one used to sign up).</p> <p>I built this tool because I notice

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I just decided to start an agency - which will be a web development/ai solutions agency for mostly small business (for now). </p> <p>A months ago, I saw a tiktok of this guy that reached out to a potential client having had developed a site for the clients business.. in order to build his portfolio and also potentially make some money, should the client agree to work with him. </p> <p>And so when i decided to create an agency, literally 2 days ago.. I needed to get started or else I’d just talk myself out of it. And so I did research and found a law firm that didn’t have an active site in my town and decided to make one for them. I worked on it and it looks really good - just like the tiktok guy did. I haven’t reached out to the firm I’m going to soon but I’m not sure if this is good thing or not.. but I guess it’s good since it got me started. But I’m stuck on whether I should give them the site for free or not. Should I even propose they purchas

I found myself getting sucked into stuff I didn’t even want to see, and it was affecting my mood more than I’d like to admit.</p> <p>So, instead of just complaining about it, I built <strong>SubSieve</strong>, a Chrome extension that lets you filter out subreddits you don’t want to see on <strong><a href="/r/all">/r/all</a></strong>. It’s not a perfect solution, but it gives you some control over what you consume instead of letting the algorithm decide for you. You used to be able to do the same thing by filtering subreddits on <a href="http://old.reddit.com">old.reddit.com</a>, but that doesn&#39;t seem to work for me anymore, so I built this extension.</p> <p>I want to stress that this isn’t about burying my head in the sand or ign
