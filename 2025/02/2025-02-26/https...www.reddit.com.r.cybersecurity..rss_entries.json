Modern platforms are now leveraging AI, machine learning, and advanced tools like XDR and SOAR to detect threats in real-time and automate responses. This shift is reshaping how organizations approach cybersecurity.</p> <p>One of the most significant trends is the rise of cloud-based SIEM solutions. Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud-native platforms for their scalability, faster deployment, and cost-effectiveness. For smaller and midsize businesses, this is a game-changer, as it allows them to implement robust security measures without the heavy upfront costs of traditional on-premises systems.
