While some data structures from the standard library such as the std::vector gets you by 90% of the time you need to store and process data, there will be the occasional 10% that requires a unique take. \n\nThis presentation aims to discuss the unique data structures that are commonly used in video games / game engines that caters to the occasional 10%. We will go over several systems outlining their requirements, constraints and present custom data structures that gets the job done.\n---\n\nSlides: https://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2024/blob/main/Presentations/Data_Structures_That_Make_Video_Games_Go_Round.pdf\n\nSponsored by JetBrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/\n---\n\nAl-Afiq Yeong\n \nAl-Afiq Yeong is a Software ",
