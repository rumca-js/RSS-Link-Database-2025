<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><h1><a href="https://www.mamedev.org/?p=548">MAME 0.275</a></h1> <p>MAME 0.275 is out now! It’s been a short month, but there’s still been plenty of interesting development. This release adds support for several arcade games on PlayStation-based hardware, a few PowerBook Duo sub-notebook computers, some hand-held LCD games, and a couple of Casio music keyboards.</p> <p>Support for the Zorro II bus used in the Amiga 2000 has been improved, including DMA support and a few more emulated cards. Some graphical glitches in Konami arcade games have been fixed. The Oberheim DMX drum machine is now fully emulated. We’ve even optimised the recompilers a little more this month.</p> <p>You can read about all the work that’s gone into this release in the <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/releases/whatsnew_0275.txt">whatsnew.txt file</a>, or get source code and 64-bit Windows binary packages from <a href="https://www.mamedev.org/release.html">the download page</a>.</p
