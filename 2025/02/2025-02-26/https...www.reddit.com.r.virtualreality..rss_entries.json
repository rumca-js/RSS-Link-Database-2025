So when Im steam home VR everything is fine, when I play standalone quest 3 games it&#39;s fine, as soon as I launch a game on PC, doesn&#39;t matter what game, could be snake or minesweeper, I get these random stutters and they always come in pair. Sometimes they come after 30 seconds, sometimes after a 40-50s. But they always come. In VRchat it doesnt matter if im in an optimized box, or in a crowded place, they always come, I&#39;ve tried running on the lowest possible settings and the highest (VRchat settings, SteamVR settings, quest 3 settings), only difference is the fps is slightly lower or higher, but the stutters are exactly the same.

And while Varjo is definitely insanely nice resolution, the hassle of using it is not worth it for me. When I develop, I prefer Valve Index since it has the least amount of issues with software stuff. Tho Quest 3 has more reliable tracking overall.

Tho I would also like some integrated headphones for it, maybe they&#39;ll come up with something.</p> <p>But like I said, ideally I would take a MeganeX superlight formfactor with Quest 3 resolution and 144Hz.

I used to have an Acer mixed reality headset years ago. My wife has a quest 2 and I was looking for something a little more suited for use on a PC because it&#39;s a bit janky using it with the oculus software then trying to get it to work with steamvr. I would be fine buying used headsets but I&#39;m not really sure what&#39;s good. I was trying to keep the price relatively low like under $200 or so but if that not really worth it I could save up for something better instead.
