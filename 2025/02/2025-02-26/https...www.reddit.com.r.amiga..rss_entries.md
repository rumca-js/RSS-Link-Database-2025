<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I currently have a CF card attached to the internal IDE connector of the A1200. How big of a deal, if even possible, would it be, to have two IDE drives on that connector? Is it just a matter of cable? Any solutions?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/multioptional"> /u/multioptional </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1iyxjq3/a1200_two_drives_on_the_internal_ide_connector/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1iyxjq3/a1200_two_drives_on_the_internal_ide_connector/">[comments]</a></span>

## Reamiga 1200 or Amiga 1200 motherboard parts list/BOM

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in the process of build a reamiga motherboard. </p> <p>The designer provides a BOM for the active and passive surface mount components (<a href="https://www.reamiga.info/?page_id=38">https://www.reamiga.info/?page_id=38</a>), but this does not include the IDs for any of the connectors and headers.</p> <p>Does anyone know where I could get such an additional list? I could scavenge the old connectors from the donor board I&#39;m using but I would like use all new parts where possible. Plus the reamiga board has a number of additional headers the original motherboard does not.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/danby"> /u/danby </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1iymalx/reamiga_1200_or_amiga_1200_motherboard_parts/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1iymalx/reamiga_1200_or_amiga_1200_motherboard_parts/">[comments]</a></

## BlueSCSI v2 Power Cable?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m planning to purchase a BlueSCSI v2 for my Amiga A590 (Revision 7) but have a question about power requirements. From watching YouTube videos of installations on Revision 6 A590s (different power socket), I&#39;ve noticed some users connected a separate power cable while others didn&#39;t.</p> <p>Can the BlueSCSI v2 draw sufficient power directly from the SCSI connection on a Revision 7 A590, or should I purchase a dedicated power cable? If a power cable is necessary, would a standard floppy drive power cable work? <a href="https://www.amigakit.com/floppy-disk-drive-power-cable-12cm-length-p-287.html">https://www.amigakit.com/floppy-disk-drive-power-cable-12cm-length-p-287.html</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/retrolinuz"> /u/retrolinuz </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1iygkir/bluescsi_v2_power_cable/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.r

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;m a pixel artist and recently i&#39;ve been diving into the demo scene and specially what seems to be called Sceners? Like, artists that took pre existing artwork and made absolutely godlike level pixel art based on it. Been having a good time on Amiga Graphics Archive, but I would like to actually load some demos on my PC and... maybe I&#39;m missing some key words or amiga lango here, but from my research there is still no way to load and explore a demo on Windows for free on 2025?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/r_rogarth"> /u/r_rogarth </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1iyfbyn/help_loading_demos/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1iyfbyn/help_loading_demos/">[comments]</a></span>
