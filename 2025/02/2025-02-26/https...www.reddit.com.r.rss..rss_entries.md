<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all,</p> <p>So The Verge has just implemented a supremely annoying new idea consisting of recurring recap articles which just contain a long list of links to every other article they have ever published on any particular subject. Think &quot;Everything you need to understand about smart homes&quot;, or &quot;Elon and salutes: all you need to know&quot;...</p> <p>So to avoid these constant (repeating) lists clogging up my feed, I copied the exact title and created a simple rule whenever one appeared: &lt;If words in title = xyz&gt; then &lt;delete article&gt;</p> <p>My problem is that although when i use Feedbro&#39;s option to &quot;test&quot; a rule, it works just fine - in real use no article ever seems to be deleted.</p> <p>I&#39;m probably missing something obvious - but any help would be great.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cutlack"> /u/Cutlack </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.redd
