<p>What could possibly be more fun than going out into an untamed wilderness, slaughtering dozens of terrifying creatures, then eating them and wearing their skin? Nothing! Which is probably why <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></em> is currently number one with a <s>bullet</s> arrow made from dragon fangs on the Steam charts even before it’s out. And if you buy some new gear from AMD, you can get it for free.</p>



<p>The latest freebie game for CPU and graphics card buyers is Capcom’s hotly-anticipated sequel to <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>. AMD will give you a free game code if you buy one of the following Ryzen CPUs:</p>

<p>Microsoft is currently rolling out a new optional update for Windows 11 24H2. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/february-25-2025-kb5052093-os-build-26100-3323-preview-053856ea-f984-4bdb-866c-5f356f5a451b">Update KB5052093</a> brings some new features, but also adds some self-promotion to the system with Microsoft placing a banner in the system settings to emphasize Game Pass.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into the more notable changes.</p>

<p>Google is changing how Chrome extensions work on the desktop and Chromebooks. While the Manifest V3 changes are billed as ways to improve safety and efficiency, the way they also <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2423294/google-is-killing-one-of-chromes-biggest-ad-blockers.html">limit how adblocking extensions like uBlock Origin work</a> has drawn a lot of criticism. And now, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2595287/ublock-origin-is-officially-dead-for-chrome-but-ad-blockers-live-on.html">uBlock Origin is dead on Chrome</a> (along with any other Manifest v2 extensions).</p>



<p>I’m sure the fact that Google is the world’s biggest advertising company has nothing to do with it. </p>
