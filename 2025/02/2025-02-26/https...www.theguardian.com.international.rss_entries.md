<p>The Academy Award nominees assembled for their annual group portrait, but who scooped the prize for looking the most bored?</p><p>Every year during Oscars week, it has become tradition for all the nominees to meet up and eat a meal together. This is usually followed by a group photo; something that the people in attendance can look back upon and cherish, knowing that for this one moment all competition fell away and they found joy in surrounding themselves with their gifted colleagues.</p><p>At least that’s the idea. As anyone who has ever been in a group photo will attest, these things are an absolute mess. There are simply too many people to control, and the resulting image is generally a free-for-all of weird costumes, odd expressions and seemingly hostile body language. As such, let’s use this year’s Oscars class photo to hand out some awards of our own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/26/oscars-group-photo-timothee-chalamet-zoe-saldana-ariana-grande-cyn

<p>Workers at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fear crackdown will have global fallout</p><p>The Trump administration has set its sights on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency, with significant cuts and a political crackdown on climate science. As Trump takes aim at the agency, the impact is likely to be felt across the US and around the world.</p><p>Noaa provides essential resources to the public and has helped make the US a scientific leader internationally. Operating 18 satellites and 15 research and survey ships, the agency’s scientists, engineers and policy experts issue forecasts relied on by aviation, agriculture and fishing industries; ocean floor mapping depended upon for shipping; advises on species protection, and increasingly precise and accurate modeling on what to expect as climate crisis unfolds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/us-climate-research-agency-noa
