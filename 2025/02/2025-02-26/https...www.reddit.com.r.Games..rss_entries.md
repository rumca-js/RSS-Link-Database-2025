In order to be called in and thus to work, I must first accept these clauses. At first glance, they are not acceptable, which aligns with the opinion of my specialized audiovisual lawyer. I find myself forced to “give up” the role I had been selected for, after 6 years. In no way can I “force” the rest of the cast to do the same.</p> <p>But what I want to say is: if we refuse, we will no longer portray these roles. If we accept, we are essentially endorsing the addendum.</p> <p><strong>TH

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>As you probably know, our next project will not be a full-scale RPG (like Age of Decadence and Colony Ship). If it&#39;s the first time you&#39;re reading about it, here&#39;s why: </p> <p>Colony Ship sold well (for an obscure indie RPG), but not enough to pay for a more ambitious and complex sequel. The plan was not to do another story on the same ship, but to continue the story after planetfall. Such a game - such a new world with everything that entails - would have required a bigger team and a much bigger budget. We simply don&#39;t have the resources to undertake that now, but hopefully we can come back to it later. </p> <p>So we&#39;re in a situation where we can &#39;go the distance&#39; and handle a 4-5 year long project, provided we keep the costs low and focus on combat, i.e. a complex tactical RPG. We know that some people will be disappointed, but it&#39;s either that or shutting down for good. So let&#39;s roll the dice one last time and

## The causes of Midway's downfall (and why only Warner Bros brought out its assets)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>While Midway&#39;s financial problems that killed the company are well-known-enough the exact inner workings on how Midway got to that state are still not as well-known</p> <p>Midway did not futureproof themselves when the inevitable decline of the arcade game scene hit the US. Rather than release games directly to the NES and SNES and develop console-originated IP like what Capcom did, Midway chose to license their properties to other partners, most notably Acclaim Entertainment, and stick to arcade games. At the time it wasn&#39;t an unreasonable decision, as Midway was hesitant on entering the American console game space due to the North American Video Game Crash of 1983 giving American game studios an extremely dirty name when it came with console games. The licensing deal between Midway and Acclaim was that Acclaim got most of the profits and that Acclaim got first dibs to Midway titles. Midway even got into a legal battle with Acclaim over NBA
