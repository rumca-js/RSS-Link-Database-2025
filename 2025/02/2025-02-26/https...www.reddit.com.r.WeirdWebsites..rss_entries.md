All the links lead to random fake product pages. Some of the products are really weird (“6 year old boy”). If you click on the Gibbons Funeral Home logo, it links to a real funeral home in Illinois. 4.0 stars on google, 14 reviews, still open. There does not seem to be a way to cross back over from the funeral home’s website into the weird slop
