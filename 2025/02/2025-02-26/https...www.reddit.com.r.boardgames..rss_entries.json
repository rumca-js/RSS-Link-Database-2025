Maybe someone here can help me.</p> <p>Im looking for a specific pen and paper RPG that was on Kickstarter around the year 2022, around April. It was set in a grimdark medieval fantasy setting with a main antagonist being a hooved goat like entity. The game had 4 Characters (pretty standard ones I guess) and advertised itself with flashy anime style combat. Also it was purely set on one shot campagins I know one of the versions was like 80+ euros and included figurines for the characters.</p> <p>Im very sorry for not having more Information.

Does anyone know if the game has a lot of complex text, or is it mostly symbols and easy-to-understand rules? Would it be a hassle to play without understanding Dutch, or should we just return it before open the box? I saw that sometimes English card has french translation below. Maybe this is the case for dutch version wit English translation? </p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/oncugultekin\"> /u/oncugultekin </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1iykr9k/do_i_need_to_get_the_english_version_of_risk_if_i/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1iykr9k/do_i_need_to_get_the_english_version_of_risk_if_i/\">[comments]</a></span>",

Or do you prefer paying in full upfront to have complete control and avoid any risks? </p> <p>From our perspective as a business, offering installments comes with some challenges.

My group has played just 3 Trick Taking games: Skull King, Cat in the Box and The Fellowship of the Ring. We realized that the only game we were playing correctly was Cat in the Box, which was our first trick taking game ever. When we learned how to play skull King we skipped a very important rule that is: You MUST follow the trick with a card of the same suit if able. Since Cat in the box cards have no suit, we basically skipped that portion of the rules. Sometimes we kept cards of the lead suit and dispose low value cards of other suits if we didn&#39;t want to win the trick. I don&#39;t know how we missed that. We loved both games and then I saw The Fellowship of The Ring game. I had to get it! So we played last night and we thought it was super easy and hardly a challenge. Just let Frodo lead with X card and throw rings at him once or twice until he gets the cards. Piece of cake. Does Sam need to win the 3 of ",
