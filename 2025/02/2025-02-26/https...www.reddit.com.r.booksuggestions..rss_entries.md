But nowadays I&#39;m really interested in Stephen King and I finished his book Carrie; it was a really beautiful and well written book. When I did research, people recommended the Dark Tower series a lot, I would be happy to hear if you have other suggestions.</p> <p>note: I have seen The Shining, It, The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption on the big screen, but Kubrick is my favorite director.

For whatever reason. </p> <p>I want to read a deeply introspective, character driven with litte plot story about this type of character overcoming his struggles or straight up surviving a suicide attempt, it doesn&#39;t really matter so long as he makes it. He doesn&#39;t even have to be fully recovered by the end, I&#39;d just like for the book to end at least with the beginning of his recovery. I&#39;m open to a romance subplot. </p> <p>I

One of the two must be written pre-1900. You don’t have to, but I would also like to do a text in translation for one of the two. I want to study the theme of cultural change, mainly the transition from tradition and cultural heritage into modernity.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My mom and I have our own little book club and my dad said he wanted to join jokingly, and we made fun of him because he hasn’t read a book for fun probably like ever. I still feel like I’m learning about my dad and what he likes, but I wanted to surprise him with a book he might like. He’s very sentimental so even if he doesn’t read it, maybe he’ll still love it and flip through it/cherish it. Suggestions?? Here are some random dad things he likes 😭 </p> <p>-baseball!!! -oldies music like Elvis -Godzilla -fixing things. Extremely handy person -Classic cars -he doesn’t like “weird” or scary things -doesn’t care for politics or history or religion -very sentimental. He lost his dad that he had a complicated relationship with when he was 20. He also has lost an uncle and a sister. -he loves funny things and silly creatures. He loves animals. </p> <p>Maybe something that would make him feel happy. Like a lot of older dads, I think he just holds in a lot

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in desperate need for good books. I miss reading books with actual plot and good writing instead of just smut. I love books that focus on mental health and past trauma, thrillers, dystopians, and sci fi that all have romance B plots. I&#39;m not a big fantasy person and I dont wanna read a fluffy Hallmark book rn. Im ok with 1.0-2.5 🌶 scale, but I love the yearning in YA books so much better. I&#39;d really want something with substance</p> <p>Here&#39;s some books and what I thought abt them to maybe narrow down my taste:</p> <p>Liked: Twisted Games, People We Meet on Vacation, The Cruel Prince, The Inheritance Games (THE FIRST 2 WERE SO GOOD but the ending stunk), Punk 57 (guilty pleasure ik its bad), Lights Out, Priest (shockingly made me go down a religious guilt rabbit hole).</p> <p>Loved: The Shatter Me series is my all time favorite, The Boys of Tommen books (im actually shannon and joey😭), Yours Truly, The Naturals (SO MUCH BETTER THA

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Pillars of the Earth did a masterful job of illustrating the feel of a world before. The characters’ stories interconnect as they grow from childhood through to old age. The reader gets a sense of how people lived their lives and how everyday things were once accomplished. The ambitions and aspirations of the diverse array of characters are explored in depth; each with a sense of personality. Their stories are both fantastic and tragic; thrilling and full of sorrow; enthralling and profound; heartbreaking and regretful. Ken Follet takes his readers on a journey of both scandal and humility in a novel that touches to the core of human achievement. Pillars of The Earth is master stroke of triumph.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JollyDefinition9786"> /u/JollyDefinition9786 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iyibop/pillars_of_the_earth_by_ken_follet/">[link]

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m looking for any books about two women falling in love. Could be YA, contemporary, fantasy, sci-fi, historical, mature, etc. My one request is that it&#39;s not the sugary-sweet, PSA-style that seems to be really popular right now among queer fiction. I want the characters to be interesting and the love story compelling. </p> <p>My favorite book series (with lesbian characters/romances) is The Locked Tomb. I didn&#39;t really care for Traitor Baru Coromont, which felt very dry and boring, but I know that&#39;s the next series that&#39;s always recommended if you&#39;ve read TLT. </p> <p>I&#39;ve also heard some good things about Priory of the Orange Tree, so I purchased that recently and will begin reading soon, but I&#39;m still on the search for more lesbian stories. </p> <p>(And don&#39;t be afraid to recommend more fluffy and light stuff, just so long as it&#39;s not after school special-y!)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32
