<p>You can’t develop software and manage software projects for 30 years and not learn a thing or two or twelve about writing good code. Here are a near-dozen nuggets of coding wisdom I picked up along the way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="simpler-is-better">Simpler is better</h2>



<p>This basic idea almost goes without saying, but I am frequently surprised at how often the KISS principle (“Keep it simple, stupid”) is ignored. Developers seem to love newfangled ways of doing things. Why do a “simple create and use an object” when you can pass around lambdas to do all the work? Why use a simple, standard data structure when you can build your own, custom, cutting-edge solution? What’s a

<p>Asynchronous programming, or <em>async</em>, is a feature of many modern languages that allows a program to juggle multiple operations without waiting or getting hung up on any one of them. It’s a smart way to efficiently handle tasks like network or file I/O, where most of the program’s time is spent waiting for tasks to finish.</p>



<p>Consider a web scraping application that opens 100 network connections. You could open one connection, wait for the results, then open the next and wait for the results, and so on. Most of the time the program runs is spent waiting on a network response, not doing actual work.</p>



<p>Async gives you a more efficient method: Open all 100 connections at once
