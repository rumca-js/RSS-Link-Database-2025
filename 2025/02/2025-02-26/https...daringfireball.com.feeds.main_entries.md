<p>I referenced Downie twice earlier today — once in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/monroe-indie-app-business">my item linking to Charlie Monroe</a> (developer of Downie) writing about the indie app business, and earlier <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/ive-desert-island-discs">in my post about using Downie to download the MP3</a> from Jony Ive’s interview on the BBC’s Desert Island Discs.</p>

<p>I somehow hadn’t heard of (or more likely, just hadn’t noticed) Downie until a few weeks ago, when I first came across <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-few-words-about-indie-app-business/">Monroe’s blog post</a>, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/01/31/a-few-words-about-indie-app-business/">via Michael Tsai</a>. Here’s the pitch for Downie, from its website:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But also don’t do this alone. I work 365 days a year. Last year, I
worked 366 days (2024 was leap year). I’m not saying that I work 8
hours each day, but even during weekends, holidays, vacation, I
need to tend to support emails in the morning for an hour or so
and then once more in the afternoon or evening. I cannot just take
off and leave for a few days without seeing the consequences and
going insane when I get back. I currently receive about 100
reports from my apps each day. Some are about license code issues,
some are crash reports, some are Permute conversion issues, some
are Downie download issues, but it all adds up to the average of
the 100 reports a day.</p>

<p>If I were to leave for a vacation for 10 days… You do the math
what would I be getting back to. Plus your

<p>Desert Island Discs is a BBC audio interview program hosted (or <em>presented</em>, if you will) by Lauren Laverne. The gimmick is that guests are asked to name eight songs, a book, and a “luxury item” they’d take with them if stranded on a desert island, and those picks — including playing the songs — are sprinkled throughout the interview. This week’s guest is Jony Ive, and it’s one of the best interviews with him I’ve ever encountered. Incredibly thoughtful and inspiring, and Laverne covers a lot of ground without ever seeming the least bit hurried.</p>

<p>A few highlights, from Ive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think that one of the struggles I have, though, is in some ways,
I think ironically, I struggle with being present in the now
because I spend so much of my life in my head in the future. The
way I try to understand the future is I’m obsessed with the past.
And so the bit that often gets missed out is right now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know that feeling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple shareholders rebuffed an attempt to pressure the technology
trendsetter into joining President Donald Trump’s push to scrub
corporate programs designed to diversify its workforce.</p>
