A few years after, I saw PC gamers playing the Index and thought it looked amazing, but really expensive and niche. I never got the chance to try one.</p> <p>Fast forward about 8 years to June of last year, when I won a Quest 2 at a work event. I lOVED IT!! So much more than I thought I would. I played through the first half of Asgard&#39;s Wrath 2 and no longer got motion sickness (with comfort settings). I enjoyed it so much that I decided to upgrade to a Quest 3 only a month later in July. Unfortunately, it had a dead pixel, so I had to go through the warranty claim process and ended up with a refurbished unit. Now on my 3rd Ques

Just not enough to drop another grand on a new headset. But I&#39;m reluctant to hold off for much longer in case things like VR headsets begin to climb even higher in price soon.</p> <p>As the title suggests, I&#39;m about ready to upgrade and not sure if I should hold off for any upcoming devices or just bite the bullet and get something now. I poked around at <a href="https://vr-compare.com/">https://vr-compare.com/</a> and I see that there are a lot of options, but I&#39;m more interested in hearing from the community. </p> <p>I plan to play new and old VR games, and I use it to exercise (especially during the winter).

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Question is in the title. As the quest3 games doesnt really come to pc anymore, and less titles are there for PCVR sadly im leaning towards 5080 way more as its newer, and the multi frame gen would be nice&#39;ish.</p> <p>Although i really would like to play my VR games on virtualdesktop godlike, and do some UEVR games, as my 4070 wasnt enough for this, so im really thinking about these.</p> <p>My flatscreen monitor is 1080p (2560x1080) tho, so i only care about VR higher resolutions, in flat, 5080 would be probably enough.</p> <p>TY!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gazop"> /u/Gazop </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1im2amg/which_gpu_would_you_get_in_my_place_quest3/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1im2amg/which_gpu_would_you_get_in_my_place_quest3/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>so i know that the quest 3 can do pcvr, but i was wondering if it runs the pcvr on the quest&#39;s system or your pc, as in would my pcvr games be limited byt the quest 3&#39;s power rather than my pc&#39;s, if that makes sense. I want to be able to run bonelab and blade and sorcery with less lag and the pcvr mods so i was wondering how it works.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/mrpringlescan101"> /u/mrpringlescan101 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1im1iet/quest_3_pcvr/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1im1iet/quest_3_pcvr/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Can you confirm this is a bug in the game and not a problem on my end?</p> <p>There seems to be an issue while walking on foot with the Index controllers. You lose stamina as if you are running by just walking normally. So you are constantly losing stamina. And when you run, can only run for like 2 seconds. Using Vive wands I don&#39;t lose any stamina while walking, and I run for much longer, like 9 seconds. I searched the issue but can&#39;t find anything related to it.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NES64Super"> /u/NES64Super </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ilzavq/anyone_with_no_mans_sky_and_index_controllers/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1ilzavq/anyone_with_no_mans_sky_and_index_controllers/">[comments]</a></span>
