Lauren Aratani reports</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of January\u2019s Potomac River tragedy, the deadliest US air disaster since 9/11, few might have expected Donald Trump to point so quickly to one alleged culprit: DEI policies. But as the Guardian US reporter <strong>Lauren Aratani </strong>explains, Trump\u2019s comments were just the latest chapter in the long fight against diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.</p><p>Lauren tells <strong>Helen Pidd </strong>that DEI policies were born in the 1960s as part of an effort by employers to broadly address injustice and exclusion. Today they are based on actively considering a person\u2019s identity (race, gender, sexuality, disability, class etc) when engaging with them, and they arguably reached their peak in the flurry of corporate announcements that emerged after the 2020 killing of George Floyd.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/feb",
