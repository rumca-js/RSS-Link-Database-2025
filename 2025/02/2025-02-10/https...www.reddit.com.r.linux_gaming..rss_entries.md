Following the same tempo.</p> <p>I&#39;m spitballing and slightly nervous on asking for advice on this topic. Has anyone tried this? Am I still naive? Would you appreciate the focus on Linux first?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, pretty new to linux/linux gaming (latter being mostly just my steam deck), i intend to main linux in a dual boot setup once i build a new pc mainly because win11 seems drwadful and most of my day to day use doesn&#39;t require windows anyway. Probably going for a nobara/bazzite install.</p> <p>Uh, anyway, ime emulation can add noticeable amounts of input lag/latency. Proton however doesn&#39;t need to emulate hardware, rather just translate api calls and such (to my knowledge) so i was wondering if anyone has measured it or noticed any or found ways to reduce it? (i remember reading something about needing to change something to turn off some sort of anti tearing feature in the os) and something similar to AMD&#39;s antilag feature that they ended up nuking after it got people banned in online games, the linux copy was called something like latencyflex iirc?</p> <p>Will be going for an All AMD setup on AM5 if that matters.</p> <p>Thanks.</p

In both cases it doesn&#39;t Show anything of the game and doesn&#39;t throw an error.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried searching around, but all I could find Was about compiling the WPE game for Linux, not launching a Compiler game. Any Tips on what else I could try?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ladripper47874"> /u/Ladripper47874 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1im0ky2/play_wpe_games_on_linux/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1im0ky2/play_wpe_games_on_linux/">[comments]</a></span>

That’s not to mention the occasional corruptions caused by some rather unstable packages. Worst of all, the Linux kernel is not compatible with Easy Anti-Cheat, preventing me from playing some games I really enjoy.</p> <p>Do you think there is a suitable Distro for me?</p> <p>Thank you very much in advance.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OptimalEnvironment41"> /u/OptimalEnvironment41 </a> <br/
