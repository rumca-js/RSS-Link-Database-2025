Do you still use it?\n11:21 I know you\u2019re still using xmonad primarily and...I noticed that your Xmonad config could use a polish. \n13:45 When you start talking, I always know you're going to take a long time... You really like taking your time, don't you?\n14:00 I was looking for ways to securing appimages running on my Arch system with permission management like flatpaks.\n15:36 Where are your videos on odysee? This video isn't there atm. Please see message and upload to odysee. Thank you.\n17:26 You say you don't care about all the drama in the FOSS community, but I think you should start speaking out on it. This seems to be a growing problem.\n21:28 Thanks to Patrons\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n\ud83d\udcb0 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n\ud83d\udcb3",
