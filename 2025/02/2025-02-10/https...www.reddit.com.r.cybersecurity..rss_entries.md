<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi everyone,</p> <p>I&#39;m working on Algocrawl, an advanced non-headless web crawler inspired by Acunetix DeepScan. Right now, I have the only working version, and it&#39;s not open source yet. I&#39;m trying to decide whether it makes sense to open-source it and, if so, why someone would want to collaborate.</p> <p>Currently, the closest open-source alternative is ZAP Client Scan (v2.16), but it’s too outdated—it still relies on Selenium instead of modern frameworks like Playwright and lacks proper DOM wait functions, relying on fixed timeouts instead. This makes it less effective at fully detecting issues in dynamic web applications.</p> <p>So, I have a few key questions:</p> <p>Is there a real need for a tool like this? Would people actually use it?</p> <p>Would anyone be interested in contributing if I open-source it? What would motivate you to collaborate?</p> <p>Or does it make more sense to keep it private?</p> <p>I’d love to hear your thoug
