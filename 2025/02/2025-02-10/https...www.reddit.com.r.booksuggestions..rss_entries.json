I\u2019ve noticed recently that I\u2019m not happy with the great life I have and am always wanting more and more... a bigger house, a nicer car, etc. We have a great house, but I struggle to enjoy it because the other houses on my street are bigger and nicer. I want to move away from that and learn to be content with what I have. I don\u2019t want to chase happiness but to feel content with \u201cenough.\u201d Are there any books to help me learn and choose to be content with enough instead of feeling down that other people have more?
