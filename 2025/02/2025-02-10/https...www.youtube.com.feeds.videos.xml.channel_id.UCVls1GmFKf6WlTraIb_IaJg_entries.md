On this episode of HEY DT:
0:00 Intro
0:20 Why don't you use vanilla Arch?
7:10 Is there a place where I can see a list of all your videos?
8:26 Were you recently interviewed and where can we watch it?
9:53 How has Syncthing been treating you? Do you still use it?
11:21 I know youâ€™re still using xmonad primarily and...I noticed that your Xmonad config could use a polish. 
13:45 When you start talking, I always know you're going to take a long time... You really like taking your time, don't you?
14:00 I was looking for ways to securing appimages running on my Arch system with permission management like flatpaks.
15:36 Where are your videos on odysee? This video isn't there atm. Please see message and upload to odysee. Thank you.
17:26 You say you don't care about all the drama in the FOSS community, but I think you should start speaking out on it. This seems to be a growing problem.
21:28 Thanks to Patrons
