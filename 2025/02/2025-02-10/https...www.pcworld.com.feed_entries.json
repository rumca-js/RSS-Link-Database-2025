It\u2019s a novel approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re an old person like me, Discord is sort of like Slack or Microsoft Teams but much more annoying. Though it was originally designed for organizing gaming groups, it has increasingly become a kind of cross-platform chatroom used by many companies for online customer service. In that sense, it seems like a natural fit for direct sales, if not without a few organizational hur",
