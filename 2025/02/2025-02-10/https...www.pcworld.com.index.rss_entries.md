<p>When looking for a top-notch VPN, the two most important things to look for are privacy and speed. While privacy is crucial to a good VPN, speed shouldn’t be overlooked. Faster speeds mean quicker file downloads and website load times, higher-quality streaming, and just a better all-around experience.</p>



<p>I’ve tested numerous VPNs and run their servers through countless speed tests to determine the fastest services based on network averages. My picks showcase the very best with the fastest download speeds, the fastest upload speeds, and more. Read below to see PCWorld’s curated list of the fastest VPNs available now.</p>



<p><strong>Why you should trust me:</strong> Here at PCWorld we’ve been testing computer hardware, software, and services since the 1980s. I’m continually testing all of the major VPNs on the market and many lesser-known services

<p>You might not need a TV antenna to cut the cord, but one can be indispensable if you want to record over-the-air channels.</p>



<p>With an over-the-air DVR, you can record shows from an antenna, rewind live TV broadcasts, and even fast forward through commercials. Some DVRs can even stream video onto multiple TVs or let you watch from outside the home.</p>



<p>The over-the-air DVR field has narrowed considerably in recent years, but some smaller hardware and software makers are still putting up the good fight, providing a level of control you <a href="https://www.techhive.com/article/2017418/why-over-the-air-dvr-is-still-worth-it.html">just don’t get from streaming services alone</a>.</p>

<p>Imagine if that refrigerator you bought just five years ago suddenly up and died—and not because of some technical glitch, but because the manufacturer deliberately reached out and deactivated it, permanently. You’d be furious, right? And you’d probably want a refund, too. </p>



<p>As wild as that scenario sounds for a major appliance like a refrigerator or a TV, it happens more often than you’d think in the smart home world. From the doomed Dropcam to the abandoned Revolv smart hub, there’s a long, sad parade of smart home devices that have turned into paperweights.   </p>



<p>We’ve compiled a list of 10 infamous examples of killer smart home products that—for one reason or another—were abandoned by their manufacturers. </p>

<p>Youtube has been trying to push users toward Premium for a while now, dangling all kinds of benefits ranging from ad-free viewing to extra features like downloading videos for offline playback and playing videos in the background while using other apps.</p>



<p>That all sounds nice, but some people are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2107229/why-i-wont-pay-to-avoid-ads-on-youtube.html">never going to pay to remove ads on YouTube</a>.

It’s a refurbished model, but with 8GB of RAM and a two-year warranty, it’s still an incredibly affordable way to get a decent laptop.</p>



<p>The Asus CX15 is a 15.6-inch laptop, and yeah, it’s pretty basic even by Chromebook standards. The Intel Celeron N4500 is a dual-core CPU from 2021, with DDR4 memory support and UHD integrated graphics. 8GB of memory is low for a modern Windows laptop, but it’s more than enough for ChromeOS as long as you don’t go ham on the browser ta

<p>With fast read and write speeds of up to 1,050MB/s, you can move files to and from your computer in a flash. In fact, considering how speedy it is, you can even use it with other devices, such as your gaming consoles, allowing you to store games and game data.</p>

<p>Whether it’s politics or tech, we live in a polarizing world.  Since Elon Musk took over Twitter and renamed it X, the platform has become an increasingly important tool in his political ambitions. This is causing many users to leave the service.</p>



<p>X and other social media services are criticized for their algorithms that encourage hate and conflict, and for having too little respect for privacy. That’s why there’s a desire for an alternative service and, for a long time, many talked about Mastodon as the main challenger. </p>



<p>Today, Bluesky is perceived as the most interesting alternative. The number of users is growing rapidly, too–reaching 30 million at the time of writing. If you’re looking to ditch X in favor of Bluesky, we’ll help you get started. </p>

<p>Yes, AIs can write recipes and sometimes they’re pretty good! (And sometimes not so much.) But for my latest challenge, I wanted to build an AI that would compose recipes from iPhone snapshots and put them in the proper format for my recipe app. Sound easy? Not really, as it turned out.</p>



<p>Now, it’s not all <em>that </em>tricky to have, say, ChatGPT write on-the-fly recipes based on photos–you can even do it using Apple Intelligence on an iPhone. Just take a snap of a meal with Visual Intelligence, ask for a description (Siri will hand that task off to ChatGPT), then follow up with a request for a recipe.</p>



<p>So, how good are these recipes? That’s a topic for a whole different story, but in my experience, they’re a hit and miss. A ChatGPT recipe that called for cornstarch in a salmon honey glaze turned out to be rather dull and chalky while a
