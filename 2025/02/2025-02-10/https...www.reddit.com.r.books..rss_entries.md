<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It’s black history month, so of course the library has displays in the children’s area filled with books about Rosa Parks, MLK Jr., Harriet Tubman, etc., but I can’t seem to find any kids books about Fred Hampton. I’ve even looked on Amazon to see if there are titles out there that just aren’t in my library, but I haven’t had any luck. Can someone recommend some kids books about Fred Hampton? I’d like a picture book, but even a kids chapter book would be better than what I’ve been able to find. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/-eyes_of_argus-"> /u/-eyes_of_argus- </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1imi41h/childrens_books_about_fred_hampton/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1imi41h/childrens_books_about_fred_hampton/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The Demon of Unrest by Erik Larson (2024)</p> <p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- A Must-Read for History Fans</p> <p>I have a lot of thoughts on this book so please bear with me as I attempt to flesh them out. As a long time Erik Larson fan, I was certainly very happy to complete his latest work. I normally try to focus these reviews on the author and the artist, but I confess I am likely to stray from that model in this review. I find this work so relevant to today&#39;s political and cultural atmosphere in America, that I just need to get them down and out of my skull. I will try to tread as carefully as possible.</p> <p>The Demon of Unrest may not be necessarily Larson&#39;s most enjoyable read, but I think it is his most important to the current state of affairs in the United States. The book focuses on the momentous event that ignited the Civil War, America&#39;s bloodiest conflict (so far). The event, the shelling of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861 by the confederat

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished the Otherland series by Tad Williams, and I cannot recommend it enough. I haven&#39;t read much in the sci-fi/fantasy genres and I wanted to change that, so on a trip to Half Price Books I happened upon the first volume of Otherland. </p> <p>I had never heard of it before, and I&#39;m amazed now how it&#39;s isn&#39;t better known. For those that love sci fi and cyberpunk, if for whatever reason you haven&#39;t gotten to this one, you need to. </p> <p>Otherland (written in the mid 90s to the early 2000s) is the story of a VR world where children have begun to disappear into, becoming comatose in real life. We follow a large cast of characters who set off into the mysterious Otherland area of the VR world to rescue the children. There&#39;s Renie and !Xabbu from South Africa out to rescue Renie&#39;s brother. Orlando and Fredericks, two friends in an RPG world who more or less stumble into the Otherland mystery. There&#39;s Paul Jonas,

Let&#39;s start with characters </p> <p>Mitsu: the most crybaby I&#39;ve seen. I&#39;ll talk about his inability to act later, but let&#39;s the take the books &quot;It&#39;s needed to show an idea&quot;. So you&#39;re saying Mitsu represents a country in turbulence? Why? The writer couldn&#39;t find a suiting character and just wrote this character specially for the plot to happen. I hate this kind of things. In literature, you should concentrate on the language, the wordplay, the &quot;painting&quot; you&#39;re trying to paint. To put a character with focused on inability to do anything in the plot is like getting the nose of a person wrong and then cutting it with a knife and placing it rightly - it&#39;s not art, it&#39;s not sophisticated, it&#39;s inability to draw a character. But he&#39;s too intertwined with other characters, so let&#39

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I suffered through Crisis because I dislike not finishing books. In the beginning the book was a page turner, really good pace, intriguing story, but it all fell apart very quickly. The story doesn&#39;t hold, there are so many incongruencies, the characters are so poorly developed. This was the first book by Robin Cook I&#39;ve read in years - I think I read one or two when I was a teenager and I remember liking them, so I decided to get both Crisis and Coma on sale. But I was not expecting it to be this bad. Now I have Coma staring at me and I&#39;m not sure if I want to <del>suffer through it</del> read it. I believe Coma is one of his best books and the story seems really interesting. On the other hand life is too short, and my TBR is huge lol Has anyone read the two books?

You’re telling me there were multiple bunkers full of women &amp; none of the men killed/raped them in this dystopian world?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Puffin has released a new <em>First Impressions</em> series of Jane Austen’s novels, featuring pastel-colored, modern YA-style covers and introductions by contemporary romance authors. The goal appears to be making Austen more appealing to younger readers, especially those drawn to BookTok trends.</p> <p>This raises an interesting question: Can redesigning classics with modern aesthetics actually make them more accessible, or does it risk misrepresenting their tone? While some might appreciate a fresh look that could attract new readers, others may feel that these covers give the wrong impression about the content of Austen’s novels.</p> <p>Does marketing classics this way help new generations connect with them, or do you think it underestimates young readers’ willingness to engage with traditional literature? If you’re an Austen fan, do you think this is a positive approach? If you’re new to her work, would this kind of redesign influence your inter
