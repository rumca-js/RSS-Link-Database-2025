<p>There may be a book I want to read, there may not. But making the choice feels so much easier than keeping up with new releases</p><p>I am a voracious reader, but it is easy to feel there are too many books in the world. How do you find the time to keep up with all those new releases? To say nothing of the overwhelm that comes from even stepping in a bookshop. There you’re faced with not only the latest titles but also the classics you’ve missed and the biographies you hadn’t heard of but find yourself drawn to. The library is the same – the masses of books too frequently inspires inertia.</p><p>But around the corner from my house is the local little street library – a small wooden box with a plastic door, holding the donated books of my neighbourhood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/11/in-a-world-of-overwhelming-choice-i-love-the-whittled-down-book-selection-at-my-local-street-library">Continue reading...</a>

It’s the third in a series set in the troubled West Yorkshire town and centred round Detective Harry Virdee and his conflicted personal and professional loyalties, and I am going to need them all.</p><p>This is a switchbacking ride from the off. We open with a man apparently on the run from the police, until it turns out he <em>is</em> the police. Virdee (Game of Thrones’ Staz Nair) is in pursuit of the man he suspects can give him the whereabouts of missing teenager Ateeq Farooqi (Yousef Naseer).

<p>It’s time to stop pussyfooting over any link between puzzles and dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and all the rest</p><p>It’s easy to understand why the question is often asked: might Wordle – or the crossword, or the sudoku – be a shield against forgetfulness, senescence, even dementia? After all, puzzles sit right there, new ones appearing among the news every day. And in fiction we’ve seen the very smartest people – the people superspy George Smiley turns to for advice – knocking off wordplay while cracking espionage rings.</p><p>When it comes to detail, though, the answer has one of two flavours. The first, the responsible flavour, is a gentle letdown: dedicated solvers may be intellectually active, but perhaps that’s why they’re dedicated solvers. Or: doing puzzles might make you better at something, but that something could be limited to the doing of puzzles.</p><p>a solver, presented with two puzzles of ostensibly equal difficulty, may solve one readily and be stumped by the o

<p><strong>Unicorn theatre, London<br></strong>Winsome Pinnock adapts the story of a teenager whose heart transplant causes controversy but the comedy drowns out the issues</p><p>Some set designs instantly make sense. Paul Wills’s clever arrangement of television screens and speakers, all linked up by glowing capillary-like tubes, encapsulates Malorie Blackman’s 1997 novel about a boy whose pig-heart transplant leads to a media frenzy. Andrew Exeter’s lighting switches from blood red to cool blue for scenes when 13-year-old Cameron repeatedly puts himself – and, eventually, his new heart – to the test when diving at his local pool.</p><p>Blackman’s novel is itself a deep dive: this “what would you do?” book for young readers considers ethics, animal rights, othering and empathy. Keeping the pre-social media setting, Winsome Pinnock’s new adaptation draws upon the heightened poetic style of Blackman’s opening chapter. Pinnock retains the narrator’s spirited interest in wordplay, boost

The reason for this, according to Margaret Visser in her impeccably researched book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331024.Much_Depends_on_Dinner">Much Depends on Dinner</a>, is that subjects who see a lemon as well as taste one are liable to react in a manner that ruins the saliva measurements.

<p>A gloomy musician messes a string of people around, but this earnest British drama doesn’t worry much about the women he betrays</p><p>A young man is haunted by the possibility that he is turning into his father and becoming the thing he hates the most in the world – a cheating partner. This is Ethan (Matt Wake), a fresh-faced indie singer-songwriter who treats three women badly over the course of this earnest and angsty British drama with droopy songs. Ethan’s agonising over the suffering caused by his infidelity – to himself mainly you’d think – may have you reaching for a tiny violin. At points I could’ve smashed his acoustic guitar over his head.</p><p>It begins when Ethan’s wife Freya (Christine During) boots him out after discovering he’s had an affair with her friend.

<p>Documentary about the Portuguese colonial exhibition of 1934 aims to expose historical prejudice but inadvertently reinforces its racist gaze </p><p>For a film that grapples with the legacy of colonialism, Marta Pessoa’s documentary begins with a rather provocative title card – it says: “Portugal is not a racist country.” This refers to the popular belief that overseas Portuguese imperialism – or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusotropicalism">lusotropicalism</a>” – is a gentler form of colonisation, compared with other European empires. To dispel such misconceptions, the film turns its attention to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_colonial_exhibition">Portuguese colonial exhibition</a> of 1934, with the aim of exposing the racist treatment endured by its African subjects.</p><p>Taking place in Porto, the fair’s organisers erected a number of housing quarters to replicate native dwellings found in Portuguese colonies, in which Indigenous people were p

<p>Surrounded by canals, a lagoon and the Mediterranean, the port town has fabulous seafood and some quirky cultural traditions</p><p>While much of southern France closes its shutters for the winter, the fishing port of Sète comes alive.

<p>As an erratic president imposes his international doctrine, countries are forging more stable alliances. His US will be weaker, not stronger</p><p>One of the ways in which Donald Trump’s regime obscures and distracts is by drawing our eyes constantly to the US – its raw power to intimidate and bully other nations, and its vast financial heft in wielding soft power through organisations <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyezjwnx5ko">such as USAid</a>.</p><p>But at the same time as Trump projects his agenda on to the world stage, he is withdrawing the US from the world and reducing its role to its bare bones – an imperial power that blatantly picks and chooses how to engage based on its alliances and interests. American taxpayer money is ever so precious on the one hand, but on the other can be profligately spent on proposals to take over an entire territory in Gaza and send billions in aid to Israel. This is not isolationism, it is unilateralism.</p> <a href="https://ww

<p>Evertonian Alexandra Topping – knowing that the famous old ground’s time was running out – made a final pilgrimage with her nine-year-old son </p><p>It’s the sound of Goodison Park that gets you. The deep rumble of feet pounding on planks when a blue shirt walks to the corner flag, a thundering drumbeat that vibrates through the legs, up into the torso, direct to the heart. It’s the staccato clatter of wooden seats flipping skyward as a player runs down the wing. The chants started in the belly of lower stands which spill out into the air in swirling eddies, echoing disjointedly around the ground.</p><p>It’s the sound of my childhood, the sound of my teens and a specific sound that – at the end of this season – will not be heard again. Everton Football Club are leaving Goodison Park – their home for more than 130 years – and moving to a state-of-the-art 52,888-capacity stadium at Bramley-Moore dock, on the banks of the Mersey.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025

<p>His back hurt and his piano was substandard. But the musician’s improvised 1975 show entered jazz history. Now two films are celebrating that mesmerising night – and the sweary teen promoter who made it happen</p><p>‘I went face to face with Keith Jarrett,” recalls Vera Brandes, “and I said to him, ‘Keith, if you don’t play this concert, I’ll be fucked. And you’ll be fucked too.’” Brandes laughs as she recalls this pivotal conversation, 50 years later. It came after a day of chaos where she, an 18-year-old concert promoter, was desperately trying to convince the famously temperamental jazz pianist to play a concert on a substandard instrument.</p><p>“To be honest,” she adds, “I had absolutely not a single clue what those words meant! My English wasn’t then as good as it is now. I’d heard Miles Davis using the f-word while talking to his band, which featured Keith Jarrett, a few years earlier, so maybe I was channelling Miles.

<p>Has the US president won the battle against diversity, equity, and inclusion? Lauren Aratani reports</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of January’s Potomac River tragedy, the deadliest US air disaster since 9/11, few might have expected Donald Trump to point so quickly to one alleged culprit: DEI policies. But as the Guardian US reporter <strong>Lauren Aratani </strong>explains, Trump’s comments were just the latest chapter in the long fight against diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.</p><p>Lauren tells <strong>Helen Pidd </strong>that DEI policies were born in the 1960s as part of an effort by employers to broadly address injustice and exclusion. Today they are based on actively considering a person’s identity (race, gender, sexuality, disability, class etc) when engaging with them, and they arguably reached their peak in the flurry of corporate announcements that emerged after the 2020 killing of George Floyd.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/feb
