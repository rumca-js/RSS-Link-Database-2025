Short snouts and a flat profile -- within a span of 100 years, humans have significantly changed the shape of the skulls of German domestic pigs. This is likely down to new breeding practices introduced at the beginning of the 20th century. The researchers analyzed 3D scans of 135 skulls of wild boars and domestic pigs from the early 20th and 21st centuries. Surprisingly, the same effects can even be observed in species that were kept separately.

## New autonomous system to monitor Arctic's melting ice

Researchers have designed an alternative, autonomous observational method to monitor the Arctic's melting ice, which holds promise for improving the autonomy of marine vehicles, aiding in maritime missions, and gaining a deeper understanding of how melting Arctic sea ice affects marine ecosystems. Their conceptual design features a small waterplane area twin hull vessel that acts as a docking and charging station for autonomous underwater vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles, using solar and turbine energy to enable continuous monitoring.

## Drug may counteract muscle loss and osteoporosis after rapid weight loss

Rapid weight loss affects muscle mass and can increase the risk of osteoporosis. But now there is good news for people taking weight loss medication who may be at risk. A new study indicates that the drug bimagrumab can counteract the side effects.

## Less, but more: A new evolutionary scenario marked by massive gene loss and expansion
 - [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250210132242.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250210132242.htm)

Evolution is traditionally associated with a process of increasing complexity and gaining new genes. However, the explosion of the genomic era shows that gene loss and simplification is a much more frequent process in the evolution of species than previously thought, and may favor new biological adaptations that facilitate the survival of living organisms. This evolutionary driver, which seems counter-intuitive -- 'less is more' in genetic terms -- now reveals a surprising dimension that responds to the new evolutionary concept of 'less, but more', i.e. the phenomenon of massive gene losses followed by large expansions through gene duplications.
