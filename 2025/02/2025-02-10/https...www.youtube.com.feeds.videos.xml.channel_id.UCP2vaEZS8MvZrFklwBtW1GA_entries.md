Tile leveling system removal tips…I use T-Lock by @perfectlevelmaster for large tiles. The Clips and Wedges keep tiles flat and grout joints even. Sometimes a Clip breaks proud of the tile. Not a problem, I remove it with a sharp utility knife. Then I use Stone and Tile Cleaner to remove mortar residue 👍🏽🔥#tile #tileshower #perfectlevelmaster #homerepairtutor
