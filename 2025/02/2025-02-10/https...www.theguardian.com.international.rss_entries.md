<p>The US’s biggest TV night of the year saw new looks at 2025’s most anticipated movies, costing studios $8m a spot</p><p>While there might have been a brief uptick in the viewership for recent awards ceremonies, the act of communal live TV watching is still not what it used to be. In the US, the one constant is sport and while weekly games might only appeal to an impassioned subset of fans, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/super-bowl">Super Bowl’s</a> broader appeal makes it the most attractive night of the year to advertisers, their big chance to make an impression with an audience that’s typically over 100 million.</p><p>It’s also inevitably the most expensive with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/29/30-second-ad-slots-for-super-bowl-reported-to-be-selling-for-8m-plus-in-us">30-second spot costing about $8m</a> this year – a record amount – and so it’s left up to the biggest of the big companies to get involved.

<p>Paulo Gazzaniga’s hat-trick of penalty saves was fresh in the mind but Bilbao ran out comfortable victors at San Mamés</p><p>Paulo Gazzaniga rapped his studs against a post, tapped his fingertips against the crossbar and flashed the smile that broke so many hearts. In the final minutes before Athletic Club faced Girona on Saturday afternoon, Ernesto Valverde was asked who would take the penalties and gave an answer almost as loaded as the question: “Only one thing’s certain,” the coach said, “it won’t be me.” Less than an hour later, it had actually happened, which maybe it had to, another man standing before a screen inviting <em>that guy</em> back into their lives.

<p>Swapping my phone for an analogue camera, I took inspiration from my family albums and started photographing the things that mattered most</p><p>There’s something magical about holding a physical print of a moment you’ve captured. I first experienced this feeling as a teenager, when my aunt gave me a film camera for my 16th birthday. At the time, it felt like an antique. I left it in a drawer, overlooked, while I relied on my phone for photos – quick snaps that were shared but rarely revisited.</p><p>Like most teenagers growing up in the digital age, I was obsessed with curating the perfect Instagram feed. My profile was a polished collection of photos intended to impress my peers, designed to fit an idealised version of reality. Each image was meticulously selected, cropped and edited. But something began to shift.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/feb/10/the-one-change-that-worked-i-began-a-quiet-satisfying-rebellion-against-the-digital-age">Continue rea

<p>George Hirst finds inspiration from his father, Plymouth exploit Arne Slot’s choices and Marcus Rashford shows promise at his new club</p><p>Against Tottenham, the Aston Villa substitute Marcus Rashford looked, well, like the old Marcus Rashford. On the left, the Manchester United loanee embarrassed Pedro Porro with a nutmeg. Through the middle, a deft touch helped release Jacob Ramsey through on goal. Rashford flew down the right at searing pace (before a brilliant Archie Gray tackle limited further damage to Spurs). In half an hour, Rashford only had one fewer touches than Son Heung-min managed in 90 minutes. He looked fit and mentally eager (winning both the tackles he attempted), had a 93% pass accuracy, won four of six aerial duels and generally looked in synergy with his new teammates. Maybe he has a point to prove, or has had a boost of confidence from Villa’s fans and manager, or maybe Rashford is just playing in a quality, well-oiled side again, but Villa’s new No 9 looke

<p>A professor of medicine weighs in on the old wives tale, and discusses the fastest routes to recovery</p><p>Tom Wilkinson, professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Southampton, says there is some truth to this age-old saying. When you get a respiratory viral infection, otherwise known as a cold, your immune system is activated, he explains. Your ability to fight it off depends on how strong your system’s responses are – and you need to be fuelled up in order to respond well.</p><p>“Activated immune cells are among the most metabolically demanding –&nbsp;they take a lot of energy from the body,” Wilkinson says. That means you ideally need to be consuming nutrient-dense, calorie-rich foods. He&nbsp;refers to an <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323262-300-eat-to-treat/">experiment</a> in which randomised volunteers were either given a liquid meal or starved for 24&nbsp;hours.
