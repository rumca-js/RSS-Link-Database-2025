<p>The latest Nvidia graphics cards are <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2593506/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-5080-sell-out-almost-immediately.html">impossible to find at retailers</a>, and you’ll be paying double or triple the already-high price if you try to get one on the secondary market.

<p>While most PC builders are content to rely on an AIO liquid cooling loop or good old-fashioned air, there are always those who will go the extra mile to keep their components frosty. If you’re willing to invest a lot of money and even more electricity, you could just hook a liquid cooling setup into a residential air conditioner. You absolutely shouldn’t, but you could! </p>



<p>One video producer in China did just that, hooting up a 12,000 BTU unit into a custom cooling loop for a system with a Core i9-13900K and RTX 4090. <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UtfmYKEig/?spm_id_from=333.1007.tianma.6-4-22.click&vd_source=ab6f7cce77d930be2096916d61222bc9">On Bilibili</a>, the creator shows off the massive system running at 20 degrees Celsius at rest (that’s 68 degrees, if you live in some kind of backward wasteland that uses Fahrenheit).
