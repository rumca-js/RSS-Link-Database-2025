<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am very new to Usenet so I&#39;m not familiar with all of the terms and processes. I&#39;ve been using the Arrs for a while now but wanted to try usenet. Newshosting has their own GUI but id like to be able to use the Arrs instead (Better GUI). What do I need to do to get newshosting set up as an indexer for video searching?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Woodford55"> /u/Woodford55 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1imb5c1/noob_question_how_to_setup_newshosting_with_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1imb5c1/noob_question_how_to_setup_newshosting_with_the/">[comments]</a></span>
