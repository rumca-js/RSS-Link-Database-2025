## 11,000-Year-Old Settlement in Canada Challenges Indigenous History

An 11,000-year-old settlement, Âsowanânihk, discovered in Saskatchewan, is reshaping perspectives on early Indigenous civilizations in North America. Located in Sturgeon Lake First Nation territory, the site contains stone tools, firepits, and bison remains, indicating long-term habitation rather than temporary hunting camps. According to research from the University of Saskatchewan, radiocarbon dating of charcoal traces human occupation dating back 10,700 years, just after the last ice age. Archaeologists and Indigenous Knowledge Keepers are collaborating to study and protect the site, which is at risk due to erosion and logging activities. This discovery challenges previous beliefs about early Indigenous societies, providing concrete evidence of structured communities thriving in the region thousands of years earlier than previously thought.

## Asteroid 2024 YR4 Poses 1-in-43 Chance of Earth Impact in 2032

Asteroid 2024 YR4, identified by NASA, has a 1-in-43 chance of colliding with Earth on December 22, 2032. Measuring approximately 55 metres in diameter, it is not large enough to cause a global catastrophe but could result in significant destruction if it impacts a densely populated area. Scientists estimate the impact could release 8 megatons of energy, over 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb. The asteroid has been classified at Level 3 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, warranting close observation. While most asteroids at this level are eventually downgraded, continuous monitoring remains crucial.

ISRO has successfully conducted a vacuum ignition test of its CE20 cryogenic engine at the Propulsion Complex in Mahendragiri, Tamil Nadu. The test aimed to assess the engine’s restart capability under space-like conditions, a critical requirement for advanced missions. Developed by ISRO’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre, the CE20 engine powers the upper stage of the LVM-3 rocket and is essential for the upcoming Gaganyaan mission. The organisation is also evaluating a bootstrap mode for turbopump initiation to improve engine efficiency. Previous ground tests have already qualified the engine for thrust levels between 19 and 22 tonnes. ISRO confirmed that both the engine and testing facility functioned as expected, marking a key milestone in India’s space technology development.

## Romania’s ‘Living’ Rocks Expand and Multiply in a Strange Natural Process

Trovants, mysterious geological formations found in Romania’s Costești region, are known for their unique ability to grow and multiply. These rocks, formed millions of years ago due to seismic activity, consist of a hard stone core surrounded by a porous sandstone shell. When rainwater rich in minerals like calcium carbonate seeps into the rock, a cement-like reaction occurs, causing the trovants to expand gradually. Over time, smaller lumps emerge and detach, forming new trovants. This phenomenon has led to various myths, including beliefs that they are dinosaur eggs or alien artifacts. However, scientific studies confirm their natural origins.

Astronomers have identified the longest black hole jet observed in the early universe, stretching 200,000 light-years—twice the Milky Way’s width. Found in quasar J1601+3102, this jet was detected using the LOFAR telescope. Despite the black hole being 450 million times the Sun’s mass, it isn’t among the most massive.
