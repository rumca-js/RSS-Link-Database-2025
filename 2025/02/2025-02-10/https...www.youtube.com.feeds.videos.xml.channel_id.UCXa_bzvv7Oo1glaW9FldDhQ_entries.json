        "description": "Resident Evil is good at so many things, and for the last few years, we\u2019ve been seeing it consistently delivering on those things. But as consistently successful as it has been with its single player outings, just as consistently, the survival horror franchise has failed to make a mark with its multiplayer attempts. \n\nIn particular, it\u2019s the series\u2019 PvP outings that fail the hardest, Resident Evil Re:Verse being the latest in a long line of similar failures, also including Resident Evil: Resistance and Umbrella Corps. Why is it, then, that the developer keeps persisting with these cynical cash grabs- especially when Resident Evil has had a proven track record with successful co-op experiences over the years? \n\nHere, we discuss just that.",

        "description": "The PlayStation One was first launched in 1994 in Japan, and after arriving in North America and Europe in 1995, it changed the landscape forever. Instead of the Big Two of Nintendo and Sega, there was the Big Three. Alongside establishing the CD-ROM as a viable gaming medium, Sony catered to a different market.\n\nSurvival horror games, big-budget RPGs with extensive cinematics, stealth action titles, and racing sims flourished during the PS One era. Legendary properties like Resident Evil, Gran Turismo, Ape Escape, Tekken, Syphon Filter and more were born during this time. Meanwhile, franchises like Final Fantasy found new appreciation and fans. Even PC classics like Tomb Raider and Need for Speed had strong followings.\n\nWith so many excellent titles, narrowing them down to the 15 best is challenging. Nevertheless, here are the top PlayStation One games you should play as of 2025. Please note that this video is our 2025 edition.",
