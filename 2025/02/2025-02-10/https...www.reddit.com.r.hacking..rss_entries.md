<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We noticed some websites at work have thousands of bogus registered users. There shouldn’t be any but the sign up box was only hidden with some code, technically it’s still there. </p> <p>Presumably some spambot is signing up these addresses. </p> <p>What reason would there be to do this? They can’t sign in, we don’t send emails, data doesn’t seem to be at risk. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CelTony"> /u/CelTony </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1im957m/spambot_registrations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1im957m/spambot_registrations/">[comments]</a></span>
