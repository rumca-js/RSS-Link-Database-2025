Catch the brilliance and wit of Phoebe Waller-Bridge and an incredible cast in Fleabag, now streaming on Prime Video.

About Fleabag: Fleabag is a hilarious and poignant window into the mind of a dry-witted, sexual, angry, grief-riddled woman, as she hurls herself at modern living in London. Award-winning playwright Phoebe Waller-Bridge writes and stars as Fleabag, an unfiltered woman trying to heal, while rejecting anyone who tries to help her and keeping up her bravado all along.
