## Cerebrospinal biomarker test can detect Alzheimer's pathology earlier. A new cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid biomarker test correlates with the severity of cognitive decline, independent of other factors, including brain amyloid deposition, and could enable early-stage disease diagnosis and intervention.
