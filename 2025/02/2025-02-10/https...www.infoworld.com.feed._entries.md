<p>Python 3.14, due out later this year, is set to receive a new type of interpreter that can boost performance by up to 30% with no changes to existing code.</p>



<p>The CPython 3.14 change log <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call">describes the feature</a> as “a new type of interpreter based on tail calls.” This description may be a little misleading for those who don’t closely follow internal Python development work. “Tail calls” doesn’t mean that CPython, or the Python language, will now support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call">tail call optimization</a>. It refers to an optimization that a C compiler performs on the CPython code, wh

<p>Google’s cloud computing division, Google Cloud, has added a new generative AI Toolbox for Databases to help enterprise developers connect agent-based generative AI applications to its databases.</p>



<p>The new <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox">Toolbox</a>, which is currently in public beta, is an open-source server designed to streamline the creation, deployment, and management of <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3812583/what-you-need-to-know-about-developing-ai-agents.html#:~:text=AI%20agents%20provide%20natural%20language,are%20summarized%20in%20natural%20language.">AI agents</a> capable of querying databases.</p>

<p>Database administration has always been something of a well kept secret. Even within the wider domain of information technology, database administration is one of those areas of expertise that often goes overlooked by aspiring STEM students and tech-savvy job seekers.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it’s an area for which expertise is in consistently high demand. And at a time when the futures of many professions have been darkened by the pall of AI-fueled uncertainty, database administration remains ripe with opportunity. For both those already in the field and those looking to enter it, I’m confident that there will be no shortage of demand for skilled professionals for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>On Sunday people tuned in to watch the Super Bowl—and lots and lots of ads. Online, however, it’s increasingly the case that AI agents will see and interact with ads. Humans won’t. That’s the insight <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kmandel_marketing-in-the-age-of-ai-agents-who-are-activity-7290257834330505216-vOwL/">Grab’s regional marketing director Ken Mandel offers</a>: “If an AI chooses your Coke order, not a human, then why bid for impressions on Instagram?” Summing up, he argues, “In a world where agents (not humans) interact with brands, the game shifts from advertising to AI influence and optimization.”</p>
