<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, long stry short my mom loves to lissen to audiobooks, and after looking at megathread and at sub for a while i cant seem to find anything that would help. She does not speak English and i would love to get some help where to look for ebooks/audiobooks in other languages. There is quite a few apps that provide audiobooks but you have to pay subscription and you dont get even half of the books available on the apps. And the cost of the book without subscryption is more then 1.5 what i make hourly and with subscription is bit more then my hourly rate which is crazy considering that im not earnig that bad. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cyganito-Maximus"> /u/Cyganito-Maximus </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1imk45c/hello_folks_question_about_audiobooks_but_not_in/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/1imk45c/hello_fol

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have been through most of the mega thread by now, and all I see are the black boxed captions. It is hard to explain my problem, there is something about them that has a wrong (or maybe just different) flow. Like they don&#39;t update propperly, sometimes when two people are speaking the newest line comes up on top instead of below the previous one. If there is a lot of information on the screen it becomes complete chaos, like if the rules of a tournament is being described in text while someone is talking simultaneously.</p> <p>Obviously they also take up more realestate on the screen.</p> <p>When I used to watch everything on aniwave I never had this issue, everything was in white text that updated propperly.</p> <p>I assume with no knowledge of the problem that it is the difference between &quot;offical&quot; subtitles and user/ai generated ones, and if I am mistaken I hope I have described the problem enough for you to know what I mean.</p> <p>S

I tried some leech sites and even jdownloader and neither could download the file or at the very least gave me a corrupted dummy pack file that is unusable. I check the megathread but did not see alot about lightroom presets most of the adobe links are for photoshop or video effects and I am specifically looking for this preset and maybe a few more for lightroom.
