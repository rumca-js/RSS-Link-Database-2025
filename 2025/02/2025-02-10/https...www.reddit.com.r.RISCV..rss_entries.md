<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I see a case in the SiFive Forum that describes how to install an AI-enabled Debian operating system on the P550. The case explains how to configure Debian for AI applications like large language models (LLMs), video codecs, and image processing.</p> <p>I tried the latest AI-enabled Debian image from ESWIN on my HiFive Premier P550 board, and my experience was positive. </p> <p>You can find the download link and installation guide here: <a href="https://github.com/eswincomputing/eic7x-images/releases/tag/Debian-v1.0.0-p550-20241230">https://github.com/eswincomputing/eic7x-images/releases/tag/Debian-v1.0.0-p550-20241230</a></p> <p>Additionally, I heard that Deepseek support is planned for this board.</p> <p>For further help, visit the official forum: <a href="https://forums.sifive.com/c/premier-p550/18">https://forums.sifive.com/c/premier-p550/18</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fit-Introductio
