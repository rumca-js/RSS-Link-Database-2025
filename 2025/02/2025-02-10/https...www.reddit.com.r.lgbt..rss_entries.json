I was shit scared to reveal it to my parents (obviously), especially my dad.</p> <p>The once I asked him about this, he tells me that people turn gay because their parents beat them a lot as kids, or something on those lines and stops.</p> <p>Now I&#39;m 20, and it&#39;s been two years that I moved out of home for higher education, it seems like he has changed a lot. He has become more emotional, and it seems like he misses me a lot and also cares a lot about me. </p> <p>Few days back, on a call, I decided to come out to him (it was totally unplanned and mostly a stupid move because I wasn&#39;t even thinking of what all could have happened) and he tells me it is going to go, ",

Always joked and identified as a lesbian in a man&#39;s body. Lately the thoughts and feelings have gotten more intense to the point where I am reading, googling etc about gender identity. My biggest struggle with this is that I am a cis gender male living in a hugely conservative area of our state. I&#39;m mostly struggling with the idea of even coming out to my partner. It&#39;s not for fear of not being accepted but rather how that would affect my wife of 15+ years. Also being in such a red area, I don&#39;t know that I could ever even come out. I have ongoing therapy scheduled and planned to talk with them before my partner. The part I&#39;m struggling with the most is I don&#39;t see a benefit or way that I could come out.

So, ig I will start a discussion here. So, can I just say that, for me at least, her Grammy rendition of Pink Pony Club seems to be at least close to par with ALMOST any Freddy Mercury song. Now, I know she and Lady GaGa are considered modern LGBTQ icons, but I am asking, are they THE modern LGBTQ icons like Freddy was back when? Also, I personally would like to thank Lady GaGa for her stand out step forward Trans people exist statement!!!
