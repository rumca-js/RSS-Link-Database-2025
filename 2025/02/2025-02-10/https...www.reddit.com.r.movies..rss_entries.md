## February 7-9 Box Office Recap: 'Dog Man' was still #1, but collapsed 62%, one of the steepest drops for an animated film. 'Heart Eyes' had a fine start with $8.3M, while 'Love Hurts' flopped with just $5.8M. In China, 'Ne Zha 2' becomes the first ever film to make $1 billion in one country.

## The Northman (2022) is everything I could have asked for in a viking epic + incredibly gorgeous to look at.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just finished seeing this movie, I remember when it came out two years ago, but for some reason I didn&#39;t pay it much heed. I wish I went back to undo it. Oh this movie is incredible. As the title says, I was extremely satisfied with what I got. Culture, magic, myth, violance.</p> <p>And it has that usual Robert Eggers weirdness and silliness that everyone loves.</p> <p>What can I say about the story? A well played out revenge epic. I love how creepy the whole thing feels. Idk why but I felt like things kinda started getting wobbly near the third act. It wasn&#39;t bad enough to damper my enjoyment.</p> <p>I love the atmosphere of this movie, really creepy and pagan feeling. I love how the supernatural element is consistant through the movie but really lowkey and eerie. Always just crouched in the background.</p> <p>The acting was great, the music was great, the cinematography was artistic af. I loved the shooting location, the long shot scenes 

## The Other Guys end credits go hard in today's economic climate

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I rewatched The Other Guys for the first time since it came out, and I liked it way better than the first time I saw it. In 2010 I was kind of Will Ferrell&#39;d out after being a big fan in the Anchorman era. &quot;Aim for the bushes&quot; is an all-timer, Michael Keaton kills it, and I had a blast whenever Ray Stevenson was on screen (RIP). However, the biggest impact for me was the end credits. </p> <p>Since the main plot point revolves around financial fraud, the credits are a series of infographics displaying the basics about Ponzi schemes, government bailouts, and CEO compensation contrasted to worker salaries. These numbers have only ballooned further in the last decade and a half, as have the societal frustrations. It was a really clear and effective way to get a message about class inequality across at the end of a great action comedy.</p> <p>For anyone who hasn&#39;t seen it or doesn&#39;t remember much about it, it&#39;s definitely a solid

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I saw <em>Nosferatu</em> recently and was really happy to see one of my favorite supporting actors, Ralph Ineson, got plenty of screen time. Ralph Ineson never gets any high billing in advertising or discussion, but has had a quietly excellent career. He was fantastic in <em>The VVitch,</em> intimidating and mysterious as The Green Knight in <em>The Green Knight,</em> and an excellent foil to Willem Dafoe in <em>Nosferatu</em>. However he’s also fantastic in the more minor rolls he’s taken, such as in <em>Chernobyl</em>, and even though he’s only in <em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em> for one scene I think he has more screen presence then the actor portraying Macduff. I’m just happy to see him getting big work. </p> <p>What supporting actors do you wish got more recognition? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HasSomeSelfEsteem"> /u/HasSomeSelfEsteem </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mo

I thought it had great potential for a franchise. I&#39;m not sure of any details that may have derailed any sequels. It may be too late for a sequel at this point. It&#39;s a good movie to put on if the kids are around or to just watch for myself. I grew up with the TV show, but too young to remember much. I think this was part of the slew of movies from TV shows, but it stuck out. Did I mention the cast? They just had great chemistry.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>It can be a film with a sad ending or simply one with a sad scene/s.</p> <p>For me, these films are: - The Miracle Maker, a little-known but absolutely fantastic animated film from 2000 about the life of Jesus. Firstly, the scene where Jesus is crying on the beach after learning that John the Baptist (His cousin, no less) has been murdered. Secondly, during the Crucifixion scene. The music during so that scene is heartbreaking, not helped by Simon Peter clearly overcome with guilt for betraying Jesus and Jesus whimpering and looking helpless on the Cross. I&#39;ve been watching that film every year since 2001 and I&#39;ll always be in tears during the Crucifixion scene; - Cinderella (the 1950 Disney film). Quite possibly Disney&#39;s saddest film. Admit it: until she marries Prince Charming, Cinderella&#39;s life sucks. The bit that gets me every time is when Cinderella is crying in the garden after her stepsisters have destroyed her dress; - Philade

Especially when they don’t take themselves too seriously. The humor is top notch.
