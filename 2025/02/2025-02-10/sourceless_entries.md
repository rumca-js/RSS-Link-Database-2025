Bats are mammals, making this the first study to link the urban living environment to the timing of birth in mammals.

Conventional methods of pest control such as insecticides do not work at these altitudes.

Certain advanced technologies, such as 3D displays, biosensing, and security printing, can utilize circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), which is produced when specific types of molecules are irradiated with UV light. The electric field of the CPL rotates in a spiral shape. Mechanical changes to these molecules, such as grinding, can induce a transition that creates a reversible emission color change. This is called mechanochromic luminescence (MCL).
