Captain America: Brave New World is the fourth entry in that long-running Marvel franchise, as well as being the first to star Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson in the lead role rather than Chris Evans’ Steve Rogers.

From Harrison Ford’s Thunderbolt Ross to Tim Blake Nelson’s The Leader to Liv Tyler’s Betty Ross, let’s break down the history of these MCU characters and why Brave New World is really an Incredible Hulk sequel in all but name.
