First of all, I do have an IT background back when we still learned C++ and COBOL. (Yes I&#39;m old) I do integrate MFPs in customer networks and link them with all the modern cloud solutions. So I feel I have some understanding of certain topics. Although I never really used Linux except the few times I installed Ubuntu then thought, cool but this makes everything just a little bit harder in my life and promptly uninstalled it again.</p> <p>Then I got a NAS, which happened have some software to manage movies and music. A few years later I got a QNAP nas that runs Plex and tautalli. At one point I had several dockers running and when trying something in portainer I somehow broke everything. Then I got a couple of things back up and running. Then she-who-rolls-here-eyes-alot-when-mentioning-

Is it then possible to later change it to e.g. a local NAS / homeserver, my self-hosted Kubernetes instance, etc.? Or e.g. change the media directory to some external mount.</p> <p><strong>Settings</strong>: For example, changing the OCR settings will likely not retroactively apply. But I assume the defaults are sensible here. Maybe there are other settings that are hard

I am afraid of messing something up security-wise though. Thanks to this sub I found out Cloudflare offers a &quot;zero trust application access&quot; which means (if I understand it correctly) that a user trying to access my selfhosted services has to first authenticate on Cloudflare&#39;s servers before they even get a chance to hit my server. That should mean that people/bots won&#39;t be able to land on my services&#39; homepages right away and I could also create a whitelist of users (e.g. by e-mail addresses) so that even if someone authenticates it doesn&#39;t mean they will go through to my services.</p> <p>Is there a way to replicate this feature in a selfhosted way with a VPS?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Red_Con_"

Which means, most likely, just yyyy/mm directories, maybe with album-specific directories for some photos. All mobile devices at home upload the pictures to my Nextcloud, I am planning to sync them to that family collection.</p> <p>Now, accessing this kind of collection for viewing is straightforward - can be anything, CIFC, WebDAV...I think also Nextcloud Photos can work with that too quite well. However, I am looking for some additional features, such as:</p> <p>- organizing albums without moving/copying the media to another structure</p> <p>- indexing the photos to be able to search them for something - object, face etc</p> <p>I know that latter is now supported by Nextcloud Photos if you install some additional apps, but here is my main problem: these apps require quite a bit of resources on the server.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve recently moved to TrueNAS, and I&#39;m slowly setting up all the experience as I had it before. I&#39;m kinda struggling to find an app that gives me a SynologyDrive-like behavior, specifically, when it comes to the owner of the files.</p> <p>The behavior I am looking to replicate is the user ownership and how it worked in Synology. Whether I was using the UI, creating the file in my laptop which then synced it with the SynologyDrive application, using SMB etc... the owner of the file was always the same.</p> <p>I can&#39;t seem to find a way to replicate that. I have tried stuff like Nextcloud etc... but at best, I&#39;ve managed to setup access using extra ACLs etc... and make sure that group-wise stuff is owned by the same group, but I have found no way to have the files created from a UI/app to have the same owner as if the file was created using SMB.</p> <p>Is there really no app out there that could do something like this?</p> </div><!
