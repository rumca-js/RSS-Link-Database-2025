While privacy is crucial to a good VPN, speed shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Faster speeds mean quicker file downloads and website load times, higher-quality streaming, and just a better all-around experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve tested numerous VPNs and run their servers through countless speed tests to determine the fastest services based on network averages. My picks showcase the very best with the fastest download speeds, the fastest upload speeds, and more. Read below to see PCWorld\u2019s curated list of the fastest VPNs available now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why you should trust me:</strong> Here at PCWorld we\u2019ve been testing computer hardware, software, and services since the 1980s. I\u2019m continually testing all of the major VPNs on the market and many lesser-known services ",
