What followed was a valuable lesson from the Vice President on how to handle bad-faith attacks from Democrats. It's also an example of why the left and the media (but I repeat myself) are about to realize attacking Trump at this point is a waste of time and focus all their energy on taking down Vance.</p><p>The saga begins with a journalist <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/doge-staff-quits-marko-elez-over-normalize-indian-hate-post-elon-musk-donald-trump-jd-vance-respond-7661136" target="_blank">digging up bad tweets from one of Cousin Elon's D.O.G.E. analysts</a> that disparaged those of Indian descent.
