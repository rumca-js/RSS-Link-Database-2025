So I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m just having a hard time finding this online or it it is a false memory, but I can clearly remember that when the PSOne redesign came out, that they also released a redesigned memory card to match the new rounded plug for the controller. The console&#39;s pack in controller looked the same, but its color was a little lighter and the part that plugs into the console went from a square plastic housing to a rounded off plastic housing. I distinctly remember Sony releasing a memory card with the same shape and color to perfectly match the aesthetic. I also remember it costing a little more than the standard memory card and remember feeling like an idiot bc I couldn&#39;t help myself from buying that memory card to complete the look. Was this ever a thing or am I misremembering things? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr8BitX"> /u/Mr8BitX </a> <br/> <span><a

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Many moons ago, Christmas 1998 to be exact, I was gifted a Mega Drive, as it was past it&#39;s active lifetime a lot of the games me and my brothers bought came from a local used shop that among other things sold games. I bought a lot of games completely blind, I bought some great games such as Streets of Rage or Mortal Kombat and games like Sword of Sodan or Rise of the Robots. However as they were often under £5 it wasn&#39;t the end of the world. </p> <p>One of the games I bought was Fighting Masters. It is a fighting game, it has a decent list of characters, some decent special moves and it&#39;s far superior to Rise of the Robots. It&#39;s not exactly Street Fighter 2 but it&#39;s not exactly Primal Rage either, I suggest giving it a go, even if you&#39;re a fighting game expert, beat it on your first try and never play it again at least you&#39;ll hear some pretty entertaining music and see some unique character designs that aren&#39;t all just
