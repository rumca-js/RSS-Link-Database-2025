<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. I’ve noticed recently that I’m not happy with the great life I have and am always wanting more and more... a bigger house, a nicer car, etc. We have a great house, but I struggle to enjoy it because the other houses on my street are bigger and nicer. I want to move away from that and learn to be content with what I have. I don’t want to chase happiness but to feel content with “enough.” Are there any books to help me learn and choose to be content with enough instead of feeling down that other people have more? This thing has plagued me for years and I’m ready to make some changes. Any book suggestions on where to start?

I always see people recommend Radium Girls, and it&#39;s saved in my Amazon cart...but it looks so long and that steers me away from it. </p> <p>I just completed Death&#39;s Acre. I just ordered The Indifferent Stars Above. And I have Into Thin Air saved in my cart for a 6 hour flight in March.</p> <p>Any good recommendations on true books along the lines of autopsy, some true crime, uncontacated tribes, jungle and wilderness situations...those all peak my interest.

I am also an avid romantic comedy reader (think Emily Henry).</p> <p>I am hoping to find books that are set during the Regency period but have a more funny and modern style, like modern rom coms. Something along the lines of the Bridgerton show, but not the Bridgerton books—I don’t love how they’re written and find them boring. I recently read Never Fall for your Fiancée by Virginia Heath and was sorely disappointed—I found that the characters were entirely one dimensional and that the plot lines were boring and nonsensical. </p> <p>Let me know if anything like this exists, and thank you in advance!!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/waterbottlelovr"> /u/waterbottlelovr </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ilynqs/regency_romantic_comedies_that_are_similar_in
