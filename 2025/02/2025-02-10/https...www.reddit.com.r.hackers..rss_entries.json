And if I don\u2019t listen to his requests he\u2019s gonna send videos of me ahem \u201cWatching adult content\u201d then continue on about how easy it was and he\u2019ll put a Trojan on my pc then send videos to my friends, family and colleagues\u2026pretty sure a hacker would know I\u2019m unemployed and my email is in no way connected to anyone I know.</p> <p>Personally I think it\u2019s fake because it\u2019s extremely formal and why would a hacker waste time telling me I\u2019m hacked instead of just remaining under the radar and breaking/stealing things but I thought I\u2019d send it here in case someone thinks it\u2019s real.</p> <p>(Oh yeah he said after I open this email you have 50 hours to transfer the bitcoin, does this guy think he\u2019s the Joker or something)</p> ",
