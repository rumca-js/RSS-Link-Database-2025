## Need help to find old flash game

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi. So recently i remembered an old flash game from the One More LVL website, which i played when i was a kid. I wanted to find it but there is literally no trace of it anywhere and sadly i dont remember the name:( So the game is a 2D sideview Action/platformer game with very basic visuals and if i remember correctly the story was that the main characters girlfriend is killed or maybe kidnapped and we have to get revenge or something. There was a healing mechanic where you could find donoughts on the ground and if you stood next to it the character did a funny eating animation. The only attack you had was a strike with a baseball bat. If im not mistaken Vodoo People - Pendulum mix was the background music in the game or at least something similar. Main guy had a blue shirt enemies had a red one. I would be happy if someone here could identify the game from the details i described above. Thank you anyway, have a nice day:)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#3
