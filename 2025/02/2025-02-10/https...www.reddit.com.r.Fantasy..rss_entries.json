Overall, still a very fun read and a mostly satisfying conclusion to the trilogy \u2013 though I admit I did find it to be the weakest of the three on a few different levels. Though that\u2019s mostly just personal appeal, probably; of course my favourite is the book that ends with the central romance breaking up via knife in heart and not the one where they get back together. </p> <p>The book picks up shortly after Oleander Sword lets off \u2013 Malini\u2019s claim to the throne s",

I love this genre and am therefor easily impressed. This book is so popular, so it should not be any different, right?</p> <p>I started of by finding it rather familiar, Beauty and the beast came to my mind. The original not the disney version. And I got sucked in to a world that had the potential of being something. This world building and dictation is thought through, and I like it. </p> <p>However, the story. I came across alot of adult content and thought &quot;I like game of thrones and this is childsplay in comparison&quot;. The difference is why it is in a story. GoT has it for a tool to bring a story or a realistic view forward. Not being the actual story and everything else being in the side line.

My name is Steve Stern, and I\u2019m most closely associated with the comic-book <em>Zen Intergalactic Ninja,</em> which I created with artist Dan Cote 38 years ago.</p> <p>Over those years, I\u2019ve also written a number of non-Zen graphic novels, among them <em>Beowulf,</em> which was published by the UK\u2019s Markosia in 2007 and has remained in print ever since. As you may know, <em>Beowulf</em> is considered by many to be the foundational text for all fantasy literature--which is as important a genre to me as is sci-fi. </p> <p>Nearly two decades ago, I began working with another remarkable artist, Gary Laib, on an original epic fantasy that eventually became known as VOIDWALKER. It is a 100-page graphic novel that tells the tale of young Toron, who sets out on a perilous journey across unknown lands to rescue his twin brother from an unspeakable evil. He\u2019ll be aided along the way by Dandrid the Voidsmith, his soul encased in a gemstone, who wi",

I knew it was a slower paced book a la The Cruel Prince but the main character has really worn me down over three books, with 3 more remaining.</p> <p>My question is what makes you decide to not finish a book or series? Does it leave you still wanting to know what happens next?? I have only DNF a couple books ever but end up not wanting to leave a series unfinished, even if my interest in the next book has diminished.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Any-Day-8173\"> /u/Any-Day-8173 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ilu4db/at_what_point_do_you_consider_dropping_a_book_or/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ilu4db/at_what_point_do_you_consider_dropping_a_book_o",
