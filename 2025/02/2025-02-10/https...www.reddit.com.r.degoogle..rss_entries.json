Since 2013 I have been researching and educating myself on ways/alternatives to regain my control, because if I paid for the product, it is mine. And I refuse to pay with my data. Nowadays it is very difficult to fully recover our digital freedom, because we are more embedded in a &quot;digital survivalism&quot;. Simple things make a difference and today, even though I don&#39;t have my phone on an alternative system list, like the ones I know and would like to use, I still made my efforts applying what I know in the factory ROM.
