You arrange colored pegs in a row, then press a button to check the arrangement. The game compares your sequence to a preselected sequence, then indicates to you how many pegs were both the correct color and in the correct position and how many are the correct color but in the wrong position. You keep guessing and try to find the correct sequence within a turn limit. Similar mechanics to wordle but without the words. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/rxnaissance\"> /u/rxnaissance </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1imkjhl/need_help_identifying_a_game/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1imkjhl/need_help_identifying_a_game/\">[comments]</a></span>",

What elements of a game spark them, and why don\u2019t they emerge as easily in simpler designs? You could play ten games of Catan and experience moments of drama.

One problem is that, while I like Star Wars, I&#39;m not a superfan and don&#39;t own most of the games presented in the video.

Build a kingdom on a private island. Fill it with sheep, cows, barrels of whisky that give sweet $ for remain rounds. The tiles are worth different points depending of what the 4 goal card have. There are more than 20 different goal so games feel different each time. There are a market where you can buy tiles from each other each round.

Of course the packaging is going to influence my initial assumptions of a game. This is most prevalent to me when I&#39;m in a shop browsing games with no intention other than to find something new. Or - in board game cafes where you have to pick a game off a shelf with hundreds or thousands of games all competing for attention. </p> <p>So what kind of packaging are you drawn to? What makes you pick up a game you&#39;ve never heard of before when looking in a shop or board game cafe or other place. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ModHob\"> /u/ModHob </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ilu0tw/your_favourite_board_game_packaging/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ilu0tw/",

They all look fun but I thought it was the same thing just reskinned. I only recently found out they also have some variations in rules, so\u2026 what are the differences? (is there a difference in the space and Star Wars versions besides references? I mean.. Both are in space.)</p> <p>Also.. if you had to rank them, how would you rank all of them?
