<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been learning Django to build a project for my company. So far, I haven&#39;t done much beyond an initial setup, a custom User model, and some authentication routes.</p> <p>New people will be joining this project, and none of them are experienced with Django either. Given that, I‚Äôd like to know what I should focus on to ensure <strong>good version control</strong> in GitHub or GitLab.</p> <p>What should I study and check in the documentation to <strong>avoid unnecessary files being pushed to the repository</strong>? Also, how should we handle <strong>migrations properly</strong> in this case? Besides these points, I imagine there are other concerns when maintaining a Django repository. What should I be checking and preparing for?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/my_winter999"> /u/my_winter999 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1img2v1/best_practices_for_mai

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi all, </p> <p>I am a software engineer with around 2.7 years of experience. I had to work on a non technical repetitive task for like a year and the rest of the time I was either working on a project making small changes or I was on the bench. </p> <p>I recently got into Django and my question is how do people self learn. Let&#39;s say I watch a tutorial but I&#39;m always stuck when I start to make a self project. Without the guidance of someone how do I know what are the best practices. Also when working on a client project one has access to paid services that they need to integrate. How do I get the same learning curve while working on personal projects?</p> <p>I would really appreciate some tips from people who self learned the django on how they approach a project. Or any suggestions on becoming a good programmer even if they&#39;re not related to Django. Please be kind üôè</p> <p>Tldr: I guess what I&#39;m looking for is how do people who self
