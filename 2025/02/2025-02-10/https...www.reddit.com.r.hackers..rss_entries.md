<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I got an email a few weeks ago, I don’t use my email often but apparently someone named “Selwyn” is gonna hack me and it’s was super easy to hack me blah blah blah send 1490$ in Bitcoin, to me it just looks like a copy and paste email. And if I don’t listen to his requests he’s gonna send videos of me ahem “Watching adult content” then continue on about how easy it was and he’ll put a Trojan on my pc then send videos to my friends, family and colleagues…pretty sure a hacker would know I’m unemployed and my email is in no way connected to anyone I know.</p> <p>Personally I think it’s fake because it’s extremely formal and why would a hacker waste time telling me I’m hacked instead of just remaining under the radar and breaking/stealing things but I thought I’d send it here in case someone thinks it’s real.</p> <p>(Oh yeah he said after I open this email you have 50 hours to transfer the bitcoin, does this guy think he’s the Joker or something)</p>
