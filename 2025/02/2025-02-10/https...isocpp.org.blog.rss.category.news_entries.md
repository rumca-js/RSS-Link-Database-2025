<p>
	It is now 45+ years since C++ was first conceived. As planned, it evolved to meet challenges, but many developers use C++ as if it was still the previous millennium. This is suboptimal from the perspective of ease of expressing ideas, performance, reliability, and maintainability.</p>

	About the article:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Here, I present the key concepts on which performant, type safe, and flexible C++ software can be built: resource management, life-time management, error-handling, modularity, and generic programming. At the end, I present ways to ensure that code is contemporary, rather than relying on outdated, unsafe, and hard-to-maintain techniques: guidelines and profiles.</p>

<p>
	From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		In any project, when a function is created for serialization, another function is created for unserialization.</p>
	<p>
		Serialization by contrast uses another approach - a contract with name and data structures is declared, and then serialization and unserialization of the data are automatic.</p>

	From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		With P2900, we propose to add contract assertions to the C++ language. This proposal is in the final stages of wording review before being included in the draft Standard for C++26.</p>
	<p>
		It has been suggested by some members of the C++ standard committee that this feature is too large, too complicated, and hard to teach. As it turns out, the opposite is true: contract assertions are actually very simple and can be explained in just five minutes. In this blog post, we will do exactly this!</p>
