Recently, I&#39;ve been learning about rss feeds, and more specifically about youtube&#39;s hidden rss feeds, and how they can be used to watch youtube videos on an rss reader. But the rss feeds from youtube only hold the 15 most recent videos shared by a channel (or added to a playlist), which I find somewhat inconvenient. I did some reading and found that rss feeds are xml files, so I thought maybe I could make my own in notepad by copying and pasting the rss feed from one youtube playlist, adding in the &quot;entry&quot; setions from another, then saving it as an xml file. It was then that I realized that basically every rss reader wants a url, not a file. Does anyone know if it&#39;s possible to cobble together multiple rss feeds into one, and (if an xml file has to be made) what would be an easy way ",
