<p>A new iPhone update patches a flaw that could allow an attacker to turn off a nearly seven-year-old <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-04-ios-12-usb-lockout-graykey-cellebrite.html">USB security feature</a>. Apple’s release notes for iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1 say the bug, which allowed the deactivation of USB Restricted Mode, “may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.”</p>
<p>The release notes <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122174" data-original-link="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122174">describe</a> the now-patched security flaw as allowing “a physical attack,” which suggests the attacker needed the device in hand to exploit it. So, unless your device was hijacked by “extremely sophisticated” attackers, there was nothing to panic about even before Monday’s update.</p>

<p>It’s a classic New York experience. You’re riding the subway to work, and suddenly the train stops. The lights go off, and you seem to be trapped between stations in a tunnel. For many New Yorkers, hardened over years of bad weather, prevalent trash and cohabitation with rats, this is just another recurring event that’s made less nerve-wracking by experience. But for Jarrod Musano, being stuck on a southbound 6 train that had lost power, there was little relief. Musano was born deaf, and the audio-only announcements were of no help. Musano couldn’t see anything in the darkness, and had to rely on gauging the amount of panic in his surroundings.</p>
<p>“I knew if it were serious, people would be moving quickly,” he recalled of the incident. Musano’s experience reflects one of many ways people who have disabilities and, more specifically, who are hard of hearing, have difficulty when using public transportation.

<p>Social platform Discord announced a new feature today called Ignore. This allows a person to hide any new messages, DMs, server notifications, profiles and activity from selected users without alerting them. In unveiling the update, Discord noted that this type of softer approach to limiting interactions had been requested by its community. It&#39;s a less stark way to tune out a person compared with blocking them.</p>
<p>In practice, DMs received from an Ignored person will appear in the inbox with an icon and a grayed-out name, so they are available if the ignorer chooses to look at them. The same applies to messages in a  If somebody who chose to Ignore an account joins a voice or video chat where that ignored person is present, Discord will show a warning alerting them before they hop into the call.</p>
