I&#39;ve been making PC, console, and mobile games professionally as a programmer and designer for over two decades (including AAA, AA, A, and others), including work on Age of Mythology (UI and god powers), Halo Wars (leader powers), Hero Academy (game director), Orcs Must Die (character movement and combat polish, physics, traps), Stranger Things 3 (core combat fluidity and boss fights), and many more!</p> <p>Eventually, I wanted to set off on my own, and began making solo indie games 12 years ago. I shipped a VR tower defense game Evil Robot Traffic Jam in 2015, and a modernized Rampart successor called Sky Cannoneer in 2020. Since then, I&#39;ve been working on my dream game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1473060?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=rGames&amp;utm_term=AMA">Reality Break</a>,
