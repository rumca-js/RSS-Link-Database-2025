<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am using RSS feeds to stay up to date on current research. Most things i can utilize PubMed for, e.g. Journals, Authors, Topics and it is really nice for that. Though I cannot find a way to get alerts on new articles citing existing ones. Web of Knowledge, Scopus and such had this functionality, but have since discontinued RSS support.</p> <p>I tried:</p> <p>- Using &quot;Find Feed&quot; functionality on various websites in my RSS reader Feedbro</p> <p>- I was trying RSS-bridge to Google Scholar but cannot get that to work (trying if its possible with public bridges, that seem to support Google Scholar, but cannot get the citation part working.</p> <p>- Using PubMed Advanced Search, but it seems using it for citations, it only does it on your initial search, and when saving just adds the PubMed IDs of the results in the query/ RSS feed.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I originally shared this in <a href="/r/techsupport">r/techsupport</a> but got no replies, so I&#39;m hoping to get at least some information here. Recently, I&#39;ve been learning about rss feeds, and more specifically about youtube&#39;s hidden rss feeds, and how they can be used to watch youtube videos on an rss reader. But the rss feeds from youtube only hold the 15 most recent videos shared by a channel (or added to a playlist), which I find somewhat inconvenient. I did some reading and found that rss feeds are xml files, so I thought maybe I could make my own in notepad by copying and pasting the rss feed from one youtube playlist, adding in the &quot;entry&quot; setions from another, then saving it as an xml file. It was then that I realized that basically every rss reader wants a url, not a file. Does anyone know if it&#39;s possible to cobble together multiple rss feeds into one, and (if an xml file has to be made) what would be an easy way
