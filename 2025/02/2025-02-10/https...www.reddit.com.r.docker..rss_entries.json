My full application for inference takes up 9 GB as a Docker Image. I like it because everything is already prepackaged, and once its pulled, running containers of the image is quick. </p> <p>This application uses two different types of Machine Learning models (vision and LLM RAG), which I have read can need larger images. I have already used the smaller, CPU Only, versions of Torch and Torchvision to optimize the space. I could probably use Python Alpine instead of Slim, but that wouldn&#39;t save too much space in the grand scheme of things.</p> <p>I am wondering if images this large are frowned upon on, especially for a smaller project such as this?
