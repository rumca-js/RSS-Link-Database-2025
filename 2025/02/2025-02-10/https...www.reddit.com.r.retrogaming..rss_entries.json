So I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m just having a hard time finding this online or it it is a false memory, but I can clearly remember that when the PSOne redesign came out, that they also released a redesigned memory card to match the new rounded plug for the controller. The console&#39;s pack in controller looked the same, but its color was a little lighter and the part that plugs into the console went from a square plastic housing to a rounded off plastic housing. I distinctly remember Sony releasing a memory card with the same shape and color to perfectly match the aesthetic. I also remember it costing a little more than the standard memory card and remember feeling like an idiot bc I couldn&#39;t help myself from buying that memory card to complete the look. Was this ever a thing or am I misremembering things? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Mr8BitX\"> /u/Mr8BitX </a> <br/> <span><a",

I bought a lot of games completely blind, I bought some great games such as Streets of Rage or Mortal Kombat and games like Sword of Sodan or Rise of the Robots. However as they were often under \u00a35 it wasn&#39;t the end of the world. </p> <p>One of the games I bought was Fighting Masters. It is a fighting game, it has a decent list of characters, some decent special moves and it&#39;s far superior to Rise of the Robots. It&#39;s not exactly Street Fighter 2 but it&#39;s not exactly Primal Rage either, I suggest giving it a go, even if you&#39;re a fighting game expert, beat it on your first try and never play it again at least you&#39;ll hear some pretty entertaining music and see some unique character designs that aren&#39;t all just",

I have an emulator in my iPad and have been playing ocarina of time but I want to take it further.
