<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Might seem a stupid question, is there a way to clone a website page, edit it and maybe share the link? I don’t need to publish it just let people who have the link see it. I’d like to edit a Transfertmarkt player’s page I have a pc but Transfertmarkt has a different layout on mobile, will the page I edit adjust itself when on mobile? Or can I edit it from my phone?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icardicolpiscee"> /u/Icardicolpiscee </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1iv468i/need_help/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking_Tutorials/comments/1iv468i/need_help/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am locked out of my old email almost completely, the only computer I had with that email on it is broken completely. This email has some very important stuff tied to it and a roblox account (yes, I know it&#39;s kind childish) with almost 10 years to it and probably upwards of 2000 dollars with of assets tied to it. Roblox support is absolutely worthless, surprise surprise. I have the roblox account name, the email name, past passwords, and proof that the account is mine if that&#39;s needed. I&#39;ll accept any and all help, this account means a lot to me for reasons I&#39;d rather not go into. I don&#39;t know how to get it back, I have very little experience with this kind of stuff, but this really means a lot to me. Any help is appreciated. Thank you Reddit community. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Many_Rest4865"> /u/Many_Rest4865 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hacking
