Julian Gollop, creator of the original X-COM game - known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ufo-enemy-unknown">UFO: Enemy Unknown</a> here in the UK, and followed up by Firaxis' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xcom-enemy-unknown">XCOM: Enemy Unknown</a> later on - has told Eurogamer that he would be quite happy to return to the series in some form. Also, that he's fine with still being known as just "the X-COM guy" - despite the few decades' worth of subsequent games he's made since.

He and I are beating back waves of brain-in-a-jar aliens in co-op in his new game, Chip 'n Clawz vs. The Brainioids, and this is the second time he's mentioned the bridgehead, causing me to detect just the tiniest bit of tension in his voice.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/x-coms-creator-believes-the-strategy-genres-in-dire-need-of-innovation-and-his-new-game-is-his-attempt">Read more</a></p>

According to some, modern games have become reluctant to let players off the leash. So conspicuous has the level designer&rsquo;s hand become when guiding players that the fundamental act of eye-widening discovery has been dumbed down, reduced to little more than scripted vista reveals. So, what happens when you set players free, providing minimal steering in a vast and potentially confusing 3D setting? You might get a game like the indie immersive sim, Peripeteia, a thriller that trusts you to find your own way in an abyssal cyberpunk sprawl.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peripeteia-offers-beguiling-maddening-cyberpunk-beauty">Read more</a></p>
