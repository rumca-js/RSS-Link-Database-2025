So far though, it has worked great for me in what I need it to do. But now I have slammed into a brick wall and I am humbly asking for help.</p> <p>I created a docker container in WSL2 (WIndows 11) and installed some support in it for coding for the RPI Pico using the Pico-SDK. This approach solved ALL my previous issues and (knock on wood) everything I have thrown at the container setup has built UF2&#39;s as expected. I make frequent experimental updates to my code however and the process of updating my devices is cumbersome. So now that I have a docker container doing what I wanted, FINALLY, I am setting out to automate some of the human interaction needed with the process.</p> <p>I have a little bit of a better understanding on how it all works, starting my container, using EXEC to start an interactive shell into it.
