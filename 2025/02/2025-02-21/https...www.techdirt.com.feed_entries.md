While Trump openly&#160;declares&#160;the Ukrainian [&#8230;]

While an unelected tech billionaire is effectively orchestrating a coup of the US government, violating federal law with apparent impunity, and disclaiming all responsibility for the chaos he&#8217;s causing, the Democrats have identified their top priority: repealing Section 230. You might think — in a moment when democracy itself seems to be unraveling and the [&#8230;]

Utah state Rep. Trevor Lee is not going to like this headline. Too bad. It&#8217;s accurate, even if he&#8217;d like to pretend it isn&#8217;t. Trevor Lee is again pushing a bill that would ban government agencies from displaying pride flags, but would allow Nazi and Confederate flags to be displayed in classrooms, so long as [&#8230;]
