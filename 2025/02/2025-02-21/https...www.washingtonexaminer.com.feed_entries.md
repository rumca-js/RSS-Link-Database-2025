It’s rare to see a film featuring a woman who desperately wants to be pregnant. If you learned about pregnancy from Hollywood comedies, you’d think getting pregnant and having a baby is a disaster that can befall you, not something people deeply wish for, pray for, pay for, and plan for.

Must every screen endeavor be an eight-episode limited series? The question has become a cliché, but let the record nevertheless show that Apple&#8216;s newest production would have been a perfectly forgettable Tuesday afternoon matinée not so long ago. Or, better still, a CBS special for the home-on-Saturday-night crowd. Instead, Prime Target limps along for the [&#8230;]

President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency may be hogging all the headlines, but it is the steps Trump has taken to restore the Constitution’s original understanding of the separation of powers that will etch his administration in history books for generations. This week, Trump signed a new executive order titled “Ensuring Accountability for All [&#8230;]

I believe that Mark Zuckerberg&#8216;s enthusiasm for MMA is genuine, that his new style is entirely artificial, and that he&#8217;s more religious than he puts out in public. However, I&#8217;m basing this on my interpretation of a PR-consultant-crafted image. You can&#8217;t know billionaires. We can judge their companies, influence, money, and the myths that orbit [&#8230;]

Seven years ago, just before commissioning the Netflix series that would make names such as Max Verstappen and Yuki Tsunoda at least vaguely familiar to much of Mr. and Mrs. America, the bigwigs at Formula One decided to strike a blow for women’s equality — by firing a few dozen girls.

Rod Blagojevich, a corrupt former governor of Illinois, calls himself a &#8220;Trumpocrat.&#8221; The label is truly apt because nobody has better articulated the heart of Trumpism than Blago, who famously said, “I’ve got this thing, and it’s f***ing golden. And I’m just not giving it up for f***in’ nothing. I’m not going to do it.” [&#8230;]
