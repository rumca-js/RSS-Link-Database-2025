## Ship of Theseus is the most pretentious book in the world and it’s hilarious.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I’m finally tackling <em>S</em>, JJ Abrams’s complicated book-within-a-book mystery; on the internet’s suggestion, I’m starting off by reading the base novel, <em>Ship of Theseus</em>. Not even one chapter in and oh. My. God. It’s exactly the type of pretentious, heavy-handed nonsense that English majors and college professors go nuts over. The “original” margin notes in pencil could’ve been notes I made at 21. The over-underlining, the Christ imagery, the references to scholarly works; even now, I’m wondering how the actual protagonist isn’t even touching on the Greek mythology (the amnesiac lost in the town as Theseus lost in the Minotaur’s labyrinth) smacking him in the face. I don’t know if it’s by Mark Dorst’s design, but I’ve never seen college catnip like this. Like, of course you love this, actual protagonists, you’re twenty-something lit students! I’m actually dying right now.</p> <p>Edit: I’m not mad, it’s funny to me. It’s like looking at

I feel sure this lady is going to be a Nobel Prize winner before long. This is an amazing book. I don&#39;t think anyone has ever represented Zimbabwe as it appears (or may have appeared recently) to the Zimbabweans before. (Well... to SOME Zimbabweans. obviously she can&#39;t speak for them all!)</p> <p>The distinction between her writing and that of Doris Lessing (also nominally from Zimbabwe) is stark. Lessing was actually British, and you see that in The Golden Notebook. She may have had Zimbabwe citizenship but she was and wrote as a Briton.</p> <p>Bulawayo&#39;s topic is, really, what&#39;s going on.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have a theory that the books you read between the ages of 13-15 are the most influential on the way you think for the rest of your teenage years. Everyone has that one book that shifted their worldview during these years. For me that book was “Looking for Alaska” by John Green–cliche, I know. To my 13 year old brain, this was a revolutionary book, I thought it was outrageous and daring and I absolutely loved it. I’m aware that in recent years it has made it on the list of banned books in the US–an incredibly sad moment for me. “Dead Poets Society” by Nancy H. Kleinbaum striked me as a book with similar value. This is the type of book that I would have based much of my personality on had I discovered it sooner. Especially since I come from a conservative society where there is a great deal of academic pressure from a very young age, I’ve faced many challenges similar to the ones that these boys face with their school and their parents.

I find myself actually avoiding it much of the time. Partly because it&#39;s just a big list of names that don&#39;t often have value to me. I&#39;m fully aware that there are thousands of books out there by Authors I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m not against expanding my horizons in literature but I have to have a reason to read one book over another. Seeing a name and nothing else doesn&#39;t offer me personally much of an incentive. </p> <p>Is there a way we can improve the information that&#39;s shared. Perhaps by including a favorite line from what you&#39;ve finished to showcase the writers style. A brief synopsis of the book?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A recent discussion about books describing dysfunctional families reminded me of Sarah Easter Collins’ <em>Things Don&#39;t Break on Their Own</em>. I really enjoyed reading this, and I’m surprised it hasn’t already been mentioned on Reddit. It is classified as “Thriller, Suspense, Psychological Fiction”. I sometimes get frustrated by different timelines and multiple perspectives, but I liked the way the author did it here, slowly unraveling the mystery of a girl’s disappearance with themes of lost love, memory, and long-buried secrets. There is a lesbian relationship in the novel, but that was not the primary focus. I just loved the way she writes, <span class="md-spoiler-text">although I found the resolution a bit unlikely</span>. As one of the minor characters says,</p> <blockquote> <p>You&#39;ll meet people in your life that you&#39;ll always wish you could have walked with a little longer.
