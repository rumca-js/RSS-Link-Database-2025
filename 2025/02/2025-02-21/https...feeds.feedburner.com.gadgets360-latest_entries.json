        "description": "ISRO, in collaboration with CMTI, has developed a 10-tonne vertical planetary mixer, the largest of its kind for solid propellants. The system improves precision, efficiency, and safety in propellant production, which is vital for rocket motors. Weighing 150 tonnes, the mixer successfully passed factory-level tests. It is expected to enhance India\u2019s self-reliance in space technology by increasing productivity in solid rocket motor production. The initiative aligns with the country\u2019s push for indigenous innovation in aerospace engineering.",

The process could sequester billions of tons of CO2 while benefiting soil health. Unlike traditional magnesium silicates, calcium silicates react faster with CO2, making the approach more efficient. Scientists are exploring ways to source calcium oxide sustainably, and field trials in the U.S. are assessing potential environmental impacts. If successful, this method could provide a cost-effective and scalable solution to atmospheric carbon removal.",
