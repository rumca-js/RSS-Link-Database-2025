<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been messing with AI for a minet now and have unable to find an answer to my question. For example, with google&#39;s &quot;teachable machine&quot;, if it doesn&#39;t have enough data to recognize an image, it gives seemingly random values. After thinking about it for a time, I realized that manually setting an &quot;exploration rate&quot; for reward-based models doesn&#39;t really seem... the best. If the AI doesn&#39;t have ANY values to know what gets it the best reward, how does it or whats the best way for it to find out?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Electrical_Apple_678"> /u/Electrical_Apple_678 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1iv44xg/how_does_ai_explore_in_rewardbased_neural_networks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1iv44xg/how_does_ai_explore_in_rewardbased_neural_

Economics will always make the on-prem vs. cloud equation difficult to compute. Disruptive technologies will frequently swing the pendulum one way or the other. LLMs / GenAI could make both cloud and on-prem deployements significantly easier, cheaper, etc. LLMs can be very valuable on both the offensive and defensive ends of the spectrum, making them an absolute requirement for security professionals. If you aren&#39;t exploring the benefits of LLMs for cybersecurity, now is a good time to get started.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IntelBusiness"> /u/IntelBusiness </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1iv3zvl/will_ai_cause_fewer_cloud_deployments/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/

As long as you knew specifically what you are looking for you will find it with a search engine.

This will then technically make physicians more efficient at their job and could in theory reduce demand. Less doctors can handle more patients and potentially demand will decrease, making medicine a harder field enter.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/hans_schmidt_838_2"> /u/hans_schmidt_838_2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1iupbif/how_might_ai_impact_the_demand_for_physicians_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1iupbif/how_might_a

When ChatGPT came out, about two or three years ago, we were all in shock and amazed by its capabilities (I certainly was). Yet, despite this, many people started mocking it and putting it down because of its mistakes.</p> <p>It was still in its early stages, a completely new project, so of course, it had flaws. The criticisms regarding its errors were fair at the time. But now, years later, I find it amusing to see people who still haven’t grasped how game-changing these tools are and continue to dismiss them outright. Initially, I understood those comments, but now, after two or three years, these tools have made incredible progress (even though they still have many limitations), and most of them are free. I see so many people who fail to recognize their true value.</p> <p>Take MidJourney, f

The key innovation is using counterfactual reasoning to identify truly relevant regions in volumetric brain scans that influence model decisions.</p> <p>Main technical points: - Uses a two-stage pipeline: initial region proposal followed by causal verification - Employs 3D CNNs with an attention mechanism to identify candidate regions - Generates counterfactuals by selectively perturbing regions and measuring output changes - Validates causal importance through intervention testing - Tested on ADNI (Alzheimer&#39;s) and BraTS (tumor) datasets</p> <p>Results: - Outperformed LIME, SHAP, and Grad-CAM on explanation accuracy - Identified known disease-relevant regions with higher precision - Showed better alignment with expert annotations - Reduced false positive regions compared to baseline methods - Required ~2-3x more computation time
