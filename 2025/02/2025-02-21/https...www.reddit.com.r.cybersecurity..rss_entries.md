OWASP&#39;s top 10 LLM threats highlight issues such as prompt injection attacks, hallucinations, data exposure, and excessive autonomy in AI agents. To mitigate these risks, it&#39;s essential to implement robust security measures, including:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Eliminating Standing Privileges</strong>: Ensure RAG systems have no default access rights, activating permissions only upon user prompts.</li> <li><strong>Implementing Access Delegation</strong>: Utilize secure token-based systems like OAuth2 for user-to-RAG access delegation, ensuring RAGs operate strictly within user-auth
