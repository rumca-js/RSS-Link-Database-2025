## PGA Tour 2K25 Review

PGA Tour 2K25 reviewed by Andrew McMahon on PlayStation 5, also available on Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

With substantial changes to how it looks and plays, PGA Tour 2K25 feels like a different game from its predecessor. The new swing mechanics, paired with the significantly improved graphics, makes for a much more realistic ambiance, even with a lethargic performance by the announcing team. The highly customizable MyCareer campaign mode shines as one of the most enjoyable parts even though it has a tacked-on personality system, occasional unnecessary connectivity issues, and of course microtransactions. PGA Tour 2K25 is still a few strokes behind EA Sports PGA Tour as the best golfing simulator around, but if it continues to improve like this with each new iteration, we may see it close that gap relatively soon.

In today's Daily Fix:
We're getting a "next-gen" update for GTA 5 on PC before we get GTA 6...which honestly has been a long time coming. The PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5 should now be on par—graphically—with the Xbox Series X and PS5 counterparts. Of course, no word yet on a new GTA 6 trailer. In entertainment news, Amazon MGM Studios now has full creative control over James Bond. Long-time franchise producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are stepping aside, but will retain ownership. Amazon has been involved in the Bond film franchise ever since they purchased MGM several years ago. And finally, cult favorite 90s-era anime Samurai Pizza Cats is back, this time with a new side-scrolling action game.
