We expect them to go viral any minute...any minute now...but it just never happens. Not because there is something wrong with the game, but just because sometimes you need to be in the right place in the right time.</p> <p>My example would be <strong>Day Repeat Day</strong>. A game with an amazing cult classic potential. It pretends to be a classic match-3, but has such a deep lore and so many layers behind it. And yet, it is completely unknown, with 32 Steam reviews.</p> <p>Another example: <strong>Supposedly Wonderful Future</strong>. Such a deep and interesting visual novel with so many cool concepts and intersting ideas. Surely people will pick up on that. And yet, 17 reviews on Steam.</p> <p>What are your examples of such games?
