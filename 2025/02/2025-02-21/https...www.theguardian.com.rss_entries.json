With the Championship\u2019s top two, Leeds and Sheffield United, playing each other on Monday, third-placed Burnley took their chance to narrow the gap with second-half goals from Josh Brownhill, Connor Roberts and Manuel Benson.</p><p>Edwards, signed on loan from Sporting last month, opened the scoring after 43 minutes. Having played a short pass to Josh Cullen, Edwards received the return, benefited from a ricochet off Shea Charles and showed neat footwork before producing a close-range finish.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/21/championship-roundup-burnley-sheffield-wednesday-bristol-city-middlesbrough\">Continue readi",

Considering Everton\u2019s form when Moyes was given the job \u2013 they were 16th in the Premier League, a point above the relegation zone \u2013 it\u2019s a reunion that has gone according to plan.</p><p>Everton are now looking up rather than down the table. They have won 2.17 points per game under Moyes, up from a pitiful 0.89. Sean Dyche won three of his 19 games in charge this season, a total Moyes has already surpassed in six matches, having watched his team beat Tottenham, Brighton, Leicester and Crystal Palace.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2025/feb/21/everton-davi",

This is correct. Part Two, like its predecessor, is arcane, surprisingly weird, oddly structured and deeply uninterested in pandering.
