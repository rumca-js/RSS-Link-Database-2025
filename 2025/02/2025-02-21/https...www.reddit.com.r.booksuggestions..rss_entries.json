I also did read a bot of Finding Audrey, but the mom character kinda ruined any enjoyment I was having with it.</p> <p>There is also another problem, some books never got published in my country, so it makes it harder to obtain them, I tried asking for help in a portuguese subreddit, but got no answers there either.

I know it is very niche, but I have been coping with some things, and I wanted suggestions of books that had the heroine be very traumatized by an event in her past, or has a disease or disability that she lives with, but can momentarily render her down. It can be a mental disease, too, like depression, anxiety or PTSD. I want there to be a partner, mostly female friend but lover fits too, that is very worried about her when she is hurt or having a panic attack or even is attacked. I just love this dinamic. If it&#39;s a romance, bonus points if it is lesbian. Plus bonus points if the FMC is afraid of touching. I would like mostly real life, but depending on the book, it could be fantasy.

She&#39;s been reading a lot about narcissists, their abuse, and trauma, but I really want to get her a book that breaks down what misogyny really is and how it affects her everyday thinking.

I&#39;d especially enjoy if there is a focus on generational healing, family saga, or growth in relationships through the adventuring. I&#39;ve read some novels in this style that take place in the mountains and would love to read more, but Arctic or cold weather settings as well as other natural landscapes, such as on the ocean (sailing adventure) are equally appealing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/becomingoutside\"> /u/becomingoutside </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iue3ax/outdoor_adventure_fiction/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1iue3ax/outdoor_adventure_fiction/\">[comments]</a></span>",

I found them absolutely addictive and read the whole thing in a few weeks. </p> <p>What I specifically liked about them was how they interwove many storylines at once, and it still felt cohesive as they were bound by one single theme (hockey). Also that they are contemporary and accessible in terms of style, while still beautifully written. </p> <p>I&#39;m looking for something similar - a story with an exciting plot, very engaging style, and mostly focused on people&#39;s lives and how they intertwine through various events, but preferably not in the realm of fantasy, investigation, etc. </p> <p>This is very specific but I&#39;m excited to hear any recommendations :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; sub",
