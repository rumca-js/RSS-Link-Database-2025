<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Like, legit, all I want to do is change my wallpaper - it’s a really ugly preset at the moment but the ability to change it is greyed out since it’s controlled by admin. I’ve requested IT to change it to a picture I sent of clouds, or to let me change it to a different preset, and they denied it. It’s a small thing but I’m super annoyed by it and want to be petty and find a way to change it anyways. </p> <p>I wasn’t really sure where to go or who to ask? Any help is appreciated! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/daneylion"> /u/daneylion </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iuyr6o/anyway_around_admin_settings_on_a_company_tablet/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iuyr6o/anyway_around_admin_settings_on_a_company_tablet/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Ehhh hope I don’t sound like a idiot as I’m very new, I’m looking to get a raspberry pi 5 and have gathered the built in wifi adapter doesn’t support monitor mode. Any suggestions on a relatively cheap wifi adapter that would help me achieve monitor mode. Please don’t torch me lol</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ewd421"> /u/ewd421 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iutzyg/wifi_adapter_for_raspberry_pi_5/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iutzyg/wifi_adapter_for_raspberry_pi_5/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to know how the Certified Ethical Hacker certification is seen by the job market and recruiters. Can it help me, in terms of jobs and salaries, to advance my career in the offensive security field? Is it &quot;easier&quot; to get pentesting jobs with it?</p> <p>I know that the exam is not practical and is not the best to acquire knowledge, I spent a lot of time on HTB modules, labs, and in other CTF platforms. Even so, where I live (Brazil), CEH is highly valued by HR and recruiters.</p> <p>I need to know if it is worth spending money on the voucher, considering that I will need to save part of my income for this, intending to boost my career and get better positions and salaries. </p> <p>Thanks.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/reznovmustdie"> /u/reznovmustdie </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1iutl2r/ceh_vs_job_market/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr
