One player was locked on tickets just to draw 3 cards that were also locked out.

I also had a total column that removed &quot;duplicate&quot; entries.

For myself and my group I am a bit hesitant to pull out a game that will take 2 + hours to play, especially considering it will be the first time playing the game for everyone in my group, which means I&#39;d expect to tack on at least 30 minutes to this play time. </p> <p>I am really happy to see in the official rule book there is a shorter version, where you skip rounds 1, 4, and 7, effectively scoring after two rounds. I am just wondering if anyone has ever played this way and what they think of it?</p> <p>I am a bit surprised to see that the rules recommend skipping one round per scoring period, rather than just playing two full scoring periods and skipping the last three rounds. It seems to me that 2 rounds may feel a bit rushed before you score.

I am over the moon as you might expect (not even counting these amazing boxes).</p> <p>While i will be playing these games a lot coming weeks, i do have a question for this group:</p> <p>As you can see in the picture, there are several figures portraying monsters and creatures. I want to paint these figures (of both games) to really fit nicely into the game setup. Yet, i have no experience in doing so as well as no intention to keep painting after these sets are done. Ergo not wanting to spend a lot of money on the paint and tools. Can anyone advise me how i can approach this situation in a way that the figures will look immaculate, as well as not drowning in debt because of the paint cost?</p> <p>Thanks in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Propperdutchman\"> /u/Propperdutchman </a> <",
