I\u2019ve requested IT to change it to a picture I sent of clouds, or to let me change it to a different preset, and they denied it. It\u2019s a small thing but I\u2019m super annoyed by it and want to be petty and find a way to change it anyways. </p> <p>I wasn\u2019t really sure where to go or who to ask?
