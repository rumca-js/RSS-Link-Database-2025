A story where the main character isn&#39;t born exceptionally competent, talented, or gifted in some grand aspect, and they really have to grind for it. </p> <p>Some fantasy stories have magic systems that are hereditary, or where you&#39;re otherwise born with powers.

Which do you prefer?</p> <p>The Poppy War both benefits and suffers from its more singular focus on a single protagonist/anti-protagonist. While that deeper introspective focus lends itself to the more interesting exploration of psychological trauma you find in that series, the broader focus on more characters and a wider timeline in Greenbone Saga keeps things fresher, and allows it to go more into themes of family and honor. </p> <p>Perhaps Poppy War is more impactful on total war and moral corruption, but is Rin a strong enough character to carry the reader through those ideas on her own?

Do you guys have any recommendations for epic fantasy books that will seriously scare the shit out of me?</p> <p>Some things to note: I\u2019m looking for high fantasy, full secondary world books. Portal fantasy and other stuff that takes place on Earth aren\u2019t really my cup of tea. Beautiful prose is definitely a big plus but I\u2019m also fine with simple prose as long as it\u2019s clean/well edited (a la Sanderson). Not sure how relevant this will be for a horror novel discussion but no YA please! </p> <p>Here are some fantasy/horror things I like to give y\u2019all a feel for my taste!</p> <p>Fantasy: Stormlight, anything by Robin Hobb, Wheel of Time, ASOIAF/Game of Thrones</p> <p>Ho",

I haven\u2019t read many books, but I\u2019d say one of my favourites is: Jake Atlas: The Tomb of the Emerald Snake. Not necessarily fantasy but I thoroughly enjoyed it and re-read it about 3-4 times. I was a bit younger then though, so my taste has most likely changed. I think my favourite novel is: Wings of Fire: The Dragonet Prophecy. I adored this novel and how unique it was, I also recently finished the 4th book in the series and I\u2019m looking to read the 5th soon. I currently have a reading list, however it\u2019s most comprised of very popular books and I\u2019d prefer to read some underrated novels. My list is currently: </p> <p>\u2022 Powerless, and the rest of the trilogy.</p> <p>\u2022 The ACOTAR series.</p> <p>\u2022 Fourth Wing, and the rest of the trilogy.</p> <p>\u2022 Jade City, and the rest of its trilogy.</p> <p>\u2022 Sorcery of Thorns and the other book in the serie",
