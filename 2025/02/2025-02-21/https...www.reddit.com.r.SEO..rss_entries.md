A client of mine lost his long-established domain due to a domain dispute case in court. He was generating a significant number of leads through organic rankings, but the sudden suspension is now negatively impacting his business.</p> <p>I advised him to purchase a new domain using his business name since reactivating the suspended domain might take a long time—if it’s even possible at all.</p> <p>He has already purchased the new domain, and I’m now in the process of migrating the content from the old site.
