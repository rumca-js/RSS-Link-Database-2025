Here is the answer for a frequently asked question about true resolution of an 8K 360° video. Unlike standard videos, in a 360° video you can see only a part of original image (approximately 30 degrees out of 360). As result, the real resolution of the part you can see isn't bigger than 1.3K.

Please note that AirPano team originally shoots its films in 16,12,10,8K resolution, depending on year and cameras used back then. But before upload to YouTube channel we downscale all our videos to 8K.
