## Red Dead Redemption 2 - Framerate issues after playing the game for some time (in one session)

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone.</p> <p>So basically my problem is that, after some time of playing the game at around 100fps stable, my framerate drops to the 50&#39;s, and after some more time, to the 10-20&#39;s. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s story mode or online. After doing some investigation with MangoHUD active, I can see that the frame drops start, when my VRAM gets maxxed out (at 8GB for my card). I also observed that when VRAM gets full, the GPU usage also jumps to 100%. I&#39;m running the game from steam, and tried: Proton Experimental (bleeding edge) and GE-Proton9-25, on both of which the issue was present. I tried both XWayland, and Wayland itself as well. Can it be that just VRAM being maxxed out causes it, or can there be something else behind it?</p> <p>For clarification. there are my PC Specs:</p> <p><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD Ryzen 5 5600</p> <p><strong>GPU:</strong> AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT 8GB (XFX Speedster QICK 308)</p> <p><strong>RAM:</strong> 1

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I bought an 8bitdo Ultimate 2C wireless controller, hoping that I&#39;ve finally found something compatible with my Garuda Dragonized KDE. Alas, when I plugged it in, the home button lit up, and the PC made the noise telling me the USB socket is connected to something, but nothing else happened. When I try wireless mode it also doesn&#39;t work. 2.4G mode straight up does nothing, while in Bluetooth mode the controller keeps connecting and disconnecting each half second, to the point where I had to restart my PC to make the notifications stop popping (sometimes it worked if I just turned off Bluetooth on my PC, but not every time). </p> <p>I am pretty new with Linux and have little to no knowledge when it comes to coding. I picked Garuda specifically because it&#39;s really beginner-friendly and doesn&#39;t require much tinkering to work in general. But in this case, my lack of knowledge is most likely an issue as well in finding ways to fix it,

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I used to have a NVIDIA GPU in the past, and on Windows I was able to change the colors, saturation, contrast and hue with the NVIDIA control panel.</p> <p>I now have an AMD system with a 7900XTX, and I am using Linux, not Windows. I am aware that AMD provides the Adrenaline software for Windows, which to my Knowledge, allows for color changes.</p> <p>However, Adrenaline is not available for Linux. What can I instead use for color changes?</p> <p>I&#39;m on Arch Linux, running Hyprland.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/4bjmc881"> /u/4bjmc881 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1iudiwu/adjust_colors_on_linux_for_amd_cards/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1iudiwu/adjust_colors_on_linux_for_amd_cards/">[comments]</a></span>
