Keep in mind, I'm coming from using only things like tabnine or copilot (which I haven't used in a while, but did play around with and test) so a lot of these features are generally new to me. I've never used Cursor or any of the others, so I can't compare the two.\n\nAnd again, this really is just a first impression of Windsurf, not a full review or anything like that. Once I have more experience with it, in various languages and sizes of codebases, I'll make a more in-depth video of my experience - probably in a month from now.\n\nMicro Center Resources:\nTrade In, Donate, or Recycle your old tech at Micro Center:  https://micro.center/2b4904\nSign-Up for Early Access to Micro Center Santa Clara:  https://micro.center/b70bcd\n\n0:00 what I\u2019ve coded with Windsurf\n0:46 I should be coding on ",
