L’idée est d&#39;aider les entreprises à répondre vite et bien, sans y passer des heures. </p> <h1>Comment ça marche ?</h1> <p>Vous connectez votre compte Google (celui qui gère vos fiches d&#39;établissements), ReplyReply récupère les avis et l’IA propose des réponses personnalisées – chaleureuses pour les compliments, tactiques pour les critiques.

Bonus : ça encourage les clients contents à laisser plus d’avis sur Google Maps. </p> <h1>Le défi</h1> <p>Faire comprendre à l’IA les nuances des avis (positifs ou grinçants) et intégrer l’API Google sans accroc n’a pas été simple. Mais quand je vois les statistiques d&#39;utilisation des premiers utilisateurs, ça me rassure dans mon choix de projet !</p> <h1>Pourquoi c’est utile ?</h1> <p>Tout le monde lit les avis avant de choisir

The tool is currently focused on <strong>long-term investing</strong>, and my goal is to make it easier to discover optimal investment strategies tailored to your unique circumstances.</p> <p>You can check it out here: <a href="https://portfoliofinder.asteffey.com/">https://portfoliofinder.asteffey.com/</a>. I’d love for you to try it out and share your feedback!</p> <h1>How it works (idea overview):</h1> <ul> <li>Allows customizable parameters based on your personal <strong>investment circumstances</strong> (e.g., your timeline, financial situation, and goals).</li> <li>Backtests each portfolio over <strong>every possible start date</strong> for your selected timeframe (going back to 1970).</li> <li>Adjusts for <strong>inflation</strong>, <strong>

Naturally, AI feels like the next big thing, but from what I’ve seen, most AI automation tools today seem to focus on small-scale tasks—lead generation, customer support chatbots, simple workflow automations, etc.</p> <p>The thing is, these solutions don’t seem to attract high-ticket clients (at least not yet). Meanwhile, a lot of the people hyping AI on YouTube are just selling expensive courses rather than actually running profitable AI businesses.</p> <p>Has anyone here built a successful AI automation business? What use cases have actually brought in serious money? Is there a real demand for AI automation beyond just chatbots and cold email tools?</p> <p>Would love t

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone, </p> <p>Sharing a quick lesson I learned the hard way, and hoping to get some feedback on a new idea before I repeat my mistakes.</p> <p>My Recent &quot;Oops&quot; Moment:</p> <p>I spent about three months building an app based on an idea I was excited about. My last brilliant idea is that i can help user convert their picture of attraction into a short introduction where they could ask followup question on. </p> <p>Then, I actually tried using the app myself, and realized something: it wasn&#39;t very good. The core concept wasn&#39;t really solving a problem – users don&#39;t need a broad introduction on the overall attraction like a wiki page, what they need is a tour guide to structurally guide them to embrace the whole experience. It was a classic case of building something without really validating if anyone needed it.</p> <p>New Idea (Please Be Brutally Honest): Virtual Tour Guide - &quot;Vivid Tour Books&quot; for Attractions<
