<p>A wide-ranging and thoroughly entertaining portrait not just of Queen Elizabeth II but of the psyche of her subjects</p><p>The funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in 2022 was watched by around 28 million people in the UK alone. In her lifetime, she was one of the most photographed and scrutinised figures in the world. Yet few could say they knew the late monarch since, says biographer Craig Brown, she kept “her interior world screened from public view” and was “a human looking-glass: the light cast by fame bounced off her, and back on to those she faced”.</p><p>Little wonder, then, that A Voyage Around the Queen does not follow the usual conventions of a biography. Instead of a chronological account of its subject, it is a patchwork of news reports, letters, diary entries, secondhand anecdotes, tweets and even dreams. The result is a wide-ranging and thoroughly entertaining portrait not just of the woman but the psyche of her subjects. You don’t have to be a royalist to enjoy such titbi

But Nolan’s Odyssey may yet revive its bronzed vigour</p><p>Back in the 1950s and 60s in the twilight of Hollywood’s golden era, the sword-and-sandals movie stood as tall as the Colossus of Rhodes.

When Ben-Hur had its chariot race, Spartacus roused cries of defiance and <a href="https://www.moviemistakes.com/film1203?utm_source=chatgpt.com">the odd moment of splendid anachronism</a>, and Cleopatra had Elizabeth Taylor burning through costume changes like a pharaoh with an Amex card.</p><p>And then, it all collapsed.

<p>Got a houseplant query? Our expert is here to answer them. This week, how to revive an ailing dragon tree</p><p><strong>What’s the problem – is it rust?</strong><br>
 My 10-year-old dragon tree has been happily growing in a bright attic room, but recently the leaves have developed brown splotches.</p><p><strong>Diagnosis</strong><br>
 It’s unlikely to be rust (a fungal infection). Dragon trees (<em>Dracaena marginata</em>) are not particularly prone to rust infections – the splotches are more likely caused by under-watering, tap water or dry air from being too close to a heat source. Dracaenas are very sensitive to salts, minerals, and chemicals, such as fluoride and chloride, which can lead to leaf discoloration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/feb/21/houseplant-clinic-why-has-my-dragon-tree-gone-splotchy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The mood in Taipei is one of wariness as the new US president takes a blowtorch to diplomatic norms and assurances</p><p>It’s a bustling morning at the Dongmen wet market, in inner-city Taipei. Mr Yu is shouting at passersby, trying to offload his boxes of freshly steamed dumplings. In between customers, the self-professed “dumpling king” and his wife, Ms Liao, discuss Donald Trump.</p><p>“He’s very positive, energetic,” says Yu, handing flour-covered coins to a customer.
