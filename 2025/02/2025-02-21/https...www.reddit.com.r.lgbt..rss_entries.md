## Question for trans people

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yesterday I was on the subway to go home and a trans woman got on. I was standing near her and watched other people stare at her. There was even a woman who was totally gender nonconforming giving her the side eye. I tried to think of a way to show her support. She was sort of to my side and kept her head down, in her phone. I got that. She was younger than me and Latina. I only say that because I‚Äôm white, cis male and older. The question is, could I have said or done something to show her some support? I know that feeling. Way, way back in the day I would literally shake if I went into a straight bar. I ran through a few thoughts but was afraid that my race, gender, and age may have put her off. We weren‚Äôt facing each other. I could march and scream until I‚Äôm hoarse about my support for trans‚Äô rights. I feel like I missed an opportunity to show it. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alive_Pace_230
