## Very Slow Speeds With Eweka

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, I am located in the U.S. and got an AT&amp;T fiber connection of 1gbps, however, eweka download speeds do not go over 5mb/s. I will get 20mb/s somedays but never more than that. I was getting 100mb/s from frugal but stopped it due to way too many incomplete packages. Eweka is slow but has never failed on me so I&#39;m happy with it. I am using port 443 and 50 connections, I have tried playing with the connections but it does not make a difference ... Any help will be appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CictorVastro"> /u/CictorVastro </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iuevfz/very_slow_speeds_with_eweka/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iuevfz/very_slow_speeds_with_eweka/">[comments]</a></span>

## NZB Downloads Faster with VPN

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently, I noticed my <strong>NZB downloads</strong> had slowed dramatically. I had changed no settings in my NEWSREADER APP. </p> <p>When I reconnect through a VPN (which usually slightly slows downloads) NZB downloads returned to the former (much faster) speeds.</p> <p>Seems odd, right? Anyone have any input?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BrianDanielWakefield"> /u/BrianDanielWakefield </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iueugw/nzb_downloads_faster_with_vpn/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1iueugw/nzb_downloads_faster_with_vpn/">[comments]</a></span>
