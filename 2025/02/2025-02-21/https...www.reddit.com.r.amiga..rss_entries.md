## Pimiga4 on RPi4 audio options?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have just put Pimiga4 on my RPi4 and it is plugged into my PC monitor via HDMI. This monitor has no speakers or headphone jack so I am wondering what my audio options are other than the built in 3.5mm jack on the RPi as that sounds awful through my headphones. I noticed something in the Pimiga readme about usb audio but I wasn&#39;t even aware RPi supported usb soundcards. What is it referring to? Can I get any usb soundcard to work with it? Are there any other options? I did briefly look into Hifiberry Digi+ but that looked too complicated to setup for me.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheKodebreaker"> /u/TheKodebreaker </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ius55t/pimiga4_on_rpi4_audio_options/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/1ius55t/pimiga4_on_rpi4_audio_options/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, I&#39;m starting to dig into AMIGA C/C++ development and I&#39;m trying to avoid old C and asm compiler, hence I loved <a href="https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug">BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug</a> plugin and specifically the fork <a href="https://github.com/jyoberle/vscode-amiga-debug">https://github.com/jyoberle/vscode-amiga-debug</a> from <a href="https://github.com/jyoberle">jyoberle</a> that manages libraries.</p> <p>I wanted the same goodness with the libSDL, I&#39;m kind of reluctant to go the full monty on the inners of AMIGA video modes, so I build the last known amiga libSDL and made my way out to compile it with modern compilers in a fork here <a href="https://github.com/mlorenzati/libSDL12">https://github.com/mlorenzati/libSDL12</a></p> <p>To my surprise this version relies only on cybergraphics but at least <a href="https://github.com/mlorenzati/libSDL12/blob/master/video/amigaos/SDL_agavideo.c">SDL_agavideo.c</a
