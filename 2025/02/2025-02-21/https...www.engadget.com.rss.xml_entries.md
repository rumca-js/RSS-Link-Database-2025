<p>OpenAI has banned the accounts of a group of Chinese users who had attempted to use ChatGPT to debug and edit code for an AI social media surveillance tool, the company <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://openai.com/global-affairs/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai/"><ins>said Friday</ins></a>. The campaign, which OpenAI calls Peer Review, saw the group prompt ChatGPT to generate sales pitches for a program those documents suggest was designed to monitor anti-Chinese sentiment on X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and other platforms. The operation appears to have been particularly interested in spotting calls for protests against human rights violations in China, with the intent of sharing those insights with the country&#39;s authorities.</p>
<p>&quot;This network consisted of ChatGPT accounts that operated in a time pattern consistent with mainland Chinese business hours, prompted our models in Chinese, and used our tools with a volume and variety consistent with manual prompti

<p>It's not clear that anyone was asking for a company to build a muscular, sinewy robot or to see a video of it dangling, helpless from a hook, but life is full of surprises and <a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="no-affiliate-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7dhwFcuUn0" data-original-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7dhwFcuUn0">this YouTube video</a> of Clone Robotics' "Protoclone" is here all the same.</p>
<p>The Protoclone appears to be a prototype version of the "Clone" robot the aptly named Clone Robotics is working to build. The video shows the Protoclone flexing its arms and legs, with visible artificial muscle fibers moving underneath its white "skin." Based on Clone Robotic's video description, the impressive part here is that fact that the Protoclone has "over 200 degrees of freedom, over 1,000 Myofibers, and over 200 sensors," and also that the robot is "faceless," for some reason.</p>

<p>Since the GSA oversees government buildings, shutting down chargers will impact personal electric vehicles owned by government employees and government-owned EVs.

<p>On March 3, Mobile World Congress will kick off in Barcelona, Spain. While it’s not the premier show it once was, many of the smartphone industry’s leading players still attend the conference and frequently launch new devices there. Typically, we hear from companies like Lenovo, Arm, Xiaomi, Dell and more at the conference, as well as standards organizations like the GSMA on developments in areas like 5G or SIM technology. And judging by the <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/agenda?date=2025-03-03">event agenda on the MWC website</a>, we will be seeing at least some kind of presence from <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/agenda/sessions/5273-unlocking-business-growth-with-whatsapp">Meta about Whatsapp</a>, though it's unlikely anything major gets announced at that event.

Under the new plan, executives could earn a yearly bonus of 200 percent of their base salary, which is up from 75 percent. This comes just after Meta announced sweeping layoffs <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/mark-zuckerberg-plans-to-lay-off-an-additional-five-percent-of-metas-workforce-182651886.html"><ins>impacting five percent of its workforce</ins></a>.</p>
<p>A committee for Meta’s board of directors approved the change on February 13, on the grounds that the “target total cash compensation” for its executives “was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions” at rival companies. It’s worth noting that the new bonus plan doesn’t ap

<p>The most surprising thing about <em>Moroi</em> is its sense of humor. <em>Moroi</em> is a top-down, dual-stick action and puzzle game set in a dungeon of surreal horrors, where each cell contains a unique and grotesque vignette. In the first area of the map, there’s a cell containing a sentient meat grinder that craves human flesh. In another, a dead man is strapped to a feeding tube that’s still pumping slop into his bulbous, pulsing stomach. The next room over, you meet a talking duck with far too many human teeth in its mouth. One tooth would be too many, but this duck has a full, smiling set. And then he rips them all out for you, leaving behind a bloody, empty bill.</p>
<p>And this moment makes me laugh out loud. The gore in <em>Moroi</em> is so ridiculous that it turns the corner into hilarity, tapping into the gruesome absurdity that makes b-horror movies so charming. You don’t expect the duck to have human teeth, but what’s even more surprising is their sudden removal and

<p>Well we didn't get the iPhone SE fourth-gen this week — instead Apple debuted the iPhone 16e, a $599 model based on the iPhone 14's design.

<p>If you couldn’t stomach $800 for a new iPhone with Apple Intelligence, don’t worry: Apple just announced <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-announces-the-iphone-16e-with-apple-intelligence-for-599-161435140.html">the iPhone 16e</a>. At $599, it strikes a balance on specs, which is the soft and cosy way to say it doesn’t have everything.</p>
<p>It has a lot, though. With a 6.1-inch screen, it’s a much bigger device than the 4.7-inch iPhone SE, with a notch for FaceID (no more TouchID), USB-C (adios, Lightning) and the company’s A18 processor. There’s also an <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-make-the-most-of-the-iphones-action-button-193038089.html">action button</a>, which arrived with the iPhone 15 series, but no Camera Control.</p>
