I used a new colorization technique, restored, and created a sound design for this rare 1922 footage of Nijmegen, Netherlands. This film captures a fascinating tramway journey through the city, along with glimpses of historic streets, landmarks, and daily life. From the railway station and the bustling Burchtstraat to the scenic tram ride through Beek-Ubbergen

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,cleand,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
