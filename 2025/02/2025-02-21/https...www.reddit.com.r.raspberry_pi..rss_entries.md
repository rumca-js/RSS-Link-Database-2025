<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m doing a hobby project where I need a 4-or-so inch touchscreen. I bought a Waveshare 4.3&quot; DSI and it works alright, except that touch sometimes doesn&#39;t work but will work for example after a reboot. Then all of a sudden it doesn&#39;t work and I have to reboot again. I can&#39;t really figure out what&#39;s causing the problem but after some trial and error I blame the display.</p> <p>It also does some weird flickering, at times it is almost impossible to read small text on the screen. I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s causing it either, shouldn&#39;t be a power issue as I supply 5V/2A to a RPi 3 A+.</p> <p>Are there any touchscreens that in your experience <strong>just work</strong>? I don&#39;t want to deal with such low level issues preventing me from doing some actual progress on my project. I don&#39;t care about price.</p> <p>Requirements:</p> <ul> <li>Between 3.5 and 4.5&quot;</li> <li>Decent image quality, so IPS or QLED</li>

Im not saying its due to the case but it also came with a fan which I switched out my old one for which might have done something to it. I took out the micro sd card and windows cant read it which I figure is normal but it is saying that its only 8gb in size rather than 128, i cant format it with anything either. The green light comes on when I power it so im not sure if my ethernet port is faulty as the cable works on my PC (orange light though). My dad helped me out wiht removing the old fan and he used snipe nose pliers, maybe those damaged the board? im not sure.
