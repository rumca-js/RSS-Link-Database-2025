<p>Interim head coach brings back Gareth Anscombe and club familiarity for visit of defending champions on Saturday</p><p>Sometimes it takes a fresh pair of eyes. Matt Sherratt, newly installed as Warren Gatland’s replacement, however temporarily, has picked his first Wales team. No one is expecting much more from it than a 15th consecutive defeat when Ireland come to Cardiff for round three, but there is at least a feeling of the rational about his selection.</p><p>Perhaps 14 losses in a row can mess with even the most seasoned mind. This is not suddenly a team bursting with experience, but where some of Gatland’s selections seemed wanton rejections of received wisdom Sherratt has responded with the selector’s equivalent of putting his foot on the ball. Wales are not blessed with a luxury of options, but when there are simple solutions to the quandary of, for example, who to pick at fly-half, sometimes it is best to go with them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/f

It’s a remarkably assured collection; even the earliest work here, the ensemble piece Piedras, with its parade of brilliantly coloured musical images which are managed so confidently, shows the startling fertility of the Valencia-born composer’s aural imagination, and the same ability to conjure up ideas with an utterly distinctive r

<p>A change in the way alcohol is taxed means wine prices are going to creep up</p><p>At the start of this month, the new wine duty was fully implemented by our current government, having been introduced by the previous one. Cheers, guys. But what, exactly, has happened, and how have things now changed?</p><p>In August 2023, Rishi Sunak’s government introduced a revised alcohol duty in line with the retail price index (essentially a measure of inflation). While the system this replaced calculated wine duty by volume (with three different rates for still, sparkling and fortified wines), the new duty is calculated via a drink’s alcohol by volume. And because wine can now be labelled to within the closest 0.1% ABV, those three rates have now been replaced by <a href="https://wsta.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024WSTAAlcoholDuyRateTables.pdf">well over 100 different ones.</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/feb/21/what-the-new-wine-duties-really-mean-for-consumers-

<p>Under the radar for a decade, the artist formerly known as Mos Def is back. He talks about rejection, revival, and his new partnership with the Alchemist</p><p>It’s the penultimate night of Paris fashion week, and at Le&nbsp;Trianon, a storied 1,000-capacity music hall beneath Montmartre, Yasiin Bey – the artist formerly known as Mos Def – is holding court. “Fashion week is exhausting, especially when you be swagging this hard,” grins the dandyish MC and sometimes streetwear designer. “People see me and be like: ‘What’s the event?’ Today. Life is the event.”</p><p>Bey is showcasing his new project, Forensics, a partnership with DJ and producer the Alchemist (Eminem, Nas, Earl Sweatshirt). Over beats steeped in psychedelia and spiritual soul, Bey skips between the personal and political with profundity, as has long been his gift. This is Bey’s deepest, most focused work in years, from Ondasz, a meditation on resistance that finds Bey reflecting: “I don’t know if Goliath made David

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells East, London<br></strong>There is a cartoonishness at play, but a coldness too, in this shadowy tribute to the ‘weirdo’ outsider</p><p>Birdboy is billed as a show for audiences aged from seven upwards, but plenty of seven-year-olds (and older) would be unnerved by how dark and shadowy this piece by acclaimed Irish choreographer Emma Martin is, especially with Dunk Murphy’s eerie soundtrack. Its long opening sequence sees solo performer Kévin Coquelard dancing and lip-syncing to a frenzied series of songs and audio clips at manic pace, as if on the verge of a breakdown.</p><p>It’s a virtuosic performance from Coquelard, who is working incredibly hard (but perhaps younger viewers will only see his clownish abilities). A rusty old car is parked on the stage, which Coquelard tumbles into, over and through, repeatedly. Later on, he hurtles through the air in a flying leap, more than embodying Birdboy, the imagined alter ego of this lonely character, the one other

This is correct. Part Two, like its predecessor, is arcane, surprisingly weird, oddly structured and deeply uninterested in pandering. This is actually a compliment, because though I have seen Part Two six times and still do not totally understand the Bene Gesserit, the film, like its predecessor, is a strange creature in modern cinema: a true blockbuster – a cinematic behemoth that makes millions, generates memes and cements the ever-vanishing movie star – that harnesses the full power

<p>A great cast helps Martin McDonagh’s bitter tale to sparkle with sensitivity and grim humour, while Thelma delivers an engaging comic adventure featuring no-nonsense seniors     </p><p>“I just don’t like you no more.” With these words, Brendan Gleeson’s Colm sets in train an increasingly acrimonious series of events in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/sep/05/the-banshees-of-inisherin-review-martin-mcdonagh">Martin McDonagh</a>’s witty, bitter yarn, set on an island off the Irish coast in the early 1920s. The recipient is his erstwhile best friend Pádraic (Colin Farrell). An easygoing man, Pádraic is generally acknowledged as a bit dull but a despairing Colm’s attempts to shun him turn surprisingly bloody. The civil war simmering away on the mainland is barely registered by the insular islanders, whose thwarted ambitions and dark secrets are given the weight of Greek tragedy by McDonagh. A superb cast also features Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon. <em><br>

<p><strong>(Moli Del Tro/Fun in the Church)<br></strong>Musing on topics as varied as porn, cute animals, war and weed, the Berlin artist’s latest release is as seductive and disorientating as a late-night internet rabbit hole</p><p>‘I hug strangers, I lose my friends … I listen to 100,000 songs,” deadpans Chris Imler on the title track of The Internet Will Break My Heart. The dark underbelly of the internet is the theme behind this record; across its nine tracks, the Berlin-based songwriter and producer flits between topics as varied as porn, cute animals, war and weed with the hasty indifference of someone flicking between apps. It’s a suitably macabre topic for Imler, whose sound is characterised by a strange, nocturnal quality, all chugging instrumentals and monotone chanting.</p><p>The record draws on Imler’s trusty seedy palette, skulking somewhere in the depths between Krautrock and industrial dance music. But where new interpretations of these genres can often veer towards pa

<p>From Conclave to The Brutalist to A Real Pain, films about religion are unusually well represented at the Academy Awards – some with decidedly unorthodox themes<br><em>• </em><strong>Warning: contains spoilers</strong></p><p>What Tony Blair’s former spin doctor Alastair Campbell said of New Labour – “We don’t do God” – applies also to the Academy Awards.

<p>Don’t squeeze them! From neutral-toned beige to bright blue stars, these clever little patches are getting the thumbs up from teens</p><p>There’s a lot of concern around teenagers and skincare at the moment. Children who are barely out of Matey bubble bath are suddenly pleading for £80 moisturisers and anti-ageing serums that are wholly inappropriate for their bouncy, line-free skins – and some brands are marketing aggressively and irresponsibly in their direction. So it gladdened my cynical old heart when I saw one of my goddaughters recently and learned of the latest high-school craze: visible pimple patches.</p><p>Hydrocolloid patches are a helpful skincare product for anyone of any age suffering from spots – but they’re especially good for teens who are, in my pretty considerable experience, more likely to pick and fiddle with their zits, worsening the redness and chances of scarring. Pimple patches prevent this habit from transferring bacteria from fingers to spots, and disco
