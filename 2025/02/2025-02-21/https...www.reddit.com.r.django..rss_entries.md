<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Has anybody had any success with Django-vite and using scss and maybe have a repo I could look at? Currently trying to get this set up and running into a few issue. Not using any FE frameworks. Using a main.js file as the entry point currently this just has main.scss as an import. It works fine in dev but in production on Heroku the browser is trying to read the .scss file and therefore getting a MIME failure and the rest of the js won’t run. CSS file does work though that vite build from the scss.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/brad3rs01"> /u/brad3rs01 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1iv1a7f/djangovitescss/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1iv1a7f/djangovitescss/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I used to use PyCharm, but I&#39;m finding VS Code to be much better for working with AI tools. There are features from PyCharm Pro when working with django. For example, PyCharm provides autocompletion for queryset filtering for all fields (like __gte, __in, etc.), suggests all URL names when using reverse, and has awareness of context variables in templates.</p> <p>Is there a way to customize VS Code to replicate these PyCharm Pro features?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/_justaverageuser"> /u/_justaverageuser </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1iumhwr/is_it_possible_to_make_vs_code_like_pycharm_pro/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1iumhwr/is_it_possible_to_make_vs_code_like_pycharm_pro/">[comments]</a></span>
