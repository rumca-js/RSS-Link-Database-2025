Acid reducing medicines from the group of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are best-selling drugs that prevent and alleviate stomach problems. PPIs are activated in the acid-producing cells of the stomach, where they block acid production. Researchers made the surprising discovery that zinc-carrying proteins, which are found in all cells, can also activate PPIs -- without the presence of gastric acid. The result could be a key to understanding the side effects of PPIs.

## Enhancing algorithms to boost vegetation photosynthesis monitoring

Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a crucial indicator of vegetation photosynthesis, and in recent years, tower-based SIF measurements have become increasingly valuable in conjunction with gross primary productivity (GPP) for studying photosynthesis dynamics. However, current SIF retrieval algorithms are plagued by uncertainties, especially those introduced by atmospheric conditions and measurement geometries. These uncertainties can distort the diurnal patterns of SIF, making it harder to accurately monitor photosynthesis throughout the day. To address these challenges, there is a growing need for advancements in tower-based SIF retrieval algorithms.
