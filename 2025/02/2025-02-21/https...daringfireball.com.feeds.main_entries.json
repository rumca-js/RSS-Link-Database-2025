        "description": "<p>Apple, in a very precisely worded statement issued to the media (including me) this morning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection (ADP) in the\nUnited Kingdom to new users and current UK users will eventually\nneed to disable this security feature. ADP protects iCloud data\nwith end-to-end encryption, which means the data can only be\ndecrypted by the user who owns it, and only on their trusted\ndevices. We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided\nby ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the\ncontinuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer\nprivacy. Enhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end\nencryption is more urgent than ever before. Apple remains\ncommitted to offering our users the highest level of security for\ntheir personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so\nin the future in the United Kingdom. <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/privacy/government-information-requests/\">As ",

These most\nrecent conversations are an extension of ongoing internal dialogue\nthat dates back several years.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cUltimately the final decision rests with me, and after great\nconsideration, we will be amending our expectations to allow our\nplayers and uniformed personnel to have well-groomed beards moving\nforward. It is the appropriate time to move beyond the familiar\ncomfort of our former policy.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The appropriate time to change this was years ago, but better late than never. It\u2019s the most Yankees story possible that this policy change is much bigger news than the fact that the team today also signed manager Aaron Boone to a two-year extension through the 2027 season",
