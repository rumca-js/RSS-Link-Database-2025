Back to Basics: Object-Oriented Programming in C++ - Andreas Fertig - CppCon 2024
---

When delving into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++, we encounter several pivotal decisions. Questions arise: which data members should be private, public, or protected? Should we solely inherit from a class, or is there a need to modify the base class behavior? And when do we necessitate a virtual destructor? Moreover, are there scenarios where certain member functions cannot be virtual?

Understanding the concept of a virtual member function is crucial as it allows polymorphic behavior. Delving deeper, one might wonder about the compiler's implementation of this mechanism.

Integrating virtual functions with other features, like default parameters, demands careful consideration. This talk will explain why that's the case.

Oh, and by the way, the classic question is, what is the difference between struct and class? Come to my talk to get answers to all these questi
