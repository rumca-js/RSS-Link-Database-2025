<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On two separate occasions, I found myself with unexpected free time while at the mall. With no prior knowledge—no trailers, no synopsis, not even having heard the titles before—I randomly picked a movie playing at the cinema just to pass the time. Both times, I walked in completely blind and ended up having an absolute blast!</p> <p><em>Law Abiding Citizen</em></p> <p><em>John Wick</em></p> <p>Another time, a friend recommended <em>The Man from Earth</em>. I knew nothing about it going in, but the storytelling was so gripping that it became one of my most memorable movie experiences.</p> <p>Have you ever gone into a movie knowing absolutely nothing and walked out amazed?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I just noticed something upon rewatch where when they are fighting in the forest you have an array of great actors all in one scene. These include Qui Gon Jin/ Rob Roy, Legalus/ Paris, Jaime Lannister, Lucius Vorenus, and Remus Lupin haha. All that to say just a really really good movie and this is stale news obviously but the directors cut is so much better than theatrical so I encourage anyone who hasn’t seen it to give it a watch. </p> <p>To me this is only a touch “worse” than Gladiator and one of Ridley Scott’s best movies. If gladiator is a 9/10 then kingdom of heaven is 8/10. Excellent story excellent action excellent acting and the cinematography is beautiful too. It’s such a shame to me they don’t make historical/ancient epics like this much anymore nowadays. I guess that’s because everybody wants superhero movies and Hollywood does whatever will make them the most money. I miss the days of movies like Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy, Kingdom of

## 23-year-old guy who loves romance movies—any other men out there who genuinely enjoy them?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’m a 23-year-old guy, and I absolutely love romance movies. I’ve enjoyed them since I was a kid, and my love for the genre has only grown over the years. My mom introduced me to romance movies when I was young, especially Nicholas Sparks films, and over time, I developed a real appreciation for them. I genuinely enjoy watching the dynamic between two people falling in love, seeing their connection grow, and admiring the emotions and chemistry between them.</p> <p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a strong idea of what romance should be. Even when I was 8, I saw something beautiful in how two people could love each other, and that perspective hasn’t changed. Romance movies give me that feeling of admiration, both for the relationship itself and for the way different characters evolve emotionally.</p> <p>That being said, I’ve noticed that a lot of people, especially other men, tend to call me “gay” for liking romance movies.
