Apple’s Vision Pro has been out for a year, and while it’s not a total failure, it faces major challenges. VR fans expected innovation, but the Vision Pro struggles with comfort, limited developer support, and a lack of must-have apps. Despite excellent display quality, its high price and niche use cases make it feel more like a premium entertainment device than a productivity game-changer. Meanwhile, Meta Quest remains dominant in the otherwise tiny niche, proving that Apple’s headset has an uphill battle ahead.
