Thus, female and male divisions were created, as it was the fairest way to allow for healthy competition. This is also why the Paralympics are a thing, as it would make zero sense to have physically disadvantaged people compete against “able-bodied” athletes. </p><p>Nonetheless, when you condone trans insanity the goalpost never stops there, as they must affirm all delusions at the expense of biological reality. That is why one trans activist felt like he had no choice but to accept the false notion that Paralympic athletes should compete in the Olympics. </p><p>Blossom Brown debated Riley Gaines on “Piers Morgan Uncensored” and the level of insanity that was condoned is astonishing.</p><div

And while the previous POTUS was in charge, aka a sleeping potato, he got the impression he could get whatever he wanted whether or not the American taxpayer agreed with it. However, the potato is no longer involved in these discussions and a man is now in charge that actually makes decisions with the interests of the American people in mind. However, Zelensky responded to this by biting the mouth that feeds him. </p><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interviewed Catherine Herridge in an exclusive interview. They discussed why the Trump Administration is not happy with Zelensky’s response to peace negotiations.</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">Rubio reveals why everyone in the administration is pissed at Zelensky.<b

There are also a few things progressives have blown more taxpayer money on other than developing a high-speed rail system in America. What "high-speed rail system," you ask? That's what Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wants to ask California. Tens of billions of taxpayer dollars have been spent, yet a high-speed rail is not to be seen.</p><p>Protestors interrupted Duffy's protest. These are progressive protestors, so there is a good chance they didn't know why they were there. They were screaming about high-speed rail, and it's possible they were blaming Elon Musk and the Oligarchy for the lack of it. Side note: I saw Elon and the Oligarchies open for Hinder in 2007.</p><p>Duffy reminded the protestors who is to REALLY blame. We've been waiti

It was time for the White House Press Corps to get a lesson in civics from Prof. Stephen Miller, the WH deputy chief of staff.</p><p>After reminding the journalismers in the room how they managed to miss the previous president's obvious cognitive decline and how they never questioned who was running America then, Miller mentioned the left's new talking point that Cousin Elon is our shadow president of the United States. You know, the talking point that progressive billionaires coined as a political attack against one of our billionaires.</p><p>Class was now in session.</p><blockquote>A president is elected by the whole American people.
