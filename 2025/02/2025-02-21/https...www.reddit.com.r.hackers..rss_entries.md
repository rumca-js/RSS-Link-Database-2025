<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello, </p> <p>So I have done some rudimentary security courses in the past and I have a general understanding, even if somewhat paranoid.</p> <p>I received a laptop, sent overnight priority from my former employer. I opened it and noticed it was a laptop, reached out to them and wondered &quot;why would they make such a mistake&quot;.</p> <p>Like many on here I&#39;m sure, I am concerned about sketchy activities. This laptop though, had the seal broken (it was supposed to be a new shipment), and, the backlights on the laptop were on behind the buttons. I turned them off and placed it back.</p> <p>So, should I be concerned about spoofing, wifi sniffing etc? If you were me, would you be concerned?</p> <p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/HonestCanadian2016"> /u/HonestCanadian2016 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iv37jk/strange_

## Has anyone seen this tactic before?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I received a text from a family members number on WhatsApp. At the top where it says everything is encrypted, it was a different color than normal. The font was different as well. The text only contained a zipped file that was titled “WhatsApp Chat with [Name redacted].zip”. I obviously did not click on it. I asked my family member if they had sent me a message and they said no. I asked them less than 30 seconds after I received the message. I have WhatsApp, but they do not. I wanted to look at the phone to determine more, but they were not willing to let me look at it. It looks like some sort of Trojan, but I find it unsettling that it came from my family member‘s phone number, when they were not at all messaging me. They did have their phone open on a messaging app, but it was not WhatsApp. Does anyone have any idea what could be going on? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Equivalent_War_415"> /

## Has anybody seen ‘The Face of Anonymous’ on Tubi and is the whole ‘Commander X’ thing legit?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I watched it last night and the whole depiction of the one calling himself Commander X is honestly quite a let down imo.. we have this idea that the Anonymous crew are a solid foundation of hackers taking over the world with entire countries essentially fearing their reprisal if they step out of line. Then I watch this film and it gives the impression it’s some homeless dude with a laptop DDOS’ing from a cafe..</p> <p>What’s the deal?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/No-Carpenter-9184"> /u/No-Carpenter-9184 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iuggof/has_anybody_seen_the_face_of_anonymous_on_tubi/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iuggof/has_anybody_seen_the_face_of_anonymous_on_tubi/">[comments]</a></span>
