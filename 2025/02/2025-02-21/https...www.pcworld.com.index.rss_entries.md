<p>On Friday, Microsoft released a pair of new builds to test new Windows 11 features, offering improved cloud search to Copilot+ PC owners, alongside a nifty new sharing and Start menu interface for Windows users in general.</p>



<p>Sometimes, Windows builds are a bit like a railyard, with tracks and switches and roundabouts. <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/02/21/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-4950-beta-channel/">Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22635.4950</a> (KB5052078) is headed to the Beta Channel, for those who skipped an <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/01/24/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-4805-beta-channel/">earlier release</a> at the end of January. <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/02/21/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26120-3291-

<p>Windows is full of suggestions and recommendations to try out new apps and features, which we sometimes refer to as ads. But the Windows 11 Surface app is an actual nest of <em>advertisements</em>, pushing you to buy various products from Microsoft and its partners.</p>



<p>And it looks like you’ll just have to deal with it.</p>



<p>I have a small cache of Windows laptops on hand, which includes some Surface devices. Since Microsoft has multiple channels to test new Windows features, I try to have a few devices available to check out new features. For example, I was gratified to note that my daily driver, currently on the Beta Channel, now includes the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2613570/these-five-new-windows-11-features-should-hit-your-pc-soon.html">nice little battery indicator</a> that should be arriving to all Windows PCs soon.

<p>The table is set for Alexa’s big AI reveal, with Amazon holding a long-delayed “devices and services” event in New York City this Wednesday, February 26.</p>



<p>So, what’s on the menu? Good question. For its part, Amazon has offered a few hints, noting that Wednesday’s unveiling with be “Alexa-focused.” Meanwhile, tech sleuths have discovered that if you assemble the various press invites Amazon sent out for the gathering, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606916/amazon-event-hidden-message-alexa" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theverge.com/news/606916/amazon-event-hidden-message-alexa">you can spell out the “Alexa” logo</a>.</p>

<p>After 17 years of research, Microsoft has finally developed the Majorana 1 chip, its first quantum computing processor based on a brand-new material and architecture, reports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614205/microsoft-quantum-computing-majorana-1-processor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>.</p>



<p>At the heart of a quantum computer are quantum bits (qubits), which handle data in a way similar to today’s binary bits but with significantly higher computational potential. Companies such as IBM, Microsoft, and Google have long tried to make qubits more stable, as they’re sensitive to disturbances that can cause errors or data loss.</p>



<p>With Majorana 1, up to a million qubits can fit on a single circuit, about the size of a desktop computer’s processor. Instead of using electrons for calculations, the chip utilizes t

<p>You might be up a creek if you’re trying to get your hands on a new graphics card. But if you want to upgrade your gaming monitor, it’s coming up roses. Take this Gigabyte 34-inch ultrawide OLED monitor, for example: normally $950, Newegg is now <a href="https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-mo34wqc-34-wqhd-175-hz-oled-black/p/N82E16824012086">offering it for just $579.99</a>. That’s an impressive $370 off.</p>



<p>The MO34WQC has a semi-standard 3440×1440 resolution for its 34-inch panel, with a 175Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time for lightning-fast multiplayer gameplay. It also has a couple of extras over the usual budget OLED monitor, like USB-C video support, a built-in KVM for multi-device support, and plenty of settings to tweak. Just be aware that power delivery is limited to 18 watts, so this isn’t the best for a gaming laptop.</p>

<p>Need another flash drive for transferring files between devices, backing up data, and more? Right now, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MUF-128AB-AM-Plus-128GB/dp/B07D7PDLXC/">128GB Samsung Fit Plus is only $14 on Amazon</a>. That’s 39 percent off its original price.</p>



<p>This tiny flash drive gives you the opportunity to rely on good old physical storage rather than cloud services. With read speeds of up to 400MB/s, you’ll speedily transfer files on a dime.</p>



<p>And this Samsung Fit Plus really is tiny. About the size of a Bluetooth dongle, you won’t even notice it plugged into your laptop. There’s even a chance you might lose it, so it’s good that it has a lanyard hole for safe carrying. Its USB-A connector means it’ll work fine with laptops, PCs, car entertainment systems, smart TVs, gaming consoles, and more.</p>

<p>It’s been 12 years since <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> was originally released on consoles, and though it was late coming to the PC (as are all Rockstar games), it’s still one of the most played titles over a decade later. Following in the footsteps of the game itself, <em>GTA V</em> and <em>GTA Online</em> will both get some new visual options in a huge update on March 4th, including much-anticipated ray tracing visuals.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/grand-theft-auto-v-on-pc-is-finally-getting-ray-tracing-and-some-graphics-options">Tom’s Hardware</a> notes, the extra visual flair was already available for the special edition of the game re-released on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

<p>Could you fix your laptop if it breaks? And I mean physically fix it with tools, not just install some driver updates. According to an industry report, you might be okay if it’s an Asus or Acer model. But if you’re using a recent laptop from HP, Apple, or especially Lenovo, you’ll have some serious issues getting it up and running again. </p>



<p>That’s according to the US Public Interest Research Group (PIRG) Education Fund, which commissioned a report (spotted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/macbooks-lagging-behind-pc-rivals-when-it-comes-to-repairability-report/">Ars Technica</a>) analyzing repairability for both laptops and smartphones available to US buyers.

<p>These days, a mini PC can make a lot of sense. More powerful than a laptop of the same price, not as much of a space hog as a desktop PC. If you don’t need a full-blown gaming rig, this is the way to go.</p>



<p>And right now, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beelink-SER5-5700U-4-34GHz-Computer/dp/B0BW8CKSJR/">Beelink EQR5 mini PC is only $299 on Amazon</a>. That’s a lovely 25 percent discount off its $399 MSRP, a fantastic price for a powerful machine that takes up very little desk space.</p>



<p>This Beelink EQR5 features an AMD Ryzen 7 5825U processor and 32GB of DDR4 RAM as well as a 500GB SSD. That’s a superb configuration that’s perfect for work productivity, streaming media, doom scrolling, video and image editing, and more. If you want to upgrade later on, it’s so easy to do so, supporting up to 64GB of RAM and 8TB of storage.</p>

<p>I have a friend Steve (not his real name) who still installs his PC games on a large, slow, noise hard drive. You know, the old-school kind that spins up before it can read or write data? I keep telling him to switch over to an SSD, not just for his own sake but for mine as well.</p>



<p>You see, Steve thinks he’s fine, that he’s harming no one by running his games on an HDD. But what he doesn’t realize is that his slow gaming times affect me and everyone else he plays with. Levels take minutes to load rather than seconds. Guess who’s always last when we jump into a game? His aged HDD makes our gaming time such a chore.</p>



<p>Please, Steve. I beg of you. Put your games on an SSD! I don’t care if your main drive ran out of space. Go buy another one! They’re quite affordable these days, and they make such a massive difference.</p>
