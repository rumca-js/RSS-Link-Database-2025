The meeting in the soup kitchen and his ability to influence emotions made me realize how much colors can sway behavior. Sanderson lays it out, utilizing the servers to control the crowd. Fascinating stuff. And wondering how much color influences our current social construct. </p> <p>Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/OleFogeyMtn\"> /u/OleFogeyMtn </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iug03w/sandersons_mistborn_the_final_empire/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iug03w/sanderson",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Educated is a memoir about a Mormon girl being raised in an extreme survivalist family. Through the odds, with a little luck and lot of hard work, Tara is able to go against the deep-seated expectations of her family. She begins to think for herself and see the world as something more than a thing to fear. It&#39;s a story about perspective, mental health, recognition, the power of education, and the complexities of navigating a family that has vastly different values. </p> <p>It reminded me of one of my favorite sayings: Death teaches us that we can love people deeply and not have them in our lives. </p> <p>\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606</p> <p>What were your thoughts on this book? I find it particularly interesting because my best friend grew up Mormon. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/suitable_zone3\"> /u/suitable_zone3 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1iufn47/educated_by_tara_westover/",
