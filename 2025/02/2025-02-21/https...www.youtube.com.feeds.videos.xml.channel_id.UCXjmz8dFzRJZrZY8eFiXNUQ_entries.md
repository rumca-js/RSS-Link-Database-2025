But everything changed when the showâ€™s lead was embroiled in a major legal scandal. Without Frank Underwood, House of Cards quickly lost its footing, and despite Netflixâ€™s best effortsâ€”including shifting focus to Robin Wrightâ€™s Claire Underwoodâ€”the showâ€™s final season couldnâ€™t escape its inevitable downfall.
