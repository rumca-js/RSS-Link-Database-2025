<p>Amazon’s announcement on Wednesday that it is abandoning its Chime collaboration app, while stressing that it will double down on the far more successful Chime software development kit (SDK), was an example of Amazon being Amazon. It knows what it does well, and where to focus.</p>



<p>Analysts said that <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1678096/amazon-chime-goes-after-webex-skype-for-business-and-others.html">the Chime app made some sense</a> when it was <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2017/2/aws-announces-amazon-chime">introduced in February 2017</a>, but that sharply changed in 2000 when the pandemic hit. Microsoft and Zoom added lots of new functionality to their colla

<p>As of 10 a.m. (ET) today, Apple is no longer offering new users in the UK the chance to enable <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/1618339/how-to-use-apples-advanced-icloud-security-tools.html">Advanced Data Protection</a>. Essentially, anyone who now wants to enable the feature to protect their data against criminal or state surveillance or exfiltration will no longer be able to do so.</p>



<p>The move appears to be a direct response to the foolish and supremely dangerous demand by the UK government to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3819834/uk-orders-apple-to-let-it-access-everyones-encrypted-data.html">undermine personal data security on an international scale</a>

<p>Tech press-landi and the tech blogosphere were abuzz last week with news that both Apple, the company that makes the iPhone, and Meta, the company that makes everybody on Facebook confront a daily flood of horrible AI-generated slop, are making full-size, humanoid robots.</p>



<p>The trouble is, they’re not doing that. Here’s what’s really happening. </p>
