        "description": "Many have been eyeing Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows with a healthy amount of skepticism in the lead up to release, thanks in no small part to Ubisoft\u2019s torrid track record with most of its major releases in recent years. \n\nAfter a couple of delays, however, the action RPG is finally around the corner, and as we get closer and closer to its release, thankfully, it\u2019s looking better and better. \n\nIt is, of course, the Assassin\u2019s Creed game set in Japan that we have been waiting for so long, but on top of that, the game is also making some interesting promises with its gameplay improvements. Here, we\u2019ll be discussing some of those improvements and mechanics that we cannot wait to try out ourselves.",

        "description": "Between all the developer quotes, trailers, and extensive gameplay, there is so much to know about Monster Hunter Wilds, even if you've played the beta or any of the previous titles. And yet, with the action RPG out in a week for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, it feels like so much of it is still a mystery.\n\nThe developer dropped a few noteworthy morsels lately, from revealing a brand new Leviathan monster to outlining the post-launch plan (which includes new Event Quests and monsters). Siege Quests aren't returning (for now), but you can climb on monster corpses, which is neat. That's not even getting into all the improvements and new additions, like the revamped map.\n\nLong story short, fans and newcomers have so much to look forward to at launch. Check out everything you should know about Monster Hunter Wilds before it arrives on February 28th.",
