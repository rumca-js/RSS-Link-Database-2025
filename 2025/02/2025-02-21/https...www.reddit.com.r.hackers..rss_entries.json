I opened it and noticed it was a laptop, reached out to them and wondered &quot;why would they make such a mistake&quot;.</p> <p>Like many on here I&#39;m sure, I am concerned about sketchy activities. This laptop though, had the seal broken (it was supposed to be a new shipment), and, the backlights on the laptop were on behind the buttons. I turned them off and placed it back.</p> <p>So, should I be concerned about spoofing, wifi sniffing etc? If you were me, would you be concerned?</p> <p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/HonestCanadian2016\"> /u/HonestCanadian2016 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hackers/comments/1iv37jk/strange_",

        "description": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I received a text from a family members number on WhatsApp. At the top where it says everything is encrypted, it was a different color than normal. The font was different as well. The text only contained a zipped file that was titled \u201cWhatsApp Chat with [Name redacted].zip\u201d. I obviously did not click on it. I asked my family member if they had sent me a message and they said no. I asked them less than 30 seconds after I received the message. I have WhatsApp, but they do not. I wanted to look at the phone to determine more, but they were not willing to let me look at it. It looks like some sort of Trojan, but I find it unsettling that it came from my family member\u2018s phone number, when they were not at all messaging me. They did have their phone open on a messaging app, but it was not WhatsApp. Does anyone have any idea what could be going on? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Equivalent_War_415\"> /",
