<p>SiFive's <a href="https://www.sifive.com/boards/hifive-premier-p550">HiFive Premier P550</a> is a strange board. It's the fastest RISC-V development board I've testedâ€”though I haven't tested a <a href="https://milkv.io/pioneer">Milk-V Jupiter</a>. It's also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTX_%28form_factor%29">Mini DTX</a>, which is an ATX-adjacent standard board size that won't fit in many Mini ITX SFF PC cases, which might be why SiFive and ESWIN are releasing a custom case for it (pictured above, which they sent along with the board for my review).</p>
