<p>The European Union&rsquo;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) has come into force, and it&rsquo;s meant that some of the world&rsquo;s biggest tech companies are having to make major changes to how they operate.</p>

<p>The law, which is designed to increase competition in the EU&rsquo;s digital markets, designates some large online companies and their services as &ldquo;gatekeepers.&rdquo; Those that have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/6/23859570/european-union-commission-digital-markets-act-gatekeepers-apple-google-meta-microsoft">received the gatekeeper designation</a> &mdash; the companies on the list are Alphabet, Amazon,

The demo for the action-adventure platformer starts at the beginning of chapter three.

<p class="has-text-align-none">The feature has been available on iPhones running iOS 16 or later starting with the iPhone 14 (launched in 2022). It is also offered on the Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch SE 2, Apple Watch Ultra, or any lat
