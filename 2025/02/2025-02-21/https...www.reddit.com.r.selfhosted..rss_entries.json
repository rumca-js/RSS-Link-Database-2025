Today, we&#39;re excited to announce that you can now train your own reasoning model with just 5GB VRAM for Qwen2.5 (1.5B) - down from 7GB in the previous <a href=\"https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth\">Unsloth</a> release! GRPO is the algorithm behind DeepSeek-R1 and how it was trained.</p> <p>The best part about GRPO is it doesn&#39;t matter if you train a small model as you just need more training time. You can also leave it running in the background of your PC while you do other things.</p> <ol> <li>Due to our newly added Efficient GRPO algorithm, this enables <strong><em>10x longer context</em></strong> lengths while using <strong><em>90% less VRAM</em></strong> vs. every other GRPO LoRA/QLoRA implementations.</li> <li>With a GRPO setup using TRL + FA2, Llama 3.1 (8B) training at 20K context length demands 510.8GB of VRAM.
