I recently downloaded a game from fit girl and it download it in bin files (I downloaded everything through Qbittorrent) and from what I know, there is supposed to be a setup file is there not? I checked my antivirus though and I couldnt find anything on my protection history. </p> <p>There is a file that is called &quot;Verify BIN files before Installation&quot; and I already did verify them, there was no issue there, that is none that I know of. If it help&#39;s, I downloaded Rdr2 from Fitgirl, torrent file.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ServantLin"> /u/ServantLin </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1iulb6j/i_cant_find_my_setup_file/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/1iulb6j/i_cant_find_my_setup_file/">[comments]</a></span>
