<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey amazing people! Thanks so much for the support on our GRPO release 2 weeks ago! Today, we&#39;re excited to announce that you can now train your own reasoning model with just 5GB VRAM for Qwen2.5 (1.5B) - down from 7GB in the previous <a href="https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth">Unsloth</a> release! GRPO is the algorithm behind DeepSeek-R1 and how it was trained.</p> <p>The best part about GRPO is it doesn&#39;t matter if you train a small model as you just need more training time. You can also leave it running in the background of your PC while you do other things.</p> <ol> <li>Due to our newly added Efficient GRPO algorithm, this enables <strong><em>10x longer context</em></strong> lengths while using <strong><em>90% less VRAM</em></strong> vs. every other GRPO LoRA/QLoRA implementations.</li> <li>With a GRPO setup using TRL + FA2, Llama 3.1 (8B) training at 20K context length demands 510.8GB of VRAM. However, Unsloth’s 90% VRAM reduction bri

I remember waaaaay back in the day, I think it was google who launched a personalized start page where you could give it some basic information like your zip code and you would have a weather forecast widget and you could put links and stuff. It was really minimal but in my head I wanted so much more.</p> <p>Today we have tons of start pages, especially in the selfhosted arena. Many if not most that get talked about in <a href="/r/selfhosted">r/selfhosted</a> are geared towards the apps we self host and monitoring them to an extent.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone,</p> <p>I have decided to completely decouple my development environment from my main computer. I am planning on running either Alpine or NixOS in a Proxmox VM and have dedicated images per project. These images will contain a neovim install and what is required for that specific project. I can always scale up the VM if need be or remove it once the project is finished.</p> <p>I saw that there are projects like code-server and devpods that kind of address this and was wondering if there was canonical way of best doing this ?</p> <p>My main motivation for this is tidiness and speed at which I can experiment. I understand that this can be achieved on my main computer with proper setup but since my &quot;main&quot; computer changes depending on the circumstances it is useful to have my work decoupled from my &quot;interface&quot;.</p> <p>Thanks for your ideas in advance!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://w

Currently, I’m running TrueNAS Scale 24.10.1.</p> <p>I’ve heard from friends and on the selfhosted subreddit that running Proxmox with TrueNAS in a VM could be a better setup. Since I’m already changing hardware, I thought this would be a great opportunity to switch to Proxmox.</p> <p>Currently, I have two NVMe boot drives in RAID 1 for the TrueNAS installation and a RAID of standard hard disks for media storage.
