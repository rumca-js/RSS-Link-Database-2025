This happens because Caps Lock activates as soon as you press the key but only deactivates after releasing another key. When I press the key I want to I want to state to change immediately not when I release the key. </p> <p>This behavior dates back to typewriters.

It took me a while for me to return to GNOME as I was discovering KDE Plasma&#39;s (5.24) customization potential. I loved it at first, but I noticed how the DE slowly became unstable after a lot of customising (Plasma has GREATLY improved by now, last time I tried 5.27 on Q4OS and it was blazing fast and rock solid). I was annoyed at how people took a liking to the hideous DE known as GNOME, and for me there was little difference between it and Windows 8, as they were basically tablet centric with GNOME and it&#39;s wasted space.</p> <p><strong>The comparative period:</strong> I eventually got tired of Plasma, because it had way too many features that I didn\u00b4t wan\u00b4t to use. Tried XFCE, MATE and Budgie, and they felt too outdated for my liking; Budgie felt off. I decided to give GNOME a shot and installed Ubuntu 22.04. F",
