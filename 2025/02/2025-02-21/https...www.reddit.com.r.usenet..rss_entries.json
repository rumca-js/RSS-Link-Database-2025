I will get 20mb/s somedays but never more than that. I was getting 100mb/s from frugal but stopped it due to way too many incomplete packages. Eweka is slow but has never failed on me so I&#39;m happy with it. I am using port 443 and 50 connections, I have tried playing with the connections but it does not make a difference ...
