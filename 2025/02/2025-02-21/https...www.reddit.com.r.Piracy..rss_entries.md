I can&#39;t really find any info on this sub that says anyone has ever been banned by having non-legit Pro activation. But when searching google, it does come up.

## Anyone know how to actually download from FileJoker with free download?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Does anyone know of any actual reliable way to download from FileJoker for free? I don&#39;t mind waiting a couple hours for a file to download, but whenever i try to download a file from FileJoker using the free download, it always loses connection. My WiFi is very good and my connection is always perfect, but it&#39;s like FileJoker actually denies the free download to encourage me to buy premium. Just wondering if anyone knows of any actual way to use the free download on FileJoker and not have it disconnect and fail the download.</p> <p>I&#39;ve tried IDM, JDownloader and Xtreme manager, none have worked. I get most success rate with JDownloader, but that&#39;s only with very small files. Any time the file is even a couple hundred mb it fails. Anyone have any ideas?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RyanGarcia2134"> /u/RyanGarcia2134 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/com
