I bought a Waveshare 4.3&quot; DSI and it works alright, except that touch sometimes doesn&#39;t work but will work for example after a reboot. Then all of a sudden it doesn&#39;t work and I have to reboot again. I can&#39;t really figure out what&#39;s causing the problem but after some trial and error I blame the display.</p> <p>It also does some weird flickering, at times it is almost impossible to read small text on the screen. I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s causing it either, shouldn&#39;t be a power issue as I supply 5V/2A to a RPi 3 A+.</p> <p>Are there any touchscreens that in your experience <strong>just work</strong>? I don&#39;t want to deal with such low level issues preventing me from doing some actual progress on my project. I don&#39;t care about price.</p> <p>Requirements:</p> <ul> <li>Between 3.5 and 4.5&quot;</li> <li>Decent image quality, so IPS or QLED</li> ",

I took out the micro sd card and windows cant read it which I figure is normal but it is saying that its only 8gb in size rather than 128, i cant format it with anything either. The green light comes on when I power it so im not sure if my ethernet port is faulty as the cable works on my PC (orange light though).
