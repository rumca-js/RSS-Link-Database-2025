And not only that, Nintendo was awarded around $15 million. In other news, Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth has finally hit Steam, where it debuted at number 3. This is a financial turnaround for the game, which has been available on PS5 for a year, and did not live up to sales expectations. And finally, PC parts maker Corsair has clarified its comments about the PC port of Grand Theft Auto 6. Corsair explained that they do not know when the game will come to PC, and previous comments were basically speculation.",

The new swing mechanics, paired with the significantly improved graphics, makes for a much more realistic ambiance, even with a lethargic performance by the announcing team. The highly customizable MyCareer campaign mode shines as one of the most enjoyable parts even though it has a tacked-on personality system, occasional unnecessary connectivity issues, and of course microtransactions. PGA Tour 2K25 is still a few strokes behind EA Sports PGA Tour as the best golfing simulator around, but if it continues to improve like this with each new iteration, we may see it close that gap relatively soon. \n\n#IGN #Gaming",

The PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5 should now be on par\u2014graphically\u2014with the Xbox Series X and PS5 counterparts. Of course, no word yet on a new GTA 6 trailer. In entertainment news, Amazon MGM Studios now has full creative control over James Bond. Long-time franchise producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are stepping aside, but will retain ownership. Amazon has been involved in the Bond film franchise ever since they purchased MGM several years ago. And finally, cult favorite 90s-era anime Samurai Pizza Cats is back, this time with a new side-scrolling action game.",
