Thus, female and male divisions were created, as it was the fairest way to allow for healthy competition. This is also why the Paralympics are a thing, as it would make zero sense to have physically disadvantaged people compete against \u201cable-bodied\u201d athletes. </p><p>Nonetheless, when you condone trans insanity the goalpost never stops there, as they must affirm all delusions at the expense of biological reality. That is why one trans activist felt like he had no choice but to accept the false notion that Paralympic athletes should compete in the Olympics. </p><p>Blossom Brown debated Riley Gaines on \u201cPiers Morgan Uncensored\u201d and the level of insanity that was condoned is astonishing.</p><div",
