It's the fastest RISC-V development board I've tested\u2014though I haven't tested a <a href=\"https://milkv.io/pioneer\">Milk-V Jupiter</a>. It's also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTX_%28form_factor%29\">Mini DTX</a>, which is an ATX-adjacent standard board size that won't fit in many Mini ITX SFF PC cases, which might be why SiFive and ESWIN are releasing a custom case for it (pictured above, which they sent along with the board for my review).</p>\n      <span class=\"field field--name-uid field--type-entity-reference field--label-hidden\"><span>Jeff Geerling</span></span>\n<span class=\"field field--name-created field--type-created field--label-hidden\">February 21, 2025\n</span>",
