Mr Yu is shouting at passersby, trying to offload his boxes of freshly steamed dumplings. In between customers, the self-professed \u201cdumpling king\u201d and his wife, Ms Liao, discuss Donald Trump.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very positive, energetic,\u201d says Yu, handing flour-covered coins to a customer. Liao chimes in: \u201cThe dancing! Isn\u2019t he in his 80s?\u201d Yu nods in agreement. But asked what Trump means for Taiwan, the elderly couple is less effusive.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/21/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-foreign-policy-impact-taiwan\">Continue reading...</a>",

Before the striker could continue the move, however, she was monstered off the ball by T\u014dko Koga, with the 19-year-old ambling away in possession as Japan began another period of extended possession. Just like that, a moment of promise, a moment where the Matildas glimpsed an opportunity to get in transition and do what they do best, was ruthlessly snuffed out.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardi",
