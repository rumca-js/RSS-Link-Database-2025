<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none"><em>Ne Zha 2</em> features a combat sequence that has to be seen to be believed. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Chinese movie, which recently passed the $1.5 billion mark at the box office to become the <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/china-box-office-ne-zha-2-1-billion-1236302317/">biggest international animated hit of all time</a>, is built around shows of immense power, leading up to a conflict between godlike forces and their armies. Thousands of white-clad martial-arts warriors, cloaked in glowing golden bubbles of energy, pile atop each other on a vastly branching magical staff to form what looks like a beautiful mountaintop tree in autumn.
