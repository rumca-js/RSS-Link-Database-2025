Some say <em>The Last Jedi</em> did but while that film undoubtedly <em>expanded</em> it, this film got the fanbase into an ugly division that has yet to be fully healed nearly a decade later. Before, it felt unified, the love for the original trilogy, the hate for the prequel trilogy and special editions, there was still enjoyment of being a fan. Then <em>The Force Awakens</em> comes and fan wars began on how some felt it was a return to form with spectacular effects, emotional beats, and the best acting in the franchise, while others felt it was a safe cash grab that did nothing to respect the lore, got too political, got too childish. The film&#39;s outstanding success only made these arguments nastier. I can remember what Reddit and IMDb was like during those days.
