It was swift and unexpected, and my day-to-day routine changed drastically. For weeks, the grief sat like a bowling ball in my chest, ever-present. But a light emerged from the darkness and it came in the form of a cozy $4 farming game called <em>Ropuka\u2019s Idle Island</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lately I haven\u2019t been in the right headspace to play anything with complicated mechanics and heavy storylines. <em>Ropuka</em>\u2018<em>s Idle Island</em> doesn\u2019t put any demands on the player, which is exactly what I need right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Ropuka's Idle Island Steam Trailer\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"acce",

You may want to take a quick moment to freshen up your account\u2019s security. A Russian hacker is claiming to have login data for over 20 million OpenAI users\u2014and the information includes email addresses and passwords. On Friday, samples of OpenAI logins emerged on the dark web, along with an offer to sell the full trove of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, OpenAI says it has not yet found evidence of compromised systems (as per <a href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/tech/openai-data-breach-chatpt-email-b2694280.html\">The Independent</a>). However, don\u2019t take that as a sign that everything\u2019s fine. Given the potential sensitive information that could be exposed if this <em>is</em> true, responding proactively now is a safe move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Not sure what could put you at risk if you wait to see what happens?
