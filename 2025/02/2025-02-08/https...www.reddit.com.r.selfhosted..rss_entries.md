<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Passman is a <strong>stateless, offline-first password manager</strong> that eliminates the risks of traditional vault-based solutions like LastPass, Bitwarden, and 1Password. Instead of storing passwords in a vault, Passman <strong>mathematically regenerates them on demand</strong>, making it impossible to steal what isn’t stored.</p> <p>This is a <strong>proof-of-concept release</strong>, and <strong>minimal testing has been completed</strong>. The goal is to challenge conventional password management by proving that a <strong>zero-storage model</strong> can work.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>On my gigabit plan with Xfinity I get about 930 Mbps download and anywhere between 70-175 Mbps upload. Streaming 4K remotely is not going too great. I’m just wondering what I would need if I wanted to accomplish this. I know I’d have to get something like an Ethernet adapter since my machine only supports 1Gbps.</p> <p>Or do most people just watch 4K content locally?</p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nothingveryobvious"> /u/nothingveryobvious </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ikdkyg/those_who_stream_4k_remotely_what_is_your/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1ikdkyg/those_who_stream_4k_remotely_what_is_your/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I&#39;ve been starting to upskill on k8s, and I finally got a little Talos cluster runnign in my basement across 10 VMs on 5 Lenovo Thinkcentre Tiny machines running Proxmox. I got a couple of little stateless applications running, and I&#39;m feeling at least comfortable enough to get around and parse logs and troubleshoot, but I&#39;m really stuck on storage. I have a storage server with a 10g fiber link to my network switch, and it has 6x 12TB HDDs (ubuntu server, zfs storage). I originally had my Proxmox VM disks stored on it and used NFS, but it was constantly getting hung up and breaking the VMs, so I now have the VM disks local to their hosts. I&#39;m worried that trying to run applications in this cluster is going to be problematic when they&#39;re interacting with data (both objects/files and databases) on the server. Before I go down the rabbit hole of trying to do it, I figured I&#39;d ask here and see how other people handle storag

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>We’re developing a lightweight, easy-to-use S3-compatible object store, designed for self-hosters, small businesses, and backup providers. The goal is to make running your own storage service as simple as possible—whether it’s just for yourself or to offer storage to others.</p> <p>What We’re Building</p> <pre><code>• A single binary S3 service that you can run anywhere (Linux, Windows, macOS, Raspberry Pi, RISC-V). • Optional multi-tenant encryption (run a second service to enable per-user encryption). • Home-friendly setup: Run it on your existing system, open port 443, set up a DNS entry (s3.yourname), get a Let’s Encrypt certificate, and you’re ready to go. • Flexible usage: Keep it private, or enable self-signup and charge customers for storage. • Scales from personal backups to multi-PB deployments for enterprises. </code></pre> <p>Why Post Here?</p> <p>We want to make sure this works well for the self-hosting community.
