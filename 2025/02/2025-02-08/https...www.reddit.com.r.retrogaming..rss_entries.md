<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I was just having a moment of observation to look at the Last Action Hero games during the 16 bit era of gaming as what I noticed about all the versions was that they were all so janky as while I get that is kind of obvious, my point is that I sometimes wonder why some of the games based on his movies back then couldn&#39;t get better treatment in quality.</p> <p>Like when I look at the Last Action Hero movie, I see a clever movie due to the way it handles movie tropes as the movie was ahead of its time for being very meta in ways that are hard to explain as I say this because I am very baffled at how every single video game adaptation of the movie had lacked the fun aspects of the movie was what hurt the games themselves the most was the lack of weapons because apparently I read somewhere that the producers of the movie would not Arnold&#39;s characters in the game wield even one weapon such as a gun as the games suffered from having strict limit

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So I&#39;ve recently stumbled upon a game called Azure Dreams, I am sure many people already know that game so here my question:</p> <p>I&#39;ve seen some people saying the Game Boy Color version is better, some say Playstation 1 but it&#39;s still not clear to me whats the main difference between the two. Is the GBC one just a simplified or &quot;2D&quot; version of the game? Are these two versions perhaps two entirely different experiences? And what IS considered the best version and why? I think someone needs explain that to me</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/torea64"> /u/torea64 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ikyy5m/azure_dreams_ps1_gbc_differences/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/retrogaming/comments/1ikyy5m/azure_dreams_ps1_gbc_differences/">[comments]</a></span>
