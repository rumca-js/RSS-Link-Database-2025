So what are your thoughts and or opinions on reading order when it comes to prequels?</p> <p>The reason for why I am asking is I am planning on reading the VC Andrew\u2019s \u201cFlowers in the Attic\u201d Series, (TikTok kinda got me interested so I understand what happens in each book) but from my understanding chronologically the books go 5, 1, 2, 3 and, 4. The fifth book gives background as to why the Grandmother in the first book is the way she is! </p> <p>So to clarify is it better to read it in 1-5 so the reason is explained at the end or better to read it in chronological order. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Wolflad1996\"> /u/Wolflad1996 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ikw4va/prequels_being_read_first/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1ikw4va/prequels_being_read_first/\">[comments]</a>",

Of course this is what attracts the resellers. </p> <p>About once a week, you\u2019ll noticed them with a scanner to check the value of books, grabbing anything that is in good condition.
