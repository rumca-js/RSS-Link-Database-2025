<p>About a month and a half ago, I had to put down my rescue greyhound. It was swift and unexpected, and my day-to-day routine changed drastically. For weeks, the grief sat like a bowling ball in my chest, ever-present.

<p>Have you ever tried ChatGPT? You may want to take a quick moment to freshen up your account’s security. A Russian hacker is claiming to have login data for over 20 million OpenAI users—and the information includes email addresses and passwords. On Friday, samples of OpenAI logins emerged on the dark web, along with an offer to sell the full trove of data.</p>



<p>Currently, OpenAI says it has not yet found evidence of compromised systems (as per <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/tech/openai-data-breach-chatpt-email-b2694280.html">The Independent</a>).
