<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone. Noob here. I’m aware that RISC-V has made great progress and disruption on the embedded market, eating ARM’s lunch. However, it looks like most of these cores are low-power/small-area implementations that don’t care about performance that much.</p> <p>It seems to me that RISC-V has not been able to infiltrate the smartphone/desktop market yet. What would you say are the main reasons? I believe is a mixture of software support and probably the ISA fragmentation.</p> <p>Do you think we’re getting closer to seeing RISC-V products competing with the big IPC boys? I believe we first need strong support from the software community and that might take years.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ikindalikelatex"> /u/ikindalikelatex </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1iksh6l/highperformance_market/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/R

## Is RISCV designs still relevant?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I think I missed that trend around three years ago. Now, I see many RISC-V core designs on GitHub, and most of them work well on FPGA.</p> <p>So, what should someone who wants to work with RISC-V do now? Should they design a core with HDL? Should they design a chip with VLSI? Or should they still focus on peripheral designs, which haven&#39;t fully become mainstream yet?</p> <p>Thank you.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Odd_Garbage_2857"> /u/Odd_Garbage_2857 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ikk5i9/is_riscv_designs_still_relevant/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RISCV/comments/1ikk5i9/is_riscv_designs_still_relevant/">[comments]</a></span>
