<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey all, I searched the subreddit briefly but didn&#39;t see anything super recent about this. I am working on degoogling my life, but I find the biggest hurdles I am facing are Maps and Home. I use my Home app to set routines and control all the lights in my home, my humidifier, alarms, I use the voice assistant in my kitchen constantly while I cook and also as a speaker when I entertain. I&#39;d like to still be able to centrally control all of these things and not use the individual branded apps, but also don&#39;t want to be forced to buy all new extension cords and lights y&#39;know? What do you find is the best way to degoogle your smart home? I see many folks agree that Maps is sort of irreplaceable right now and I am wondering if the same goes for Google Home. I&#39;m ready to ditch my Nests tho!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/idggysbhfdkdge"> /u/idggysbhfdkdge </a> <br/> <span><a href="

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello everyone! I&#39;ve created an alternative to Google My Maps called <a href="https://tasmap.app">Tasmap</a>. The core concept is simple:</p> <ol> <li>You have a map editor (like Mapbox Studio)</li> <li>You have a text editor (like Medium)</li> <li>Combine them together, and that&#39;s it!</li> </ol> <p>Regarding privacy:</p> <ol> <li>Map data comes from OSM. There are absolutely no ads or commercial promotions, and creators have complete control to customize their maps.</li> <li>We don&#39;t collect user privacy data. We have basic Analytics, but we don&#39;t collect personal information like GPS data.</li> </ol> <p>Some features:</p> <ol> <li>Built-in default map designs, and you can design your own maps. If you&#39;re not good at design, AI can help design it for you.</li> <li>AI can automatically analyze locations mentioned in text and pin them on the map.</li> <li>Each map can have customized icons and can be installed like an app. It&#39;s

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So, I&#39;m in the process of removing Google and Microsoft. </p> <p>I&#39;ve just noticed my files manager was from Google, so I downloaded Material Files instead. </p> <p>I was also using Google Photos whenever I wanted to crop an image and mark up on my phone, so I downloaded Simple Gallery Pro instead.</p> <p>I also noticed that I&#39;ve synced all my contacts through my Google account. I have no solutions for this because I now use Proton which doesn&#39;t sync contacts. Should I keep the status quo or should I keep my contacts saved locally in my phone only and make a backup on my Proton Drive? (I don&#39;t update my contacts often)</p> <p>I&#39;ve also noticed advices to use F-Droid instead of Google Play Store but I feel like I&#39;m not good enough with that level of tech. I downloaded the file and my phone told me it was unsafe and for an older version of Android, and I was unsure what do to about it, so I just cancelled it and for the mome
