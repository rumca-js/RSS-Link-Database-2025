<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this question about authenticators related topics but here it goes.</p> <p>Have you noticed how authenticators have become essential for secure logins these days? It seems like almost every account, whether it&#39;s work-related or personal, now requires some form of authentication.</p> <p>We used to rely on five or six-digit codes sent via text messages or emails. But now, authenticators have taken over as the primary method for securing logins.</p> <p>It makes me wonder, what could be the next stage of security logins after authenticators? Do you think we&#39;ll see some new form of login security once authenticators become obsolete or less secure as technology continues to advance in the next five to ten years?</p> <p>Considering the rapid pace of technological advancements, it&#39;s quite possible we might see innovative security measures that go beyond what we currently use.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --

The laptop, tablet, phone distinction just seems arbitrary to me. It would seem to me that if there is a risk, continuing to allow OWA would just continue the risk.
