<p>Sometimes a branch grows so low and bushy that it blocks access to my room. I diligently cut it back</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/summer-essentials">More summer essentials</a></li></ul><p>In the late 1970s when my parents built the house I still live in, there was no forest. The property was a disused cow pasture, full of scrappy grass and weeds. My parents began planting trees before they began the house build, and now – in my lifespan, 47 years – it has grown into a forest. When I was a child, we called my parent’s plantings “the garden”, implying a place managed by us. Cultivated, civilised. Somewhere along the way we renamed it “the forest”. A self-managed ecosystem we occasionally impinged upon – cutting back, cleaning up debris – but only when it made incursions into our actual house.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/21/sign-up-for-five-great-reads-guardian-australias-wrap-of-our-best-summer-stories"

## Mbappé fires equaliser as Real and Atlético share spoils in Madrid derby

<p>The match that was billed as a battle of the superheroes ended without a winner, all set up for a sequel instead. Kylian Mbappé and Julián Álvarez had looked out from Madrid’s front pages on the morning of the city derby, the media turning Marvel Comic, and they will probably be there on Sunday too but this isn’t over. The man they liken to a Mutant Turtle and the striker they call The Spider scored one each as another derby finished 1-1, leaving these two great rivals first and second in La Liga, a single point between them, left to fight another day.</p><p>Between them Mbappé and Álvarez had already scored 37 goals in their debut seasons; on a night that took a while to get going but did eventually become a real contest if certainly not a classic, they took that to 39. Atlético started in the ascendency then Real were revived.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/08/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-la-liga-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arriving with no pre-season, the Italian appeared ‘left behind’, but could now be unleashed for the gruelling run-in</p><p>Andy Robertson remembers vomiting the first time he ever did the lactate test. He was 23 years old, had just arrived from Hull and considered himself in pretty good shape. Until, that is, he was made to run Jürgen Klopp’s sadistic pre-season gauntlet for the first time.</p><p>Basically, you do laps of the training pitch. The required pace gradually quickens, in the manner of a bleep test. Unlike in a bleep test, however, at regular intervals a member of Klopp’s medical staff will come over, puncture your ear and – ew – extract a sample of blood from it. High lactate levels indicate fatigue; too high and you’re done. Pretty soon Robertson was feeling queasy. He started gagging. Full discharge followed soon after. It may not surprise you to know that James Milner won the Melwood lactate test eight years running.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/

<p>Shootouts are the least bad way the game has found to settle drawn matches, but they should be a last resort</p><p>So Uefa is considering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/05/uefa-weighs-up-scrapping-extra-time-for-champions-league-knockout-rounds">doing away with extra time</a>, at least in the knockout stage of the Champions League, another grand old tradition swept away as the arc of history bends towards the generation of revenue for the already wealthy.

<p>A wet evening, a slick pitch and two committed teams and suddenly the FA Cup doesn’t seem in quite such a troubled state. This was a remarkable tie, played at remarkable pace, stuffed with incident and endeavour, and illuminated by a stunning goal from Tomoki Iwata. The Japan international’s strike was not enough to prevent Newcastle reaching the fifth round, but it was the highlight of a performance from which Birmingham will draw not merely a lot of pride but also encouragement that they will be able to cope at the higher level if they go up to the Championship.</p><p>The weather was ideal for the fourth round of the Cup, a thick veil of drizzle casting everything in an appropriately nostalgic soft focus. Although promotion is clearly the priority for Birmingham, this was a game that mattered, something clear from the dozen or so lads in Burberry caps and scarves outside New Street station chanting unconvincingly about much how they hate Geordies to the pre-match light show feat

<p>Whether it’s infertility, to save a career or pure altruism, is there ever a reason that can morally justify surrogacy? </p><p>An online row last week underlines something we all know but which many prefer to ignore. There is something not right about surrogacy. The furore started with an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFgdk4hOU10/?igsh=QkFJYmQ4NmhRUQ%3D%3D">Instagram post by Lily Collins</a>: a picture of her new daughter, Tove, in a little basket, under which the <em>Emily in Paris</em> actor expressed “endless gratitude for our incredible surrogate”. Reaction split along predictable lines – those in favour of surrogacy, and those against.</p><p>What was striking was that it also split along another fissure: Collins’s possible motives. It was OK, some felt, to use a surrogate if you have infertility problems. But not in order to keep your figure, help your career, or because pregnancy is taxing and you are rich enough to outsource it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.c

<p>The Park End was awash before kick-off with banners commemorating Everton’s five FA Cup triumphs, each one part of the competition’s 132-year history at Goodison Park. History is where Goodison and the FA Cup will remain. Bournemouth ensured there will never be another cup tie at the grand old stadium as Andoni Iraola’s team defeated Everton for the third time this season.</p><p>Two James Tarkowski errors contributed to the two Bournemouth goals, a penalty from the impressive Antoine Sememyo plus a bundled effort from Daniel Jebbison leaving David Moyes’ side with the proverbial mountain to climb by half-time. Everton did their best to stage a second half recovery only to strike the post three times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/08/everton-bournemouth-fa-cup-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On 10 January, as fires raged across Los Angeles, local portrait artist Asher Bingham made an offer via an Instagram reel: “ To anyone that has lost a home in the #LAfires I will draw [it] for free.” She had already drawn the house of a close friend that had burned down; by offering her services more widely, she hoped to help others grieve for what they’d lost. She wasn’t prepared for the response. So many people sent in photos – 1,300 and counting – that she had to recruit volunteers to keep up with demand. For Bingham, it’s all about the small details: wind chimes, potted plants. “Anywhere I can see people put love into their home, I draw it,” she says. “I’m trying to recreate a memory that only lives in their minds of the beautiful time they lived there.”</p><ul><li>See more on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/asherbingham.fineart/">instagram.com/asherbingham.fineart</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/feb/08/where-the-heart-is-the-art

Six older fathers share the unexpected joys and pitfalls</p><p>The first time Gary Jenkins became a father, in 1995, his priorities changed in an instant. “I was a sales director, on the crest of a wave,” he says. “Becoming a father seemed to complement the full set: the car, the house, the job, the good life.” Holding his new daughter, however, he realised that he had never truly loved anything until that moment. “Suddenly, here I was, plunged into something beyond words, beyond my comprehension.”</p><p>When, 21 years later, his second child, a son, was born, everything about that first experience came back to him: the sleepless nights, the nappy technique, the feeling that he had a new vantage point on “the circle of life”.

<p>The US president’s real-estate fantasies rely on the erasure of Gaza’s people and culture. Now we must act to preserve them</p><p>It might already be too late to save the homes where many of the people of Gaza have been living and have memories of lives spent there. Or the recollections of people in Ramallah who spent their honeymoons in Gaza by the Mediterranean. Like many others, I too have strong and beautiful experiences of time spent in Gaza. Yet, at this time of almost unimaginable destruction of homes and lives, I turn my mind to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/04/everything-beautiful-has-been-destroyed-palestinians-mourn-a-city-in-tatters">destruction of cultural heritage</a> such as the Great Omari mosque, opened in the seventh century and also known as the Great Mosque of Gaza, whose minaret was partially destroyed and parts of its structure severely damaged.

<p>Pickling is a good way to lengthen the life of your eggs, and a chance to use up herbs and spices, too</p><p>At <a href="https://www.yeovalley.co.uk/">Yeo Valley</a>’s Good Food and Eating Well conference last year, Christine Storry of the <a href="https://www.dynamicfood.org/">Dynamic Food Board</a>, a UK body that promotes sustainable, local food procurement, estimated that “more than 700 million eggs are wasted in the UK each year”; that’s roughly 45,000 tonnes, or almost equivalent to the weight of the Titanic. She also noted that only 22% of us know how to test if an egg is fresh and safe to eat.</p><p>To keep them at their best, store eggs in a cool place at a stable temperature below 20C, because fluctuating heat and direct sunlight can affect their quality. To test a raw egg’s freshness, put it in a bowl of water: if it sinks and lies flat, it’s fresh; if it stands upright, it’s safe but needs eating soon; and if it floats, it’s past its best, so feed it to the compost mon

<p>I owned and loved my architect’s drawing board for 30 years – until my wife paid someone to take it away without my knowledge. A monstrous betrayal</p><p>It is Saturday, and my wife wants me to walk the dog before we go to the dump, which strikes me as a lot. I&nbsp;would prefer to combine the dog walk and dump trip into a&nbsp;single excursion. I make a fuss about this, and prevail.</p><p>The purpose of the dump visit – by appointment only – is to get rid of an old wooden desk that has been rotting under a tarpaulin in the garden for&nbsp;two&nbsp;years. Looking at its mouldy green surface, I am reminded of the architect’s drawing board that I owned and loved for 30 years, the drawing board that was also exiled out here for&nbsp;a time after we moved, until my&nbsp;wife finally paid someone to take it&nbsp;away without my knowledge – a&nbsp;monstrous betrayal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/feb/05/tim-dowling-a-trip-to-the-dump-brings-up-painful-memori
