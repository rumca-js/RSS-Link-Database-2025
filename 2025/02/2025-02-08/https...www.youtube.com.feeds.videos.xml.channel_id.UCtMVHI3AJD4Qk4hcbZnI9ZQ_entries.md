Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at how Playstation network is down, this wouldn't be a thing I'd discuss on it's own typically but as someone who's covered physical media and game preservation this is important for people to learn from. With such a heavy reliance on the Internet with modern game consoles it's moments like this that should wake people up and request more disentanglement from companies like Sony and Microsoft. Thanks for watching!
