<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Passman is a <strong>stateless, offline-first password manager</strong> that eliminates the risks of traditional vault-based solutions like LastPass, Bitwarden, and 1Password. Instead of storing passwords in a vault, Passman <strong>mathematically regenerates them on demand</strong>, making it impossible to steal what isn’t stored.</p> <p>This is a <strong>proof-of-concept release</strong>, and <strong>minimal testing has been completed</strong>. The goal is to challenge conventional password management by proving that a <strong>zero-storage model</strong> can work. Looking for security researchers, developers, and privacy advocates to test, break, and improve it.</p> <h1>How Passman Works</h1> <ol> <li>You enter your <strong>master password</strong> and a <strong>website/app name</strong>.</li> <li>Passman <strong>mathematically derives</strong> a password from these inputs.</li> <li>The password is <strong>copied to your clipboard</strong> for imme
