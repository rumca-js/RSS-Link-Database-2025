I&#39;m currently using Spotify on my phone, laptop and desktop and I&#39;ve got librespot running on my NAS, offering a relatively smooth experience. I can play music from any of my device to any other output, especially my NAS.</p> <p>I want to move away from Spotify (the experience has been becoming increasingly worse).</p> <p>I don&#39;t actively want to download/curate a whole music collection, but if the download process can be automatic and somewhat seamless, I&#39;m okay with that. An important thing is that I (+ partner + friends) should be able to stream music to my NAS when they&#39;re at my place.</p> <p>Do you have any suggestion?

I&#39;ve been starting to upskill on k8s, and I finally got a little Talos cluster runnign in my basement across 10 VMs on 5 Lenovo Thinkcentre Tiny machines running Proxmox. I got a couple of little stateless applications running, and I&#39;m feeling at least comfortable enough to get around and parse logs and troubleshoot, but I&#39;m really stuck on storage. I have a storage server with a 10g fiber link to my network switch, and it has 6x 12TB HDDs (ubuntu server, zfs storage). I originally had my Proxmox VM disks stored on it and used NFS, but it was constantly getting hung up and breaking the VMs, so I now have the VM disks local to their hosts. I&#39;m worried that trying to run applications in this cluster is going to be problematic when they&#39;re interacting with data (both objects/files and databases) on the server. Before I go down the rabbit hole of trying to do it, I figured I&#39;d ask here and see how other people handle storag",

Caddy is also hosting a little web server (HTTPS) that serves up a web page where I can click on which web UI I want to log into.<br/> *I&#39;ve been unable to figure out how to put my internet facing domain behind a login. My subdomains point right to the web UI login.<br/> *My apps are a mix of docker images and CLI installs. Maybe there&#39;s a better way of keeping track of many apps?<br/> *I do intend to share access with just a few people and I have Wireguard setup for my devices on the OpenWRT router for LAN stuff.</p> <p>I&#39;m very new to network ",
