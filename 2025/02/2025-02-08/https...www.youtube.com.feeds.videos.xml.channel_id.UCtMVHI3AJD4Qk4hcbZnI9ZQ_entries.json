        "description": "Hello guys and gals, it's me Mutahar again! This time we take a look at how Playstation network is down, this wouldn't be a thing I'd discuss on it's own typically but as someone who's covered physical media and game preservation this is important for people to learn from. With such a heavy reliance on the Internet with modern game consoles it's moments like this that should wake people up and request more disentanglement from companies like Sony and Microsoft.
