## Modifying windows registry for no cd?

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi, </p> <p>I bought a game from my childhood on gamersgate for 5 bucks. The game came as ISO. I mounted the ISO, installed the game, replaced some folders to change languages and I was able to start the game sucessfully. <strong>Also after dismounting the ISO</strong>. Then I just wanted to copy the game folder to another PC, but here it asks me for the CD, if I try to start the game. So I guess, there must be a no cd key, that has been added to the windows registry during the installation process. Now I try to find out, what windows registry is the right one. I used a tool named registrychangesview to compare the windows registry before and after the installation, but there are like 100 entries that has been added, changed or removed. Has anyone experience on this field and can tell me how to find out which is the right entry?</p> <p>Cheers</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/charlie12_"> /u/charli

Unarc.dll returned an error code: -11 ERROR: archive data corrupted (decompression fails) </code></pre> <p>I tried standard troubleshooting (rehashing, disabling Windows Defender, limiting RAM) and other recommendations, but nothing worked. Manual DLLs didn&#39;t work either (got a little desperate lol).</p> <p>The solution was installing the game onto my internal SSD from a repack saved internally (I had been using an external drive). After installation, I moved the game to the external drive.</p> <p>In general, just revert any recent changes made around the time it started. This might not work for most people who get the error, but it was worth sharing anyway.</p> <p>Hope this helps.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/magawkgawks"> /u/magawkgawks </a> <
