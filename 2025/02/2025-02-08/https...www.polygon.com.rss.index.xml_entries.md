<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Friday evening, Sony’s PlayStation Network has been down. At fifteen hours and counting, PSN is experiencing one of the longest unscheduled outages of a major video game network. The outage is wide-reaching, including PSN’s account management, social features, the PlayStation Store, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet information on the cause (let alone the fix) remains vague. Fifteen hours ago, the official AskPlaystation X account messaged, “We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN. For more details: <a href="https://status.playstation.com">https://status.playstation.com</a>.” The account hasn’t posted a message since then.

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Star Trek fans celebrate a lot of holidays. There’s Star Trek Day on Sept. 8, the anniversary of the premiere of <em>Star Trek: The Original Series</em>. There’s First Contact Day on April 5, the anniversary of the fictional date on which humanity made first contact with Vulcan visitors. One might even celebrate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiKwAS1qaCk">Captain Picard Day</a> on June 16, the Gregorian calendar date that corresponds with a yearly tribute put on by schoolchildren living on the Enterprise-D.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none"><em>Helldivers 2</em> has reached its first anniversary, marking what’s been a wild year for Arrowhead Game Studios. The co-op action shooter took off as soon as it was released on Feb. 8, 2024, enjoying an explosive launch with hundreds of thousands more players than Arrowhead expected. I’ve been logging in consistently throughout the first year, joining the Helldivers on the front lines of the evolving Galactic War.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That initial momentum has hit a few obstacles throughout the year, but after some careful balance patches and narrative events, I’m optimistic about the future of <em>Helld

<p class="has-text-align-none">We may still be in the midst of winter, but that hasn’t stopped Netflix from throwing a few great thrillers onto its streaming service. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every month, we handpick a few of the best thrillers on Netflix that fit the current season. Sometimes they pair well with an upcoming release. Other titles might be new additions to the platform.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This month, we’ve got a foodie-murder hit that seems to be growing into a modern classic, a high-finance romantic drama, and one of the biggest Indian movies ever made.</p>
