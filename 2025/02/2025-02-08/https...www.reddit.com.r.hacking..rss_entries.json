And it saves result as a binary file. I thought I could edit the binary file, since it is clear in that file where code is. But if I make changes that way, the audio program won&#39;t load the file. When I make same change directly in the audio program then look in HEX editor, I see that the audio file is setting first 4 bytes to file size. That I figured out and can take into account. But I also see end of the files change. So at the point right where the javascript ends, there are 46 bytes. If I had less code, that goes down to 45 bytes at end. But for a given file that has 45 bytes at end, changes in the file as made in the audio program show very slight changes in those ending 45 bytes. </p> <p>For instance, before edit to script, I see this</p> <pre><code>08 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00",
