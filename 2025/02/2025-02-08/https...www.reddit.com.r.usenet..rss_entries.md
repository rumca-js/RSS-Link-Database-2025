<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious. Has anyone received a TOS warning for requesting a file on Usenet?</p> <p>For example, if I was looking for a long out of print book and posted a request on one of the e-book newsgroups that is frequented by a few uploaders, is there any chance I could receive a TOS warning for simply requesting an old book? Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rockphantom"> /u/rockphantom </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ikprhv/has_anyone_ever_received_a_tos_warning_for/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/comments/1ikprhv/has_anyone_ever_received_a_tos_warning_for/">[comments]</a></span>
