"Elevator Operator" by Electric Callboy was released on 24 January, so I know I'm late to this. I blame Transport For London and door trouble at a stately home. It's also late posting on YouTube - copyright restrictions were brutal on this one, so to watch the whole video, visit here first: https://youtu.be/BiP0FpY88E4?si=XpOi_wqt_dHAF3Uu

The new Darkness album comes out next month,  you can pre-order 'Dreams On Toast' on CD, vinyl or cassette here: https://thedarkness.lnk.to/dreamsontoast/

The Darkness are also going on tour across the UK in March, tickets are on sale here: https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/
