I forgot just how good Crank and Glass (less so Fallout) are, I finished them both in the space of three days, I just couldn&#39;t put them down. </p> <p>As I said, I&#39;ve read her other books, I&#39;m looking for something new but similar. I&#39;m hoping for teenage/young adult angst mixed in with real world, gritty, difficult subjects. Doesn&#39;t have to be addiction necessarily, but I am fascinated by stories from the perspective of someone in the depths of substance abuse. </p> <p>Thanks in advance :) </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/queenloora"> /u/queenloora </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ikrze8/books_like_the_crank_trilogy_by_ellen_hopkins/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/booksuggestions/comments/1ikrze8/books_like

Sure I&#39;ve read some (like 20) books from then on but lately, whenever I try to open my kindle or pick up a random book from my shelf (I have so many unreads at home) I read for max 5 minutes, lose concentration, start thinking of something else, then I switch back to reading and I find myself reading the same thing again and again because I can&#39;t focus enough to grasp it. My attention span has worsened because of instagram reels and YouTube, reddit, etc. I really need to start somewhere but I can&#39;t seem to enjoy reading like I used to. It makes me feel bad too because I think I&#39;m so dumb/hyper that I can&#39;t even read properly.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t know, YA books are books written with a target audience of 12-18 year olds, but are enjoyed by people of many different ages. The reason I typically lean towards these books (especially when looking for fiction) is because they have all the aspects of fantasy, are relatable, and don&#39;t have any spice. There is nothing wrong with spicy books, I just feel really uncomfortable reading them. Part of that is probably because I&#39;m asexual, but I know plenty of aces who read spicy books, I&#39;m just not into that. I love YA books, but the problem I often find with them is that there is little to no queer representation. One of my most favorite series of books is all of the ones in the Percy Jackson universe. There is queer rep, it&#39;s relatable, fantastical, and fast-paced. All good things. But I have not found another book like it. Harry Potter was great...for a while..iykyk.

I recently enjoyed henry FORDs autobiography and LOVED john d ROCKEFELLERs 38 letters to his son. Both books were full of valuable quotes and stories that showed insight on their mindsets that allowed them to achieve success. Quite directly as well! It feels as if he is speaking to the reader and not his son. I am interested in other robber barons as well. Economics have changed a lot since then. If anyone has read these please share your fav parts! </p> <p>Currently Chick YEAGERs biography is a very fun and educational read. </p> <p>Whats your fav?
