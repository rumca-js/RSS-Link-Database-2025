I added this parameter to take a look at the Proton log and, to my surprise, the game launched with no issue. I thought I was crazy so I took it out and sure enough the game wouldn&#39;t launch again. I&#39;ve tried this on several different games at this point and this happens with every single game that&#39;s using Proton no matter the version.

As is the way with Wayland, when I am playing a non-steam game, my OS asks to share the remote with the OS and allow the controller. When I do this, the right stick moves the mouse and the buttons interact with the desktop, which is neat.</p> <p>However, this behavior needs to end when I have RCPS3 open. I want to control my character, but the mouse can roam onto another monitor and interact. I have the setting for locking the mouse turned on in RPCS3 too, but it truly does not care. How can I either turn this feature off or get the mouse to remain in the confines of the game?</p> <p>I even tried launching the games through steam to see if steam would take ownership over the controller, but sadly, no dice.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MoonstarReddit"> /u/MoonstarReddit </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_
