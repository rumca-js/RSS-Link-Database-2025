Probably not the best one, but I couldn&#39;t find anything with a similar theme. But that basically escalated to an argument that fantasy has little to no value, I have to choose something specifically from our country, based on true facts (that is not required. Our teacher reiterated many times, it doesn&#39;t matter what we choose, what matters is that we analyse it coherently, but as much as I explain that to them, they stick to their guns).

I&#39;m looking for the name of a book that I read a few years ago and can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called, and i really want to read it again.</p> <p>It&#39;s about a girl who doesn&#39;t have an animal skin like everyone else does, and that&#39;s why she&#39;s not seen as human or something like that. And there&#39;s something about the druids or the Celts having problems with the Romans and there&#39;s a conflict. Our main character ends up being the chosen one of the mothers, who are some gods of the land I think. I think the book cover is blue with a golden fish on the front. It&#39;s been a while, so I can&#39;t remember all the details, but I&#39;m hoping that maybe someone knows what the book&#39;s called?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/pukfarron\"> /u/pukfarron </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ikvxs3/looking_for_the_name_of_a_book/\">[l",

I\u2019ve enjoyed the world building quite a bit and the magic system seems interesting so far, but I can\u2019t stand Rin. From chapter 1 she\u2019s portrayed as a highly intelligent individual with fierce independence and a strong will, which is great. So why is she making such stupid decisions every chance she gets?

Also, caution of spoilers, as I detail my understanding of the world so I can explain my confusion: </p> <p>So, the book mostly seems to take place in the city of Psikamit. Psikamit was previously ruled by the Bhatuma, and during this time it was occupied and controlled by Vareslians. Then, sometime in the semi-recent but also not really recent path, a religious order known as New Favor liberated the city and - as far as I understand it - killed the Bhatuma, and now they&#39;re in control of the city. That&#39;s all fine, understand that no problem. My question is this: </p> <p>how do the Ephirits fit into this picture? I get that Karys&#39; patron, Sabaster, is a Ephirit, but are Ephirits part of the New Favour. Sometimes, it seems like they are one and the same, like at the sta",

I&#39;m a huge fan of LotR films, Harry Potter was my favorite book series growing up. Lately I&#39;ve been getting into Sanderson&#39;s work, currently on the Hero of Ages, after not reading much the past few years. I&#39;m a writer, mostly film scripts in the drama genre. But I also wrote and self published my first novel back in 2019. It was something I still can&#39;t believe I did as it was the biggest creative project I&#39;ve ever finished. I&#39;m super proud of it, even if it&#39;s not the greatest, I&#39;m proud of myself for seeing it though. Now, after years not having much creative energy I&#39;m getting it back and have been writing some outlines for a few projects. One is a detective series I&#39;m slowly outlining, and the other is a newer idea for a larger fantasy setting, and now a novella/novel taking place in that setting.</p> <p>My question ",

The writing style has basically a dan brown level feel of just one more chapter while remaining fantasy as fuck with some absolutely great hopeful characters I needed right now.
