<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey everyone,</p> <p>I’ve been learning web development, but I feel stuck in a cycle—watching tutorials, building small projects, fixing bugs, and repeating the same things daily. It feels like I’m not making real progress.</p> <p>I think I’m too comfortable with what I know and struggle to push myself into bigger challenges. Has anyone else felt this way? How did you break out of the loop and level up?</p> <p>Would love any advice! Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MiddleRough8127"> /u/MiddleRough8127 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1ikr38s/stuck_in_a_loop_learning_web_devneed_advice/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1ikr38s/stuck_in_a_loop_learning_web_devneed_advice/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I have spent time on OAuth and first used allauth, then switched to drf-social. I managed to get OAuth working on the frontend but not on the backend. In my backend, I have created an application, and the frontend is supposed to use the convert-access-token API to exchange the token and create a user in my backend’s application.</p> <p>I can’t make it work. The backend returns “invalid_client.”</p> <p>I have the client secret and client ID and have double-checked them with the API. I have changed the user model three times and erased the database three times, but it’s still not working. I also applied logging, but nothing useful showed up.</p> <p>I really need to move forward, but this is so frustrating. I have no idea what to do now.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AgreeableIron811"> /u/AgreeableIron811 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/django/comments/1iki4om/i_can_not_make_oau
