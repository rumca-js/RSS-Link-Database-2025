## Synduality Echo of Ada Review

Synduality Echo of Ada reviewed on PC by Will Borger. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
Synduality Echo of Ada is a tense extraction shooter with a cool sci-fi premise. Its mech-based action plays well, but the early grind is an absolute slog and upgrades are always slow to unlock, even if youâ€™re not dying much. My drive to play even started to die after a while because I was forced to do the same things on repeat. But I powered through that part and Iâ€™m ultimately glad I did, because what comes after that slow opening is great. Thereâ€™s nothing quite like smoking some poor sucker who picks a fight with you in single combat. Oh, and if youâ€™re rolling with stuff you really like, please buy insurance. Itâ€™s a scam, but it may save your life â€“ or at least your mech. And in the world of Synduality, thatâ€™s really all you have.
