Every day we hit them with three things. They’ll bite on one, and we’ll get all of our stuff done. Bang, bang, bang.”</p><p>Since his re-election, Donald Trump has been following this script to the letter, and the media, not to mention the entire world, are feeling punch-drunk.

<p>Tim Fehlbaum’s taut thriller deploys hand-held cameras and actual footage to gripping effect as it relives a caught-off-guard TV crew’s coverage of a hostage crisis</p><p>It’s the news journalist’s dream: to have the scoop and a front-row seat at one of the biggest stories of the decade. But the events of 5 September 1972 – the Black September terrorist attack and hostage crisis at the Munich Olympics – were not a story that the men and women covering the Games for the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) expected to be telling. Nor was it, arguably, one that they were fully equipped to tackle. Tim Fehlbaum’s gripping real-life newsroom thriller deftly cuts between the nervy dramatised events behind the scenes and actual archive footage from ABC’s coverage of the tense standoff that saw two members of the Israeli team murdered and a further nine held at gunpoint in the Olympic village.</p><p>This lean media procedural, which is so tautly directed that you can practically feel the p

As&nbsp;freelance digital creatives, their&nbsp;Neukölln flat is affordable, their windowsills are plant-lined, their armchairs are Danish mahogany.

Theirs is a life defined through a keen outward projection of taste. Ove
