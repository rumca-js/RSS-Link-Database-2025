<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>PDF is what gets printed on paper, and often the most common way of sharing documents online. PDFs have a fixed width height/width, which makes them difficult to read on a small screen.</p> <p>EPUB is what e-readers like kindle or kobo work with, often using a derived format like mobi/azw that are still similar to epub. EPUBs are fluid, the text &quot;flows&quot; to fill the current page, so they are readable on all screen sizes. Heck I read the harry potter series on my dad&#39;s old nokia phone with a 2.4&quot; screen.</p> <p>Even before ai, there have been many local/online tools that try to convert pdf books to epub. But they almost always get the formatting wrong. I was wondering if things have gotten any better. I am not lookin for any ocr, the pdfs are well formatted. Are there any ai (or even non-ai) tools that can convert a pdf to epub without mistakes?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ia

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>A new approach to multi-modal language models that uses progressive alignment to handle different input types (text, images, audio, video) more efficiently. The key innovation is breaking down cross-modal learning into stages rather than trying to align everything simultaneously.</p> <p>Main technical points: - <strong>Progressive alignment</strong> occurs in three phases: individual modality processing, pairwise alignment, and global alignment - Uses specialized encoders for each modality with a shared transformer backbone - Employs contrastive learning for cross-modal association - Introduces a novel attention mechanism optimized for multi-modal fusion - Training dataset combines multiple existing multi-modal datasets</p> <p>Results: - Matches or exceeds SOTA on standard multi-modal benchmarks - 70% reduction in compute requirements vs comparable models - Strong zero-shot performance across modalities - Improved cross-modal retrieval metrics</p> <p
