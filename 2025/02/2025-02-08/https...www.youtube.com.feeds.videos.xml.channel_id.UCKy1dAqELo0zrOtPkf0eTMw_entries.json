        "description": "Synduality Echo of Ada reviewed on PC by Will Borger. Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nSynduality Echo of Ada is a tense extraction shooter with a cool sci-fi premise. Its mech-based action plays well, but the early grind is an absolute slog and upgrades are always slow to unlock, even if you\u2019re not dying much. My drive to play even started to die after a while because I was forced to do the same things on repeat. But I powered through that part and I\u2019m ultimately glad I did, because what comes after that slow opening is great. There\u2019s nothing quite like smoking some poor sucker who picks a fight with you in single combat. Oh, and if you\u2019re rolling with stuff you really like, please buy insurance. It\u2019s a scam, but it may save your life \u2013 or at least your mech. And in the world of Synduality, that\u2019s really all you have.",
