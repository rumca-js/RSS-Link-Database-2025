Today, during the Civ World Summit livestream on the official Firaxis Games Twitch channel, the studios announced they will be bringing Sid Meier's Civilization VII--the latest installment in the strategy franchise--to virtual and mixed reality for the first time ever in Civilization VII VR for the Meta Quest 3 and 3S.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">This new take on Civilization will position players above the playing area, which will be contained within a massive circular surface called the Command Table. Civ VII VR will support both single-player and online multiplayer modes, though online players will be limited to opponents also using a Meta Quest 3 or 3S.</p><figure data-align=\"center\" data-size=\"large\" data-img-src=\"https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4440558-civ-vii-1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4440558\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2048\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"wi",

Eagles QB Jalen Hurts was named Super Bowl LIX MVP.</li><li><b>Early Game Dynamics:</b> The Eagles started strong with Saquon Barkley using his exceptional juking abilities to score the first touchdown. The Chiefs responded with a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Travis Kelce, but an interception by CJ Gardner-Johnson help",
