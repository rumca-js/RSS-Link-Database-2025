<img src="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/untitled-design-42.png?width=1920&height=1920&fit=bounds&quality=80&format=jpg&auto=webp" /> <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grid-legends">Grid Legends</a> is a great-looking racing game. While it doesn't have the wide open scope of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a>, or the detailed on-track ray tracing of Gran Turismo, it does have excellent lighting and beautiful stages. That's true across all the platforms, but the recent release on Android and iOS is intriguing. We've experienced mixed fortunes for triple-A titles released on mobile, but having played the game extensively on iPhone 15 Pro, I'm impressed. In fact, it's one of the only triple-A iOS ports I can actually recommend.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-grid-legends-on-ios-is-proof-that-console-games-can-transition-well-to-mobile">Read more</a></p>

It's been over 14 years since developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>' fondly remembered alternate history shooter series drew to a close with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resistance-3">Resistance 3</a>, but it turns out fans might have seen a fourth mainline entry if the studio had got its way. Outgoing Insomniac boss has revealed the studio pitched a "wonderful concept" for Resistance 4 - but Sony ultimately said no.
