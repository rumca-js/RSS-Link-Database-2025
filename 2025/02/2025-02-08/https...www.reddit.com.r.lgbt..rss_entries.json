Sure it gets busy, but it&#39;s not your typical bar where you have to almost yell to hear the person next to you. I started going to it for that reason; because it&#39;s quiet (and also for when I just didn&#39;t feel like being at home). Each time I&#39;ve gone, the staff have been super nice to me and I just like the vibe of the place. I don&#39;t bother anyone and just mind my own business (I also don&#39;t have any friends, so no risk of brining in a problematic compatriot to ruin the vibe of the place). But at the same time, I sometimes feel like it&#39;s &quot;not my place&quot; to be there. That, since I don&#39;t fall under the LGBT umbrella, I&#39;m not really welcome and that, if the bartender or someone else found out I wasn&#39;t gay, they might look at me different",

(Outside of black) And I want to give my dog a bright sparkly pink collar. But my grandparents are making it a big deal on how it &quot;isn&#39;t masculine,&quot; and that people might mistake my dog for a girl. I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s a big deal. It&#39;s literally a fucking collar, and they have to act so sensitive about it. And they call people who support the lgbtq community sensitive, but their throwing a literal temper tantrum at the idea of my dog wearing a pink sparkly collar.</p> <p>Like I can&#39;t even joke about this shit.
