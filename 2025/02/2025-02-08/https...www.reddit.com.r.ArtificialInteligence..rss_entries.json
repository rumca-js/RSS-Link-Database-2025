It is the most important point. Once model is trained it does not evolve. It can not learn on it&#39;s own.</p> <p>Argument 3: LLMs are not self-aware and therefore lack any critical thinking. LLM does not have any introspection (consequence of argument 1 and 2).</p> <p>Argument 4: (consequence of argument 3) it&#39;s the most overlooked one - all the seemingly human-like stuff done by &quot;ai&quot; are in fact pretty big software systems buit on top of LLMs. The whole wow-effect would be way smaller if regular people got a chance to interact with LLMs directly.</p> <p>Summary: undeniably modern LLMs are extremely cool technology.

The core idea is decomposing complex instructions into simpler components using a systematic framework called UltraIF.</p> <p>Key technical points: - Uses a decomposition-composition framework to break down instructions into atomic queries and constraints - Generates specific evaluation criteria for each constraint - Same model serves as both generator and evaluator, improving efficiency - Incorporates a feedback loop for iterative improvement - Works on both base models and already instruction-tuned models</p> <p>Results: - 8B parameter models achieved competitive performance with larger specialized instruction models - Showed improvements across 5 different evaluation benchmarks - Demonstrated effectiveness on LLaMA-3.1-8B model family - Required no benchmark training data - Improved performance even on previously instructio",
