<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Just been playing and enjoying the game but something I didn’t quite get is the ending. When all twelve formation cards have been played and for example a two player game is in progress and one of the « interns » and used up all his formation cards but the other player has 1 or 2 left. What happens ? Does the game end when someone has none left regardless or just keep going in case of 3 or more… </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Virtual-Weight688"> /u/Virtual-Weight688 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ikzuiu/abducktion_ending/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ikzuiu/abducktion_ending/">[comments]</a></span>

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I want to get a game for my boyfriend. He loves video games like the Witcher and Baldurs Gate 3. He also loves LOTR book series. We tried playing Gloomhaven: Jaws of Lion but we didn’t like the aesthetics and the game was to straight, dark and gritty without enough magic and whimsy. We mostly play board games like Wingspan, Verdant, Forest Shuffle and other nature themed games but it’s more because I love nature, plants and animals. He really loves Everdell and thinks it’s cute. I want to get him a game that will be totally his vibe. He really likes high fantasy aesthetics with lots of magic and whimsy.

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey <a href="/r/boardgames">r/boardgames</a>! My friend and I are developing a geopolitical strategy board game called World 2050, where 6 players compete for global dominance in a near-future setting. Think Risk meets Twilight Struggle, with elements of secret objectives and dynamic events. We&#39;re aiming for a 2-3 hour playtime with card drafting, action selection (public and secret), resource management, and a world map divided into strategic zones. We&#39;re looking for feedback on the core mechanics, theme, and overall appeal. Anyone interested in discussing geopolitical strategy games or offering suggestions for development? We&#39;d love to hear your thoughts!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FutureMillionaire343"> /u/FutureMillionaire343 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ikz5lq/nearfuture_geopolitical_board_game_what_themes/">[link]</a></span> &#32;

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I wanted to share a positive experience I had with Ion Games Design. A while back, I accidentally spilled water on some of my Stationfall cards, which damaged them. Since Stationfall relies on hidden identities, having marked cards would have been a real problem, and finding a replacement on my own would have been difficult.</p> <p>I reached out to Ion Games Design to ask if they could help, and they sent me replacement cards without any hassle or charges. They didn’t have to do this, especially when some bigger publishers don’t offer replacements at all, so I really appreciate their support.</p> <p>I already enjoyed their games, but this experience left an even better impression. I recently picked up Derrocar and have been enjoying it, and Sammu-Ramat is on my list to try next.</p> <p>Just wanted to put this out there, good customer service deserves recognition.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/f

## Gears of War: The Board Game - good yet somewhat forgotten dungeon crawler, with surprisingly modern mechanics for its age

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Cooperative dungeon crawler, one of the first of its kind. Old but not outdated even today. It has really cool mechanic &quot;your hitpoints = action cards in your hand&quot; (sounds much like Gloomhaven, however this game is 7 years older!). </p> <p>Which forces you to think over your turn, rather than simply rush forwards, and switch careful turns with action-packed heroic deeds. Not to mention that action cards give more variety and fun that just &quot;do 2 actions and chuck dice&quot;, like in so many other crawlers. </p> <p>Enemies (locusts) are controlled by AI with simple AI &quot;if... then&quot;. Nothing special but quick to manage. Combat uses custom dice, which may trigger weapon abilities, much like Descent. Player character can help each other with action cards, take cover, run forward together, which adds more shooter-like atmosphere.</p> <p>Overall a nice dynamic shooter, still pretty good despite its age, with some memorable scenarios

<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am trying to figure out if I want to purchase some expansions with Splendor, but first I need to know what are in those expansions. As far as I have figured it out, there are four extra modules to the game:<br/> Cities, Trading-Posts, Strongholds, and The Orient<br/> The Cities of Splendor expansion pack include all 4 of these, however there are two other packs: The Silk Road, and The Sun Never Sets. I think as far as I can tell that The Silk Road contains:<br/> Cities &amp; Trading-Posts<br/> And that The Sun Never Sets contains:<br/> Strongholds &amp; The Orient<br/> Am I correct or wrong in this? If I am wrong, what are the modules? Are there more than four then?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Infamous-Box381"> /u/Infamous-Box381 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1ikc5m8/different_splendor_expansions_and_what_modules/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a hr

Someone told me to buy the deluxe edition straight from Funtails, but I cannot seem to get their website to load. I’m not sure if they’re having a domain issue, or if the problem is on my end. </p> <p>Would someone be kind enough to see if they can get the Funtails website to load for them, and report back what their experience was?

This happens to make it that little bit easier to pack and take camping! No space is wasted in that box, that’s for sure!</p> <p>As usual I went heavy on the camera/photo meta, hogging the camera piece and taking photos as often as I can. Each photo is worth one point, so I figure they’re pretty efficient compared to paying to visit high-point Parks. My strategy d
